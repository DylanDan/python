Today's call is being recorded.", "For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Chris Conley.", "Chris Conley", "Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation third quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Vice Chairman, Mike Todman; President and Chief Operating Officer, Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our web site at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from those statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on slide one and in the appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to slide two, we want to remind you, that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think these adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation, beginning on slide 37, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you saw on our press release this morning, we reported record revenue, ongoing operating profit and earnings per share for the third quarter. Our integration activities in both Europe and Asia continue to progress well, and we expect to continue to deliver significant integration benefits during the fourth quarter. And during the quarter, our larger global operating platform, enable us to offset continued volatility in the global economic environment.", "If you'd now turn to slide 5, we will look at our third quarter results; you will see where we delivered strong revenue growth in the third quarter with the revenues up 9% versus last year, and up nearly 25% if you exclude the impact of currency. Ongoing business earnings were a record $3.45 a share and additionally our free cash flow improved compared to the prior year.", "On slide 6, you can see an update to our current year regional margin expectations versus last year. Here we expect substantial operating margin improvement and record performance in three out of our four regional businesses. Those three being North America, Europe and Asia. These regions are clearly on track for the year, and we are making meaningful progress towards our 2018 goals.", "In Latin America and in Brazil specifically, we have taken actions to address the current market challenges, and we expect to continue to adjust as appropriate, to deliver margin improvements in this very challenging environment during the fourth quarter.", "Turning to slide 7, we are outlining our current industry demand expectations for the full year. Based on recent demand trends, we are revising upward our North America business to a 5% growth. We are lowering our Latin America forecast to a minus 20% decline, and we are lowering Asia to a 2% decline, primarily coming from China.", "Turning to slide 8, we are affirming the lower range of our previous guidance, which reflects the current currency in emerging market demand levels. We now expect to deliver record ongoing earnings of $12 to $12.50 per share and free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million for the year.", "Globally, we continue to pursue opportunities for both growth and margin expansion. Including leveraging our newly introduced innovative products in many markets around the world, executing on ongoing cost productivity programs and delivering on our acquisition synergies.", "So in summary, we are making significant progress towards our long range goals this year, despite a very challenging global economic environment with negative impacts of currency in emerging market demand. But having said that, we do expect to deliver a record year of revenues and ongoing earnings and earnings per share, along with strong free cash flow in 2015.", "Before I move on to the regional sections, I would like to make a few comments on the leadership announcements we made earlier this week. On Wednesday, our Vice Chairman, Mike Todman has announced his planned retirement at the end of the year. We also announced that Marc Bitzer has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer for our company.", "First of all, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Mike for his more than 20 years of service to the company, serving in a wide variety of global leadership roles. Mike is leaving us with a strong legacy within our company as an enabler of our global expansion, and he has had a very positive impact on our entire global enterprise. Although Mike will be greatly missed, we all want to wish him the very best for he and his family in his retirement.", "At the same time, I am also very pleased to have Marc move in to his new role, and I am confident that under his leadership, we will have a very positive impact, as we continue to execute our long term strategy.", "So at this point, I am going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Let me begin on slide 10 by reviewing North America's performance in the third quarter. Overall, we are pleased that our third quarter performance, which included record ongoing operating margins of 12%. As you might recall, at the beginning of the year, we provided ongoing operating margin expectations of 10.5% to 11.5% for the year, and in this quarter, we have [indiscernible] deliver at the top end of that range.", "Very strong operating margins in the third quarter, but primarily driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and new product introductions, which more than offset nearly $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts. Our net sales of $2.8 billion for North America were unchanged compared to the prior year period and up nearly 3% excluding currency.", "While we are pleased with our margins, we are obviously not satisfied with our top line performance, which has been trailing the market for several quarters. Up until now, our priority has been on the expansion of operating margins and we are very pleased with the result of that execution. Our focus in the fourth quarter and beyond will be on delivering strong margins, while clearly accelerating plans to achieve our expected revenue growth targets.", "Turning to slide 11, we outline our actions taken to continue delivering strong results in the region. We believe the industry is in a middle of a multiyear growth cycle, which in combination, has historically strong seasonal demand in the fourth quarter, positions us for a record performance this year.", "As mentioned previously, we expect to accelerate our plan to leverage the increase in consumer demand for our new products, drive improved price mix and volume growth in the fourth quarter. And finally, we will continue to deploy strong cost productivity plans, as well as focus on growing outside the core.", "On slide 12, as an example of our product leadership, you can see our new multi-door Whirlpool branded refrigerator. This award winning product has nine storage zones and is designed to keep food organized to each family's preference.", "I will now share the third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, as shown on slide 14; sales were $1.5 billion compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year, driven by the acquisition and continued recovery in the Western European demand. Ongoing operating profit was a third quarter record of $71 million, with ongoing operating margins at 4.9% compared to $9 million and 1.2% in the third quarter of 2014.", "During the third quarter, strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity more than offset approximately $45 million in unfavorable currency impact, primarily from the Euro and Ruble, that delivered yet another quarter of significantly expanded operating margins.", "Slide 15, as we look toward the full year 2015, our priorities remain unchanged. There is a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products, both within and beyond the core.", "Slide 16, as an example of product leadership in region, you can see our new Whirlpool branded washing machine and dryer, with products combining Precision Cleaning, the Eco-Friendly Drying and have recently won the prestigious European iF design awards.", "And now, I would like to turn it over to Mike.", "Mike Todman", "Thanks Marc. Let me begin with our Latin America results on slide 18; as you may recall on our Q2 call, we expected demand to be down 15% and their AI to be between 3 and 3.25. During the quarter, the macro environment in Brazil further deteriorated with increased inflation, volatile currency and lower demand. As a result, sales for the quarter were $751 million, down 34% from the same prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased 7%.", "Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $31 million or 4.2% of sales, which represents operating margin consistent with our second quarter results. These results included a year-over-year unfavorable operating profit impact of nearly $40 million due to currency, and another $55 million due to reduced demand and lower production levels compared to prior year. These were partially offset by favorability from our previously announced cost based price increases and mix improvements from new product introductions.", "On slides 19 and 20, we want to put our Latin America business in context, by providing additional detail about Latin America and Brazil specifically. Brazil's currency is experiencing the most volatile period in the last 10 years. In the third quarter, compared to the prior year, the reais devalued 55% versus the U.S. dollar, which had an approximately $300 million negative impact on our regional net sales, and as I mentioned earlier, a $40 million negative impact on operating profit.", "Additionally, the deepening political crisis, increased inflation and falling global commodity prices has had a profound impact on Brazil's economy, and as a result, overall GDP is in the steepest decline since the global financial crisis.", "On slide 20, we put Brazil's performance further into the context of the region. It is important to note that our LAR international Extend and Expand businesses, as well as the global compressor business are delivering solid performance this year, and with the impact of this year's currency devaluation and demand reductions, Brazil now represents less than 10% of our global sales.", "To improve our performance in Brazil, we have fully deployed previously announced actions, and those actions have ally offset the impacts of currency and demand in the third quarter. We are prepared to take additional actions as necessary, targeting fixed cost reductions in the near future.", "While, we will be lower than our long term margin expectations for Latin America, we believe we have the right actions to address the operating environment and expect improved operating margin in the fourth quarter.", "On slide 21, we summarize our current priorities in Latin America. We are managing short term challenges through previously announced and executed cost base price increases. We have fully deployed previously announced actions to reduce fixed costs and have plans to deploy additional actions in the fourth quarter as necessary.", "Finally, its important to remember, that while we are experiencing some short term issues in Brazil, long term fundamentals that will facilitate future growth in the country are still intact. We continue to invest in new products and will be well positioned to capitalized on growth, when demand returns.", "Turning to slide 22, we are showcasing the new console refrigerator, that is designed with flexibility in mind. It offers adjustable shelving, and built-in containers that fit the needs of even the most demanding consumers.", "Now I will turn to our third quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on slide 24; net sales were $346 million, in comparison to $157 million in the prior year period, driven largely by the strength of our integration actions, we have delivered a record third quarter ongoing operating profit of $27 million. Ongoing operating margins were 7.7%, up significantly compared to the prior period, behind the benefits of those integration actions and record gross margins in India.", "Turning to slide 25, we will continue to focus on our integration activities in China, with a special emphasis on continued distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. As a result, we will expect strong margin performance, driven by our larger growth platform.", "Slide 26, we highlight our new Whirlpool refrigerator, that recently won the good design award for excellence in form and function. It offers food preservation with some of our most advanced moisture control and precision cooling technologies.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry.", "Larry Venturelli", "Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Let me start with our third quarter results on slides 28 and 29. As Jeff mentioned, we had record net sales and ongoing operating profit during the quarter. Our revenues were $5.3 billion compared to $4.8 billion during the same prior year period, an increase of over 9%.", "Currencies impacted our revenues by over $700 million, EBIT margins by two points, and net earnings by over $1 per share.", "As a result of the actions we took in the first half of the year, to mitigate currency and emerging market demand headwinds, we saw solid sequential improvement, in both our margins and earnings during the quarter. Our recent acquisitions have strengthened our global footprint, and provide greater diversification of our regional profit contribution. This combined with cost and capacity reductions, ongoing cost productivity and an active cost base pricing actions, enabled us to deliver all time record ongoing earnings of $3.45 per share, despite weaknesses in emerging markets.", "Allow me to make a few more detailed points on our financial results; we adjusted our third quarter ongoing earnings for $42 million, primarily to account for product warranty and liability expenses on heritage Indesit products. In addition, we adjusted our opening balance sheet for the Indesit acquisition, to reflect the warranty liability of approximately $275 million, with after-tax impact of about $220 million. We expect to substantially complete any actions related to these products by the end of 2017.", "SG&A as a percentage of sales on a GAAP basis increased slightly. This increase is due to higher brand investment, acquisition related costs and the deleveraging effect of weaker demand in Brazil. We do however expect SG&A margins to return to prior year levels, as we realized integration synergies to additional fixed reductions and higher volumes in the fourth quarter. Interest and sundry expense was better than a year ago, primarily due to higher acquisition and legal costs in the prior year.", "Finally, as shown on slide 29, and consistent with the range we previously provided, our effective tax rate year-to-date is now approximately 22%. This adjustment was made during the quarter.", "On slide 30, we are narrowing the range of our previous guidance to incorporate incremental currency and emerging market demand risk. We now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $12 to $12.50 per share. As Jeff mentioned, we are now forecasting approximately $600 million to $700 million in free cash flow, which includes $75 million to $100 million in working capital investments to support international product transitions.", "Turning to slide 31, let me make some additional comments regarding our ongoing EBIT margin; the solid sequential margin improvement delivered during the third quarter is expected to continue into the fourth quarter as we exit the year. We expect continued improvement in price mix, driven by the actions we have taken throughout the year and our new product launches, and we are firmly on track with our cost and productivity reduction initiatives, and expect continued improvement in ongoing productivity during the fourth quarter. In summary, we expect margins to improve sequentially and for the full year, despite currency and emerging market demand headwinds.", "On slide 32, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and integration activities in both Europe and Asia. We incurred $145 million in restructuring expense and realized $135 million in benefits year-to-date, which was consistent with our expectations. For the full year, we now expect $230 million in expense, and $200 million in benefits. It is important to note that the reduced expense forecast has had no impact on our synergy benefits that we expect.", "As we continue to grow revenues and improve margins, we have clear priorities to deploy the cash generated from our business as shown on slide 33. Given our profitable growth trends, increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we continue to balance funding from all aspects of our business, to ensure the best long term value creation for our shareholders.", "I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you, Larry. Let me add a few final comments about our view of the business and expectations for the year. This month, it has actually only been a year ago, where we closed on the acquisition of Hefei Sanyo in China and Indesit in Europe, what I believe are two historic acquisitions that is helping to transform our global footprint.", "Throughout this year and 2015, we have seen emerging market demand significantly decline and the U.S. dollar rapidly strengthen against most of the currencies where we have significant exposure to. Most notably, the Brazilian reai, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Russian ruble.", "Given the significant economic shocks this year, we believe that currencies have experienced a global reset, and we are prepared to operate this changed environment going forward.", "Let me try to put this reset in perspective for you; currency alone is expect to impact us by reducing our revenues by over $2.5 billion versus the last year, and have a negative $4 per share and earnings per share compared to last year. And the impact from declining emerging market demand will cost us additional $1.75 per share. In total, currency in emerging market demands fundamentally versus last year, has cost us $5.75. But because of our larger global platform and our rapid responses to market change, we have been able to absorb both of these impacts and are on track to deliver record revenues in earnings along with free cash flow this year.", "Putting a longer term perspective actually to turn to slide 36, where we outlined the actions which we introduced late last year, which we believe are key to deliver our long term growth value creation strategy, and they really, in our view, remain unchanged. And today, we continue to see multiple paths for profitable growth going forward, and today, we also have very high confidence, that our growth plan is giving us an outstanding opportunity to continue to deliver significant shareholder returns, as we continue to execute these long range plans. We will update all investors in detail on our 2016 expectations, as well as our progress towards our 2018 goals on our next earnings call in late January.", "That ends our formal remarks, and I'd like to open this up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we can take our first question from Denise Chai with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Denise Chai", "Okay. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations Marc and all the best to you Mike.", "Mike Todman", "Thank you, Denise.", "Denise Chai", "Thanks. So I know you have always been more focused on margins that on market share, and when we look at North America, you had such a tough comparison last year. But this quarter, the variance with AHAM was really outsized, and you also listed your industry guidance for the year. So what was behind the variance with AHAM and as you -- you said you are going to be shifting your focus a little bit more back to, I guess market share. Are you looking to maintain share or to regain lost share?", "Marc Bitzer", "Denise, it's Marc. So let me maybe expand a little bit. I will talk about margin, and our balance of margin versus revenues. Obviously, and I have stated that before, we are very pleased with the margins that we have achieved. 12% operating margins, that means we are pretty much now the twice the level of our key competitors, [indiscernible] profit, and I also would like to emphasize that 12% without any volume leverage. So it just gives you a good indication of how strong the underlying business is from a gross margin and the entire cost structure.", "As much as I am pleased with the margin progress, we would be lying if we say we are satisfied with the revenue. We are not, okay, and we -- so far folks have been strong in margin expansion, and going forward, we will find a good balance between margin, a healthy margin profile and revenue growth.", "So to be more specific on revenue growth, us trading Q3 versus market, its not what we intend. There are a number of reasons, and I am not going to get into all the reasons, but more important thing is, any constraint which we had so far is behind us, and we are right now, operating what I would call in a normal constrained environment. I.e., we have normal availability of products, normal capacity, that's behind us. It should not give us any reason why we don't achieve a revenue growth which we have in mind for Q4.", "Jeff Fettig", "Denise, this is Jeff, I'd just add to that. And again, as Marc clearly outlined, our priority to create value was first to fix the margins. We are on a great track to having done that, then grow, and I would say in supporting Marc's point, we have the tools to grow. We believe in earning market share, not buying market share and I think we are in a great position to do that going forward.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, great. Thank you. And just one more on LatAm, you have taken so much price, but volumes were a lot worse than we were expecting. So are you losing share in that market, and how much are your competitor's raising price? And also at some point, do you focus on market share in Brazil?", "Larry Venturelli", "Denise, let me address that. First of all, the market in Brazil was down by 27% in the quarter, so the market was fairly negative. And the fact of the matter is, that's just -- there is an impact on consumer demand, and so -- less consumers alike. Having said that, we are focused on both margin and share. We did lose couple of points a share in the quarter, but not significant, and we think we had the right plans in place with some of our product launches and the work that we are doing in order to recover that share. So we see that as a very short term item.", "So I can't comment on what the competitors are doing, but we continue to do what we think is necessary from a pricing perspective and taking out costs to make sure that we maintain our margins.", "Jeff Fettig", "Denise, I'd say our profile in the total Latin America country wise is different than others, so it really depends on your country profile. I'd say, without a question, I think in Brazil, we are relative to our competitive Brazil market, where despite the difficulties, we are in a strong as a position as we have ever been.", "Denise Chai", "Larry Venturelli", "I would just add Denise, keep in mind that in Brazil, we have been leading pricing increases and there is always a lag related to that.", "Denise Chai", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Wetenhall", "Hey. Good morning.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning.", "Robert Wetenhall", "Hey, just wanted to focus on North America. It looks like unit volumes were flat year-over-year, and it seems like industry shipments are kind of mid-single digit growth; and I think that would suggest that, you guys would have very strong volumes going into fourth quarter, and I just wanted to see if I am thinking about that right; do you see a good spike in volumes, both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis in North America?", "Marc Bitzer", "So Robert its Marc, let me first come to Q3 and then we can talk about Q4. In Q3, our volumes have been flat to very slightly down, which also implies that despite Canada and everything else, we had stable to slightly positive price mix, which is, I would say good achievement in a very competitive environment. But ultimately in Q3, we lost market share, even though as always and as we made comments in previous times, our units aren't exactly comparable to T6 or T7 market share, because there is more in our volumes than just T6 and T7. There is also Canada, Mexico, small domestic, etcetera.", "Anyhow, having said about Q3, we lost market share -- there are certain elements of different shipment patterns between Q3 and Q4 last year, so that gives a little bit of a tailwind in Q4. But above and beyond, and more importantly, it\u2019s the -- final but fully effective for new product launches, which give us momentum in Q4.", "Robert Wetenhall", "Got it. And then, taking from that, you had a very strong third quarter margin performance in North America, 12% plus, and that's also at the -- above your full year guidance, top of the range for 11 to 11.5. So should we expect to see very robust margin performance in the fourth quarter ast well?", "Marc Bitzer", "Robert, as I stated in the previous comments, we expect to be at the top end of that range. Again in context, we gave 10.5 to 11.5. If you just do the arithmetic math, yes, we are at the very top end of that range. I think from a structure margin run rate, we do not expect any surprise, but the question is, how much volume leverage can be captured.", "Robert Wetenhall", "Got it. And if I could just sneak one more in, can you give a little color in terms of what you are seeing on industry growth trends in Europe and Asia year-to-date, and how kind of organic volumes are trending versus your expectations? Thanks very much.", "Marc Bitzer", "So Robert, it's Marc again. I am going to give a comment on Europe and then Mike will give a comment on Asia. On Europe, again it\u2019s a split market, if you want to say. But Eastern European market demand continues to be very slow and very much down, which is driven by Russia and Ukraine. As we know, these markets are also historically very volatile markets, so its always difficult to predict how long they will be down. Historically, we didn't see these markets to be down on an extended timing, but right now, year-to-date, they are down significantly, and keep also in mind that the acquisition we have a much higher footprint and exposure in these Eastern European countries, compared to previous years.", "The western side, on the other side, I would say its stronger than anticipated. The most markets are in a very healthy and robust phase. But totally, if you add the two numbers together, that's basically 0% to 2% forecast and I would say right now, if Western Europe sustains, then we would be probably at the high side of that range, and that's what we would expect it from today's perspective.", "Mike Todman", "Okay, Robert. Just to give a little perspective on Asia. As you know, we took the Asia forecast down to about minus two, and that's largely driven by China. China has been slower in terms of market events than we expected, kind of coming into the year. Its at around minus 4% right now, and for that market, it\u2019s a big decline, although in general terms its not and we don't think that it should have a significant impact on our business.", "India is a little bit different. We have had a couple of quarters of fairly strong market demand and then the third quarter more, because of seasonal issues it reduced. But we think India will stabilize at a small growth, and that's why we have about a minus two for the year.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Good morning Jeff, Marc, Larry and Mike how are you?", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning.", "Mike Todman", "Good, Sam.", "Sam Darkatsh", "And Marc, congratulations and Mike congratulations to you as well, and it was a pleasure working with you over the years.", "Mike Todman", "Thank you.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thank you, Sam.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Couple of questions. First clarification, Marc, if I could peg you on this, what specifically were core shipments in the U.S., as it relates to AHAM comparable?", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam, its Marc. The key seven, as we look at it, is a plus 8.1% in Q3. That's basically -- and given our guidance of 5%, then you can make the math what it basically implies for Q4, i.e., 4% to 5% in that ballpark. That's what we -- again referring to the key seven units that's consistent with what we previously communicated.", "Sam Darkatsh", "That's the industry. I was looking for your units in the third quarter.", "Marc Bitzer", "Our units in the third quarter were almost minus 0.6%. All in, keep in mind, that's more than T7 versus significant impact for Canada in -- their Canadian market is very soft, and there is also impact for Mexico in there.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Well, I was specifically looking for T7, when you guys were doing in T7 in the quarter?", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam as you know, we don't typically drill down by U.S. T7 numbers. Directionally flat, slightly -- very-very slightly up, but its not to a level of a market.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Got you. And two more quick questions if I could, can you give an update, Marc, in terms of the $170 million in acquisition integration savings that you had originally planned for 2016 over 2015. What is that number now, based on currencies and volumes and what have you and how much of that actually do you expect to translate down to the bottom line?", "Larry Venturelli", "This is Larry. Let's first talk 2015, even with weaknesses in the Euro, we will exceed our 2015 synergy target. At Investor Day we did show 2016 our expectations between 2015 and 2016 would be approximately $170 million. We will update that, but we continue to believe we are going to have some really strong synergies in 2016, consistent with what we have talked about in the past.", "Marc Bitzer", "And Sam, it's Marc again. Just to add to that response; first of all, we will hit or even exceed the dollar synergy target, which means in local currency, we are actually quite a bit ahead of the original communicated plan. Given that synergies build over time, it shows -- gives you a lot of confidence going into 2016. So far, our integration is running very well and we remain fully committed and confident behind the numbers that we showed at Investor Day and communicate subsequently.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Thank you. Last question if I could, Larry; you took the free cash flow expectations lower for the year, but you took your CapEx and restructuring cash outlays lower also. I imagine as some of that might be slightly lower net income, but what is the other variable that I am missing in terms of -- like free cash flow is going down now versus prior expectations?", "Larry Venturelli", "Yeah I think the point I made in my remarks Sam was, we are going to carry a little bit higher inventory than originally expected, and that's primarily due to international product transitions, and that's obviously a timing issue.", "Sam Darkatsh", "That's already on the books, or that's planned into 4Q also?", "Larry Venturelli", "Well in the fourth quarter, a little bit higher in inventory than we previously said.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Got it. Thank you very much gentlemen.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Michael Rehaut", "Thanks. Good morning everyone and congrats also to Marc and best of luck to you Mike.", "Mike Todman", "Thank you.", "Michael Rehaut", "The first question, I just -- I guess you [indiscernible] in a couple questions on this already, but I think its going to be -- one of the big focuses coming out of the call and I am referring to North America margins versus volume, and Marc, you kind of mentioned that. You still expect to generate healthy margins, and you have done a lot of heavy lifting in terms of really strong improvement over the last two years. But at this point, it kind of sounds like you are shifting the pendulum a little bit back in the other direction, where you are still going to -- like you said, have healthy margins, but try and achieve some better revenue growth and it sounds like you were maybe a little disappointed with 3Q. Is that the right way to think about it? In other words, the 12% that you have got into 3Q, should we kind of think about that as more or less a high water mark, and maybe when you say, still healthy margins, maybe that could be something a little less than that for next year?", "Marc Bitzer", "Michael, its Marc. These are obviously several questions embedded in one question, and obviously we don't give guidance at this point for next year. So first of all, on high watermark on peak margins. Keep in minds, the number that are floating around half a year ago, I presume peak margins, we have already proven. And I don't want to nail down whatever is the peak margin. But the only thing which I want to reemphasize, we achieved 12% in Q3 without any volume leverage, which is a big deal.", "Having said that, and you mentioned that its not margin versus volume its margin and volume, and I think ultimately for us, it means a better balance between margin expansion and volume growth. Its not margin versus revenue, its margin expansion versus volume growth, and to be very honest, yeah, we will put a strong emphasis on revenue growth without diluting our strong margin profile.", "Michael Rehaut", "Okay. So in other words, I guess embedded in my first question, what was lacking there was that -- you can't necessarily think about giving up margin, because you are kind of ignoring the leverage benefits from the better volume and as you said, you are still hoping to hold on to the margin levels and maybe just dial back the expansion from here. Did I understand that right?", "Marc Bitzer", "First of all, again, we are not going to give a 2016 margin guidance, and I am not going to try to say we will hold the margin. [Indiscernible] our emphasis on margin expansion versus revenue growth, and that's what we will kind of carefully balance going forward.", "Michael Rehaut", "Okay. Appreciate it.", "Larry Venturelli", "Michael, just keep in mind, the longer term goals for North America, back in December were 12 plus. We are at -- as Marc mentioned, we will be at the higher end of this year in the range of 10.5 to 11.5. So we are very much on track with the longer term perspective of the company, and to Marc's point, we will balance that with revenue growth.", "Michael Rehaut", "That's there. Appreciate it. Just a few technical questions I guess; you mentioned about the progress with Indesit and at this year, you're exceeding your synergy target. I believe you'd called for $80 million and as you said, $170 million, which will be updated. If you are exceeding this year, and you still remain on track for the full amount of $350 million over the next three years, does that mean that -- maybe you could give us a sense of where you are in 2015 versus the 80 originally expected, and in effect, we should think that perhaps you are holding on to the full $350 million, but some of 2016 is coming into 2015?", "Marc Bitzer", "Michael, its Marc. Let me try to answer. So first of all on the $80 million, you are correct, that's mostly anticipated restructuring benefit in U.S. dollars. We are in U.S. dollars at the $80 million or slightly above, which means also, compared to our original euro assumption, we are actually trading quite a bit ahead from operating synergies. And again keep in mind, euro is our operating currency in Europe. So I mean, from an -- everyday, what we deliver from synergies, it looks very good. Which also means yes, we are confident on the previously stated $170 million and we are confident on the previously stated $350 million.", "The other thing that you got to bear in mind, what we did not anticipate coming in the year, but we have been able to mitigate it for additional actions, there are significant currency issues in Europe, that comes from a weaker euro, because you have a lot of dollar buy in Europe, largely from China, and other Asian areas, and particularly with Ruble and from [indiscernible]. So we have massive currency headwinds. Again I am very pleased that through better synergies and better ongoing cost productivity, we have been fully able to mitigate kind of any currency headwinds.", "And if you drill down the European number, what I am particularly pleased with is, the massive margin progress year-over-year is very healthy between gross margin benefits and SG&A improvements. So we are kind of fitting in on both sides.", "Larry Venturelli", "And Michael to be clear, because you have talked about in both markets. In terms of our direction, that's why we put the margin chart in this. North America, Europe and Asia are falling on track, and I would say also falling on track on our 2018 long range goals. The outlier this year from a regional business, has been Latin America, because of -- again I won't repeat, the currency and the decline in the market, we are dealing with that. But in terms of the expectations, we maybe getting there a slightly different way in Europe, more synergies offset by current transactional currency costs and things like that, but directionally, all three of these regional businesses are on track for a record year and are on track for our 2018 long range goals.", "Michael Rehaut", "All right. One last one if I could, the tax rate, I believe and then I believe I will hop off. The tax rate guidance at 22%, I guess that's now at the low end of the prior range of 22% to 25% if I have that right. Is that a number, that 22 now for 2015 that we can use for 2016 all else equal, or there are other some one time things and we should think of a tax rate of 22% to 25% long term for the company?", "Larry Venturelli", "Again Michael, its kind of hard to forecast really long term tax rates. But I would say, going into next year, we would expect our range to be what we stated at the beginning of this year, a similar range.", "Michael Rehaut", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David, please check the mute function on your phone.", "David MacGregor", "Yeah, there we go. Sorry about that. Good morning everyone.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning David.", "David MacGregor", "I guess, I think Michael had the right point, this is truly -- North America is going to be the focal point of the call, wanted to better understand, just some of the moving parts here. It seems as though you don't want to break out Canada and Mexico, maybe just this one point, you may want to make an exception on that, just because it seems to be such a core concern for investors today. But I want to understand kind of the price mix being up 350 basis points and I think gross margins in North America, about 200 basis points. It looks like maybe you are walking away from some unprofitable business, but maybe you could just peel back a little bit and give us a little more color on the moving parts there.", "Marc Bitzer", "David, its Marc Bitzer. Again in terms of the specific breakdown on Canada, Mexico, we won't provide details, but however I will you a couple of hints, which we will also present at the investor conference. Canada historically has been a $1 billion business for us roughly, that's what we showed -- depending on the currency, that's what we showed all semester day. If you look at the exchange rates, you basically had to do about 25% or almost 30% devaluation over last 18 months. So just do a math on the entire year North America business, it gives you a sense about how much of revenues we are losing in Canada.", "To a much smaller extent, but still to an extent, you have Mexico also, but our Mexican business is not the same size as Canada.", "So yes that has been impacting, but the reality is, we don't have sufficient growth -- didn't have sufficient growth in Q3 on our U.S. core business, and that's what we will change going forward.", "David MacGregor", "So are you walking away from a profitable business and maybe just talk a little bit about U.S. or domestic market share?", "Marc Bitzer", "I mean, David, I wouldn't say we are walking from unprofitable business. I would say, it\u2019s a combination of two things; one, we have not yet found a full leverage of all our new products, as we talked a lot about the massive amount of product introductions, the Kitchen Aids, the new VBL. So we don't yet have the full leverage of all different products in the market. And yes, there is also elements -- as always, there are certain promotions which are non-value creating. We only participate in what value creating promotions, and there has been a slightly higher promotion pressure by certain competitors, more imports in the markets.", "David MacGregor", "So how much of the apparent share losses occurring on long weekend sales of that is versus day-to-day business?", "Marc Bitzer", "David, we don't drill it down by promotional times and regular business. But if you connect it back to my previous comments, yes, there has been a slightly higher promotional pressure by certain imports, and that typically comes with extended promotion periods and deeper discounts from promotions.", "David MacGregor", "I just noticed, that upon the expiration of these retail sales events, MSRPs are popping right back into map line, which would suggest that most of this promotion is happening on sales events. So I am just wondering if that's where your share vulnerability lies?", "Marc Bitzer", "Not entirely David. Again, typically, yes you would expect during certain promotions, our share may not be exactly the same as during non-promotion periods.", "Jeff Fettig", "And David, I would say that pattern has not changed on the heavily promoted, particularly the ones that -- the major holidays. We would typically lose share and we bounce right back afterwards. And that pattern hasn't really changed, but I would just say to Marc's point is that certain competitors turn weekend promotions into month long promotions, and that has been a little bit more problematic and we are figuring out ways to deal with it, and we will, and I'd also like to point out that our -- again, I feel very good about the tools we have available. We had some issues to get them all available in the marketplace. As you know, this time of the year, you don't change [indiscernible] everyday, so we are working customer-by-customer and again, I believe we are in a great position to grow and candidly with our good margin structure, its very value creating for us to grow.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.", "Megan McGrath", "Good morning. Thanks. I guess, just to drill down on this a little bit more, and then I am going to move to Brazil. But one of the things, Marc, you just said is obviously on the promotions, and then you sort of mentioned you haven't found full leverage of the new products, and you have had a pretty robust slate of new products, let's say for the past 10 months or so. Can you point to any reasons why you think those new products haven't taken off as fast as you thought? Is it just because the promotional environment has been higher, or have there been execution issues with getting them out? Can you dig deeper a little bit into that one for us?", "Marc Bitzer", "So Megan, let me try to address the two points, promotion and the new products. Just to be very clear, our new products, the way how we look at the new products, when we floor and do a turn, I do a sell-through, and that is going very well. I think the uplift, which we get, whenever we have our new products floored, is we are very pleased, to a point where, we sometimes even have capacity constraints. When I talk about the leverage, yes, I mean, as we refer to all the previous calls, there has been a slight delay on how we ramped up the new product, how we get the full production capacity. That impacts the pace at which you can flow the product and subsequently the sell through.", "But the important thing is, whenever we have a flow, it sells very well and we are very pleased and that's what gives us a lot of confidence going forward.", "On the promotions, it\u2019s the same comments as before. We are participating than we believe we can create value with certain promotions, and in Q3, there have probably been a slightly higher share of promotions, which we would consider clearly non-value creating.", "Megan McGrath", "And then, can you then walk us through why you think 4Q is going to be different?", "Marc Bitzer", "First of all, we know what is our ramp up pace of the new product. We know how many were floored and this retail concentration which we have in North America is pretty -- you can't predict pretty well -- depending on the floored units, what rotation you get, and we have a good indication rotation.", "Obviously, we also have a certain order pipeline that we know and have a pretty good sense, October-November, that gives us a lot of confidence, and we are certain, as I hinted before. There are certain seasonality elements between Q3, Q4 last year, which are slightly different this year. So a combination of these three factors give us the confidence we have for revenue growth in Q4.", "Megan McGrath", "Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then shifting really quickly to Brazil, I guess one of the things I am trying to get a handle on here is -- I know, I think last quarter, the quarter before you presented the chart around GDP and how it usually bounces back and obviously we are not seeing a bounce back. So what's different in your strategy now, as you look at Brazil versus your strategy three months ago?", "Mike Todman", "Well Megan, I'd say, our strategy is unchanged. We are essentially executing what we said we were, which is new product introductions and innovations. But we are having to -- and managing our brands in the marketplace, the way we have talked about it. What we have had to do though, is react to a volatile environment. And so, when currency changes, then we have to react to that, when demand goes down, we have to react to that, and our ability to react to that has been very quick. And so we have managed that.", "The difference in the Brazil environment right now than I think in some of the past, is you have a political crisis going on now as well. And so, that has just introduced kind of another factor, which has driven some volatility.", "What I can tell you is, I feel really good about our ability to respond to that, our ability to -- if you will, change our business profile quickly, but continue to execute our long term strategy. That hasn't changed at all, and I am confident that as we manage through this, we will see improvements in our margins, and when growth returns, we will really like the answer.", "Megan McGrath", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Ken Zener", "Good morning gentlemen.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning Ken.", "Ken Zener", "Apologize if there is background noise. Look, I think in America, you guys are going to be focused on profitable growth that you are talking about. So Marc, if you could just say, you ran some degree short of your metric [indiscernible]. What percent of that was -- if you don't want to give us market share, how much of that was self-inflicted? Self-inflicted meaning you had products ramping up, etcetera, as opposed to the promotional. Would you say half of it was self-inflicted half of it was promotional?", "Marc Bitzer", "Ken its Marc. We don't break down how much of a market share was self-inflicted that you call versus promotional environment. At the end of the year, it was market share in a competitive environment, by definition you do 100% in a competitive environment. However I would say, directionally about half of it has been driven by certain constraints, which are under our control, but the other half is particularly focused on certain product categories, where we had a slightly higher promotional pressure intensity by certain imports.", "Ken Zener", "Okay. And then what would you say, relative to that competitive import pressure; because I believe the tariff review for a large residential loss, which is one of the two effective complaint you guys filed, was actually reduced. Could you comment on that?", "Marc Bitzer", "So first of all, Ken, and without getting into the details of a dumping discussion, the previous dumping cases which we won, there is a very important aspect; the tariff, referring to certain countries and reductions, some of the imports have shifted their production source. What is in our view, a certain mention on efforts of trying to circumvent the existing tariff, we have been, I think on the investor conference, we have been talking about it that we monitored very closely. And yes, there is a strong correlation between the promotion intensity and where this production has been shifting to, and we are observing it very closely, monitoring very closely. But I don't want to, at this point, reveal what we have or might have as an anti-dumping strategy going forward.", "Ken Zener", "Understood. Jeff, if we look at LatAm, so your margins as we enter the year, when you guys took guidance from 2014 to 2015, down to 12 to 13. [Indiscernible] to Brazil about currency and demands continue to fall. If we were to sit in that April quarter, your view was that you were going to be ramping up in the second half, towards the longer term 8% to 9% of EBIT. That was deferred obviously in 2Q as reported, because demand is fading. You thought it would be exiting the year, at 8 or 9. And now it says that, you guys, while not giving 2016 guidance, talk about it being below that long term growth rates. Could you give us an understanding of how that long term growth EBIT margin is actually impacted by the contraction we had within that core market being Brazil? Is it possible to hit that 8 to 9 if you just don't have the volume? Because you are not going to go in and restructure your whole footprint, like you have done in various regions.", "So are we really shooting at -- if volume is down 30%, let's just say it is [indiscernible] are we going to be sitting more at a 6% to 7% from the total segment?", "Jeff Fettig", "Ken, to your point and particularly in Brazil; but there is a few other countries also, I would -- to Latin America. We have literally seen three waves so far this year of currency devaluation, which there is a first quarter wave, and then it stabilized for a while, and then there is a second quarter wave and now the third quarter wave, and we have seen the currency from last year go from an average of about 2.30 to 2.35 to now almost 4, and obviously no one forecasted that and nor did the financial markets forecast that.", "Now with that, then came an accelerated decline of demand, and those comped, as you can, in a rapidly changing economy like that, you know right now, and all of our forecasts are updated to 20% down in Brazil and about a 4.0 reais and based on that, we are very confident about increasing our margins and forecasting and so on and so forth.", "What we really need to see is stability, whether in currency and demand, whatever levels they are; because we adjust, and we have adjusted very rapidly every quarter to these exchanges, but we are chasing a down market right now. Is it going to stabilize in the fourth quarter, I don't know, but to your bigger question, maybe your medium term question is, whatever the reais is and whatever demand levels are, its down 20% or 30%, once it stabilizes, I absolutely believe, given our market position, given our brand equity, we will, number one, continue to have a very strong share position of their share and we will be able to drive at least 8% plus margins, because that's a choice and that's what we would choose to do.", "The key is, it\u2019s the rapid profound volatility that you have to adjust to, and it doesn't take us years to adjust, we adjust now within months. We just still -- but we'd have to adjust several times. And so what we really need to do is just wherever the bottom is, see stability, we will start building margins back up from there.", "Ken Zener", "I appreciate that. And I am going to ask another follow-up question related to LatAm, and if you could -- comfortable to expand on it. Marc, you highlighted Canada at your investor day was $1 billion, there is currency that has changed. Jeff, Marc or Mike, do you guys do the same for LatAm in terms of -- you had Brazil at the same point in December 2014. Could you tell us what percent of LatAm it is today, and if you would, directionally, talk about margins I guess within that segment being brought outside of Brazil, and Brazil, if you would -- because I think on the increment, people are really trying to understand is, if you are looking for stability in Brazil, you haven't found it yet, but we also want to understand how Brazil is different than those two other pockets that I just mentioned, because that's also going to point to the stability, if those businesses exchange table, and are deteriorating. Thank you very much.", "Mike Todman", "Ken, maybe let me just take a quick shot at that. If you go back to our presentation, we kind of gave you a view, 2014 and then to 2015, what sales look like if you broke them down in LatAm and what the percentages were. What it showed is the compressor business went from 32% to 37% of our LatAm business, that are -- Extend and Expand in international went from 15 to 22, and then it showed that Brazil core went from 53 to 41. So you can see kind of what the rebalancing in sales have been. I can tell you that our compressor business continue to perform, and the margins in our compressor business are exactly where we thought they would be. And remember, this is a global compressor business.", "So yes, it has some impact in LatAm and it has an impact in some other regions of the world, but there is some balance, because it also provides product in North America and Europe, etcetera, etcetera. So the margins in that, we have been able to manage, and they are very good.", "Our LAR international and Extend and Expand businesses have also performed very well in this environment, and are delivering increases in both sales and we are taking market share in LAR International as well as maintaining a very high margin level.", "So the reality is, as we look at the rebalancing, the impact of Brazil core has become less and less on the total. And so we are pretty confident that we are continue to perform in those other businesses, and that's going to allow us to perform in Latin America.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard", "Thank you. Two things, first of all, in terms of material cost savings, input savings, if you could update us on 2015 and some thoughts on 2016, and also curious on how you think about those savings relative to the investments that you are considering within the North American business?", "Larry Venturelli", "Yeah Eric, this is Larry, we have said in the last call that we expect raw material benefits of around $100 million and if trends were to continue, we'd expect it to be north of that, and certainly we would say would be north of that. Its also important for 2015. Its also important to note that, many of the currencies around the world are U.S. dollar based. So when you are in emerging markets, there is a partial currency offset to that. But based on rates we are seeing right now, we'd say north of $100 million for 2015.", "Jeff Fettig", "And Eric, going into next year, if current trends hold, we will see some further improvement. Based on today's rate, wouldn't be as much next year as this year, because we are already accruing some of those benefits this year. But we have activities. We have productivity activities, we have continued -- the way we look at it is called total cost productivity, which includes not all raw materials, but productivity programs as well as our restructuring synergy. So we are very positive about our ability to generate those next year. We have not -- again, I don't necessarily buy the question, leading to the -- we are going to spend margin money in the marketplace. We are going to be competitive in the marketplace. We have got the right tools, we have got great innovation, great brands, and I fully expect that we will do it in a value creating way.", "Chris Conley", "With that, we will wrap up the call for today. We would like to thank everybody for your participation, and we will talk to you again.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you everyone for joining us and we will look forward to talking to you next time.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's program.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.", "Joseph Lovechio", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operation as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation.", "Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 31 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by noting that we delivered significant improvement in our third quarter operating results driven by our North America, Latin America and Asia regions. Year to date, we're delivering on our commitments to expand our operating margins, and we've significantly strengthened our free cash flow. In fact, these results marked the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement this year.", "Overall, our actions have more than offset higher material cost inflation and unfavorable foreign currency. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are on track to deliver the expected $200 million of cost savings benefits for this year. And very importantly, we continue to see strong price and mix improvement during the quarter driven by a strong cadence of new product introduction and our strong global consumer brand portfolio, which is enabling us to mix up in most markets around the world. As a result, we're increasing our full year ongoing business operation guidance for EPS to $6.90 to $7.10 per share and our free cash flow to between $125 million and $175 million.", "Turning to Slide 6. You'll see that overall revenues were up 5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX. This revenue growth was driven by our strong price and mix.", "Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved 6x what they were last year to $1.80 per share compared to $0.29 in the prior year. And our underlying free cash flow improved significantly year-over-year from our ongoing business operations.", "Turning to Slide 7, you can see our industry demand assumptions for the year. Globally, we continue to expect second half industry demand to improve from first half levels.", "And although while industry demand remains in many markets relatively weak, we are optimistic about some growth that we're seeing in some particular markets, and particularly trends that we're seeing in the U.S. housing market. Additionally, our ongoing business performance shift continue to improve because of our strong pipeline of new product innovations coming to the market and the benefit of our cost savings initiatives that we've already announced.", "On Slide 8, you can clearly see our positive price and mix and margin expansion trends over the last several quarters. Year-to-date, we made very strong progress towards our full year margin, and we fully expect to reach our full year operating profit margin guidance of between 5.5% and 6%.", "At this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North America operations.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing North America's performance in the third quarter.", "Starting on Slide 10. Both revenues and margins for the region grew during the quarter. And our strong operating margins exceed 9% for the quarter and were driven by price and mix. Our continuous investment in innovation, coupled with strong market execution, drove significant product improvement.", "Turning to Slide 11. You see the net sales of $2.4 billion increased slightly over 2% from last year, driven by favorable price from lower volumes.", "And as we've previously stated, our priority is margin improvement. We have gained share in the higher price segment across most products, driven by innovation, as evidenced by our positive mix. Our ongoing business operating profit was $227 million, which more than tripled as compared to $62 million in 2011. This means overall ongoing business operating margin was up almost 7 points year-over-year. In addition to price and mix, the year-over-year improvement was also driven by the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives.", "Turning to Slide 12. You can just see just one example of a new innovation that is driving improved price and mix. The photo shows our new Whirlpool brand, White Ice Collection.", "Lastly, as I mentioned on our last call, shown on Slide 13. It is important to point out that there is good upside for the business as underlying industry demand improves. And as we've already stated during our last earnings call, we continue to see some early but consistent signs of housing recovery, which makes us increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery.", "And now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Marc. Turning to Slide 15. Overall, our international operations were led by strong performances in our Latin America and Asia regions, which more than offset the effect of unfavorable currency and the weak economic environment in Europe. We delivered improved price and mix across our international business, as we continue to launch consumer-relevant innovations in every product category around the world.", "If you turn to Slide 16, you'll see our Latin America third quarter results. Sales of $1.2 billion were flat to the prior year. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 21% on higher volumes and improved mix.", "Operating profit for the quarter totaled $118 million compared to $147 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower monetization of tax credits.", "On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $105 million compared to $85 million, a 24% improvement year-over-year. We saw good market demand in Brazil and across the entire Latin America region.", "Turning to Slide 17. We gained share in our core 3 appliances with a positive price and mix, offsetting the adverse effects of higher material cost. For our Latin America business outside of Brazil, we had a record operating profit across the region and our adjusted margin increased more than 1 point.", "Turning to Slide 18. During the quarter, we faced continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone, negative conversion due to reduced production, unfavorable currency and high raw material cost. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales declined to $703 million, with unit shipments down 9% compared to the prior period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 10%. The region had an operating loss of $35 million compared to the $12 million loss in the prior year period.", "Given the environment, we have taken appropriate actions to position the business for a return to profitability during the fourth quarter as we realize benefits from our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives, benefit from higher seasonal volumes during the fourth quarter, improved price and mix within key countries and across our distribution, supported by new product innovations and realize the benefits from our ongoing productivity initiatives, which will ramp up in the fourth quarter. We will further accelerate these actions to ensure we move to a profitable position despite a continued negative environment.", "Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 19. During the quarter, we gained market share in India and expanded our margins across the region despite weak consumer demand and unfavorable currency.", "Net sales decreased 6% during the quarter to $201 million, down from $215 million in the prior-year period.

Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned and as shown on Slide 22, given our strong year-to-date operating performance and trends, entering the fourth quarter, we are increasing our annual ongoing business operations EPS range to $6.90 to $7.10 per share compared to the previous range of $6.50 to $7.", "We're also increasing our free cash flow guidance to between $125 million and $175 million. As you can see on Slide 23, we continue to expect the 5.5% to 6% ongoing operating profit margin for the full year. This translates into a 300 basis point improvement.", "Our ongoing operating profit margins increased to approximately 6% during the third quarter and is expected to continue increasing in the fourth quarter, given higher seasonal volumes, benefits from our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives and continued sequential productivity improvement.", "Our year-over-year margin improvement drivers for Q3 were price/mix, which was up approximately 4 points and is trending higher than original expectations. Driven by both cost-based price increases, as well as favorable mix, we continue to expect positive year-over-year price and mix for the balance of the year.", "Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, contributing over a point to our year-over-year margin improvement during the quarter.", "Material cost inflation was approximately $60 million in the third quarter. While we did benefit from sequential improvement in productivity from the second quarter, our productivity was somewhat impacted due to continued weakness in demand, primarily within Western Europe.", "Now turning to free cash flow on Slide 24.

It's important to note that net sales in constant currencies and excluding, BEFIEX credits, were up approximately 5%. Monetization of BEFIEX tax credits were $13 million compared to $62 million last year as a result of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. As of September 30, $202 million of credits remain. The IPI tax holiday in Brazil was recently extended to December 31, and we now expect to monetize approximately $40 million to $45 million for the full year.", "Regarding interest and sundry.

Fettig", "Thanks, Larry. Let me sum up by turning to Slide 29 and just highlight the following points. Again, we are delivering our margin expansion and cash flow commitments for the year. We continue to increase our cadence of new product innovation in the marketplace. We are realizing the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, and we're beginning to see some positive growth trends, in particular recent U.S. housing trends. So overall, we're pleased with our progress, and we expect to finish this year strong.", "Given our improving operating margins, we're upwardly revising our ongoing business operations and free cash flow guidance. And as we enter the fourth quarter, we are on track for the year to realize our full year operating margin target of 5.5% to 6%. I believe this will, we will achieve a record year for margin expansion across our global business. And we certainly believe at this point in time we are on track towards delivering our midterm 8% operating margin target.", "As Larry mentioned, we're not giving 2013 guidance today, but we do fully expect our positive momentum to carry over into 2013 as we realize an even greater benefit from our restructuring and cost initiatives, as well as a continued strong cadence of new product introductions.", "Finally on Slide 30. I'm increasingly confident in our opportunities that we see to grow in our business. These opportunities for us will come through our investments and consumer-relevant innovations. We see appliance growth opportunities in both developed and emerging markets. We are making good progress in expanding into higher margins, faster-growing adjacent businesses, and we continue to strengthen our global brand portfolio.", "We continue to make progress on our roadmap for growth. And more importantly we're performing at levels, and we'll continue to increase those levels to create value for our shareholders.", "So with that, I'm going to close in on our formal remarks and open this up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the site of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. First off, market share in North America and Europe look to be sharply lower. I know some of that's by design. When do you expect that to stabilize? And how important is it to you as opposed to incremental returns on capital? And the second question would be regarding sequential price versus mix. Can you throw a little color, specifically around the world, as to what you're seeing sequentially with price and mix as opposed to them combined?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Sam, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me try to answer both questions for North America. First of all on market share, and let me give you a broader context. I mean we've said all along, I think over the last 5 or 6 earnings calls, that our focus is on restoring operating margin. And why? Very simply because it doesn't make sense to push for volume when you have sub-par margin. I think it's more than fair to say what we've delivered on that promise. We outperformed our competitors by a long shot in our operating margin in North America. With that in mind, our share loss actually is fairly small. And I think more important, and I'm coming to you coming on by line is if you break down the component of the share movement. We actually gained share in the higher end segment. That is evidenced by the strong, I mean with the exceptionally strong product mix, price/mix which we got in Q3. And obviously you wouldn't get that kind of mix if you don't gain share in the higher end segment. At the same time, and that's by design element, we kind of -- we did not go up to a certain unprofitable low end market shares. [indiscernible] by design, and I would say that has certainly stabilized now. So I don't expect -- even as you know we don't give forward guidance, but I would consider that right now as a stable market share, and we're pretty comfortable with the levels right now. Pretty good. On your second part of your question, the sequential pricing. Actually, as Larry indicated, the global price in Q3 was 4%, slightly above 4% year-over-year. North America was quite a bit above that, which basically also tells you sequentially we were stable, which I would say given that we've kind of -- going to anniversary of the price increase of last year is a very strong performance. And again, as I mentioned before, it's largely mix driven, because obviously the like-for-like price impact basic levels of [indiscernible] anniversary for price increases.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Sam, let me address your first question on Europe market share. We did lose some market share, although not significant in Europe. But again, it's clearly focused on making sure that we go after the share that really counts for our business. And so we don't expect that to continue. As a matter of fact, what we saw in September is that we started to recover share in key categories that we wanted to, and we expect that to continue as we go into the fourth quarter. In terms of your second question on sequential price/mix. For the overall international region, we were stable. And then region to region, it was more or less stable in most of the regions I think slightly down in Europe, but everywhere else it was stable.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Sam. From both Marc and Larry's comment from a global perspective sequentially, price/mix all look very, very well. We did have some nice margin improvement coming from restructuring productivity between Q2 and Q3. And as far as what we'd expect in Q4 due to the seasonality of the business, we'd expect the mix-up again in Q4.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the site of Joshua Pollard from Goldman Sachs.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "My first one is on your 2013 restructuring benefit. I sort of think of your productivity and restructuring in 2 separate buckets. There's the ongoing piece, which is pretty hard to see in your margins. And then there's what you guys have done over the last year, which is obviously showing up in your margins. When you say restructuring for 2013, the benefit to be $200 million, which of those 2 buckets does it fall into? Should we see that in your margins? And if so, in what regions?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Josh, this is Jeff. Absolutely. And we communicated it in 2 buckets. The restructuring benefits relate to the announcements we made 1 year ago at this time, where we said we were going to reduce our fixed cost. We were going to take out unprofitable capacity, and that we would deliver $200 million in net benefits to our P&L in 2012 and another $200 million net benefits to our P&L in 2013. And that's still the plan, and we're on track to do that. Separate from that is our ongoing net cost productivity, which takes into account material inflation, et cetera, et cetera, and then the productivity actions that we take to offset that. This year we continue to have, given the GDP around the world, very high raw material cost inflation. We had very high salary and benefits and electricity and things like that around the world. We did have a good -- we are having a good year of gross productivity. But that's an area where we have not been able to fully offset that inflation in our net productivity. Going into next year, we will see when we give guidance in late January, early February. We'll give you our assumptions on that but typically, we would try to offset all of that and have positive net productivity, particularly if we had stable or modestly growing volume.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "And then Josh, this is Larry. As far as the restructuring in the margin. An approximation, you'd see about 85% of restructuring flow-through. Gross margin, 25% -- 15% would be within the SG&A area. The regional split, 75% North America. Europe would be 15% to 20%, and the rest of the world will be the balance.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "My second one is on your volumes by end market. I guess this question is going to be for Marc. Can you talk about your volumes in the contractor channel versus retail? And then within the retail, can you talk about how long it's going to take you guys before you lap sort of the market share losses that you guys have blatantly taken this year? In other words, should we expect relative to AHAM 6 that your retail volumes are sort of 5 to 6 points below the industry for the next 4 quarters? Or is it some shorter period of time?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "It's Marc Bitzer. First of all, when you look at our Q3 volumes, there's one additional comment which we need to make. There was a specific impact due to an exceptionally weak Mexican market, which had an impact on the overall quarter. But having said that, our volumes also in U.S. have been down in Q3. Now to answer your question about the split of retail versus contract if you want to make that simplification. Obviously, to date the weight of so-called contract to build the channel is significantly lower [indiscernible]. We're talking about a factor of 3. Now what has happened in the meantime is, I would say, significant strength in our position in that contract to build the channel and are therefore, in our view, very well positioned to an upturn in that market. Given the recent trends in the housing market, it is yet too early to see that impact in our numbers. Yet, you see an increase in the building contract channels, but it's not to a magnitude that has had significant weight in our overall business. Having said that, with ongoing good news in the housing market, I expect that positive momentum to more and more show up in our overall numbers.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "What was the difference in the growth between retail and contractor for the quarter?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "What I said, Josh, is that the contract channel in terms of impact or size [indiscernible] is down by a factor of 3 pretty much versus the 6. I mean we're talking about a very, very significant market.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Year-over-year, Josh, absolutely we're seeing increase in the contract shipments year-over-year in strong double digits as we have all year. But I think Marc's point was it's just a small part of the total market.", "Operator", "We'll move next to that site of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I guess you still have a few billion dollars of unrecovered cost inflation over the past decade. Just what's the opportunity to continue leveraging innovation to get pricing and rebuild margins? I guess that'll be the first question.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "David, we absolutely agree with you. Despite generally difficult economic conditions around the world, we continue to see every day the consumers pay for real innovation. And that's why our focus is and has been all through this downturn -- we never have stopped to reduce our level of investment in new product innovation or R&D. If anything, we've been increasing it of late. So you would expect the cadence of innovation from us to continue and probably at an increasing rate. Because that is -- that with strong brands is how you can sell and create value in our business, at least in our business model. But we don't take our productivity. That's why a year ago we said we did not know when global demand levels would return or what the new norm was. And that we were going to reduce our fixed costs by $400 million to adjust to this -- today's level of demand and expand our operating margins. And we'll have that again $200 million, which is almost a full point or is a full point going into next year that we fully expect to realize. And then lastly, I'd add productivity. Again, even during this downturn, prolonged downturn and weak global GDP growth, we've had tremendous amount [ph] of  material cost inflation. There are times, like we did this year and some last year, where it is imperative that we go out with cost-based price increases as we have. In some high inflation markets of the world, we even recently announced new price increases. So we're willing to do that. I think going back to Marc's question, we don't see a lot of value in chasing low end in our view profit, destroying pieces of the business when we have opportunities to invest in new product innovation that we get paid for. So we're committed. We're by no means done in our operating margin target that we laid out a couple of years ago for 2014, say, plus percent operating profit. We're still committed to that, and we see ample opportunities around the world to be able to achieve that.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I guess the question is just with -- in light of the innovation that you bring into market, can you -- does that give you the means to achieve pricing despite a flat raw material market? The flat raw material market should continue fairly couple of years. Is innovation enough to allow you to continue to improve your pricing as you go and recover a couple of billion dollars of unrecovered cost inflation?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well again, I think a couple billion that you talked about, it is true that's what we absorbed. I\u2019ll put it a different way. I do believe we can sell our new product innovation at attractive value-creating levels which will, in fact, continue to drive us to mix up. So I -- we are, nowhere in the world today are we satisfied with our operating margins. So we're taking actions on both new product innovation in parts of the world and new pricing, but certainly also focusing on cost and productivity to ensure that we have a pipeline of margin expanding activities in our system to be able to deal with whatever kind of environment we see.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Second question, just last question. You're talking about the $200 million of restructuring benefits and creating net P&L benefit of $200 million a year for 2 years. If we get some kind of a cyclical recovery in 2013, presumably everybody's going to beef up their ad spend, and I'm just wondering how much of that $200 million for 2013 you think you can actually take to the bottom line versus having to redeploy into a brand support?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, we've already been beefing up our brand in new product innovation investment. And as we have more and more new products to do, we'll continue to do that. So again, we're not giving 2013 guidance today. But the flip side of -- as we see recovery, we're going to have volume leverage as well. So I think there are a number of levers available to us in our business to both invest the right way to create value and to fund that while expanding our operating margins.", "Operator", "We'll move next to the site of Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Two questions. First of all, the increase in the full year guidance, it looks like Europe, you're probably going to make less money than you originally expected. So I'm interested in the moving parts within the increased guidance. That's my first question.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Eric. If you look at where we are year to date and again, we talk about continued seeing strong momentum as we finished the year on a full year basis, Europe is lower and North America is higher. And everywhere else is about the same.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then secondly with North America, you've been focused this year on -- focused greater on profitability and less on volume and your retail partners have gone along with that. I'm curious if you think this is sustainable for an extended period of time. How you think about that as we look into 4Q and even into 2013?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Eric, it's Marc Bitzer. Again, let me reiterate our focus has been on margin expansion. I think the big difference in Q3 compared to prior quarters, it's more than just price/mix, but we also have now price/mix and productivity and part of that coming from the structure. I would say our margin expansion is now in better footing than it was probably in Q1, Q2, which as you know also speaks volumes about sustainability. And our ability to keep pricing up on several sequential quarters and getting cost gives us quite a bit of confidence to make it sustainable.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And to add to that too is our trade partners certainly expect and benefit from our new product innovation. They expect us and benefit for -- as investing in our brands, which brings customers in their doors. Selling the better mix of product for them is as helpful to them as it is to us.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then lastly, the assumption for 4Q North America is an improvement in volume relative to the year-to-date and relative to 3Q. Interested in sort of what you're seeing in the business that gives you some confidence and a little bit of a step-up in volumes in 4Q?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Eric, it's Marc Bitzer again. As you've seen, we've kind of kept our full year volume/mix [indiscernible] or industry guidance on the same level [indiscernible]. If you mathematically would take the midpoint, that would give you a 3.5% to 4% growth. I think what is [indiscernible] affecting our guidance is at the lower end of that range, which is probably making the 1% or 2% growth in Q4. And that's pretty much what is the most probable scenario. We continue to see a lot of volatility in the market. But right now we're at, as I've said before, coming from the margin and cost take-outs, we're in very good position for Q4.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "And the other thing I'll add is just globally for the company, Q3 to Q4. Volumes, in general, are around 15% sequentially.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Normal seasonality.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the site of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "A lot of questions already asked. If you could maybe give us a specific update on U.S. Home Depot, the pilot program. Give us a comment on Brazil, relative to your margin outlook as it relates specifically, I believe, to one of your competitors. Perhaps losing a land position to make a factory. That's the first question.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me first take your Home Depot question. As you know, we have a long-standing quality of not getting specific of trade partners' strategies or actions. But obviously, it's a well-known fact that we kind of participate with the Whirlpool brand, in addition to our success with Maytag and Amana business at Home Depot, in what Home Depot put out as a pilot, what they called the [indiscernible]. I would say the only comment which we can make, we're actually very pleased with the progress so far. And it's in line or even slightly above our expectations so far.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And Ken to answer the question on Brazil. We feel good about our continued margin expansion in that region. We're expecting to see that progress continue in the fourth quarter. Our volumes have been very strong. As you can see in the core 3 appliances of the strategy that we deployed all year is working. And frankly, I won't speculate on what our competitors will or will not do. What we're trying to do is execute our strategy, have the right innovation in the market and ensure that consumers want our products [indiscernible]. So far, it's working.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess to the extent that you said the volume shortfall, while partly from Mexico was certainly related to walking away from some of the low end share. Marc, I believe you said that those share losses had stabilized. Would that imply to the extent you got margin growth in the third quarter due to mix, you're now not believing off share [ph] in lower margin product. Does that imply sequential margin pressure in North America?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc. And obviously, it's a number of question embedded in 1 big question. On the volume, Mexico had a very peculiar and very soft market, I would say, year-to-date. It's kind of [indiscernible] emerging market pattern, which we expect to stabilize going forward. That had a very significant impact or had a significant impact in our overall Q3 unit business. My comment on the low end was referring to -- and that is again the context of margin expansion. We focus on selling on innovation, particularly the higher end of the market. And we also had a significant mix growth. At the same time, we kind of -- we did not aggressively go after some low end unprofitable market segment. And that's why we vacated [ph] some share. I would say that action is behind us. It's pretty much stabilized. I don't -- from that natural trend, we don't expect a big change, and we can't comment and won't comment much about Q4 specifics. But I don't expect that massive change in market share trend so far.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "All right. I guess,  and then just my last question would be taking a step back given near 600, 700 basis points margin move in the U.S. How much of the ITC petition -- there's 2 of them, obviously the refrigerator being appealed; but the current tariff in place on washers. How should we think about perhaps benefits you're already receiving from these petitions, relative to your internal actions related to price and not willing to back up? How much of the tariff benefit has already been, perhaps, incorporated?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc again. Simple answer is 0. I don't think we have any benefit in our current Q3 performance, which also means if there's a positive outcome, which we count on, that should be outside.", "Operator", "The next is the site of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question on North American margins, obviously great performance and congrats on that. Looking at the performance sequentially though, up about 180 bps, excluding the gain from 2Q on slightly lower revenue and I guess part of that as you've been talking about is mix. Is that kind of the biggest driver, in terms of the sequential improvement in margin profitability? Or are there incremental benefits coming from price, or even perhaps on a sequential basis any benefit from lower raw materials?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Michael, it's Marc Bitzer again. Just on your question with sequential margin. There's 2 components which you've got to look at. One is the pricing component as such, which pretty much held as an impact. However, the composition of the pricing impact has changed. And Q2 was a little bit more like-for-like and less mix. And now, it's a whole lot more mix and less like-for-like. And that's just the nature of us going through the anniversary of price increase from last year. The second component that has changed is we see cost and restructuring benefits in Q3 to a higher or much higher extent than we saw in Q2.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And also I guess looking at Europe, Mike, if you could shed some light, at least on stated revenue basis, revenues have inched up a little bit in 2Q and 3Q coming off of the first quarter. Yet margins have obviously deteriorated. Just kind of trying to understand it sequentially, in terms of -- because certainly, you've been getting some restructuring benefits from a cost side this year. But it seems like the profits have been going the other way despite higher revenues. So what's been going on there, and what's behind the confidence behind profitability in the fourth quarter?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, first, Michael, just to kind of look at, although revenues have been going up, we had to take out fairly significant amount of production. And just from a seasonal perspective, you normally see kind of increases in volume quarter-over-quarter. But still, if you look at the third quarter, revenues were down about 10%. But why we're confident going forward is both on the restructuring side, in terms of the benefit as you know takes a little bit longer to ramp those up. We're going to see more of those in the fourth quarter. We see more productivity coming in the fourth quarter. We have higher seasonal revenues in the fourth quarter and we already saw -- we were already profitable in the month of September, and we see that continuing in October. So we're pretty confident that we've -- that all of the actions that we've been taking very aggressively are really starting to work. And we're beginning to see that turn in Europe.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. One last question if I could sneak it in about bigger picture with product innovation. And Jeff and Marc, you've both highlighted that the shift to the higher end products, I think pitting, is that something -- I assume that's something that obviously you're counting on into '13. Just trying to get a sense of, I guess particularly on the mix side, the mix benefit, has that something that's been kind of just emerging over the last couple of quarters and you'd expect that positive mix shift in North America to flow over into '13? And if there's anything additional in terms of perhaps a volume benefit relative to the market in general from product innovation. And I guess both of these comments, I'm really centering around North America here.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Michael, this is Jeff. I would say this is a trend we've seen for the last several years really, with the exception of late 2008, early 2009. Consumers buy that. And given the average points last for 10-plus years, and that we are still clearly in a replacement market. When people go into stores and see our products, they see things very dramatically differently than they did 10 years earlier when they purchased whatever product we're replacing. And that value's relevant. Yes, there is a small portion of the market who can only buy the affordable -- from a price standpoint, opening price point product, but that's very low in our market compared, certainly, to other markets around the world. And what we've seen with again, only a small, less than a half a year interruption is that when you bring value to the marketplace in the form of new product innovation, given consumers' choice, they will mix themselves up because the value they're receiving is a great value. It's a value in terms of performance of the machine, the energy efficiency, the water efficiency, the design and on and on and on. So I don't see this as a 2012 trend. I see this as a structural trend. And our view is, is to increase our cadence in new product innovation, continue to offer great values in the marketplace, supported by consumer demand and strong brand preference brands and that -- and we have a portfolio that's made to mix up.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Larry, one quick question on pension. I noticed that the cash flow guidance has benefit contributions or pension contributions up to $200 million versus previously up to $250 million. Is that something that also kind of works through the income statement in that perhaps there was less \"pension expense,\" or if you could just kind of describe what's -- what you expect to work through the income statement this year versus perhaps previously? And where you think pension contribution could be in '13 even?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Yes, a couple things, Michael. We did adjust the pension contributions from up to $250 million to $200 million. That's to do with the new legislation. It has no P&L impact whatsoever. The cash change that you saw, we did have the higher operating performance. You mentioned the lower pension cash, a little bit lower restructuring cash. But I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have lower BEFIEX credits. This has less cash. And we have these legal resolutions that also occurred in Q3. We'll have a little bit slightly higher working capital than we originally expected. We're taking out a lot of working capital to generate cash. So net-net, operationally the business is doing well from a cash perspective. From a pension expense perspective, again, both in the U.S. and foreign, we have about $50 million of pension expense. We'll provide you with additional guidance when we talk next time regarding expense. The new legislation will increase our pension expense by about $12 million next year, but I don't expect a significant increase above that.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Not even with the lower interest rates?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Remember, our pension plans are frozen. So we don't, on the expense side, have a lot of impact from pension for the interest rates. From a contribution perspective, we would expect to be -- to pay less cash next year.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well listen, everyone, we're going to conclude the call here.

(NYSE:WHR)  Q2 2007 Earnings Call July 20, 2007 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Larry Venturelli - VP, IR", " Jeff Fettig - Chairman & CEO", " Mike Todman - President, Whirlpool North America", " Roy Templin - CFO", "Analysts", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", " David MacGregor - Longbow Research", " Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", " Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", " Laura Champine - Morgan Keegan", " Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", " David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Operator", "Good day, everyone. And welcome to today's Whirlpool Corporation second quarter 2007 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded.", "For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Larry Venturelli. Please go ahead.", "Larry Venturelli", "Good morning. And welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Our opening remarks will refer to a slide presentation, which is available on our Investor Web page. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist in your understanding of Whirlpool's future expectations.", "Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q. During the call, we will be making comments on free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Listeners are directed to slide 34 for additional disclosures regarding this item.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Fettig, for his opening remarks. Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw earlier this morning, we released our financial results for the second quarter, and you can find these results, which are shown on slides two and three. For the quarter, net sales increased 3% to an all-time Company record of $4.9 billion in revenue.", "We delivered $161 million in earnings from our continuing operations, which translated into $2 a share, which was up about 60% from the $100 million or $1.26 per share that we reported a year ago at this time. The increase in earnings for the quarter reflect several items, which include strong brand performance and operating profit improvement within each of our international businesses.", "The efficiency benefits associated with last year's acquisition of Maytag, productivity improvements combined with very strong cost controls all around the world, and a lower effective tax rate. I'm very pleased that during the quarter that all of our regional businesses reported improved year-over-year operating and profit margin.", "And as we expected, second quarter results were negatively impacted by significantly higher material costs, which primarily were within base metals, component parts, and steel. We also, as expected, saw lower demand in the U.S. We had increased brand investment and a pension curtailment charge in our U.S. business during the quarter, as well.", "Regarding our North American business, we are very encouraged by the U.S. industry demand trends that we saw late in the second quarter. While weak industry demand in the U.S. has been negatively impacting our results during the past year, shipment trends began to improve during the second quarter and we believe that demand will begin to return to moderate growth levels during the second half of this year.", "The Maytag integration is progressing well and as planned. And as we discussed with you last time -- or last quarter, we are implementing the Maytag integration really in three phases. Our initial integration efforts have been focused on fixing Maytag's cost structure.", "A significant portion of this work was completed during first half of the year, which included the sale of the Hoover Floor Care business, transfer of production related to the closure of two Maytag laundry locations to our Ohio facilities as well as consolidating administrative, procurement, R&D and other supply chain functions.", "We will be closing the remaining Maytag laundry facility in the fourth quarter of this year and by the end of the year, we are very confident that we will have significantly improved the old Maytag business cost structure.", "The remaining two phases are very important to our integration, and are focused on brand investment and growth, which includes utilizing our innovation pipeline to reinvigorate the brand product offerings in the marketplace.", "In the second quarter and through the balance of this year and throughout the first part of next year, you will see a themes (ph) of innovation and acceleration of product development, delivering on our longstanding Maytag brand promise of durability and dependability.", "We will continue to focus on the brand by making appropriate brand investments and by driving growth through product innovation, we will continue to expand our distribution, and the development of a very distinct visual brand language for all Maytag products. In line with these growth plans established for Maytag, we did increase brand investment during the second quarter.", "This planned increase was in support of our new product introductions and the brand positioning which reinforces the attributes of dependability, durability and quality with our customers.", "Maytag's advertising to consumers has been extremely limited over the last several years, and we believe this increased advertising support is one of the key investments that we're going to make and are making for the brand's future growth and profitability. Overall, we are very confident and have strong confidence that our actions that we're taking will position will the Maytag brand for growth during the second half of 2007 and beyond.", "Also as we discussed during our last call, we have resumed during the quarter our share repurchase program. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $100 million of common stock in the open market. We have approximately $365 million remains open under our $500 million share repurchase program. We continue to believe our stock is undervalued and we intend to remain active purchasers of our stock going forward.", "Our guidance for 2007 is shown in slide four, and I would like to point out a couple of changes that we are making in terms of the inputs to guidance. First, due to the success of our Maytag integration efforts, we now expect to realize efficiencies in excess of the $400 million that we talked about earlier for 2007. This is significantly above our original estimate.", "Additionally, due to now rising oil prices, we expect the combination of material price increases and oil related costs to increase by approximately $570 million. This is up from the $500 million guidance we gave you in April. But combined, we still continue expect our earnings to be in the $8 and $8.50 per share range from continuing operation and for free cash flow to be in the $600 million to $650 million.", "The priorities that we embedded in our 2007 guidance, which are listed on slide five have not changed. We really remain focused on five specific areas to address the significant material cost increase environment that we continue to see. And, again, just as a reminder, those priorities are realizing the Maytag efficiencies, which are going very well.", "Secondly is continuing the acceleration of our new product innovation globally. Third, which we will talk about later today, the growth of the Maytag brand. Fourth is to drive cost productivity around our global operations. And lastly, and very importantly, managing our overall mix of brands and products and innovation, which does include cost-based price increases that we've implemented previous to this call.", "Joining me today for the call is Mike Todman, our President of our North American Business, and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer. I'm going to now turn this call over to Mike to discuss both the North American and International performance for the quarter.", "Mike Todman", "Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance during the second quarter. During the quarter, we reported improved operating income and margin expansion versus a year ago. These financial results were achieved during a very difficult material cost and demand environment, and while also executing the integration of Maytag.", "We were able to offset these headwinds by combining strong acquisition efficiency realization with the favorable impact of higher average sales values and an improved price mix from our innovative brands.", "As expected, industry unit shipments of appliances declined approximately 1% for the quarter, and about 5% for the first half of 2007. We did begin to see positive industry trends in June and also in early July, after several months of steep year-over-year declines.", "These recent trends reinforce an improving industry environment and are consistent with the guidance we previously provided. We continue to expect moderate growth in the second half of the year, which will contribute to a stronger second half financial performance, and we anticipate that the annual industry demand in the U.S. will decline by approximately 2% to 3%.", "As you will see on slide six, second quarter revenue from Whirlpool North America of $3 billion was down approximately 6% versus the year ago period. While total Company share increased from first quarter levels, we did experience year-over-year declines, primarily within our OEM business. For our branded products, the Whirlpool brand continued to gain share and our premium business of KitchenAid and Jenn-Air remain very strong.", "As expected, Maytag year-over-year brand share was down. However, brand share was essentially equal to first quarter levels. I will speak about our growth plans for Maytag in just a moment. Finally, our value brands, which tend to be more price sensitive have experienced significant margin pressure from increased material costs.", "To recover these material cost increases, we consciously took price increases at the expense of share in some categories. With new product innovation launches, increased distribution, execution of our Maytag growth plan and the vast majority of our acquisition integration activity behind us, we fully expect to increase share in the second half of the year.", "To close out my discussion on second quarter financial performance shown on slide six, I should also highlight, that our operating profit of $179 million for the quarter reflects increased brand investment in support of the Maytag brand innovation launches and a pension curtailment charge.", "I'd like to make a few comments regarding where we are in the integration and growth plans for the Maytag business, consistent with our original plan, we are following the outlined approach that you see on slide seven.", "We have completed significant portions of our integration plan, and much progress has been made over the past several months, addressing Maytag's cost structure. Acquisition efficiencies from the combined company have been robust and continue to track above our initial plans.", "With the integration activity largely implemented, we are now in the midst of our product innovation and growth plans, which are being supported by additional brand investments. These plans started in the first quarter with the introduction of the Centennial and Bravos top load washers, which can be seen on slides eight and nine.", "During the second quarter, we also introduced the new Maytag Epic washing machine shown on slide ten and the Jenn-Air brand launched a complete collection of appliances in an oiled bronze finish shown on slide 11.", "This cadence of new innovative product introductions will continue well through 2008. By this time next year, we will have turned over a significant percentage of the Maytag product line.", "As such, you will see significant product differentiation and innovation launches over the next several quarters, which clearly support the Maytag positioning of dependability and durability.", "This commitment to brand investment, innovation, and growth has enabled to us increase our distribution during the first half of this year, and positions us to grow the Maytag brand share during the second half of 2007 and into 2008.", "Along with new Maytag innovation, we will continue new product launches, like the new KitchenAid Architect Series II shown on slide 12.", "Going forward, as you can see on slide 13, our business focus for 2007 remains realization of Maytag efficiencies, Maytag new product launches and brand investment, improvements in margin realization, introducing new product innovations to the market, and delivering strong levels of productivity.", "In summary, we do expect second half results in North America to improve based on improved industry demand, continued strong acquisition efficiency realization, the ramp up of productivity initiatives, benefits from new product launches and share improvement, and lower year-over-year material and oil-related cost increases in the second half of the year.", "Turning now to our international business, you will see on slide 14, that we have made good progress on international growth. Following our strong performance in 2006, momentum in our international business continued through the first half of 2007. Total international operating profit reached $271 million during the first six months of 2007, and margins increased from 5.4% to 7.5%.", "For our European business, shown on slide 15, revenue increased 10% during the quarter to a record $900 million, led by continued strong performance of the company's Whirlpool brand, and innovative new product offerings.", "In local currency, sales increased approximately 3%, year-over-year unit shipments for the region exceeded industry demand during the quarter, which was estimated to have increased 2% to 3%.", "Record second quarter operating profit of $51 million increased 20% over last year's comparable period, and margins expanded as favorable mix, productivity and lower benefit costs offset higher material costs during the quarter. In Europe, our innovation cadence remains strong and we continue to leverage our global operating platform and customer knowledge.", "As you can see on slide 16 through 18, we introduced the Whirlpool Evolution Emotion Hood with dual functionality, the Bauknecht Super Echo energy conserving washing machine, and the Whirlpool Never Defrost freezer during the second quarter.", "Based on current economic conditions, the company continues to expect full year 2007 industry unit shipments to increase approximately 2% to 3%. On slide 19, you will note that our European business focus during 2007 remains continued improvement in the overall mix of our business to expand margins, manufacturing, productivity and cost reduction initiatives, and leveraging our global product innovation.", "For our Latin American business, shown on slide 20, we recorded second quarter revenue and operating profit. Sales improved 29% to $822 million from last year, reflecting robust industry growth and market share gains in appliances, a favorable macroeconomic environment in Brazil, cost-based price adjustments and strong consumer demand for the company's innovative brands.", "Excluding currency translations, sales for appliances and compressors increased approximately 18%. During the quarter, we extended our leading market share position in Brazil, as our regional unit shipments of appliances grew 22%, exceeding industry shipments, which are estimated to have increased by 18%.", "Record second quarter operating profit of $95 million increased significantly over the prior year period, the region reported a strong second quarter operating profit margin of 11.6%, strong appliance demand, productivity, and price increases implemented to mitigate higher material costs contributed to the improved performance versus a year ago.", "Innovation continues to be a cornerstone of our Latin American business. During the quarter, the region introduced both the Brastemp One Fitness microwave and Retro Mini refrigerator, shown on slides 21 and 22.", "And the Consul brand introduced the innovative Mare washing machine, shown on slide 23. Based on the current economic environment in Brazil, the company continues to expect full year 2007 appliance industry shipments to increase 15% to 20%.", "As indicated on slide 24, our focus in Latin America during 2007 is on strong cost productivity, margin realization, and acceleration of innovation launches. On slide 25, Asia's first quarter sales of $163 million increased 23% from last year.", "Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 13%. The region reported improved operating profit results during the quarter, largely driven by strong growth within India.", "The favorable impact from successful new product launches, such as the Mastermind frost free refrigerator, shown on slide 26, improved product mix and cost-based pricing, offset higher material costs during the quarter.", "Based on current economic conditions, the company continues to expect 2007 industry unit shipments to increase 5% to 10%. Slide 27 shows our continued business focus in Asia during 2007 is to, one, extend our product offering and accelerate new product launches, expand distribution and leverage our global innovation, continued expansion of China procurement and technology, and drive strong manufacturing productivity.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review.", "Roy Templin", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff discussed earlier in his opening comments, we earned $161 million or $2 per share from continuing operations for the quarter, compared to $100 million or $1.26 per share last year.", "Included in these results are some discrete items in the current year second quarter, which I would like to highlight. First, a lower effective tax rate, which increased earnings by approximately $0.27 per share when comparing the current year effective tax rate to the prior year.", "Second, a pension curtailment charge, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.14 per share and, third, a cumulative charge for variable stock-based long-term compensation, resulting from the company's significant increase in stock price during the second quarter, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.09 per share.", "All of our businesses reported year-over-year operating profit improvement during the quarter combined with margin expansion. Outside of the U.S. our financial performance exceeded expectations for the quarter as both appliance demand trends and international economic conditions remained solid.", "Our U.S. business was negatively impacted, as expected by lower demand and significantly higher material and oil-related costs during the second quarter and first half of this year.", "Globally, our material and oil-related cost increases were approximately $157 million for the quarter, and about $305 million through the first half of the year. Roughly, 75% of these increases were experienced in the U.S.", "Acquisition efficiencies continue to remain strong. During the quarter, efficiencies were $120 million and integration costs were approximately $10 million. For the first half of the year, total efficiencies were $227 million and one-time costs were $24 million. We are encouraged by U.S. demand trends exiting the second quarter, and believe we will see flat to moderate growth in the second half of the year.", "In addition, while year-over-year material cost increases will remain significant. We should experience a lower year-over-year increase in the second half of the year, when compared to the first half.", "These factors, combined with productivity initiatives, new product launches and the continued benefits from acquisition efficiencies, will improve our second half performance within the U.S.", "I will now make some additional comments on our second quarter consolidated earnings performance. Before I begin, and as a reminder, during the first quarter of this year the company adopted changes to its segment reporting consistent with realignments made to our regional business operations. Regional results for 2006 have been reclassified to reflect these changes and are shown on slide 28.", "Turning to slide 29, you will note that interest income and sundry improved approximately $14 million from 2006. This improvement primarily reflects foreign currency gains on balance sheet positions held in various countries around the world during the quarter.", "Last year, these positions resulted in $7 million of expense, while this year's results were a $7 million gain. Interest expense declined about $7 million from the prior year, reflecting an overall reduction in our debt balance and the replacement of maturing higher cost debt during 2006 with lower rate debt.", "Our effective tax rate was 14.5% during the second quarter, compared to 25.5% last year. As we stated during our first quarter earnings conference call, the adoption of FIN 48 will most likely cause additional volatility in our tax rate from quarter to quarter.", "Although, we continue to expect an overall annual rate in the mid-20s for the entire year, Whirlpool was required to recognize the benefit of two discrete items related to international tax reserves established prior to 2007 during the second quarter. The recognition of these two items in the second quarter reduced our second quarter tax rate below our estimated annual operating rate.", "Finally, you will note that equity in affiliates and minority interests, which are associated with our Latin America operations and a European equity investment negatively impacted year-over-year earnings by $8 million.", "Turning to slide 30, I will briefly comment on our cash flow performance. Cash used in continuing operations of $6 million was $87 million lower than last year's results, as current year results include higher restructuring, primarily in support of the Maytag integration, and a higher pension contribution.", "Overall, working capital levels as a percentage of sales ended the quarter at 12.4% versus last year's reported level of 12.0%. Our overall inventory position at the end of the quarter increased $265 million from the same period last year.", "The year-over-year impact from currency increased inventories by about $90 million due to appreciation in both the Euro and the Brazilian Real. Material cost increases and safety stock for product transitions moves added an additional $85 million and the remaining $90 million represents about two excess days, which we expect to work off by the end of the year.", "Turning to slide 31, given our accelerated rate of achieving efficiencies in the first half of 2007, we now estimate we will exceed $400 million in efficiencies in the current year, significantly ahead of our original schedule.", "Our revised estimates for integration costs shown on slide 32 have not changed from our previous guidance. As Jeff previously discussed, our earnings per share guidance remains $8 to $8.50 per share for 2007 and free cash flow is expected to be between $600 million and $650 million.", "We resumed our share repurchase during the quarter and purchased $101 million of common stock, which equated to about 915,000 shares. We have approximately $365 million available for purchase under our current authorization.", "Now, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you, Roy. Let me recap our view for the balance of the year. To begin, we do expect continued strong performance within our international businesses. At this point in time, we are encouraged by the U.S. demand trends that we saw exiting the second quarter and we believe that with an improved demand environment, combined with our acquisition efficiencies, our ramp up, which we expect in the second half of the year of our productivity improvements and the Maytag product innovation. We will significantly improve our performance, as expected, in the U.S. during the second half of the year.", "Overall, we will continue to address globally, this heightened global material cost environment through the things we've talked about, which include new product innovation, increased productivity throughout our global operations, successfully improving our overall mix of business as we have done to date and where appropriate, implementing cost-based price increases.", "Finally, we do remain very well positioned to realize efficiencies, as Roy spoke about, in excess of $400 million from the Maytag acquisition and we are very excited about the growth plans for Maytag throughout the second half and into 2008.", "At this point I will stop and I will open this up for questions. Operator, if we could proceed with the Q&A portion of this call.", " Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Michael Rehaut, J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. First, just focusing on the share trends for the quarter, were those within the expectations that you had going into the quarter and maybe you could highlight within OEM and Whirlpool-branded you know, where were there particular strengths?", "Were the Whirlpool share gains maybe not as strong as last quarter, OEM, what's going on with Sears, if you could shed any light?", "Jeff Fettig", "Sure. Well, let me have Mike Todman answer that.", "Mike Todman", "Yes, Mike, let me just start with kind of the general share trends, and actually the share trends in general coming from the first quarter to the second quarter are in line with what we expected, except for the OEM share is lower than what we expected, but the Whirlpool brand did gain some share and was very strong.", "We feel very good about our premium brands, both KitchenAid and Jenn-Air and those were very strong. The Maytag brand was right where we thought it would be and just was about flat in share quarter-over-quarter.", "So, really it was the OEM brand. Now, we feel pretty confident that as we go through the second half of the year with some of the new product introductions that we have coming into the third quarter and the fourth quarter with Sears that that ought to help them with the plans and actions that they also have in place. So, we feel good about what we've got coming up through the third and the fourth quarter.", "Jeff Fettig", "And to be clear, on the Maytag brand, which there have been some comments about, year-over-year, it is down and we expected that as we have gone through this transition. We've closed two major facilities, production facilities, and transferred production.", "So, as we transition through this, we had to move up old stock off floors and then ramp up with the new and put on our new, particularly in fabric care. So this is largely in line with our expectations.", "Versus the first quarter, it was marginally up, and we think really the full impact of the Maytag improvement is going to show as we have these new products in the marketplace in the second half of this year.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Great, thank you. And can you give us an idea what your, what pricing in North America contributed to the top line?", "Roy Templin", "Well, Mike...", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "As a percent?", "Roy Templin", "Michael, it's Roy. If you look at North America Q2 to Q2 a year ago the price mix impact in North America was just about a point of positive improvement year-over-year. ", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "And was that mostly, was that more price versus mix or...", "Roy Templin", "It was about equal.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Okay.", "Roy Templin", "Enterprise mix. That's in their gross margin.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And just last question, understanding, of course, that there is, does continue to be some volatility with FIN 48, but with some of those difficult to ascertain the factors aside. Given that you are still looking for a mid-20s full year tax rate, is it safe to assume then that for 3Q and 4Q, you are looking at maybe a 30%ish type number or how should we think about that in terms of modeling?", "Roy Templin", "Well Michael, let me just say we don't give quarterly guidance, but I think where you are going is exactly right. If you look at our rate through the first half of the year we came out of the first half at 19%.", "So in order to get that mid-20 kind of rate for the full year, you are correct in that our rates will be elevated in the back half of the year to get back to that number.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from David MacGregor, with Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Yes. Good morning everyone, David MacGregor, I just wanted to be clear on this OEM share loss. Was it just weakness within the Kenmore traffic? Or have you by any means lost any Sears business? Has any of that business been awarded away to other manufacturers?", "Mike Todman", "David, this is Mike Todman. The fact, it's actually the Sears outlet share that's gone back. We have not lost any share within the OEM, within the Sears group.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay, good. I just wanted to be clear about that. So it's really just weakness in their traffic. Can you talk a little more about the brand investments at Maytag. And I know last year in the second half, you were pretty diligent about rolling over a lot of your SKUs in the Whirlpool line, and I think it showed up nicely in the first quarter pricing.", "I wonder to what extent we could expect to see much stronger pricing within the Maytag brand offering as a result of the new product introductions and all the innovation you plan on rolling out in that category? ", "Mike Todman", "Yes, Michael, let me maybe comment on that. What we did, as you know is we've introduced some new product within the first half of the year, some within the first quarter and the second quarter, in order to support those new product introductions we invested in brand investment to reinvigorate and reintroduce that Maytag brand into the marketplace.", "We feel very good that it is commanding the appropriate price level in the marketplace. As we move into the third quarter, we are going to be introducing some new products in the front load area, washer area, which we think, again, will help support the brand and the pricing that we will be able to command in the marketplace with that brand.", "So all of these investments are really around the right product innovation to support the Maytag brand positioning around durability and reliability and we think with that positioning, we will command the appropriate price in the market.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Is there any chance you could give us some sense of at least range on what kind of pricing you expect is achievable from the revitalization? ", "Mike Todman", "No, that's, that's very difficult to do in that sense because essentially, it's the products and where we are introducing them in the marketplace. ", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Maytag efficiency is now greater than $400 million. Can you talk a little bit about the source of the incremental efficiency, Jeff?", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, David, really it's across the board. If you look at the entire value chain as we said, we have, in the very beginning we said we have two appliance companies that we are basically integrating into one.", "I would say every bucket of the value chain, we have had a very disciplined process applied to this from day one. We've got people accountable for each piece of it. The big ticket items certainly have been and most recently have been the factory closures.", "But you ought to think about it, everything from product through supply chain through manufacturing to SG&A and so on, we're just, as we complete these projects, we are yielding more efficiencies in total than we had originally forecast.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "So there aren't one or two elements within that number that are featuring more predominantly? ", "Roy Templin", "David, this is Roy. David, if you think about, Jeff is exactly right, first of all. If you think about the three big buckets that we've talked about with respect to efficiencies, procurement, manufacturing efficiencies and then the SG&A redundancy improvements, all three of those large buckets have improvement and are driving this increase.", "And so I know the second part of your question will be SG&A versus cost of goods sold, as we've said historically, those first two items both come through margin, and this third item comes through SG&A. But, again, increases in improvements in all three of the large buckets.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay, good. Final question, just if you could help me with the outlook for the 2008 on your working capital and your CapEx? ", "Roy Templin", "Yes, we're -- you mean 2007 or you wanted me...", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "No, I'm trying to think a little further ahead here.", "Roy Templin", "Well, David, we are not going to comment on 2008 today. I will tell you, I will comment though, and give you a little perspective with respect to the rest of year. As you know, working capital as a percent of sales was 12.4 at the end of Q2, and as you'll recall, we were at that same place at the end of Q1.", "Our commitment, and we've said this earlier, David, and we remain confident in our ability to do this, is to achieve a working capital level below where we ended the year last year, which you'll recall, David, was 11%. And so again, as we look out for the rest of this year, we expect to take our working capital down to below 11%.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay. And then CapEx?", "Jeff Fettig", "David, the other perspective I would give you, is that if you look at our guidance for free cash flow this year, $600 million to $650 million, that's about 3% to 3.3% of revenues and I think you know our longer-term goals were 4% to 5% of revenues. So we are not giving any guidance for 2008, but we expect as we go forward, that we are able to deliver higher levels of cash from our operations.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Are you able to talk at all about CapEx at this point? ", "Jeff Fettig", "No.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay, thanks, guys.", "Operator", "we'll take our next question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Good morning Jeff, Good morning Mike, how are you?", "Jeff Fettig", "Good Sam.", "Mike Todman", "Good.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Three quick questions, first off, Befiex, Roy, the tax credits in the quarter I missed. If you said it, I missed it. Did you mention that?", "Roy Templin", "I don't know that we said a number, Sam. The number in the second quarter was $27 million, which you will recall is down a little bit from the first quarter where we had $30 million of Befiex in the first quarter. ", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "And how would you suggest we look at that on a quarterly basis, then? Is that the run rate, you think, as long as the business holds up? ", "Roy Templin", "Well, Sam, let me just -- let me answer your question this way. The reason we don't do any forward forecast on Befiex, it's sort of like any other kind of tax in that Befiex tax credits are really dependent upon a couple of things.", "One, the level of volume in Latin America. And two, which makes this a little bit more difficult to predict, is the mix within that volume, because dependent upon the mix, you get a different level of the Befiex credit. So it's tough for us to project it going forward, Sam. But, again as a reminder, we came out of last year at $23 million in the fourth quarter, $30 million in Q1, and again, $27 million here in Q2.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Okay. Next question is a bit granular, Roy. I apologize for it ahead of time. Your free cash flow walk that you provided in your press release, has proceeds from sale of assets in non-Maytag businesses of $50 million.", "But it looks like the first half of the year, if you add the Maytag proceeds, along with the sale of non-Maytag businesses, it comes to $120 million. Is -- how do I reconcile that? And based on your guidance of $600 million to $650 million, what was your cash usage in the first half I guess, is what my real question is?", "Roy Templin", "Sam, I'm sorry. I may not understand your question here. I'm going to have to ask you to at least repeat part of it.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "I'm sorry. In the walk where you give the guidance of $600 million to $650 million, you have $1,175 million to $1,225 million of cash flow from continuing operations. You have $625 million in CapEx and then you have $50 million from proceeds from asset sales, and that's how you get to $600 million to $650 million?", "Roy Templin", "Right.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "That's what I'm referring to.", "Roy Templin", "Okay.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "I'm guessing, based on that definition, what was your cash flow usage in the first half of the year?", "Roy Templin", "Well, Sam, first of all, let me go back to the $50 million. Again, that's asset sales exclusive of the adjacent businesses from Maytag. So, again, I hope I'm understanding your question correctly. We had $20 million year-to-date through first half of the year on asset sales, of which, again, this is an annual guidance number that you are referring to here. We expect that number for the full year to be $50 million. But again, very importantly, that number is exclusive of any of the adjacent business sales.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Got you. So then, by that definition then, you would have used $188 million of cash in the first half. So then, you would be generating roughly $800 million or so in the second half of positive cash flow. Is that correct?", "Roy Templin", "That's correct.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Okay. I just wanted to make sure I was clear with that.", "Jeff Fettig", "It's also in line with our normal seasonal pattern.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Right. I understand that. I just wanted to make sure of the exact magnitude of it. Last question, before I'll defer to others. You mentioned higher brand support spending in the quarter, what was that on a year-on-year basis, roughly?", "Roy Templin", "North America or consolidated, Sam?", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Yes.", "Roy Templin", "Yeah, okay. North America, it was about half a point, and that equates you back to about a little over three-tenths of a point for the consolidated numbers in terms of impact.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Thank you much.", "Roy Templin", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Laura Champine with Morgan Keegan.", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your line is open. Hearing no response, we'll move on to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Good morning.", "Jeff Fettig", "Hi, Eric. Good morning.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "A couple of things, first of all, on Maytag, can you give us a sense of what the revenues are of that business on a year-over-year basis?", "Jeff Fettig", "Eric, no, we really don't break out specific brand financials, but I think you can kind of look at the past and see where it was on the old Maytag. It's proportionately close to being the same.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Okay. I guess asked differently, the Whirlpool, the legacy portfolio, can you talk about it? I mean when you look at the segment down 6% and the industry down 1% in units, I know that doesn't include price, was the difference of performance versus the industry, was Whirlpool in line with the industry or slightly worse than the industry? And then, the delta is Maytag? Is that the right way to think about the work?", "Jeff Fettig", "No. Eric, what we said was if you look at -- maybe, I'll give you two pictures. One, we've been growing Whirlpool brand share. Our premium brands, which we don't really look at as much on a market share basis as revenue, but our premium brands have been strong, which are Jenn-Air and KitchenAid.", "And if you look at the market share, year-over-year losses that we had, the predominant share loss came from OEM. The next biggest driver, as Mike explained, was from what we call our value brands, which are the more price-sensitive, lower end brands that we sell across different retailers across the country. Which for two reasons, one, that's part of the low-end market, the weakest part of the market.", "And, two, as we said, we have had a significant material cost effect on this, and we took price increases and we had market share losses. And then, the third contributor of that, year-over-year, was what we call, consider the transition share loss, we expected to have in Maytag as we retool the product lineup and get it redistributed and go through all the transitions. So, that's how I characterize our market share position quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year. Versus the first quarter, we made some marginal increases in market share.", "So, our view is, we bottomed out, really late last year in the first quarter, and now, we're kind of moving into the growth phase with our consumer brands.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Okay. And then, the traction, how would you characterize the traction? I know there have been a lot of significant Maytag new product introductions in the first half and in the second quarter? How is the traction and the progress on those, such as the Maytag, invested by progressing and some of the things you've done with Amana?", "Mike Todman", "Eric, we're actually feeling pretty good about where the Maytag brand is tracking and how it's going. As you know, we introduced the brand into Best Buy kind of in the second quarter, and what we're seeing through sales of that brand is we've had some very strong weeks in some of the key categories within Best Buy. And so, we think that that trend will continue. We expect that that brand will be fully forward by the end of July in Best Buy, and as that does, it is increasing the draw of consumers into Best Buy.", "So, we're feeling good about that, and we're actually seeing an increase in sales on the Amana brand. So, for both of the Maytag brands, as we look forward what we are seeing is fairly strong performance, and we think it will only continue into the third quarter as we begin to introduce new products.", "And one of the things I do want to make sure I note that is in Best Buy, we've had some of the top selling SKUs, have been the Maytag brand. So, we're feeling pretty good about the fact that with a very short introduction period, it's moving fairly well.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Secondly, with the upside in the synergies this year, I know you're not talking about 2008, but I'm wondering how does that impact 2008 and I guess, specifically, does that mean that you're just going to get more of what you were going to get in 2007 or will there be a meaningful incremental amount that comes in 2008? In other words, the increment that was expected to show up in 2008 does that show up in 2007 or is there a further meaningful chunk that shows up next year?", "Jeff Fettig", "I'd answer that to be both. We don't have any specific numbers on that, but one, we're getting the efficiencies faster, and two, we're getting more. But there will be a tail of this, obviously, in 2008. But I would caution on the other side. I don't want to let pass this very significant inflated material cost market. 2005 was the biggest increase we've ever seen in our history in material costs.", "And I think we came in at about $530 million, although that being without the Maytag business. This year, we're at $570 million. Our ability to offset that, we've demonstrated that. We continue to demonstrate that, and we're using all the different tools at our disposal to be able to do that. I think we feel very confident about the cost reductions and efficiencies that we can drive. The little bit of a wild card out there is what's going to happen to material prices.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "And then my last question, it sounds like your second half assumptions include a belief that this acceleration in demand in the market that we've seen in the last handful of weeks is going to continue. Can you just give us a little more color on what you're seeing and perhaps, even what you're seeing within mix in that as well, just that you're seeing the market pick up at this point in time?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yeah, Eric, I think that's a good point. Coming into this year, really late last year, Eric, everyone, including ourselves was concerned about a demand shock in the marketplace, and we saw it. We saw it in the fourth quarter.", "It accelerated and bottomed out in the first quarter. By the way, those were also the quarters we were going up against the toughest year-over-year comparisons. We expected, based on our forecasting of both the replacement market and the retail market and the contract market that the market would be down approximately 5%. That's basically, how it turned out.", "The housing market, we believe, is going to continue to be depressed at least through the middle of 2008, but I'd remind you that that's 20% of the market, and that we have proportionately a lower share of that market than we have in the traditional replacement market.", "So really, I would say the housing is coming in as we expected and we're seeing, what I would call is a typical replacement market that's starting to drive the growth. We're going against weak year-over-year numbers.", "So, in our forecast of minus two to three, that clearly implies we expect to see a couple of points of growth in the second half of the year. And basically, that's what, so far, we are pretty comfortable with what we've seen over the last several weeks that that's happened.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Laura Champine with Morgan Keegan.", "Laura Champine - Morgan Keegan", "Good morning. Am I live now?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yeah, Laura, we got you.", "Laura Champine - Morgan Keegan", "Great. Maytag, you mentioned that there might be some new product costs and some branding costs, and it seemed to imply they might be one time in nature. Combined with that pension curtailment charge, major your EBIT margins look a little lower in that business than they should.", "Is that true that some of those are one time, or do you think those are just ongoing brand building and product launch costs we need to expect?", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, the pension curtailment of approximately $14 million is you know I think you ought to consider it's non-run rate type of thing. The brand investments, I think the point we tried to make that relative to the first quarter, we had a fairly big increase.", "I don't think those should be viewed as abnormal. There are a lot of product introduction costs and floor display costs and so on. So a portion of those, I would say that you always have with new product introductions, but the brand investments and innovation investments you should not consider as one time.", "Laura Champine - Morgan Keegan", "And then, Jeff, just for clarity, was that $14 million or $0.14 a share on the pension curtailment?", "Roy Templin", "Laura, it actually equates back to about the same thing. It is and it's just slight under $14 million, and it's $0.14 a share on the quarter.", "Laura Champine - Morgan Keegan", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Citigroup.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Roy Templin", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "I guess at one level, thinking about share loss at legacy Maytag and on the low end, and maybe even OEM is not surprising. What I found a little bit interesting and surprising, though, is that price mix only up 1%, because those share loss dynamics seemed like they would argue for positive.", "Roy Templin", "Jeff, Jeff, we maybe ought to clarify that. The margin impact was about 1 point. The revenue impact was dramatically higher. In fact, we had the highest portfolio average selling price we have ever had in the second quarter.", "So it's more in the range of, I guess on the revenue side, it's probably close to the range of 5%.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Revenue price mix is 5% and how does that... ", "Jeff Fettig", "From a revenue standpoint, from a margin standpoint, Roy's comment, it was about a point.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Okay. And then is that also equal weighted between price and mix roughly?", "Roy Templin", "A little heavier mix than price.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Okay. And on pension, Roy, you mentioned cash contributions to pension this year. What's going on there? What did you do year-to-date and what do you expect for the year?", "Roy Templin", "Yes, Jeff, we had, actually it was just sub $30 million contribution that we made and actually it was in the first quarter of this year, compared to no contribution sort of year-to-date a year ago.", "And it was actually to one of the Maytag plans. We used part of the proceeds from the Hoover sale to fund one of the Maytag plans. I think, as you know, Jeff, we are sort of positioning ourselves at an enterprise level, getting ready for the Pension Protection Act, which kicks in the first of next year.", "So we did make a contribution. We took a tax deduction for it last year in 2006. But again, on a year-over-year comparable, there were no contributions this time a year ago.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Okay. And does the curtailment charge relate to Maytag?", "Roy Templin", "No, it does not. It's actually it's our Fort Smith operations in North America.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Okay. And could you just remind us what the Befiex was in Q2 last year?", "Roy Templin", "Q2 last year, Befiex was $12 million.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Okay. And just one final point, to be clear on the divestitures of the Maytag assets and other properties that's in your cash flow statement, do the gains or losses associated with that flow through the purchase accounting, or is that now going through the regular P&L?", "Roy Templin", "I'll answer your question in two parts, Jeff. First of all, again, all the adjacent business proceeds are on a separate line of the cash flow, because again, I don't want to make sure we don't have those confused with the other asset sales.", "And the second part of your question, though, is there is no gain or loss associated with those dispositions. That's all a part of purchase accounting and was adjusted through goodwill. So, again no P&L effect from the disposition of those businesses.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We'll take a follow up question from Michael Rehaut of J.P. Morgan. ", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks, a couple of quick questions. First, I was wondering if you could breakdown the material and oil-related costs? What the year-over-year delta was for 1Q and 2Q. And as far as the overall 570, you know, perhaps you can break it down, if possible, by like steel, energy, and other large items.", "Roy Templin", "Yeah, Mike. I don't think we can do exactly what you said, but let's give you two looks at it. In the 570 for the year, we've given you the first quarter and second quarter, if I add those right, I think it's $305 million so far this year.", "So, although we raised the forecasts and they are increasing, they will be proportionately lower in the second half than they were in the first half. That's one point. And as a percent of sales, given we have our higher sales base on a margin base, they'll be, although very impactive, they will be less impactive than they were in the first half.", "In terms of the makeup of our cost structure, and I think we've talked about this before, but our number one purchase is steel. Number two is plastics, resins, which are driven by oil. Number three, are logistics-related costs. And number four, because of the raised increases getting close to number three, are base metals.", "And I would just say that a couple of years ago, we had the big oil shock and that's kind of continued to ebb up. We had the big steel shock and that continues to largely be indexed to the market price.", "The huge increases have been in both the base metals and then the corresponding impact that that has had on the component prices. Many of our suppliers buy the same base metals, they've had the same shocks, so we are seeing increases in that area.", "So round numbers, I'd say about 20% of our challenge is in steel 35% to 40% in base metals. And the balance in large amount is in components.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "That's very helpful, I appreciate it the other question, just on the pension curtailment charge. You went into a little bit of detail there. What triggered that and is that something that we could see reoccur at all over the next year or so.", "Roy Templin", "No, Michael, there's no reoccurrence per se for that unit, again what happened was the union ratified a change from a defined benefit program to a defined contribution pension plan; you'll recall Michael we actually did this in a couple of our plans a couple of quarters ago.", "And what happens when we have a change like that is as you know the accounting rules have you smooth gains or losses into pension expense over appropriate periods of time; when we actually changed the plan in Fort Smith. We had unrecognized losses that we in essence accelerated into the second quarter results. And that's what triggered the reductions.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "All right, last question, thank you, I would like to get the discussion away from pension curtailments and Befiex credits and talk about the international business. Where you seem to be doing extremely well, there was a time I guess a number of years ago. Where people felt that the European business would reach some sort of a limit at around 8% operating margins because of the structural costs of doing business in Europe and so on and so forth.", "Can you talk just a little bit about the sustainability of the international results given raw material cost inflation, and I realize you'd indicated I think 75% was in North America. And maybe there's more to come in the international business, and also the extent to which you think Mike, that you could get beyond a 7% or 8% operating margin in Europe. And maybe get to higher ground than that.", "Mike Todman", "Yeah. David let me just first of all talk about the European business, I think, as you know over the course of the last several years. We have been putting in a very competitive both operating structure and platform. But at the same time introducing new products into the marketplace in that business, and that has really given us the opportunity to really have sustainable growth.", "And that's what's happened to that business over the long term, I think that the range that you are talking about in terms of operating earnings is absolutely a range that we feel very comfortable about. And I think that that business can achieve given all of the things that we have done over the past couple of years.", "And I would tell you that if you look at our businesses all across the world in the international frame. We have been able to do things to offset the material cost impacts, again we have been doing the same kind of introductions and innovations, product innovations with the brands that we have; we have our business in Brazil, is not only dependent on the growth of the marketplace, but also our position and our brand's position in the marketplace.", "And so we feel very good about the ability to sustain those growth levels, so I would tell you that, sure I do believe that this is very sustainable.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "I know that the North American consumer has been on a trend towards higher price point, more fully featured, more energy efficient appliances for the past five or six years. And it's shown up nicely in terms of your ASPs, I think you mentioned earlier this was the highest portfolio pricing quarter in the history of the firm.", "I'm just wondering to what extent in Europe you are seeing a cyclical recovery. But I wonder to what extent you're seeing in Europe the emergence of a secular trend. Somewhat similar to what's been unfolding in North America for five or six years; as consumers sort of come out of this longer term economic funk. And want to get caught up with where the Americans are with respect to energy efficiency and more fully featured...", "Mike Todman", "David directionally we see some more, perhaps not yet having the full magnitude that we have seen in the North American market yet. But directionally we see those same type of trends and I would also say in emerging markets, which does have albeit smaller. A fairly substantial household income base that mirrors the U.S. or Europe.", "We are also seeing small niche opportunities in those markets, so, but I think the key message here is where we bring meaningful, innovation to the marketplace. We have seen strong acceptance by consumers around the world, and if that means at a higher price.", "They see it as a value, they don't necessarily see it as a higher price because the performance or the feature or the design is something they value. And there's a lot of price elasticity in terms of what consumers are willing to pay.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Good, and then just final question, you talked earlier about price-based or commodity cost-based pricing initiative. However you termed it, but it's basically price increases. Can you talk a little bit about the posture of the North American retailer with respect to price increases; are they helping you on this? Do they push you back a little bit on this; to what extent are they helpful or not helpful in terms of achieving higher pricing?", "Mike Todman", "Well, David I'd just say that the North American retailer is no different than anywhere and what they want to do is be competitive in the marketplace; and so as long as we are providing them with competitive products and brands that consumers come in and buy.", "And they are able to earn the appropriate margins and have business then they support what needs to be done in the marketplace; and so what we are finding is working with them in that way. That we are able to deliver the right kind of -- pricing in the market.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "So you are saying with the innovation and everything else. You are getting retailer support for price increases?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes David we really. I don't want to get into much detail; I think Mike's general comment is how we view the marketplace. And it's a, as you know, it's a, it really depends on your level of competitiveness; and where we are competitive it's no issue if we have competitive issues, we have to address them.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay, thanks gentlemen.", "Jeff Fettig", "Okay. Well thank you everyone; thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you next time.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded.For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call overto the Vice President of Investor Relations, Larry Venturelli. Please go ahead.", "Larry Venturelli", "Thank you. \u00a0Good morning, and welcometo our third quarter earnings conference call. Our opening remarks will referto a slide presentation, which is available on our investor web page.

into a deeper look intowhat's driving the business in Latin America. \u00a0If you take a look at slide 25 you will seethat Latin America has been the fastest growingappliance region worldwide during the last five years.\u00a0 From 2002 to 2006, the region has had acompounded annual appliance growth rate of 13%, and we expect that number to beeven higher this year. \u00a0The economy of Brazil,which is our largest market in Latin America, has beenresilient and exhibits very strong fundamentals, and you can see that on slide26.", "What we\u2019re seeing, economically, in Brazil are low levels of inflation;declining consumer interest rates, significantly lower country debt and highlevels of international reserves, strong and growing GDP growth and improvingconsumer real income growth. \u00a0Theseeconomic conditions, combined with very low appliance penetration in many ofthe key product categories within this region, position us very well for growthfor the number of years ahead.", "On slide 28, you can see our brand position and leadership across theregion. \u00a0In Brazil,the Consul brand remains the number one appliance brand in the country, whilethe Brastemp brand is the leading premium appliance brand.\u00a0 The Brastemp brand is also the fifth mostwell-known top of mind consumer brand in Brazil,following great brands like Coca-Cola, Nestle and Nike.

increase of 18%, excluding the impact of currency salesincreased by about 7%, led by new successful product launches, as well asimproved mix and strong performance in India which is our largest market withinAsia.\u00a0 We had an operating loss of $5million in the region from the last year's level primarily due to increasedbrand investment and higher transition costs associated with new productlaunches. \u00a0You can see also, as you havein other regions, the innovations we are bringing to market on slides 31 to 33.\u00a0Based on the current conditions we seein Asia, we still expect to see robust growth in 2007 inthe 5% to 10% range.", "At this point in time, I will turn it over to Roy Templin.", "Roy Templin", "Thanks Jeff, and good morning, everyone.\u00a0Before I begin, and as

And you are saying there is notgoing to be any pension contributions.\u00a0 Inthe third quarter your share repurchase activity was roughly equal to your freecash flow generation. \u00a0Can we expect thatsort of ratio or activity on a go-forward basis; we're based on where the stockis?", "Roy Templin", "Sam, as you know, we don't comment on prospective share repurchases, I willsimply reiterate what Jeff said in his script and that is that we still have$214 million remaining open on our authorization, but again, as you know Sam,we don't forecast share repurchases.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Well, then directionally, how would you comment to the statement that itwould appear as though the best home for incremental cash flow at this pointmight be share repurchase vis-\u00e0-vis or in lieu of debt pay down? \u00a0Would you comment on that statement?", "Jeff Fettig", "Sam this is Jeff. \u00a0I would say we arecontinuing to execute to the priorities that we've established which was numberone; fund the business we are doing that, there's nothing new there. \u00a0Number two; pay down debt, we\u2019re on track todo that and we'll continue to do that. \u00a0Number three; return to shareholders throughthe share repurchase and those are the priorities we are executing with ourfree cash flow.", "Roy Templin", "Sam, as you know just to reiterate what Jeff said, I think our focus hasbeen and our commitment was to get our debt levels back to pre-acquisitionlevels. \u00a0We ended the third quarter, Samjust for your point of reverence, that debt EBITDA of 1.7. \u00a0As you know, our goal is to be 1 to 1.5, andwe would be within that goal by the end of the fourth quarter.", "Jeff Fettig", "For clarity.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Okay. Second question, this is more of a housekeeping thing. \u00a0In your earnings guidance for the year, arethere any, it doesn't appear as though at least in your cash flow guidance therewould be any subsequent asset sales, but would there be any P&L impact of aone time nature in the fourth quarter that you would anticipate at this point?", "Roy Templin", "Sam again, without going into the quarterly guidance, I'm not aware of anysignificant P&L or cash flow one time items from asset sales in fourthquarter, no.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Okay. Last question then I will defer to others. \u00a0As it stands right now if raw materialsremained at current levels or inputs remained at current prices. What does 08\u2019 looklike directionally versus 07\u2019 from a raw material inflation standpoint? \u00a0I mean you had rough $570 million in headwindsin 07\u2019. \u00a0Half that, three-quarters that,a third of that for next year? \u00a0If youcould directionally help us.", "Jeff Fettig", "If you just take the current prices today with commodities, spot market steel,etc., which obviously the way we buy new things will obviously haveopportunities across the business, but if you just take the markets as theyexist today, you would expect something about half of what you saw this year.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "And so would you anticipate then that the incremental Maytag efficiencies bealmost enough to offset that inflation that you are seeing at this point on 08\u2019versus 07\u2019?", "Jeff Fettig", "I guess, we are not really prepared to give any specific guidance about 08\u2019.And only thing I would say in the Maytag efficiencies is, as we ramp up our runrates this year, there will be residual effect next year.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Okay.

Your line is open.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning.\u00a0 Firstquestion is around the progress with Maytag in the new products. It'scertainly, as you spoke over a couple times during the summer, it was an areaof focus and benefit that you were looking for in the second half of the year. \u00a0During the prepared remarks, you talked a lotabout innovation in that area, particularly as it relates to 08\u2019, across theyear almost pretty evenly distributed, but I was wondering if you could help mewith where you are in 2H07. \u00a0It seemslike you continue to lose some market share, if you could kind of talk abouthow those new product launches in the back half of the year progressingrelative to your plans. \u00a0If perhaps theoverall market weakness and perhaps higher competitive backdrop, may haveaffected the smooth rollout and acceptance of those products?", "Mike Todman", "Sure, Mike. Let me comment on that. Actually, I would tell you that ourMaytag launches, our Maytag grand launches are going as we had planned, andessentially, we at the end of the third quarter, have introduced our new frontload washing machines in the Maytag brand that are very distinctive for thatbrand, so therefore different from what we've got out in the marketplace in theWhirlpool brand.", "We've introduced new dishwashers in the Maytag brand and so we arecontinuing to ramp our launch activity, and actually, if we look at the shareof the Maytag brands, year over year, we are about flat. So actually, what thatsays is we were beginning to recover and get to the kinds of growth levels thatwe expect to have for the Maytag brand. \u00a0Thatwill only be strengthened in 2008 as we continue to launch products.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "So in looking at the sales decline where within the North American segment;where did the share loss come from? \u00a0Andwhat do you think are the drivers to that perhaps if that would continue intothe fourth quarter or where do you see the weakness?", "Mike Todman", "Mike, there are really two areas. \u00a0Oneis our value brands and that's actually the biggest portion of the share loss,and I think I commented on the last call that we made some conscious decisionsto really exit some of the lower and unprofitable segments that our valuebrands were in. \u00a0", "And the other is the weakness of our OEM supplier, or our OEM product.\u00a0 And that's an area where we continue to workwith new products, new launches, to try to maintain their rate of sale. \u00a0I can tell you our balance of sale with themcontinues to be where it has always been, but that's obviously, an area that isalso challenged. \u00a0But the value brandsegment is really the largest portion, so we expect, fully expect from thefourth quarter to really regain market share in our key brands as we have beendoing all year with the Whirlpool brand.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "And lastly, in terms of, just two more real quick questions. In terms of theraw materials obviously, oil has gotten out of hand here in the last quarter, butI was wondering if you could kind of walk through the puts and takes and whyyou are still comfortable with the 570 in material inflation for the year?", "Mike Todman", "Well Michael, there clearly has been a lot of volatility and all across ofthe whole value chain. \u00a0The raw materialsstarting with, I would say, base metals, but also steel, also oil related whichaffects plastics, have had increases or dramatic increases throughout thecourse of the year. \u00a0I guess our comfortlevel is are almost at the end of the year.\u00a0So, we pretty much know what our costs are going be between now and theend of the year, but the volatility is high and some of these are going to fallover into 2008. \u00a0There, given the natureand the structure of many contracts, it\u2019s still too early to predict accuratelywhat 2008 will look like, but we feel very confident about what the balance ofthis year is going to look like.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks and one last question, I'm sorry. \u00a0The tax rate, clearly a big surprise duringthe quarter and as of the last conference call, you were talking about a mid 20\u2019srate for the full year which implied a thirtyish percent rate for the back halffor 3Q and 4Q.\u00a0 I was wondering, if youcould go through what drove that this quarter, and why you still expect a low20\u2019s tax rate. \u00a0What are the, I mean,there's just such a massive difference and I was wondering if you couldcomment, going forward on what your thoughts are for 08\u2019?", "Mike Todman", "Michael, let me talk a little bit about the tax rate. \u00a0First of all, a couple of reminders. \u00a0We, initially, at the end of the last calltold you our guidance for the year will be somewhere in the mid 20\u2019s. And as Isaid in my script, we now think that will be a low 20\u2019s, and that will compareto a rate a year ago at about 20% or 21%, as well, so just to sort of level setrates.\u00a0 ", "Let me talk specifically about the quarter, and let me go back to a coupleof things, Michael. \u00a0One, as you know andwe've talked about, I guess, probably over the last year on these calls is we'vebeen executing a tax strategy around the world in terms of making our overalltax liabilities more efficient with respect to our earnings around the globe.\u00a0 Our highest effective tax rate is in North America where we have about a 37% rate and then it goes down asyou walk around the world to the low point in Asia at23%. \u00a0So, part of what happened thisquarter was a dispersion piece and a dispersion component because as NorthAmerican and overall earnings go down, we actually benefit on the tax line, butthat was a small piece.", "The real happening in the quarter was that we had a deferred tax asset inour international business that we had fully reserved that based uponperformance in the operation and our tax strategy that we executed in thequarter, we took the benefit of that in the third quarter and that was about 15point reduction in the rate, Michael.", "Now, a little bit of reminder from an accounting perspective. \u00a0As you know, and FIN 48 clarifies, that as weexecute our tax strategy, those pieces and components that relate to currentyear operations flow through the rate as a blended component of our effectivetax rate for the year.\u00a0 However, thoseitems, like this deferred tax asset that we now recognize, that don't relate tocurrent year operations per se, all the benefits of those items are recognizedin the quarter in which that particular action is taken and so, the issue forthe third quarter or the result of the third quarter is that you had a bigbenefit 15 points from this tax strategy action. \u00a0You had some favorable dispersion, and then youhad a few points, Michael, that were simply a result of some other tax actionthat we've taken over the course of the year.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "I appreciate that detailed response. And its 15 points, what's that, I'msorry, in a dollar number?", "Mike Todman", "Well, I think the average dollar effect there is about $7 to $8 million. \u00a0Is that right?", "Jeff Fettig", "The total asset was $30 million. \u00a0Ithought you were asking in terms of the percentage point and impact on theeffective tax rate, Michael.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. That's the 15% as you said but the 30 is the dollar number.", "Jeff Fettig", "That's correct.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "We can go next to David MacGregor from Longbow Research. \u00a0Your line is open.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Good morning, guys.\u00a0 As we lookforward to 2008, obviously you\u2019ve got a lot of new product coming out under theMaytag brand. \u00a0Can you talk a little bitabout what commitments you may have received from retailers on increased salesfloor presence or sales floor square footage for the Maytag brand?\u00a0 And maybe in the context of providing thatanswer, you can also address investor concerns about potential losses to theWhirlpool floor space presence as a result of the Maytag gains.", "Jeff Fettig", "Yeah, David, let me address that. \u00a0Whatwe have done is we've taken out some of these new Maytag brand innovations. \u00a0Frankly, this is what we are getting fromretailers is a very positive response and this is not about replacing any ofthe Whirlpool brand product, that\u2019s currently on the floor, it's reallyexpanding their floors with new Maytag brand innovation. \u00a0As we've talked about, I think many times, itis a very different consumer and I think our retailers understand that thereare different consumers that are buying the Maytag brand, that aren\u2019t buyingthe Whirlpool brand and what we have made a very conscious decision is toensure that these products are very differentiated. \u00a0So, walking on the floor, frankly, youwouldn't be able to tell that it comes from the same manufacturer because theyare different. \u00a0They are attackingdifferent segments and not only how we're positioning them, but frankly, thefeatures and so on that the brands have are different from one to the other.\u00a0 So, we are actually feeling very good aboutwhere retailers are the commitments that they are making and, frankly, thefloor space that both brands will occupy.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "And, there is still one retailer that is conspicuously absence from yourdistribution neutrality, any thoughts on where that may be going?", "Jeff Fettig", "You need to help me, David.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Home Depot.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, I think, we feel very good about what this Maytag brand can do to helpHome Depot and their appliance business. \u00a0I would leave it at that. \u00a0They are welcoming the new innovation and Ifeel good about where we\u2019re positioned.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Yeah. I guess, I was referring with respect of the Whirlpool brand and abroader brand offering for that retailer.", "Jeff Fettig", "I really at this point, really don't have any other comment to make, David.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay. Can you talk a little bit about the value brand demise? \u00a0You said that you consciously walked away fromsome business and you're probably to be congratulated for that but can youquantify, how the value brands were down year over year, so that we can excludethat from the net number?", "Jeff Fettig", "It was slightly over two points David, if you are talking specifically aboutmarket share. \u00a0And again, that'ssomething that we consciously made some decisions, just kind of given wherethose value brands were performing.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay and what is the risk to the current levels of profitability in Latin America for 2008?", "Jeff Fettig", "David, we are very positive, as I described in some of the slides that weput in there. \u00a0We are very positive aboutthe economic environment of Latin America. \u00a0It's as structural and strong, as we have everseen over any period.\u00a0 I think there is alot of historical concern appropriately so for the historical ups and downsthat you would see in those markets. \u00a0But, I really think particularly Brazil,but also a number of other markets are going through some very fundamentalstructural changes, so, I would just say from an economic and growthstandpoint, we are rather bullish about the Latin Americamarket over the next two to four years.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "You see the developments are sustainable for at least the next 12, 18months?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, we do.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay, that's fantastic. \u00a0And then,last question, just globally, is there still a move to low cost geography storyhere?", "Jeff Fettig", "David, not necessarily for us. \u00a0Thereis of number of elements across the supply chain that as we will look at ourfactories, we have slightly over 40 factories around the world and our view isevery factory has to be best cost, best quality, best availability for theproducts they produce for the market they serve. That has changed and therewill continue to be some change with certain products at certain times.", "But also, our component and material supply chain continues to change, ourmanufacturing evolves, but I don't think, we feel pretty good about where weare. \u00a0There will be changes over time aswe make new investments, but our need; we don't have a huge need to shipproduction to LCCs because they aren't necessarily the best cost countrydepending on what product and what market you sell to.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from the site of Laura Champine from MorganKeegan. Your line is open.", "[Ike Borcia] - Morgan Keegan", "Hi. Good morning. This is actually [Ike Borcia] calling in for Laura todaywho is traveling.", "[Ike Borcia] - Morgan Keegan", "My question is, what can you do to improve the U.S. OEM business and how canyou reduce your exposure to that business?", "Jeff Fettig", "Let me maybe address that. \u00a0I think,first of all what we do and what we will continue to do is ensure that weprovide them with the series with the right kind of product innovations thatsupport their overall business and then work with them to ensure that consumersknow and want to shop in that environment but, I will tell you the other thingthat we need to do and we are doing is leveraging all of our brands in ourbrand portfolio.\u00a0 Essentially, that meansthat we are bringing on innovation in the Whirlpool brand, bringing oninnovation in the Maytag brand, continuing to support our premium brands in KitchenAid and Jenn-Air, and I think if we continue to do those things, in fact, nomatter where consumers decide to shop, our brands will be available for thoseconsumers, and that's essentially what\u2019s our approach and the strategy is.", "[Ike Borcia] - Morgan Keegan", "Do you feel you're maintaining share within the OEM business?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, we were.", "[Ike Borcia] - Morgan Keegan", "Okay. And last question on what should we expect in terms of year endinventory levels?", "Roy Templin", "Well Ike, this is Roy. \u00a0We don't talk specifically about inventory perse, but we have said, and we remain committed to ending the year with workingcapital below where we ended the year last year.\u00a0 Point of reference, I think, we ended theyear last year at 11% the assumption that you are probably going to make, andit would be a fair one, is that in most of the reduction from where we aretoday to where we will be by the end of the year will be a result of lowerinventory levels.", "[Ike Borcia] - Morgan Keegan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Roy Templin", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next, the site of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your lineis open. ", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "Thanks. Good morning.\u00a0 A couple ofpretty simple questions. \u00a0First of all,within the North American business, I think you indicated total North Americanrevenues were down 8%. \u00a0Can you give us asense of what the difference was between the legacy Maytag side of the businessand the Whirlpool side of the business versus that 8% number?", "Jeff Fettig", "Eric, no we are really not splitting those businesses up. \u00a0I mean really, as we progressed through thisyear, it's more and more difficult to assess that, so we don't break thatinformation out.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "Okay, is there a sense at all, of which is performing better and which isperforming worse?", "Jeff Fettig", "Not well, but think about it this way, our premium brands Kitchen Aid andJenn-Air are performing fine. \u00a0Mike hadsaid that Maytag brand if you will, that\u2019s Maytag, Amana and Jenn-Air, in thethird quarter were flat year over year, so, we have had three quarter orwhatever decline and we are now calendaring that and we are now flat, and weexpect that to improve and grow in the fourth quarter and beyond and theWhirlpool brand has been growing share although all during this period of time.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "Okay, so the share erosion then is centrally focused on the value brands?", "Jeff Fettig", "Well number one, its value brands, number two is our OEM business. \u00a0For the quarter, that's what it is. For theyear, yes, our Maytag brands prior to the third quarter were down year over year,but they were the smallest of the three contributors.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "That's great. And secondly, within the North American profit in the quarter,I think the reported profit was $132 million, and it sounded like the net costsavings were around $113 million.\u00a0 And Iguess I would love to get a little bit better understanding of how the NorthAmerican profit ended at such a level that was somewhat well below what I hadexpected, and what the prior trend had been, and looking to the fourth quarterclearly what you are assuming takes place in the fourth quarter. \u00a0So, can you just help understand thecomponents that drove the magnitude of the shortfall within the North Americanprofit especially when understanding how big the cost savings were?", "Roy Templin", "Eric, why don't I start with the components and sort of give you themathematics of what happens year over year in the quarter for North America,and then Mike can talk a little bit about the composition of those and thefourth quarter piece, the second part of your question.", "The biggest piece by far, Eric, in North Americaresults continues to be material cost. \u00a0Ithink Jeff said this in his script, if you look at materials year to date, up$455 million, 70% of that increase is in the North American business.\u00a0 Year over year, Eric that lowered theirmargins by about 3.5 points. \u00a0And again,that by far was the biggest piece of the reduction year over year.", "The second piece is we also had a little over a point of lower price mix whenyou look at price mix year over year in the North American operations and thosewere offset by two elements. \u00a0The firstone is productivity, which was about a point better. \u00a0Again, when you look year over year and thenthe Maytag efficiencies and your numbers are very close. \u00a0Maytag efficiencies was about 3% improvementwhen you look at Q3 this year versus Q3 last year. \u00a0So, you got five negative and four positivethere, Eric, in terms of the key components.", "Mike Todman", "You know, Eric, maybe what I can do is also give a little bit of perspectivethen on the other part of your question, which is going into the fourthquarter, and why we feel good about improving our margins in the fourthquarter.", "First of all, we have talked about a slightly increased industry demand, andthat will have a positive impact. \u00a0Secondly,just seasonality and the kind of the seasonality of our business and we feelgood about that, but I would say, most importantly, these products that we\u2019velaunched that did cost us some transition in the third quarter, we feel verygood about how they are ramping up, how they are getting on the floors and,frankly, early indications of the sell through in the fourth quarter and thoseproducts are at, largely, at the higher end and so, we see a positive marginmix coming from those products. \u00a0So, a combinationof all those things, and, I guess, the last item is in the fourth quarter, youactually get a more positive impact from productivity so although materialcosts will continue, we will also get more productivity in the fourth quarter. \u00a0So, those are really the drivers to ourconfidence that we will improve our margins in the fourth quarter.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "It was the price mix assumption, which I'm kind of surprised it was negativewhen considering you mixed out of a lot of value brands. \u00a0Is the price mix assumption turn into afavorable one in the fourth quarter and why?", "Mike Todman", "Yes. We do expect it to turn favorable in the fourth quarter. And a littlebit of what I've just stated is what we see is, we are seeing with the productsthat we've launched an improvement in our overall mix. \u00a0\u00a0We have to bear the cost of kind of thattransition as we came out of the third quarter, and that actually deterioratedsome of our mix.", "And then secondly, last year at this time, we actually had a price increaseso; we had a slightly negative impact as we get into this third quarter. \u00a0We feel very good about kind of how we werecoming out of this quarter.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "And then lastly, within Europe, when you strip awaythe gains, it appears that the underlying operating margin contracted 30 basispoints year over year. Can you talk about if anything is changing materiallywithin the profit or momentum of the European market and business?", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, yes, Eric, you may be right. \u00a0It's basically the margins pulling that outwere flatter, within a tenth of each other. \u00a0So, I view them basically as flat and givenmaterials have hit there too; we had about $30 million quarter over quartermaterial increase in Europe in the third quarter. \u00a0Given the way European production works, July,August holidays, and then September is the primary production month, that isnot a very good productivity quarter normally for us, anyway.\u00a0 So, actually we thought pretty good about theEuropean performance, and expect that our productivity will catch up withmaterial costs in the fourth quarter, and we'll see margin expansion in thefourth quarter.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "And then just one last question, the SG&A looks like it was down about$50 million year over year. \u00a0I don't knowif there are some other gains that show up in that, but is there a simpleanswer for the big improvement in SG&A year over year in the quarter thatwas different than what we saw in the first half?", "Jeff Fettig", "I think that the simple answer, Eric, is there are two pieces. \u00a0One is the Maytag efficiencies, and that'sabout seven tenths of a point reduction when you look year over year. \u00a0The second key item, and you askedspecifically about any of the one time gains or losses, the non income basedtax credit that we had, the $12 million, was in fact in SG&A and that wasabout three tenths of a point. \u00a0And thenthere are two other feature is that there are sort of offsetting. One iscontinued increase in brand investments offset by cost controls throughout thebusiness.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "Thank you, very much.", "Operator", "We have time for one further question. \u00a0And we\u2019ll go to Jeff Sprague from CitigroupInvestment Research. \u00a0Your line is open.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Thank you. Good morning.\u00a0 Could wejust drill for a minute on this price mix question? \u00a0It is surprising, as the prior questioner saidthat the price mix is negative one, if you moved out of these value brands andparticularly, just going back to my notes, price mix was positive five in Q2. \u00a0I'm just wondering if you get just aggregatethat a little bit for us. \u00a0Is the mixactually positive and prices down a couple of points here?", "Roy Templin", "Yes. Jeff, first of all, for clarity on price mix, that the price mixresponse was, Eric had asked about margins. \u00a0So, I want to clarify, first of all, thatprice mix and again that was relative to North America. \u00a0If you look at total business, it was about sixto seven tenths of a point on total margins.\u00a0Price mix from a top line perspective was actually favorable. \u00a0If you do the math on unit\u2019s reductions, weended with basically flat sales. \u00a0We hadabout 3.5 points of currency improvement and about a point of favorable pricemix in the top line so; I want to be clear on that point.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Okay. And that's the total Whirlpool number, one point, or that's a NorthAmerican number?", "Roy Templin", "That is a total Whirlpool number.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "And could you give us North America?", "Roy Templin", "Yes. North America was actually favorable by 1.5points.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "And then if I could come back to this tax, Roy,I'm a little bit confused here still. If I think about the $30 million numberyou gave us and gross up the year to date for that that would imply your yearto date tax rate is 19%. \u00a0I would thinkbased on what you said, that would be then your target full year tax rate wouldbe something like 19%.", "Roy Templin", "Yes, Jeff, first of all, I mean, without having precision here, the fullyear tax rate, as I said in my script is in the low 20\u2019s. \u00a0I think part of the difference in your math iswe talked specifically about dispersion; we talked specifically about thisrecognition of a deferred tax asset.\u00a0 They\u2019reobviously a number of other components going throughout the tax rate, some ofwhich get annualized as part of the operations and some of which were discreetyear to date. \u00a0But net net, if you wouldfactor in a couple of the other discreet items that we had in the quarter, youwould end up with a rate in the low 20\u2019s versus your 19%.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "All right. And then the $12 million tax item you are talking about is that [Inaudible]or is that something else? \u00a0And if it'snot [inaudible] it could you give us the [inaudible] number?", "Roy Templin", "Sure. \u00a0First of all, it's not [inaudible].\u00a0It's actually a social tax credit. \u00a0Again, it came through SG&A, [inaudible],Jeff, was $25 million for the quarter versus $17 million a year ago Q3.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "And, I guess this question of North American margins has been asked a coupleof times, but maybe again just to try to think about framing what's changed. \u00a0Although these raw materials costs areobviously very onerous, I don't think your raw material headwind guidance hasactually changed for the year.\u00a0 So onroughly flat sequential sales, you do have a pretty meaningful drop in NorthAmerican operating profit. \u00a0It soundslike we are getting this isolated down to promotion primarily is what I\u2019ve havebeen able to glean so far, but how else would you characterize that? \u00a0If we think about raw mat guidance hasn'tchanged, revenues are roughly flat, price mix is actually positive, is it allpromotion?", "Roy Templin", "First of all our revenues were lower than we had expected. \u00a0We reduced production so there is a volumeloss in this. \u00a0What Mike, had describedis we did have higher than normal and fairly substantial new productintroduction cost during the quarter and there is promotional expenseassociated with that in the quarter.\u00a0 Whenyou add that up, on top of that, raw materials were higher during the quartereven though our 570 didn't change for the year, they were higher during thequarter. \u00a0The flip of that is we thinkthey will be lower in the fourth quarter.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Okay. And I guess just last question, any change in the way you guysnegotiate raw mats? \u00a0I think you had amix of annual contracts and spot and just giving us volatility and pressureover the last couple of years. Is anything changing in the way you try that setand determine your costs?", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, Jeff, as you know in that market, frankly speaking, the way contractsare done today, it's changing all the time and it's basically moved to a muchshorter time frame or an index. \u00a0So thereis inherently, I think, for most people who buy these types of products, morevolatility and less long term contracts. \u00a0And that's what we are seeing in our business,as well.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you. \u00a0Well, listen, everyone.Again, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to younext time.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's teleconference.

As I am sure you have seen earlier thismorning, we did release our financial results for both fourth quarter and thefull year.", "Overall in 2007, we deliveredboth record sales and earning per share and what was as we discussed throughoutlast year, a very challenging global economic environment. The two majorchallenges that we faced all during the year, first the US appliancedemand, where we saw year-over-year demand decline by almost 6%, which was thelargest decline we have seen in over two decades.", "And secondly, we hadapproximately $600 million in higher material and oil-related costs. In factduring the last three and half years, we continued to see unprecedentedmaterial cost inflation, which has increased our input costs since 2004 bynearly $2 billion. ", "During 2007, we did accomplish avery major milestone by completing the Maytag integration. We achieved our costefficiency goals one full year ahead of our plans, when we first announcedthis.", "We also improved our costproductivity performance across the globe and generated more than $2.5 billionof revenue from our innovation pipeline. So, overall we are pleased with our2007 results particularly given these economic challenges that have taken place.", "I will now turn to the slidepresentation, starting with slide 4.  Whereyou will see that our annual revenues increased 7% to $19.4 billion, ourearnings from continuing operations came in at $8.10 per share, which was up28% over 2006. And as we have seen over the last several years one of the keydrivers of our financial performance and revenue growth has been our ability togenerate higher average -- global average selling prices, which you can see onslide 5.", "During 2007, our ASV is increasedby more than 7%. As I mentioned we delivered over $2.5 billion in revenues fromprojects, which came out of our innovation pipeline. As we exit 2007 ourpipeline remains very strong and we estimate we have now about $4.5 billion ofnew product revenues from projects and we anticipate continued innovationdriven growth as we go forward.", "These innovations continue notonly to fuel our growth, but also improve our overall margins. So, we are verypositive about our new products come in to market early 2008, especially on newMaytag launches, which Mike Todman will talk about in a moment.", "Turning to our balance sheet, wehave made great progress in strengthening our overall balance sheet and reducedour debt by $243 million during 2007. We also returned $502 million to ourshareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "On slide 6, we list the majortrends, which we expect to see in 2008 and these are the foundation for the keyassumptions, which we build into our plans and guidance. First, as we have seenthroughout 2007, we expect to see genuine weak and negative demand in our largemature economies that are the United Statesand Europe.", "We expect continued strong demandin our key emerging markets like Latin America, Indiaand China.We will see increases in continuing material commodity inflation and finally wecontinue to expect volatility in movement in our global currency markets.", "Given this economic backdrop, asseen on slide 7, we believe we are in position to continue our strongperformance in this economic environment 2008. We have been successful innavigating through some of the issues due to several key durables, which Iwould like to mention.", "First of all our business is verygeographically diverse. Currently, about almost 50% of our revenues comeoutside the United States.Our International markets were experiencing higher growth rates and expandingprofit margins, which is helping to mitigate a weaker US market.", "Secondly, we have industryleading, global consumer brands in most major markets around the world, andthey continue to increase consumer investments and a very strong cadence ofinnovation.", "The third reason is our globalcost platform and steel is unmatched in the appliance industry. And we believewe have very significant opportunity to generate continued productivitythroughout our global supply chain and infrastructure. And finally I would saythat, we feel very good. We have an experienced global management team in placethat have successfully managed conditions before and we expect that tocontinue.", "So, looking ahead to 2008, whichis shown on slide 8, we expect to see the front there; the details of ourestimates are the following. First of all we expect the US market will declinein 2008 from 3% to 5%, we will go through the details about that later. Weexpect our International businesses in total that continue to grow withpositive demand trends. In Latin America and Asiawe expect to see industry demand in the 5% to 8% range and 5% to 10% rangerespectively. While in Europe, we expectoverall demand to be flat versus 2007.", "The general trends that we haveseen in the last several months continue to point towards negative industrydemand trends in the United Statesand Europe. As such, we expect those marketswill be down more in the first half of the year with moderate recovery ingrowth in the later part of the year. Turning to our input cost, we estimatematerial all related cost will increase by approximately $350 million in 2008.", "Turning down to slide 9, whichreflects and lists our priorities for the year. We plan to offset both weakindustry demand and higher material and oil-related cost by  leveraging our strong portfolio of brands andbuilding on the positive market share momentum, which we saw in the latter halfof 2007.", "Our plans include significantlyhigher investments in innovation and advertising. We expect 2008 will be ourone of our strongest years ever for new product launches, which adds to alreadystrong consumer brand preference for our key brands. Secondly we will deliveragain very strong consumer brand preference for our key brands. Secondly, wewill deliver again very strong global productivity as we continue0 to optimizesteel and the efficiency of our global operating platform.", "The third area, which I wouldmention, which is consistent with recent announcement that we have made, whichincludes the closure of LaVergne, Tennessee facility, Reynosa, Mexico and Newton,Iowa in North America. Wecontinue to adjust our cost structure and capacity to efficiently address thecurrent demand environment that we are seeing going forward. All thesedecisions always are difficult, optimizing our operating platform is criticalto ensuring our cost leadership position that we currently enjoy.", "And finally in response to thecontinued material and oil-related costs environment we have announced in orimplemented cost-based price adjustments in most major markets around theworld. Given the unprecedented materials inflations we have seen over the lastthree and half years, now going into the fourth year, we have taken theposition that current inflation and costs must be passed through the marketplace and that is the plan that we are executing today.", "So as we step back and put allthis together, I would summarize our expectations and our 2008 performances asfollows: We expect moderate revenue growth, we expect material cost increases,higher restructuring cost and increased brand investments will negativelyimpact our margins by a little over two points, which we expect to more thanoffset through very strong productivity, the benefits of the reduction in ourcost structure from the announced manufacturing changes we have already made,positive brand and product mix driven by our innovation and cost-based priceadjustments.", "The successful execution of ourplans will lead to a positive revenue growth, improved profitability andimproved free cash flow. With that for 2008, we are giving our first guidance,which were we stated that we expect our earnings per share to be in the $8.50to $9 per share range and free cash flow to be between $600 and $650 million.", "With that I'll now turn the callover to Mike Todman to discuss our North Americabusiness. ", "Mike Todman", "", "Thanks, Jeff and good morningeveryone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North American performanceduring 2007. Clearly as Jeff mentioned, 2007 was a challenging year for our USbusiness. We completed the integration of the largest acquisition of companyhistory, faced the toughest appliance demand environment in 25 years andabsorbed significantly higher material and oil-related costs.", "Despite these challenges, weexited the year with fourth quarter results, which included operating profit of$175 million,  representing a 41%improvement over 2006 and our operating profit margin increased 1.7 points fromthe prior year. Our market share improved significantly from third quarterlevels in all of our branded products, especially Maytag, increased share fromthe last quarter.", "Our fourth quarter resultsbenefited from strong acquisition, efficiency realization, improved product mixand productivity improvements. Results were partially offset by significantlyhigher material and oil-related cost and lower industry demand. Overall ourfourth quarter industry appliance demand was down approximately 6%, however,our North American sales declined by only 1%.", "Our performance compared to theindustry was positively impacted by a favorable product mix. Before providingour outlook on 2008, given the current demand environment, I would like toprovide a little background on the US appliance industry and thefactors which impact demand.", "As you can see on slide 13, itshows the progression of new housing related demand in United States. You can see over thepast three decades, new housing construction continues to decline as thepercentage of overall appliance demand. During the 1980s, new housingconstruction represented approximately one quarter of all major appliancedemand. Since the 80s new housing -- the new housing portions of the industrydemand has consistently declined, and now stand at approximately 15%. In factsince 1980 the other components of US T7 appliance industry demand such as replacementand discretionary have grown at a compound annual rate of about 3%. This is anotable trend as we look to the future.", "On slide 14, you will note thatduring 2007 the combination of new and existing home sales representapproximately 30% of total appliance industry demand. More importantlyreplacement demand represents just under 50% of US demand with the balance of themarket tie to discretionary purchases which tend to increase with consumerconfidence and the strength of new market place innovation. Turing to ouroutlook, we are forecasting USindustry demand to decline by 3 to 5 percentage points in 2008.", "On slide 15, we have broken upthe components and our assumptions for 2008 US industry demand. First,replacement demand consistently added 1% to 2% to industry growth each year forthe past three decades, and we fully expect this trend to continue in 2008.Many of these purchases are related to the replacement of units that consumersare either unable to find or are uneconomical to repair.", "Our forecast calls for the newhousing demand to reduce industry growth by 3 points in 2008 based upon a 20%decline in new home completion and approximately 25% decline in new housingstart. We also expect the existing home component of demand to reduce industrygrowth by about 2 percentage points.", "This expectation is based on a13% decline in existing home sales. Historically a 6% change in new homecompletions or existing home sales is translated into a 1% decline in theindustry demand. The purely discretionary component of demand is expected toreduce industry volume by about one point.", "Based on these current estimatesof the key economic variables, which impact the US appliance industry, as I statedbefore, we believe that the industry will decline approximately 3% to 5% in2008. The current outlook points to a more challenging environment during thefirst half of the year.", "Given the challenging demandenvironment, our 2008 priorities are as follows: One accelerating growth of theMaytag brands, two successfully launching new product innovations supported bybrand investments, three offsetting material and oil-related costs tocost-based price increases and strong productivity and four cost structurechanges to balance production and demand.", "I will now briefly touch onthese. As you recall, as shown on slide 17, our initial plan for Maytag isfirst to complete the integration and improve the businesses cost structure. Wehave fully completed this phase of our plans.", "During 2007, we began positioningMaytag to grow. As I mentioned earlier, we had positive share trends exiting2007. We are now in the growth place of our clients. An example of this isshown on slide 18, in which we illustrate our brand revitalization for thefront-load laundry category. As you can see, 2008 provides significantly moreinnovation across more price points than Maytag has ever had historically, andwe are supporting this and other launches with significant consumeradvertising.", "Two, we are accelerating newproduct innovations for all of our other brands and continue to grow our brandsthrough new product introductions. Throughout the year, we will introduce arecord level of innovations shown on slide 19, under our leading brand names,including 72 new product launches. These launches will be supported withsignificant consumer brand investments throughout the year.", "Three, our North Americanoperations will continue to introduce cost based price increases and deliverstrong productivity to offset material and oil-related related cost increases.And finally four, as recently announced we will make appropriate cost structurechanges, to better balance production-in-demand, as we continue to drive costproductivity throughout the organization.", "With that I will now turn the callback over to Jeff for his comments about our international operation.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thanks Mike. During 2007 ourinternational operations delivered another year of record revenue growth andoperating profits. For the full year revenues grew by 19% and our operatingmargin expanded by 2.3 points.", "Slide 22 shows the revenue growthand profitability trends of our international businesses since 2004. And youwill know that all three regions have shown strong revenue growth, combinedwith significant operating profit expansion, over the last three years, andthat would more than double the operating profit margin from approximately 4%in 2004 to nearly 9% this year.", "Our international growthopportunities remain very significant. Our results increasingly show that weare successfully growing our innovative consumer products and brands throughoutthe world. For our European business, which is shown on slide 23, we delivereda record full year and fourth quarter revenue and operating profit. Revenuesfor the quarter reached $1.1 billion, increasing 12% from the prior year, localcurrency revenues were approximately unchanged.", "Industry unit shipments for theregion declined 1% year-over-year during the fourth quarter. Our improvement[rather] in the industry is led by the region's top selling Whirlpool brandcombined with the new innovative product offerings that we brought out duringthe latter part of last year.", "Record fourth quarter operatingprofit totaled $73 million, increasing 22% from last year and we hope theresults reflect improved product mix and productivity. Partially offsetting theimproved operating profit performance was significantly higher material coststhat we saw year-over-year during the quarter.", "In Europe,our innovation cadence remains very strong and we continue to leverage ourglobal operating platform and our global innovation pipeline.", "On slide 24, I'll turn to Latin America business, where we also reported recordfull year and fourth quarter revenue in operating profits. Revenue increased30% to $1 billion during the quarter, excluding the impact from currency, salesincreased by approximately 12%.", "Industry unit shipments ofappliances in the region grew by about 11% during the quarter. And for the fullyear, our shipments exceeded industry growth.", "Operating profit increased 73% tothe all-time quarterly record of $156 million during the quarter and marginsexpanded to almost 15% from the 11.2% reported last year.", "Increased unit shipment, improvedpricing, strong productivity and an asset sell gain of $50 million were allpositive factors during the quarter. Results were mainly affected by highermaterial costs.", "Our results in Latin America doreflect the strong market conditions throughout the region, but alsoimportantly our very strong consumer brand position, which has been supportedby innovation and a very advantageous cost structure. Latin America, as we've communicated in the past, has been the fastestgrowing appliance region worldwide during the last five years, averaging about13% annual growth. These strong economic fundamentals, combined with lowappliance penetration in many of our key product categories within Latin America, bode well for what we expect to be strongfuture growth.", "As we know, we hold by far thenumber one consumer position throughout the region, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. We are rapidly growingour positions throughout all 32 Latin American markets. Today Brazil represents 60% of our LatinAmerican revenues, with the rest of the market also growing very rapidly, whichprovides us with very balanced portfolio of markets, throughout the region.", "Our Asiaregion, which is shown on slide 25, reported quarterly sales of $155 million,which were up 26% from the previous year. Excluding currency, sales increasedby approximately 13%. And this was driven by our successful new innovationlaunches and improved mix within India, which is our fastest growingmarket in the region. We reported a $4 million operating loss during thequarter, as we continue to make significant growth investments particularly in India and China. Overall our presence in Asia continues to grow. We are leader among westernbrands in China.We hold a very strong number two position in India.", "In 2008, we expect also to see arecord level international innovation in the market place. As you can see, justa sampling of this on the slide 26, throughout the international market, we'lllaunch 174 new products under our leading consumer preferred brand names. Theglobal leverage from our innovation pipeline continues to accelerate ourability, to bring great new product innovations to all of our global consumers,faster, better and with less overall investment.", "Now for the outlook, let me turnto slide 27. In Europe, we expect industryvolume levels to be flat with 2007. We are seeing some industry softness withinWestern Europe markets, as a result ofdeclining consumer comp. However, emerging Eastern European market, continues toremain positive and should somewhat mitigate negative industry trends in themore mature market. And as we've have seen in North America the near termconditions appear to be more challenging, as such we do expect to see declinesin the first part of the year, offset by moderate improvement later in theyear.", "Turning to Latin America. Based on our current economic outlooks, we anticipate forthe entire region, industry volume growth in the range of 5% to 8%. The LatinAmerican economies remain strong and our position in the market is verybalanced and strong throughout.", "In Asia,we anticipate continued growth in the 5% to 10% ranges. As our India and China operations continue to extendour reach and product offerings. We do expect for all of our internationalbusinesses to have higher material and oil cost during 2008. And here too we'veimplemented cost based price increases in selective markets. We expect costproductivity and the impact of new innovative product offerings to offset thesehigher input costs.", "Overall, I think it we are verywell positioned to continue to deliver improved results in our internationalbusinesses in 2008. And at this time I'm going to turn it over to Roy Templin.", "Roy Templin", "", "Thank you, Jeff, and good morningeveryone. And for those who know me I apologize I am fighting a cold, so I amgoing to try real hard to project as well as I can over the phone this morning.Before I begin, and as a reminder during the first quarter of 2007 the companyadopted changes to its segment reporting, consistent with realignments made toour regional business operations.", "Regional results for 2006 havebeen reclassified to reflect these changes and are shown on slide 40. Beginningon slides 29 and 30, I will walk you through a summary of our fourth quarterperformance. During the quarter, we reported revenues of $5.3 billion, up 7%from the prior year, primarily driven by strong international performance andfavorable exchange rates.", "Our fourth quarter result alsoreflects strong operating profit margin improvement, compared with the prioryear. Our gross margin expanded 1.7 points to 15.7% for the quarter. Theimprovement in gross margin primarily resulted from strong productivity andMaytag efficiency gains, which combined added 3.5 points to our marginimprovements. While positive price mix contributed just south of 0.5 point.", "Partially offsetting these gainswere increased material and oil-related cost, which resulted in approximately$130 million or about 2.5 points in margin reduction.", "We also improved SG&A as apercentage of sales by over a 0.5 point during the quarter, primarily due toMaytag efficiency realization and cost control. As a result of the items I justdiscussed, operating profit increased 74% during the quarter and thecorresponding margin expanded 2.4 points to 6.2%.", "This operating profit marginmarked the highest level post Maytag acquisition in the face of significant USmacro economic challenges, as well as significant material and oil-related costinflation.", "As for Maytag, as you'll recallour original goal was to achieve $400 million in acquisition relatedefficiencies by 2008. We have both exceeded that goal and completed theintegration ahead of plan. We realized $180 million in efficiencies in thefourth quarter and $460 million for the full year 2007. With the integration nowbehind us we will no longer breakout Maytag's specific efficiencies. Furtheroptimization of the remaining Maytag infrastructure will be included in ournormal productivity initiatives.", "Turning back to our fourthquarter results, I would like to highlight two discreet items included withinour financials. First, we sold an idle International facility, which resultedin a pre-tax gain of approximately $15 million. This gain is included withinour Latin America operating profit. As part ofour global operating platform optimization, we continuously evaluate ourexisting asset base.", "We have migrated production overtime to what we do refer to as best cost locations and as a result somefacilities have become idle and eventually monetized. As you know, each year weincur structuring expenditures and monetizing idle facilities has helped tooffset a portion of these cost.", "You will note on slide 31, thatwe experienced a larger year-over-year increase within interest and sundryexpense during the quarter. The main component of our higher expense reflectsan increase for legal reserves of approximately $17 million. We also incurredhigher non-income based taxes during the quarter.", "Moving to our tax rate, we havereported an effective tax rate of 16% for the quarter, which was well above theprior year's rate of a 2% credit. The increase in rate compared with the prioryear is mainly due to two discreet items recorded in the prior year pertainingto global audit settlements and legislative changes.", "Our full year effective tax ratewas 14.5% and was better than our previous expectations due primarily to therecognition of certain tax planning benefits that were triggered by foreignlegislative changes and regulatory approvals.", "In addition, given the markettrends in the quarter, the rate benefited from higher earnings in foreignoperations, which have a lower overall effective tax rate relative to ourdomestic operations. Going forward into 2008, we expect our effective tax rateto be in the mid 20% range.", "Finally, we incurred operatinglosses from an equity investment of approximately $8 million after tax duringthe quarter. We do not anticipate recording further equity losses in 2008.", "Slide 32, highlights our workingcapital performance during the quarter. As you can see, we have made strongprogress in all areas of our working capital management, as working capitaldeclined to 10.4% of sales, compared to both the 13.2% reported in the thirdquarter and the prior year amount of 11.0%.", "We have made strong progress inreducing inventory from third quarter levels, although not to the extent of theoriginal plan, due primarily to weaker than expected industry demand within theUS.Our team remains focused on continuing to improve working capital performanceduring 2008.", "Now, I would like to take amoment to discuss our 2007 free cash flow performance on Slide 33. For theyear, we generated $521 million in free cash flow, well below our previousexpectations, free cash flow improve to 22% from 2006 on a strength of higherearnings, improved overall working capital and lower global tax payments.", "Cash flow was negatively impactedby current year payments associated with the Maytag product recall announcedlast year. Our capital expenditures totaled $536 million in 2007, down $40million from the previous year, driven by continued global capital efficiencyinitiatives and lower acquisition integrations spending during the currentyear.", "We continue to improve ourcapital efficiency as demonstrated by our fixed asset turns, which haveimproved approximately 28% over the past five years ending 2007 at 6.0 turns.We expect 2008 capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million.", "Turning to slide 34, wesummarized cash return to our shareholders during 2007. As you can see wereturned more than 500 million to shareholders in the form of dividends andshare repurchases. At the end of the year, we had $97 million remaining underour current share repurchase authorization.", "I will end my comments with our2008 guidance, which has shown on slide 35. Based on current economic andindustry conditions, we anticipate full year 2008 EPS in the range of $8.50 to$9 per share. Within this estimate, we expect up to a $100 million inre-structuring charges. Additionally, we expect to convert these earnings intofree cash flow in the range of $600 million to $650 million.", "I will now turn the call backover to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thanks, Roy. Once again I would say that overall weare pleased with our 2007 performance in a challenging economic environment, wedelivered record results. We believe this performance highlights the strengthof our global business model. We have a strong portfolio of consumer preferredbrands around the world. We have great teams of innovation and a very strong globaloperating platform that we  leverage eachdrive resulting in all of our businesses around the world.", "Today, our global position isnumber one in the global market place. We are leveraging our leading consumerbrands for growth. We continue to effectively translate our innovation in theprofitable growth and we will continue to utilize our global operating platformto drive very strong level productivity worldwide.", "With this I believe that ourcompany is never been better position to succeed. We have a strong platform forthis today, which is why we expect to deliver a record year performance in thechallenging business environment 2008.", "I am going to end here and I willnow open this up for questions. Operator lets proceed with the Q&A portionof the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our firstquestion comes from Sam Darkatsh. Your line is now open.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Good Morning Jeff, Roy, Mike. How are you?", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning, Sam.", "Roy Templin", "Good morning, Sam.", "Mike Todman", "Good morning, Sam.", "", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "If just little more clarificationcan be reached on the earnings per share walk from '07 to '08; I know you don'thave much left under your existing share repurchase authorization Should I thenassume that the share count would remain flat in our assumption from Q4 levelsin fiscal year 2008. So, any share purchase activity would by definition and beincremental?", "Roy Templin", "That's correct Sam. I knowbecause of the averaging that goes on in the diluted earning per sharecalculation. It's tough to track the share buyback versus the shares issued,but if you were to look at the basic absolute levels of shares. We came out ofthe year at about 78 million shares outstanding. So, if that helps you withyour model, but again I understand with all the averaging going on, it's hardto see those numbers.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "Great, and then I understand thatyou're not going to be breaking out efficiency cost from Maytag's perspective,but what were the integration costs in fiscal year 2007? And I'm guessing thatthe vast majority of that will not repeat in 2008. Could you remind us whatthat was in '07?", "Roy Templin", "", "Yes, I can, Sam. The one-timecosts in the current year were $37 million versus the $89 million we had a yearago.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "And that will not repeat in '08?", "Roy Templin", "Well, if you remember, Sam, the chart that we published May23rd and we've actually published going forward. We always estimated that,there will be a small amount of P&L charge in 2008. I think the estimates$5 million of P&L we got, but again nothing significant.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "Okay. And then productivityexpectations, Jeff in '08, normally it's about 2% to 3% of COGS; is that withinthe realm of expectations? Or with the lower volume, would productivity comeoff a little bit or how should we look at that?", "Jeff Fettig", "Sam, in terms of with breakingall the parts, I'd say, we expect to drive, compared to historical standards, avery strong level of productivity. Two points I'd make, one we have factored inthe lower demand in that estimate in the US. Secondly, to Roy's point, any residual benefit from Maytagis included now in that productivity number. But I'd say that it would be atthe higher end of your historical range.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "And then, final question thatI'll defer to others, I noticed that there wasn't a whole lot of sharerepurchase activity in Q4, despite the fact that it was a fairly fact that itwas a free cash flow generating quarter. Keeping dry powder perhaps foracquisitions or could you help us to why you might be a little reticent rightnow, in terms of buying the stock back at current levels.", "Jeff Fettig", "Sam, this is Jeff, I'll answerthat. First of all, we are very consistent I think throughout the year, secondquarter, third quarter, fourth quarter and in terms of our purchases all over$100 million in purchases. As we said, share repurchase has been, as we talkedabout last April, and remains a very high priority for us. We do have $70million or $97 million of authorizations still available to us and you shouldexpect that continues to be a high priority for us.", "Regarding use of cash, ourpriorities, if we look at on an ongoing basis, are the same. First is to fundthe business to deliver to operating results and cash. We've given you thosenumbers, so there is nothing abnormal there and we feel that\u2019s fully includedin our guidance.", "Second is, as we talked about inthe past, we paid debt and our pension obligations, we've got our debt levelsdown, basically here our cost are pretty Maytag type levels, so we did a goodjob and in that, we are year ahead of our plans in terms of the debt reductionand when we fully fund our pensions and any additional pension contributionsare included in our forecast.", "Third, returning to shareholders,which is share repurchase and dividends. That remains a very high priorityparticularly given current share valuation levels.", "And then fourth, is looking atstrategic opportunities, again I would say that as we've talked about in thepast, we were always looking to three to four or five these around world, someof them paying out, some of them don't. So we will look at those on a one onone basis, but we don't see that as a huge transaction with these or more ofthings that fit into our global operating structure.", "So that's pretty much how we seeit, how we prioritize and again those things I mentioned already are built intoour guidance.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Thank you so much, keep it up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes fromDavid McGregor. Your line is now open.", "David McGregor - Longbow Research", "Yes, Good Morning everyone. Jeff,you mentioned price initiatives, I think, Mike mentioned price initiatives aswell. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of where you are so farin the year; do you see competition following along? Where around the world areyou pursuing pricing initiatives and does a negative volume expectation for theyear temper your expectations on these price initiatives?", "Jeff Fettig", "Dave, let me talk aboutinternational markets, that\u2019s in my comment I just talked about.Internationally, I kind of break it down into three regions, Latin America, Ithink, we\u2019ve been doing all along a very good job, of both driving strongproductivity and our ability to appropriately pass through cost-based priceadjustments. We continue to do that and I think that\u2019s one of the reason whyour ability to do that in those markets is going pretty well.", "In Europe,it\u2019s a little bit of a mixed picture depending on market transitions. I wouldsay, as you exit 2007, probably more, that the price declines that we see inthat for many years had lessened and I think there are some markets where priceincreases and certainly positive mix improvements are taking place. And weexpect to do both in 2008, based on what we\u2019ve announced.", "In Asia, it\u2019s a market by marketsituation, Indiais a big market for us. There we are, again we look both at price increasesannounce and improvement mix. Chinais more an improvement in mix as we basically overhauled our whole product lineto that market place.", "So, there\u2019s a number of ways toimprove margins, cost-based price increase are just one of many but that\u2019s thepicture internationally, and I feel very good about where we are today, interms of pursuing, implementing and achieving those and I\u2019m sure, let me turn over to Mike Todman, I\u2019msure what he was ever seeing in the U.S market.", "Mike Todman", "Yeah, David, let me start gettingto the perspectives on the price - cost-based price increases. First of all, wehave announced cost-based price increases and we clearly expect that they willhold in the market. What we have done and what we continue to do is just makesure that our brand carries the right value.", "But secondly, the way we getprices is through new product introductions and innovations. And as I mentionedin my opening remarks, we have got 72 product launches that we scheduledthroughout the year. For both those factors, we feel pretty confident thatwe'll be able to realize the cost-based price increases that we have taken tothe market place.", "Jeff Fettig", "And David, the last thing I wouldpoint out here is, again I go back to globally witnessing over $2 billion ofinput cost for the last three and half years. It will increase another $350million or so this year. We have seen adjustments being made through the wholesupply chain. A big part of our material cost increase in this year iscomponents, as we have suppliers who no longer absorb these increases andfrankly, in some cases, we risk losing a supply base that we need to continuethe business.", "So, the same as it moves from thesupply chain is true at being the main factor in market development. It\u2019sobvious that's where we are. Margins are very low compared to where they werefour years ago. We have done a good job with productivity and in otheractivities and offset about three-fourths of this. But we are coming to thepoint with this continued [commodity] inflation in our view and that, wecommunicated publicly, as we expect to pass these through to the market placein order for us to continue to invest in innovation and the things thatconsumers really want in our business.", "David McGregor - Longbow Research", "Did you sense that your competition is of a similar mind?", "Jeff Fettig", "I can't really comment on your actions David, I will justsay everybody likes materials, so everybody probably got a problem.", "David McGregor - Longbow Research", "Yeah, I am just wondering if youcan guide for your sales and marketing organization that your competitors havealso pursued pricing initiatives.", "Jeff Fettig", "It varies per market and to me,the best way to look and see what are MSRP selling at and just sell from retaildata. I don't think you take much stock and day-to-day rumblings in the marketplace.", "David McGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay, great. Thanks very muchgentleman.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from MichaelRehaut. Your line is now open.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities", "Thanks. Good morning everyone.", "Jeff Fettig", "Hi Mike, good morning.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities", "Just a question on the rawmaterials. You had mentioned that you are expecting $350 million for '08. I waswondering if you could kind of break that down; if possible by steel, energyand maybe plastic or resins?", "Jeff Fettig", "Michael, in our business gadget go in order of site, ofpurchase steel was like our number one, oil and resins was number two,base metals number three and this strategic components bake up then in numberfour. I will say we are going to modest increases in steel.", "Concerning base metals; if youlook at the second half average, we basically hedge base metals, so we are alwayskind of in the middle of the market, but clearly year-over-year first half willcontinue that, but nothing like we saw last year But we are expecting theincrease there. Oil, we are assuming $90 barrel oil for the year and thatdrives resins, and  also hits our freightand warehousing.", "But probably, and again it's beena little bit different every year depending on which things take off, but thisyear the biggest impact is what I mentioned is the component value change whereour suppliers; which is copper and steel and so on and so forth, also have beensqueezed to the point where we've had to Maytag the [kick pricing] and weneeded the supply and so we're seeing readjustment in that part of our valuechain. So that's probably actually the biggest crunch this year.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities", "Also just taking a bigger pictureand looking at, certainly you had seen success in past couple of years withcost-based price increases, at the same time the demand side has weakenedpretty consistently over the last 18 months. And as you noted in your outlook'08, there doesn't seem to be a change in that trend.", "I was wondering if you could kindof comment on the level of promotional activity that's out there. I think you kind of commented atthat in the third quarter this was maybe an area of surprise or a negativeimpact, and how you see some of the competitors that are out there gainingshare or trying to gain share, rather affecting that balance as perhaps demandcontinues to fall?", "Jeff Fettig", "Mike, one thing I want to commenton, I'll ask Mike to make his comments as well. But in terms of the USmarket, which I think you're primarily referring to, is we did really see somesubstantial pick up in the fourth quarter; certainly versus the third quarterand everything for us moved in the right direction.", "There has also been somediscussion about increased promotions in a challenging marketplace. I guessthere is a lot of noise out there in terms of our level of promotions and soon. There is nothing abnormal in the fourth quarter. As we go into the 2008,frankly, we have shifted the significant part of our focus to the productinnovation launches that Mike just talked about, which are substantial, numberone.", "And number two, shifted a lot ofpromotion to consumer raw advertising to really make innovations well known andfrankly create demand in the market place. Given where we are, given Maytagintegration is over, given our innovation across all of our brands, this is theright time for us to do that. So, we expect to win market share and compete byhaving the best brands, the best products and making sure consumers know aboutthem as apposed to price promoting in the market place. Mike is there any?", "Mike Todman", "No. Michael, I think Jeff reallysaid it, we didn't have any abnormal activity in the fourth quarter and aswe've come into the year, we really have shifted a lot to be consumer directed,if you will, advertising to draw them into the market place. And if you look atour results, we actually had a very positive price mix in the fourth quarter,while we recovered and had significant improvement in our market share from thethird quarter to the fourth quarter. So, we feel pretty good about that and wethink that we can continue that trend as we go through 2008.", "Roy Templin", "", "Michael, its Roy. Michael, just a sort of build on Mike'spoint, I think if you look at the company, I talked about the favorable pricemix in the fourth quarter globally. Mike is correct, he got about a half apoint within North America and if you step back to see more of the macropicture, as a company for 2007, we had just a little lower half point offavorable price mix as well. Just to help you calibrate the success we had in2007.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities", "Last question, if I could, nowwith the Maytag cost saving cycle essentially achieved, I think you had saidthat you're kind of going back to general productivity expectations and thatyou're not going to actually break-up Maytag, apart from your overall productivitygains. Also, kind of conceptually, you are now with that much of a biggerfootprint and market share. Is there still, where are you are in terms ofproduct gains?  Historically you said aneven 3% to 5% per year productivity gains. It might be a little repetitive ofSam's question, but net-to-net, do you still feel that there is a biggerplatform from which to get productivity gains or how do you see that?", "Jeff Fettig", "I'll answer that. The answer isyes. Particularly compared to pre Maytag, I'll go down at number dimensions;one, our larger size of scale provides a bigger platform. Two, although we needa tremendous number of changes during the Maytag integration, it's still farfrom optimized and as you think about every new product we bring out is nowcompletely on a Whirlpool cost, structure versus the Maytag cost structure, andthat will continue for sometime until a 100% of the product line is completelyget over.", "We do have some facilities andyou saw one Reynosa in Mexico, which was not included inkind of the first ground of integration that's subsequent to that and when youhave some continued manufacturing optimization to do. And then on top of that,I'd say stronger than ever is the global common standardization, commonnizationof some of our product designs and component parts and that sort of things.", "So, I think there are a certainnumber of enhanced opportunities we have because of the size scale and scope ofMaytag. The other side is still the globalization level, which still has a lotthat we think we can benefit from. And then the third area is our ongoingrelentless improvement on things like [clean] manufacturing and in our internalskills, in order to drive and also add in the whole trait and warehousing thelogistic change.", "We are finding new ways to driveproductivity, so yeah, my expectation actually would be that we have moreopportunity today then certainly we did pre-Maytag to drive productivity.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from EricBosshard. Your line is now open.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "Good morning.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning Eric.", "Roy Templin", "Good morning.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "A couple of things, first of allcan you give me a sense that $8.50 to $9 of guidance up, there are obviouslyhead winds from the tax rate and from last asset gains, I'm assuming thosenumbers, but can you give me what gives you the conviction of that improvementin the face of the demand head winds and some of these other factors?", "Jeff Fettig", "Sure, Eric. Let me give you alittle bit of color. And I'll break it up on the three parts. One is revenueand if you take the demand in the US and what we expect we can do a productsand brand, in market trend and so on and a kind of put all pieces in the worldtogether. We do expect moderate positive revenue growth globally for the year.", "Secondly, is the negative hit tomargins, as I said our material cost, restructuring, and the increased brandinvestments, although a lot of that brand investment were funding from otherinfrastructure cost changes. So, there is a decline against an increase. Butoverall, that's a little over two points of negative to hit the margins, theflip side and how we expect to offset it.", "The other things that Imentioned; number one is, very strong productivity. I believe net of rawmaterials this will be the strongest productivity we have been ever had for allthe reasons I've just mentioned. Number two, to both costs-based pricing andproduct mix. We do expect to recoup and improve our margins; at least thelevels that we have done better this year and that's true around the world.", "And then third, I'd say itcontinued, although perhaps a little bit slower, but still very positive internationalgrowth. Those things wethink will more than offset that would over 2 point of negative hit and thereare a lot of other things in our income statement. Let me give it to Roy a kind of give you --kind of a little bit more granularity.", "Roy Templin", "Eric, first of all, you'recorrect in terms of conviction if you take a things, let me start with the lowoperating profit. You touched upon tax rate, where we think we go to the mid20s. Second item as you notice is other income, other expenses was a littlehigh this year. So, we've normalized that back to our typical run rate.", "So, you really come back to theoperating profit and if you normalize the operating profit you take out the twoasset gains that we talked about this year. And then you step back from this,you really have two things that are going on within our operating profit. Oneis what Jeff talked about his script. He had the negative 2.1 points coming offmaterials, restructuring in SG&A.", "And then that the second side,Eric, is the positive side and which embedded in our guidance, is in essencethree points of improvement from productivity, price mix and the incrementalrun rate on Maytag efficiencies for those efficiencies that we actuallyrealized over the course of 2007.", "Now a little bit of baselineEric, in terms of what gives you conviction, which was the first part of yourquestion. Productivity in 2007 for the company was two points of productivityas what we achieved in 2007. Price mix I mentioned earlier with, Michael was0.5 point.", "The Maytag is a little trickierbecause again as you know we've had strong year-over-year efficiencyrealization obviously, we wouldn't repeat that, but we do have, imbedded in ourguidance, some incremental benefit from those Maytag efficiency. Those threecombined are totaling three points, which gets you to our operating profit walkforward. That enables you to get to the mid-point of our guidance.", "Jeff Fettig", "The last perhaps perspective, I'dput on is, if you look at 2007 and 2008, they have a lot of similarcharacteristics in the guidance that we gave in the beginning year and frankly,for most of you. We had two big changes in our assumptions, which drove ourguidance and that was, we earlier in the year, we really tough to choose onethese are $400 million range, they were in the $600 million range. That's $200million; that's full one point of operating margin.", "In the second pass we had, we call the first part of theyear right on industry demand in US been down about 5% and it goes down5.1%. What we missed was the impact of the financial credit crunch in prices;originally we thought the second half will be up 1 to 2% and the reality wasdown almost 6%.", "And so that big swing in demandcoupled with the $200 million cost increases is what challenged us in this backhalf of the year. Having said that, we've made adjustments throughout the yearto deal that still. Still largely delivered within the guidance that we gavein, and I think 2008, its similar, we kind a laid out what our assumptions are,those are our planning assumptions they can change.", "But we also made it into ourbusiness and tried to take the actions throughout the course of the year andalso made sure that we are changing along inline with the environment stilldelivering our guidance. So, I guess from that perspective, I think we have gota number of things that we are continuing to work on, that if theseenvironmental assumptions do in fact, three months or six months down the road,change, that we are working on enough things to adapt our business fairlyquickly and try to deal with it.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "Can you give us anyquantification of how much Maytag cost save carry over the risk going into '08?What you have not annualized to this point?", "Mike Todman", "Eric I would estimate it to $50million to $100 million.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "", "Okay. And then the other questionis, you talked a lot in '07 about the cash flow 6 to 6.50 and it ended up itlooked like from cash from operations 200 million short in 4Q and seemed likethe inventories may explain some of that, but can you explain a bit the 200million deviation from your guidance in cash flow from operations in the fourthquarter?", "Mike Todman", "I am sure I followed yourquestion Eric, in terms of the delta from our guidance.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "I think you had been [guiding of]cash from operations for the year and the reported number ended up being 927?That's what I was trying to figure, what explains that deviation in the fourthquarter relative to the guidance?", "Mike Todman", "I am thinking, Eric, we were 100million off of what we had guided in terms of cash from operations and that wasprimarily driven by inventories and again for the most part that was inventoryshare in the U.S. where we did take a number of down-days, but as the marketshrank over the course of the quarter, we just ended up with about 2 excessdays of inventory on hand, that we had not planned. And then one day of theinventory that we consciously built to support our global footprinttransitions.", "Jeff Fettig", "And I would add that it wasreally the early shortfall of that we saw late November, December. By then, itwas really too late to make any more adjustments in our inventory. So, thatreally was frankly the entire mess.", "Mike Todman", "That was a mess.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "Right Thank you.", "Jeff Fettig", "Are there questions?", "Operator", "Yes, our next question comes fromLaura Champine. Your line is now open.", "Laura Champine\u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Good Morning, Jeff", "Jeff Fettig", "Hi Laura", "Laura Champine\u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company", "I noted from your boiler plate,that, if I\u2019m doing my math right, your business will see this decline to about8%, though your business in North America wasup a percentage point for the year. If you can, can you draw into how yougained share in the fourth quarter despite a pretty widely publicized declineand continued share loss of your biggest customer, and then as a follow on,what will you do in 2008 to try to become more channel neutral and diversifyaway from that weak link in retail environment?", "Mike Todman", "Okay Laura, this is Mike Todman,and maybe just let me give you a look at our overall business. And I think wehave said throughout the year, and really as we executed in the fourth quarter,that we wanted to make sure that our brands won work at the distribution whereour consumers shop, and that we don\u2019t specifically pick where consumers shopand so if we are there and we have the right product, the right innovation,then we will enjoy the market share that --- what I would say, therefore in thefourth quarter is, we saw a fairly good increase in our branded market share.So, outside of Sears in particular, and that\u2019s just based on kind of the productlaunches that I talked about in the third quarter call that we executed in thefourth quarter. ", "The other aspect of it, as wecontinue to go forward, what we again have said all along is, if you look atall these product launches that we are taking to all of our brands, our intentis just to have the right product, the right value, the right innovation in ourbrands where every consumer shops. And so at Sears with [M-mart] we will havethe right product offering there. If it is outside of Sears in any of the otherdistribution points, we may consider that we have the right product offering inour brands in those environments, and that's what we intend to continue to doas we go throughout the year.", "Laura Champine\u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Can you comment on Q4, whetheryour share gains were weighted more towards the Whirlpool brand or the Maytagbrand, and also how are your client brands doing relative to those core marketbrands?", "Mike Todman", "Laura it was both Whirlpool andMaytag, and I will tell you we had very strong performance in our [Iron] brand,and as we introduced that new product Kitchen Aid that I mentioned here, we sawthat consumers were buying those brands. Frankly, we had it across the board atall of our brands.", "Laura Champine\u2013 Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Thank you.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have time for one morequestion from Jeff Sprague. Your line is now open.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research", "Thank you, good morning.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research", "Roy, you had a couple of comments about theprice and mix. I think that was about operating profit, not revenue. Just so, Ihave it, we all have it square, can you just, the revenue composition in North America in Q4. How it shakes out for Whirlpoolvolume price mix?", "Roy Templin", "Okay, you are right. I am goingto reconciled revenue for you. Okay, you could hear earlier, I was talkingabout the margin impacting in my discussions with Eric and Michael.", "If you look at, I will start withConsolidated, Jeff, Consolidated Whirlpool sales were up 7%. If you look atcurrency, the currency impact of that foreign currency was 6.5 pointsimprovement. We had about 0.5 favorability of price mix and then we had minus 0.5for volume and that gets you to the 7.5 for Consolidated. For North America specifically, we had about 3.5 points of favorable pricemix in the fourth quarter, about 0.5 of rate and volume was about 5.5 negativeto get you just at minus 0.5.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research", "Great. And then could you justwalk us through the mechanics of why tax rate would go back up? It would seemlike some of the geographic forces that drove it down in '07 would still be inplace in '08?", "Roy Templin", "Yeah Jeff, that's a goodquestion. Let me talk a little bit about that. And it's sort of a loadedquestion. I am going to give you little bit of perspective, and then I willcome back to your direct question. I think it's important to [propose] with twopoints, Jeff. One is that we've talked about, I guess now, over the last coupleof years, that we have been implementing a tax strategy plan to get our taxbase globally more efficient with respect to our operations.", "The second propose point is that,as you know, under the current accounting rules there are really two impact,sJeff, typically when you execute a tax strategy. And that is that under theaccounting rules for those things that involve the current period operations orfuture operations, you recognize the benefit of those strategies over period oftimes as part of your operating tax rate.", "The second important distinctionnow, Jeff, is when you execute tax strategies for those pieces or componentsthat relate to prior periods. Let me give you an example of what specifics to [workover]. If you execute a tax strategy that now enables you to utilize NOLs thatwere previously not able to be utilized, the component of that that relates toprior periods is run through the rate in the quarter that you execute the tax strategies.So, you get this much largest impact on the individual quarters then you wouldget over a blended period of time.", "For Whirlpool Corporation, if youlook at our normalized tax rate taking into effect our rates around the world,we have a normalized rate, Jeff , of about 30%. If you look at the rate versusthis year, we had about 15 points of benefit coming off of the tax strategythings that we did, that related to prior period positions that we now had theinformation on and therefore lowered our rates. So, that's the delta betweenour normalized rate of 30 and a roughly 40.50.", "Now let's walk it forward to yourspecific question. If you look at the things that we've executed on ourstrategy and if you look at the benefit that it will have on the rates goinginto 2008, we get about 5 points of benefit that we expect to achieve in 2008.And that take you from this normalized rate back to the mid-20s. Another pointI'd make, Jeff, with respect to taxes, I think it's an important distinctionthat, these things that we've executed are real from a tax cash perspective,these are not just book accounting entries, these are truly a lowering of ourcash taxes that we pay around the globe.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research", "Actually, that was going to be asecond part of my question. Actually, if you could give us a sense of what cashtaxes did in '07, and what you would expect in '08? You do have a prettysubstantial, call it 25% operating cash flow improvement bake in for '08. I amwondering if you could kind of give us some color, is it cash taxes or is itworking capital or what it is that would actually drive that strong of animprovement?", "Roy Templin", "Well, Jeff the simple answer is,we did have lower cash taxes paid in 2007. Part of that was from our taxstrategy, part of that was related to refunds that we had on global scale. Wedon't expect significant change in that going in to 2008.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research", "Okay. So, the cash flowimprovement in '08 is more of a function of working capital?", "Roy Templin", "Yeah, it's really coming off of afew components, Jeff. One is working capital, which is the single greatestcomponent. And again, if you think about my comments with respect to inventoryand where we ended the year that's a big driver there. It\u2019s a little bit onhigher earnings, a third piece that's very important is the Maytag recall. Wedid expand $72 million of cash in 2007 related to that recall. You will recall,Jeff, that we estimated $82 million in total, so obviously a lot less cashcoming out next year. And then final point that Jeff referenced is, we doexpect $25 million more in pension contribution next year than we had in 2007.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research", "", "And then, just one final one, ifI could. I think a prior questioner assumed that there wouldn't be asset salesgains that worked as potential offsets to restructuring. Would you in fact, asyou are selling some of these facilities you are closing, in fact have someoffset?", "Roy Templin", "Well Jeff, if you look at thechart in the back of the press release, you will note that we have $50 millionto $100 million assumed in terms of proceeds from assets sales, that's relatedto your point. In terms of again on asset sales, again we don't forecast thosegains, but if you look at our run rate over the last three years, you will findthat we have about $50 million, its the typical run rate of gains on assetssales.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research", "", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Roy Templin", "You are welcome.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well thank you. And everyonethank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you in thefuture.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Greg Fritz, please go ahead.", "Greg Fritz", "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation's second quarter conference call. Joining me on today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to the many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q. During the call, we will be making comments on free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Listeners are directed to slide 30 for additional disclosures regarding this item. Our remarks today will track with a presentation available on the investor section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw earlier this morning, we released our second quarter results. Now we'd like to provide you with some perspective on the state of our business and review our second quarter results.", "Let me start with the quarter, where we reported that net earnings from continued operations were $117 million and our EPS was $1.53 per share and that's versus $2.00 a share of last year. For the quarter, net sales were up at $5.1 billion which represents about a 5% increase versus the last year.", "Overall, I would summarize the quarter as follows. First of all, our Latin America region produced another quarter of very strong results with sales growing by 22% and our operating profit increasing by 40% on the year-over-year basis. Secondly, as we've seen in previous quarters, weakness in the US market persisted, with demand declining by 8% during the quarter. This is now the eighth consecutive quarter where demand has declined in the US marketplace. And third, we continue to face a surge in material and oil-related cost increases. To combat these unprecedented cost increases, we've implemented very strong cost reduction actions across the business and price initiatives which I'll discuss more in a moment. And lastly, I'd like to point out that in late April we did sign a joint venture with Hisense-Kelon Electrical Holdings in China, one of the leading electronic and home appliance companies in China. As part of the JV, we will benefit from sharing research, technology, procurement and development resources for producing refrigerators and washing machines in that marketplace. Overall, we believe this joint venture will allow us to accelerate our growth in this very important Chinese market.", "I now turn to slide 4 and talk about a little bit of the balance of the year where we expect US demand to be down a little bit more than we previously said. We're now forecasting that to be in the 6% to 7% range. Europe, we're seeing some slowing in that market and we're now projecting the year in Europe for demand to be down 2% to 3%. These markets continue to face very challenging macroeconomic conditions that we see are stressing consumers and therefore purchases. At this point, we don't see this trend abating in the near term and we're managing our businesses there accordingly. We are maintaining our full year outlook for emerging markets but we see some indications of slower growth in these markets as cost inflation also impacts the ability for consumers to purchase. We do expect now our 2008 material and oil-related cost to increase by $600 million to $650 million which is higher than our previous estimate.", "As you've all seen, we've seen a substantial increase in key commodities such as steel, and oil, and oil-related inputs. Given these factors along with very weak consumer sentiment in a lot of the key mature markets, as well as continued currency volatility, we're very focused on positioning our company and our business to address these macroeconomic challenges.", "As shown on slide 5, our business priorities for 2008, we are forced to implement our previously announced cost-based price increases globally. In light of the continued inflationary trends, we've taken multiple cost-based price increases in many markets around the world. Most recently in North America, we've implemented a July price increase which ranged from 6% to 10% on the effective products. In Latin America, we also have recently announced and are implementing price increases in the 4% to 5% range. In Asia, we have implemented price increases in all of our major markets of up to 13% with most markets implementing price increases in the mid to high single-digits. And finally in Europe, we've announced and are executing low single-digit price increases in most markets across Europe. So overall, we have, as we mentioned before, absorbed significant unfavorable material and oil-related costs. Now, if you go back to really when this trend started in mid-2004, well over $2 billion during the last four years, it's critical that we pass some of these costs through to our customers.", "Secondly, one of our critical priorities we've set for 2008 was increasing our new product innovation and focusing on improving our marketplace execution. We have done that in all parts of the world. As Mike Todman will touch on in a moment, we continue to perform very well in the marketplace relevant to the overall industry decline in North America. We are experiencing similar positive performance trends in most of our international markets. With our global new product launches, we are very focused on bringing innovating new products to consumers in every part of the world.", "The third area which is critical to us is productivity, where we are seeing very good progress on our enterprise-wide cost initiatives. Roy Templin will touch on this in more detail in a moment, but we're having very good success on the productivity part.", "And finally, in terms of adjusting our costs and capacity structure, we continue to take the very difficult steps of optimizing our manufacturing footprint, particularly in this type of environment. So far in 2008, we've announced the closure of four facilities in North America to better align our cost structure capacity with the current industry environment.", "At this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Todman to give you an update on our North America performance.", "Mike Todman", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance in the second quarter. As shown on slide 7, our net sales declined 4% during the quarter to $2.9 billion with US industry demand for T7 appliances declining approximately 8%. Our brand and share growth is being fueled by the many new innovative product launches that we have discussed on previous calls. Turning to operating profit, profit declined $78 million to $101 million in the second quarter. This decline is mainly attributable to three factors. One, lower US industry demand. Two, higher material and oil-based costs. And three, increased brand investment.", "There are four key takeaways that I would like to highlight around our second quarter results. First, despite the lower US industry demand, our volume performance exceeded overall industry performance during the quarter. This improvement was driven by our Whirlpool owned brand product portfolio outpacing the industry. Second, we experienced substantial material increases in metal and oil-based purchase components. In addition, diesel fuel prices continued to accelerate resulting in substantial increases in our freight cost during the quarter.", "And third, we continue to invest in our brands particularly related to advertising. While we feel we are seeing some near term benefits on these advertising initiatives, these efforts did result in increased SG&A spending during the quarter. Finally, I would like to touch upon our inventory during the quarter. Given the challenging market environment we are very focused on aligning our product inventory with demand levels. Our team has worked very diligently in this area and we actually increased our inventory turnover during the quarter.", "Slide 8 provides an update on the status of the key indicators behind our 2008 US industry demand outlook. Considering the current outlook for these components, as well as sharply lower consumer confidence, our current outlook for US demand is slightly below our previous guidance. We now expect the US industry demand to be down 6% to 7% and as you can see, significant factors behind this change are related to consumer confidence and new housing completions which we now expect to decline approximately 28% from the approximately 20% previously expected.", "On slide 9, I would like to review the key initiatives underway given our expectations for lower industry demand and higher material and oil-related costs. One, as we discussed on the last call, a 6% to 10% cost-based price increase on selected models took effect at the end of the second quarter. Given the significant rise in raw material and oil-related costs that have persisted for several years, it has been necessary for us to take these increases to the marketplace. Two, we are accelerating our productivity initiatives and cost changes. As Jeff referenced earlier, we continue to take the difficult steps to align our capacity with demand. We have now announced the closure of four manufacturing facilities in North America. These steps will improve our capacity utilization in the region and improve our cost structure.", "Three, the record number of new product launches this year is providing us with strong new products in the marketplace. Our new products are being received very positively in the market and will allow us to build upon a strong momentum. Four, our increased consumer advertising during the quarter has been effective in the marketplace. And we will continue to make similar brand investments as we see the appropriate value from these investments.", "In summary, our organization remains well on track in executing the key initiatives we have previously articulated to you. While the macroeconomic environment remains very challenging, we are very focused on the key levers we control that will enable us to successfully manage through this environment.", "Turning to slide 10, you will find the summary of the second quarter product mix trends. This chart depicts our year-to-year unit volume change for T7 appliances. And as you can see, we have continued volume growth in our business with higher average selling prices. While we certainly are monitoring mixed trends on an ongoing basis, to date, we have not in our business seen a significant shift towards mixing down from higher price point products.", "Finally, I would like to turn to the outlook for North America for the remainder of the year on slide 11. As I mentioned previously, we now expect US industry demand to decline in the 6% to 7% range for the remainder of 2008. We expect to see continued weak conditions in the third quarter with some moderate improvement in the fourth quarter. We do expect, however, to see negative industry year-over-year comparisons in both quarters. We have implemented cost-based price increases to offset the macroeconomic headwinds and given the persistent rise in material and oil-related costs, our cost-based pricing adjustments were critical to ensure that our product prices reflect the value we bring to the consumer.", "With that I will turn the call back over to Jeff for his comments on the international operations.", "Jeff Fettig", "Our international operations continue to perform well despite what we see as an increasing challenging market environment. Latin America continued to build on its strong performance trend during the quarter. Our European operations posted stable results in an increasingly challenged market environment. And our Asian operations has showed good growth and improved profits during the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our international performance as they continue to perform well in an even more challenging environment.", "I'll turn to slide 14 to review our European business. For the quarter, European revenues increased 17% to $1.1 billion during the quarter. In local currency, our sales were up 2% from the prior year. Industry unit shipments for the region declined by approximately 2%, year-over-year. Our operating profit decreased 1% to $50 million in the second quarter. Our results were unfavorably impacted by higher material and oil-related costs, and we are able to substantially offset many of these costs through productivity and positive price mix.", "Turning to slide 15, our Latin America business once again reported very strong second quarter results. Our revenue increased 22% to $1 billion for the quarter and excluding the impact of the currency, sales increased by approximately 7%. Our operating profit increased 40% to $133 million during the quarter and our margins expanded to 13.3%, up from 11.6% a year ago. Overall, our increased unit shipments and very strong productivity and cost-controls, were all positive factors in our second quarter results. Here too, however, results were negatively impacted by significantly higher material costs.", "Slide 16 summarizes our second quarter results in the Asia region. Net sales increased 9% during the quarter. Our results were led by very strong performance in India. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased about 8%. The region reported an operating profit of $5 million in the quarter, up from last year's levels. Our improved results reflect in improvements in productivity, product mix and price. These favorable factors, here too, were once again partially offset by higher material costs.", "Turning to slide 17, to give you an outlook going forward, in Europe, we currently expect 2008 industry volumes to decline in the minus 2% to 3% range. We saw industry softness in the first half of the year and we expect this to continue for the balance of 2008. The market remains split between positive growth in the Eastern Europe and negative demand in Western Europe. In Latin America, based on our current economic outlook, our previous expectation of industry unit demand in the range of 5% to 8% remains unchanged. While the first half of the year was well above this rate, we are seeing some signs of slowing in Latin America in total, but given the expected trend, we are comfortable with our full year estimate for the year. In Asia, 2008 unit growth estimates also remained unchanged in the 5% to 10% range. Again, here we're seeing the similar pattern in growth in Asia where first half results were very strong in terms of market demand and we're seeing more moderate growth rates in the second half of the year.", "As I previously mentioned, higher material and oil-based costs continue to have a very unfavorable impact on our international operations. We have and will continue to address these pressures across our business with productivity initiatives in implementing our announced cost-based price increases. Overall, despite more challenging conditions in Western Europe, we remain well positioned to deliver improved results in our international businesses for 2008.", "So at this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Roy Templin for the financial review.", "Roy Templin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone. Beginning on slide 19, I'll walk you through a summary of our second quarter performance. From a top line perspective, our recent trends in performance remained largely intact. We continue to experience strong sales from international operations, particularly in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific regions. In addition, foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on our net sales. Weak US and European industry demand offset these favorable factors during the quarter.", "Turning to the income statement on slide 20, during the quarter we reported revenues of $5.1 billion, up 5%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our sales declined 1%. The Euro and Brazilian Reais fluctuations accounted for the majority of the favorable currency exchange impact on our results. We monetized $47 million of BEFIEX [1:14/09 Replay] tax credits during the quarter based upon both, increased sales and the mix of those sales. Our gross margin contracted 30 basis points to 14.8% for the quarter. The decline in gross margin is primarily the result of increased material and oil-related cost. We absorbed approximately $130 million of increased material and oil-related costs during the second quarter. These costs were partially offset by favorable productivity initiatives and a positive price mix trend. Compared with the first quarter level, our gross margins increased 1.5 points. This sequential improvement was driven by favorable price mix and productivity initiatives. SG&A expenses increased $39 million to $502 million in the quarter. Approximately two-third of this increase was the result of foreign exchange translation impact on our results. As we discussed in our previous calls, we are also making brand investments such as increasing our consumer advertising which accounted for the balance of the increase.", "As we discussed last quarter, we executed a significant amount of our expected full year restructuring cost during the second quarter. We incurred $40 million of restructuring expenses during the quarter which corresponds to a $24 million increase when compared with the prior year. The increase in restructuring expense accounted for a half a point of unfavorable margin impact when compared with both, the prior year and the prior quarter. As a result of the items I just discussed, operating profit totaled $203 million compared with $247 million in the prior year. If you look at our tax credits in Latin America, they provided an incremental $20 million benefit during the quarter. This amount was more than offset by our increased restructuring expense of $24 million and some of the operating income impact of these two items was slightly unfavorable.", "Turning to slide 21, our other income expense had an unfavorable impact of approximately $26 million when compared with the prior year. The two main items are related to legal settlements during the quarter and unfavorable foreign exchange movements on balance sheet positions.", "Moving to our tax rate. We reported an effective tax rate of 1.5% for the quarter which was well below the prior year's rate of 14.5%. The decrease in rate compared with the prior year is mainly due to two discrete items in the second quarter resulting from foreign audit settlements and international tax planning initiatives which improved the level of tax credits available to the company.", "Slide 22 illustrates our working capital results for the quarter. Our working capital performance improved during the second quarter on both, a sequential and year-over-year basis. We improved our total working capital, as a percentage of sales, on a year-over-year basis as a result of improved accounts receivable days and accounts payable days. As Mike mentioned earlier, we improved our inventory turnover in North America during the quarter. However, our overall inventory turnover was slightly unfavorable as a result of higher levels of inventory in our international operations.", "Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our free cash flow performance and that's on slide 23. For the quarter, we reported free cash flow generation of $262 million compared with $62 million in the previous year. The improvement was primarily the result of favorable working capital variances compared with the second quarter of 2007. Specifically, we saw a notable year-to-year improvement in accounts receivable and inventory during the quarter. Through the first six months, our free cash flow was approximately equal to the prior year. Similar to the second quarter results, improvements in working capital, primarily in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory offset lower income levels. Our capital expenditures totaled $124 million in the second quarter which resulted in an $18 million year-over-year increase. We continue to expect our full year capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $575 million.", "Turning to slide 24, we returned $86 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. We now have $446 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.", "Finally, I would like to turn to our guidance summary on slide 25. Based on current economic and industry conditions, we are maintaining our full year 2008 EPS guidance in the range of $7 to $7.50 per share. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we now expect material and oil-related cost increases of between $600 million and $650 million for the full year.", "We expect to offset this increased amount with productivity initiatives, previously announced cost-based price increases, and a lower full year effective tax rate. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate would be in the mid-teens. Within this estimate, we continue to expect up to $100 million in restructuring charges. Additionally, we expect to convert these earnings into free cash flow in the range of $500 million to $550 million.", "At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thanks, Roy. Let me sum this up and just repeat what I think is obvious. The global economic environment remains very challenging on all fronts and we see commodity inflation really evident in all parts of the economy and is weighing heavily on consumer's ability to purchase goods of all types. We see this inflation is now negatively impacting demand levels in most parts of the world. We are preparing our businesses to successfully operate in what we see is a much slower growth environment. To do this, we will execute on the things which we can control and are critically important to succeed in an inflationary slow growth environment.", "We've talked about this before, but we will continue to drive cost productivity in every part of our business. We will, as we have, adjust our capacity to deal with lower demand levels. We will continue to invest in our brands and bring on an ongoing continuous stream of innovation to the marketplace. And finally, we'll continue all of our efforts to have the marketplace absorb more of the impact of this inflation. In total, although we see a very challenging marketplace around the world, we believe we can address this environment and create significant value for our shareholders.", "At this time I'd like to open it up for Q&A. And I'll turn it back to you, operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from the side of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Yes, good morning, everyone.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning, David.", "David Macgregor - Longbow Research", "In North America, revenue is down 4%, industry shipments down 8%, price 4%, improvement in price and share gains. Is there any way you can help us understand how much was price, and how much was share gain?", "Mike Todman", "David, let me try to answer that question. Initially, I would say that on the price mix side we saw good improvement, but in fact, we were able to offset much of that margin through share gains. So a greater portion was through share gains, and then a slight improvement in price mix.", "Roy Templin", "David, its Roy. Just to give you the traditional components, as you know, we don't bifurcate US from others, and you're talking about US, I know. But, if you look at North America in total, currency was 0.8 points positive in terms of their total delta in sales. Price mix, to Mike's point, was favorable by about 0.5 point. And then you've got an overall North America volume reduction of about 5.3%, and that puts down to the overall 4.1% total for North America.", "David Macgregor - Longbow Research", "Okay. And then just shifting to the raw material cost inflation, can you just walk through the four segments and talk about where you're seeing the greatest amount? In terms of the incremental guidance that you provided on those pressures, how much of that is North America versus Europe versus Latin America?", "Jeff Fettig", "David, this is Jeff. It's up everywhere. Oil and steel are the biggest deltas in our April guidance. I think at the time oil was at $110 or $115 a barrel. We get it from oil, two big areas. One is resins of plastics, which go into our products and everywhere you get it in diesel fuel or other fuel, used for shipment. So that's proportionately around the market. The steel markets are a little bit different, as you will know, around the world. Contractually, some are on indexes, some are monthly. Generally, our international businesses are more bearable, and so the other, I would say, steel has been largely an international.", "David Macgregor - Longbow Research", "Do you have any major hedges rolling off in the second half or at the end of the year that we should know about?", "Roy Templin", "No, nothing that's unusual, David, that would cause a distortion in trends. The timing of this has always depended upon hedges rolling over and new hedges coming on, as well as length of the contracts, but there is nothing unusual in the trends as we look forward.", "David Macgregor - Longbow Research", "Okay, good. Congratulations on a good quarter in a tough environment.", "Jeff Fettig", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question, this one from the side of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Good morning, Jeff, Roy and Mike. How are you?", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning, Sam.", "Roy Templin", "Good morning, Sam.", "Mike Todman", "Good morning, Sam.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Roy, I guess this question is for you. I'm trying to reconcile the forward guidance vis-\u00e0-vis where it was last quarter, because you are keeping it the same, although incrementally, you've got maybe $150 million of higher material costs. You've got some tax benefit this quarter, but at least if my math holds, you're still asking us to assume low 20% range for tax rate in Q3 and Q4. And pricing is the same as where it was in Q1, and volume is down a little bit from where it was in Q1. So where are you making up the difference between the $150 million in raw material inflation and the lower volume, versus where you were last quarter? I'm just trying to reconcile how you're keeping your guidance the same?", "Roy Templin", "First of all, I will confirm your assumption on the tax rate in the back half of the year is correct, and that's how you're going to foot down to the roughly 15% rate. So I'll start with that. Sam, here are the pieces, in terms of what's happening with respect to our guidance from what we shared with you in April. There are two negatives, and Jeff touched upon those, and I know Mike touched upon one. And the first one, as you talked about, is materials. Obviously, we're looking at about $150 million increase in material costs. And then we've obviously adjusted our demand in North America from 5 to 6, to 6 to 7.", "Offsetting those two negative items are three components, Sam. The first one is pricing, and you talked about pricing being the same. However, that's not quite right, because we have now implemented back half of the year price increases in our international operations, which will take overall price mix for the year from what we had when we shared it with you in April. The second area, Sam, is in the area of productivity, and again, we continue to see favorable productivity trends. As you would expect, we continue to initiate incremental productivity, given the demand environment that we're seeing across the globe and so that number, again net-net from April, is favorable as well.", "And then the third component which you touched upon, and I touched upon in my script is the lower effective tax rate by about 5 points for the full year estimate and those are the components, Sam.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Got you. Second question, the $600 million to $650 million, as it stands right now, and of course that's a moving target. Unfortunately, right now it's moving higher. But how does that look right now for '09 directionally, based on when your contracts roll over and hedges roll over? And just then and I have a follow-up question to David's question last round.", "Jeff Fettig", "Sam, we have not provided a 2009 forecast of any type, but I guess I would say the drivers are out there and it depends on what assumptions people take on oil, steel and, really, the base metals. I guess, right now, given the trends, we think a lot of this inflation in 2008 will carry over into 2009 and until we see changes in those market trends, that is what our planning assumption is. As I mentioned earlier, we have the environment, we are positioning the business and as for an environment which continues to have this cost inflation. And so, as a result, in the absence choking off demand and slowing the growth patterns, that's how we're planning the business for the, I would say, foreseeable future.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Last question, and I'll get back in queue. You cited the industry growth rates in North America and Europe. You did not cite it for Latin America. Obviously, you've got a large market share down there, but are you maintaining share? Are you losing share? What are the competitive dynamics in the Latin America market, since it's now such a large part of your business?", "Jeff Fettig", "I would say we modestly outperform the market in Latin America, and in the parts of Asia that we're participating, we're either equal or slightly ahead of the market.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the side of Jeff Sprague with Citi Investment. Your line is open.", "Jeff Sprague - Citi Investment", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Roy Templin", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Mike Todman", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague - Citi Investment", "Just one more on the cost side, we've danced around it a little bit here. But when we look at the $600 million to $650 million of pressure this year, that is, in fact, your full P&L impact net of hedges and other actions you've taken to mitigate raw materials costs. Is that correct?", "Jeff Fettig", "That's correct, Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague - Citi Investment", "So, just as we are all to make our own assumptions, but conceivably things roll-off and that would imply you're not actually feeling the full brunt of raw mats as they stand today, because you've got hedges and various actions in place.", "Jeff Fettig", "That's a fair assumption, Jeff. That's correct.", "Jeff Sprague - Citi Investment", "Can you also just help us understand the mechanism by which you try to get price? I'll be over-simplistic, but if we take the North American price of 6% to 10%, 6% alone, obviously, on $11 billion sales base in North America's $6 a share in price on an annualized basis. So, clearly there are catalog increases, and then there is a mechanism, you go to the market and there is a push back from retailers, and any number of things that probably happen. But, maybe you could give us a little bit of a perspective on the last time you went in to get price of this magnitude? How it played out? And what would really be a reasonable expectation for what could stick?", "Mike Todman", "Yes, I'd maybe take that, Jeff. First, maybe go back to 2005 when we took a large price increase and we were able to actually take it through. In our July price increase and we've said, both at the time and in my script, that it was non-selective models, because as I had talked about, we had a number of new product innovations coming out through the year. So we didn't take it across to the board. In addition, as you know, our business is segmented between the contract channel and the retail channel. And so a lot of the price increases will go directly into the retail channel. But the contract channel has contracts that are out for a longer period of time. So it really is on selected models, but what we do experience and will experience is a total increase in price across the marketplace. But that kind of gives you a perspective of how we took this last price increase, and therefore what we expect.", "Jeff Fettig", "And Jeff, and globally I would say, to your point, there are a lot of levers, in terms of really trying to offset these costs through, whether it be product mix or brand mix, and so on. In new models and the innovation, we will continue to do that. I think the point is that the inflation is at a point where, what we would call like-for-like pricing, are largely the increases we're now announcing. We're moving our maps in the marketplace; we're repositioning our aligned structure, and basically increasing like-for-like pricing to deal with this unprecedented inflation that we continue to see. And the announced increases we have to-date don't come anywhere near offsetting, in the calendar year, the kind of cost increases that we had this year.", "Jeff Sprague - Citi Investment", "And I guess, Jeff, maybe you can pick that up too, on the productivity side. I mean, you know, it is a tough concept for us on the outside looking in to really get our arms around. Obviously, your guys are doing a very good job in the plans to squeeze out productivity when you've got these type of volume pressures. But how do we kind of get comfortable, or get our arms around what you can do next? What's left to do in the next area of improvement? Is it more capacity? Is there more left in Maytag? Is it purchasing? Is it this Chinese joint venture? What are the leverage that you have there?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, Jeff. It's in fact, its all about if you are hitting on the right one. We have an enterprise-wide cost initiative across all parts of the business, and we have a very defined approach. Given material by itself is such a big part of our cost base, you're absolutely right. If materials are going out, particularly we agree that they are now, your opportunity space is more limited in doing so. So the approach we've taken is really dissecting our entire value chain and putting in place, and we began this well over a year ago, but starting to payoff with higher levels of what I would call controllable productivity that we've ever had. But it begins with products and product designs, designing our products more efficiently using less material content, less labor assembly.", "It does have to do with procurement. We continue to find big opportunities to harmonize parts around the world, returning in essence our volume in the scale which makes us much more efficient for us and our suppliers. We have significant efforts in all 43 factories around the world, from lean manufacturing and other continuous improvement to drive higher conversion rates. Our freight costs, which are, given as you would expect, the size of a fuel have become a larger portion of our total value chain, if you're also really finding efficiencies along the way we ship products, the minimum order sizes and that sort of thing.", "Driving, of course manufacturing footprint is a part of this. As you say, the way we've taken the difficult challenge; we've taken four facilities offline just in North America. We will continue to look at making sure that we're in the best cost locations for that. Yes, there is continued, what I would call, optimization. Basically, we have all the Maytag stuff integrated, but there are still optimization opportunities. And then we get into our SG&A and our infrastructure cost, so this is a very serious bear economic environment, and we're aggressively trying to manage every part of our business to ensure, on one hand, we stay very productive but on the other, that we're able to justify passing some of this inflation into the marketplace.", "Jeff Sprague - Citi Investment", "And, I guess, just one last one for Roy. I guess you never give up on tax trying to find benefits and things like that, but what should we really think about for a normalized tax rate? Some year out there, 2010, or whatever when things stabilize, I know it is partly to be a function at geographic mix, but can you give us any direction there at all?", "Roy Templin", "Yes. Jeff, let me make just a couple of comments, because I think it probably is worthy on me making a comment or two here on the tax rate. A couple of things; one, as you know, I had forecasted and predicted we would be in the roughly 20% range for the year on the last call, and obviously, we've taken that down five points from 90 days ago. Really, two things happened, [David], under the accounting rules. I know you already know this, but it's quite worth emphasizing. Two things happened in the quarter. One was, we had a favorable audit settlement, one of our international operations that was more favorable than we had anticipated and under the accounting rules that's what they call a discrete item. So we take the entire benefit in the quarter.", "The second item was, we actually worked pretty hard in a different international location to be able to optimize some tax credits under a law change that happened about a year ago, and we finished that tax plan in the quarter, which again gave us a benefit which is discrete in nature, and so you recognized the full benefit of all prior year impact in the current quarter. So those two items are what drove the rate from what you probably modeled in the low 20s, which is what I would have modeled down to the 1.5.", "As we look forward for the rest of the year, Jeff, those two items are also the two items impacting the rate, taking it down from roughly 20% to roughly 15%. As you go beyond that, I would still go back to the guidance I've given you guys before, which is somewhere in that mid-20s. It's probably where we would expect our rate to be, given our international dispersion of earnings and the opportunities that we have in front of us.", "Jeff Sprague - Citi Investment", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Roy Templin", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We take our next question from the side of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning.", "Roy Templin", "Good morning, Michael.", "Mike Todman", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "First question, just with regards to the raw material assumptions, obviously steel and oil have continued to rise throughout the year and we're seeing steel contracts up in July and August and further. So, just wanted to understand, with the 600 and 650, roughly speaking, either at what price assumptions are you using there? At what point throughout the year are you looking at how much steel has gone up? Are you looking at June end or August end or September end, in terms of forward contracts, or how are you integrating the continued increase in that area?", "Roy Templin", "Michael, the forecasts that we have, I would say, represents our best estimate of what we will pay for these goods throughout the balance of it, what we've already incurred and what we're going to pay throughout the end of the year. As it relates to steel, again, every market is a little bit different on the way steel is purchased. And again, some is a monthly negotiation, some is indexed. Some is relatively fixed or within a range. And so we're sitting here in mid-July, I guess our comfort with what we obviously wrong at the beginning of the year, we're obviously wrong in April, being low but I think now we pretty much know what the third quarter is going to be, and so the amount bearable is shrinking. And actually, I'd say oil is probably the biggest variable left on the material cost base. So we're reasonably comfortable, unless there is some kind of explosion in oil that this forecast is within the relevant range for the balance of this year.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Okay. I guess the second question is just on the other eliminations line which I guess has a lot of different components to it, year-to-year and includes corporate overhead and such. You were at $86 million in the quarter and just wanted to try to get a sense, that I assume it includes the higher restructuring costs and if you could give us an idea of perhaps how those costs are perhaps somewhere of those restructuring, I assume, are related to North America versus Europe. If you could give us a sense, a little more granular detail of what's going on there?", "Roy Templin", "Yes, Michael, first of all, I'll answer the first part of your question. First of all, you are correct, that line does include our restructuring expenses, and so if you were to bifurcate the key components that are within that line what you would find is $24 million more restructuring obviously negative year-over-year trend being offset by corporate G&A costs which are down about $18 million year-over-year. And so, those two together are what net you out to your $6 million change that you referenced in the first part of your question. In the second part of your question, Michael, we really had restructuring cost incurred in every part of the world. Each region had their share of restructuring costs. The greatest component, the biggest component was the restructuring we did in Germany, where we took down about one shift of our production in Germany and that was by far the single greatest contributor to the cost of $40 million in the quarter.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks, Roy. And just also on the interest in sundries. You said that there was an unfavorable foreign exchange and legal settlements, if you could also give us a little more granularity there?", "Jeff Fettig", "Sure. In terms of waiting, the foreign exchange is a bit more than a legal settlement. Foreign exchange is a negative 13, Michael and again, with this be another income, another expense. What this is, is it's the currency. We actually had currency gains a year ago on our balance sheet positions. Again under the accounting rules, any balance sheet position you have and a currency, other than that location's functional currency, we basically adjust for currency. A year ago, those were gains. This year, they were losses. Again, it's spread amongst the number of positions around the world, but you had a $6 million gain, a year ago $7 million loss this year which gets to your $13 million. The litigation, again, was a non-recurring item in North America. It was roughly $10 million negative.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you, one more, if I could. Just on the BEFIEX credits. Do you have a sense of where you're going to be for the full year? You said it was 47 in the quarter.", "Mike Todman", "That's correct, Michael. Again, BEFIEX, let me just give you a little bit of reminder here. BEFIEX is dependent upon two things. The reason we don't forecast BEFIEX is its dependent upon the level of sales we have which in turn determines how much industrialized product tax we pay, and so as sales go up, those taxes go up and we are entitled to more credit.", "The second piece, Michael, is a mixed piece, and for example, in the second quarter laundry picked up 5% in terms of balance sale of the mix. Laundry has the greatest proportion of IPI taxes which in turn brings with it in a higher BPX credit and so it is primarily mixed as well as volume driven and we just, again, because of the variability particularly on the mix side, we just don't forecast that going forward.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Okay. But perhaps you could also just give where your balance is at this point at 2Q end.", "Roy Templin", "Yeah, I think we'll filed a Q later today of the 875 million, Michael.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We have time for one last question. We are going to have a final question. This one is from Laura Champine from Morgan Keegan. Your line is open.", "Laura Champine - Morgan Keegan", "Good morning. I know we have hit this ad nauseam. But can you give us the percentage of your total material and oil-related cost increase that you expect to offset with price increases this year. And also on that point, can you just give us a little more clarity into what specific productivity improvements are incremental to the productivity guidance that you gave us back in April?", "Roy Templin", "Laura, first of all with respect to productivity, its really all the things that Jeff referenced are what are the components of what the difference is from what we gave you back in April. Net net, Laura, again, big part of this coming out of converging productivity and that's two things. It\u2019s what we have done in the way of the traditional conversion productivity, plus cost reduction action that we have taken, not only in North America, but in all of our markets around the world.", "We've also got in there to just point SG&A actions that we have undertaken. So it\u2019s the net of all those components which give us the increase relative to where we were in April. Laura, in simple terms, this takes us back to roughly the productivity levels that we thought we would achieve at the beginning of the year in our February guidance, but as you know, we lost a little bit of traction when we updated our guidance in April, and we're really back to that starting point where we were back in February, to make it simple.", "Laura Champine - Morgan Keegan", "So the incremental change that helps you offset those cost increases is the price action that you're taking?", "Roy Templin", "It is both price and productivity, Laura. And again, you are walking the delta forward from April. Actually, they are about equal in terms of their impact and ability to offset materials. They are roughly the same in terms of delayed offset.", "Laura Champine - Morgan Keegan", "Alright, thank you.", "Roy Templin", "You're welcome.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well again, thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your questions and we look forward to talking to you next time.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Greg Fritz. Please go ahead sir.", "Greg Fritz", "", "Thank you Kevin and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation fourth quarter and year end conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q. During the call we will be making comments on free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Listeners are directed to Slide 30 for additional disclosures regarding this item.", "Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investor\u2019s section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. With that let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "", "Well good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you saw earlier this morning we released our fourth quarter and full year results and now I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to provide you with some perspective on the quarter, the year and I think very importantly the actions we\u2019re taking to address this very difficult economic environment that we see in 2009.", "As you all know, the global economic slowdown accelerated during the fourth quarter and in fact has deteriorated rapidly over the last six months. The negative volatility has created substantial challenges in our business and the following areas of demand; currency impacts; and costs. Let me start with demand.", "During the quarter, we saw a steep drop in global unit demand which made for a very challenging sales and production environment. This was primarily due to accelerated declines in our North America and European businesses during the quarter. In response to these demand levels, we took aggressive measures to reduce our production rates to insure inventories did not get out of line. This did have, however, a significant impact on our operating margins during the quarter.", "The second area where we saw a lot of negative volatility is in currency. During the fourth quarter we saw significant and rapid movements in exchange rates. In fact the world magnitude was 20 to 50% on some of our major currencies around the world. This volatility had a very unfavorable impact on our results during the quarter, well beyond what we would consider to be normal. And we\u2019ll talk a little bit more in detail about that in a moment.", "And the third area was the costs. We continue to face high material and world related costs in the quarter. Quarter over quarter, material costs were $150 million higher due to the increases we\u2019d seen all year through the spikes that we saw in raw materials in the third quarter of the year. And although we\u2019ve seen a recent reduction in raw material trends, they did remain at elevated levels during the fourth.", "I return to on your slide \u2013 to Slide 4 to summarize our year where we did a number of things, one to address this environment. First of all we did implement structural cost reduction actions as I mentioned to align capacity with demand. As part of this effort, we made a difficult decision which we announced in October to close five manufacturing facilities and to reduce approximately 5,000 positions globally by the end of this year. ", "These actions are in place and are now beginning to deliver strong operating efficiencies and will structurally remove costs from our business. In addition to this, we are implementing additional cost actions to further adjust our business to lower demand levels and I\u2019ll talk more about those in a moment.", "Also during 2008, we executed cost based price increases in all markets around the world. These increases were aimed at partially mitigating the record raw material and oil related inflation we saw throughout the year. These 2008 actions will have a positive carryover benefit to our margins in 2009. ", "As I mentioned, we reduced global production rates below demand to reduce our inventory levels. And also we continue to invest in innovation. Our innovation pipeline remains very strong. Innovation not only attracts consumers to our brands, it drives an overall business mix improvement for our business that generates higher margins. As such we are going to continue to make focused investments in innovation going forward in 2009.", "And finally, despite this very volatile environment really in all parts of the world, we were able to either maintain or grow our market position in all major markets around the world. ", "I\u2019ll now turn to Slide 5 where I outlined the areas that we see most impacting our business in 2009. On the positive side we do expect to significantly reduce our total product costs despite expecting higher material prices. We\u2019ll be able to do this by taking aggressive actions in product redesign; commonization of components; productivity improvements which will positively impact conversion; improvements in quality; and the restructuring benefits of our previously announced activities which related to manufacturing footprint and job reduction.", "The second area which will be positive to our business is the way we\u2019re aggressively attacking our non-product costs, primarily related to SG&A levels and logistics costs. In these areas we\u2019ve taken actions in literally every part of our business by reducing headcount; freezing salaries; reducing some benefits; adhering strict reductions at all travel and all discretionary spending. We\u2019ve also reduced and redirected a portion of our consumer marketing spend to trade marketing. Given the current environment, we believe conversion of point of sale is the most effective use of these investments. ", "In the area of logistics, we\u2019ll benefit from a steep drop in oil and in a low demand environment like we\u2019re seeing we see opportunities to realize lower tariff rates. So in total, we expect SG&A and logistics costs to be substantially lower in 2009 than in 2008.", "The third area we see benefiting our business is through improved price and mix. Again as I said the actions that we\u2019ve taken in 2008 will largely carry forward benefits to 2009. We continue to see favorable mix opportunities with our new product innovation and in the area of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is a growing consumer preference in most markets around the world. And as you know, Whirlpool is the leader in offering the largest number of energy efficient products to the marketplace today.", "We see in this tough demand environment value is a strong buying preference and that energy efficiency as opposed to just lower prices is increasingly seen as a great value offering. Together these things are having a positive impact on our mix. Globally this year we expect to realize approximately two points improvement to our price mix than in 2008.", "The last two areas where we expect to see positive benefits for cash generation are in working capital and capital spend. For 2009 we expect working capital to be a significant source of cash generation. From an overall perspective, lower revenues and unit production although a negative on our P&L will have a positive impact on our working capital.", "In addition, we\u2019re taking very significant actions to reduce inventory while still providing great product availability to our customers. This is made possible due to the reduction of the five manufacturing facilities that I\u2019ve previously discussed and also by having less build up of inventory for major product change overs. ", "Our capital spend will be 10 to 15% lower in 2009 than in 2008. And this will represent a $50 to $100 million improvement in cash generation compared to last year. We have significantly reduced all non-product spend, but and I\u2019d emphasize we are continuing our investments in new product innovation.", "The negative impacts in our business this year are demand; material prices; and currency. Overall globally we expect to see about an 8% decline in our global unit volumes during the year and at current currency rates we anticipate about a $1 billion revenue reduction just from currency translation alone. Lower demand impacts our results in two ways. First there are simply lower gross margin dollars due to lower demand. And second is the negative effect of our fixed cost rates on lower units. We are addressing this and rapidly reducing our fixed cost base to minimize and ultimately offset this impact.", "Material costs in 2009 are expected to be up by about $200 million. Clearly we\u2019ve seen a very positive turn in oil, base metals and steel in some markets compared to what we were seeing in mid-year 2008. The overall increases did increases in some component costs and the carryover effect of the significant mid-year 2008 increases that we incurred. As you all know, there\u2019s a lot of volatility in many of these costs and we anticipate that overall costs will continue to move in relation to overall demand levels.", "The last area which will negatively impact us this year is the overall impact of foreign currency due to the significant moves which we saw in the fourth quarter in all of our major currencies. We see negative impact to these currency moves in our P&L in three different areas. First is simply the translation of our international profits to U.S. dollars. The second is the operating transaction effect between production markets and selling markets. And third we see it for a period of time in certain balance sheet adjustments. ", "In a relatively stable currency market we\u2019d normally have very little P&L impact due to our hedging approach and the natural balance of our business. The rapid and significant moves we saw in the fourth quarter had a very unfavorable impact on our P&L, which you will see in the fourth quarter. But if today\u2019s currency levels remain intact for the full year, we do anticipate an unfavorable impact to our P&L in 2009 in the $100 to $150 million range.", "Let me sum this up by saying that we\u2019re clearly focused on generating cash and reducing costs in every part of the business to align ourselves in this highly volatile environment. We have implemented significant actions to date in all parts of our business and will continue to do even more as we go throughout the year. ", "I\u2019d move now to Slide 6 where we offer our earnings guidance. This year we expect our earnings to be in the $3.00 to $4.00 EPS range for 2009. For the full year we expect to generate positive free cash flow in the $300 to $400 million range. I would emphasize we are basing these projections on the economic environment that we outlined today in the business plans that are currently in place. Clearly there is a lot of volatility and certainly in the economic outlook, and our focus is firmly on taking all actions needed to insure that we succeed during this difficult environment.", "I\u2019ll stop here and turn it over to Mike Todman to update you on the North American business.", "Michael A. Todman", "", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter. As shown on Slide 8, our net sales declined 18% during the quarter to $2.5 billion with U.S. industry demand for key seven appliances declining approximately 10%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, our sales decreased 16%. ", "While we had been experiencing lower demand in the U.S. through the first nine months of the year, we had been having more favorable industry demand in Mexico and Canada on a relative basis. During the fourth quarter we saw these trends deviate significantly from the first nine months. For the quarter, the U.S. business was potentially in line with our previous outlook while Mexico and Canada experienced declines that were greater than our previous expectations. Overall, our year-over-year volume declined substantially during the fourth quarter.", "As we had discussed with you on our third quarter call after strong market momentum during the first half of the year we experienced lower volumes during the third quarter due to announced and implemented price increases. While we experienced continued volume pressure during the fourth quarter, we did see a marked improvement in our share on a sequential basis. As we have previously noted, we are seeing the most pressure with our value brands which have the largest percentage increases in price.", "During the quarter we reported an operating loss of $20 million. The decline to profit was due to significantly lower revenue; costs associated with adjusting our production to the demand environment; and higher material and oil related costs. In addition, we had an unfavorable impact of $32 million due to a supplier related product recall. These factors were partially offset by favorable price mix; ongoing cost reduction initiatives; and a $23 million gain related to the sale of an asset.", "On Slide 9 we provide our industry outlook for 2009 and some background on the components of demand. Our forecast calls for new housing demand to reduce industry growth by approximately four points in 2009 based on a 35% decline in new home completions. In addition, we expect existing home sales to decline 9% during the year. We expect discretionary spends to decline given that lower consumer confidence and high unemployment are expected to persist throughout most of 2009.", "In addition, given the general consumer unease we continue to expect to see some consumers delaying replacement purchases even for appliances that are beyond repair. However, we should note that many of our products are considered basic necessities by consumers and any purchases that can be delayed ultimately will be replaced. As a result, we believe that these buyers will return to the marketplace as some of the broader economic concerns subside.", "Based on current estimates of these key economic variables, we believe that the U.S. industry demand will decline 10% in 2009 with continued high levels of uncertainty. Slide 10 shows that 2009 will mark the fourth consecutive year of a U.S. industry decline. In addition, the magnitude of this downturn is now projected to be the worst on record with the major appliance industry contracting by approximately 11 million units over a four year timeframe. As this chart depicts, overall industry demand is forecast at its lowest level since 1998.", "Finally, given this challenging demand environment I would like to turn to our key priorities for North America in 2009 on Slide 11. These priorities are to appropriately adjust our production levels and inventories to expected demand levels; manage all costs across our business including manufacturing and supply chain costs through focused lean activities; organization and SG&A costs; and all other costs that do not impact making, selling and distributing our appliances. We will also continue to execute previously announced restructuring plans in the areas of reduced labor and production capacity. ", "And finally, to optimize our volume and price mix in the marketplace. As you know we have executed cost based price increases in 2008 and have announced an additional 8 to 10 price increase effective January 1, 2009. While we continue to expect to realize favorable price mix during the year, we will balance this with optimizing volumes and insuring that we provide consumers with great value.", "Finally, with regard to our consumers and trade partners we will continue to accelerate our disciplined and systematic approach to deliver the right product at the right value. This is particularly evident in the area of providing consumers with the widest array of energy efficient products. We have always believed that energy efficiency and consumer value go hand-in-hand and this has allowed us to provide the most energy efficient products to the marketplace for many years. ", "During 2008 as you may know we received the Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award for the ninth time over the past ten years. We currently offer approximately 600 Energy Star qualified appliances, more than any other appliance manufacturer. Today these products offer consumers an outstanding value which provides substantial reduction in lifetime ownership costs.", "All of our actions are focused on providing consumers with the greatest value by offering brands they can depend on with the most innovative features in the most cost efficient manner. We are in a challenging period where we are facing low demand but have urgently taken the steps necessary for our business to perform during this difficult economic time.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Yes. Let me turn to Slide 13 to discuss our international business. Here too in our global international markets we saw deterioration at different levels in terms of economic activity in the different markets in the regions. Our results were once again unfavorably impacted by exchange rates on both sales and in operating profit, but also from significantly lower demand levels particularly in Europe.", "Our Latin America-Asian businesses delivered very good results even though the growth of these markets either slowed or declined. I\u2019d speak then on Slide 14 to Europe where European revenue decreased by 16% in dollars for the quarter and local currency declined 7% from the previous year. Industry shipments, however, declined approximately 10% year-over-year. Our operating profit had a significant decline to $2 million positive in the fourth quarter. ", "Our results were heavily impacted by unfavorable fluctuations in currency; significantly higher material costs; and then of course these sharply lower production rates which were significantly lower than our sales decline. ", "Turning to Slide 15, our Latin America business revenues again in dollars decreased 26% in quarter. Excluding the impact of currency our sales were down about 14% but that varies very differently in different parts of the business. These results reflect a much lower demand in the Latin America market outside of Brazil. Brazil was fairly steady. And we also saw a large decline in our global compressor operations.", "Operating profit in the period declined by about 30% to $110 million. Our results here, too, were impacted by unfavorable currency; lower revenues; and higher material costs. We were able to partially offset these negative impacts with favorable price mix and overall cost reductions.", "On Slide 16 we reflect our Asia business. Here our sales in dollars declined 10%. Excluding currency our sales increased about 7% due to higher volumes and a very favorable price mix. We had a positive operating profit in the quarter of $3 million compared to the previous year loss. And again this year-over-year improvement in profit came from the higher volumes; favorable productivity; and price mix. Here too we had negative material costs and unfavorable currency impact.", "To provide you with a broad outlook at our international business on Slide 17, I would say based on what we currently see in terms of the economic conditions we anticipate these markets, too, to remain somewhat challenging and expect that in Europe for example full year industry demand is expected to decline by about 8% from 2008. We expect demand in Latin America in terms of shipments to be flat to down about 5%. And also the same in Asia, flat to down about 5%.", "So with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Roy for the financial review.", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Beginning on Slide 19 I\u2019ll walk you through a summary of our fourth quarter performance. From a top line perspective we saw significant weakness across most major markets during the fourth quarter. Industry declines in our largest markets North America and Europe were the most severe during the fourth quarter. In addition to the decline in global unit volume, we experienced a significant revenue decline as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.", "On the positive side of the ledger we did see continued favorable gains from positive price mix during the fourth quarter. From a margin perspective we had positive impacts from our price mix and SG&A cost reduction actions. More than offsetting these positive impacts were higher material and oil related costs; lower global unit volumes; and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.", "Finally, we monetized $38 million of BPX tax credits during the quarter and recorded asset sales gains of $43 million. From an expense standpoint, we recorded $77 million of restructuring expenses and $32 million of expenses related to a product recall.", "Turning to the income statement on Slide 20, during the quarter we reported revenues of $4.3 billion down 19% from the previous year. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation accounted for six points of the decline and was predominantly related to the appreciation of the dollar against the Brazilian real and euro. In addition to this weakness however we had unfavorable effects across most of our major currencies.", "Our gross margin contracted 4.7 points to 11% for the quarter. Our gross margin was impacted by three main areas; significantly lower unit production volumes, higher raw material and oil based costs, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Material and oil related costs increased $165 million during the quarter. These items were partially offset by favorable price mix which was significantly positive during the quarter.", "SG&A expenses decreased $135 million to $379 million in the quarter. The variance was largely driven by lower SG&A expenses related to cost reduction initiatives and lower overall incentive compensation expense. Foreign currency translation and asset sale proceeds accounted for approximately 40% of the dollar improvement.", "During the quarter we recorded $77 million of restructuring charges related to our previously announced programs compared to $15 million in the previous year. Our fourth quarter restructuring expense resulted in a 1.8 point reduction in our operating margin. As a result of the items I just discussed, operating profit totaled $10 million compared with $332 million in the prior year. The combination of higher restructuring costs; unfavorable foreign currency exchange movement; and higher material and oil related costs accounted for approximately 80% of the year-over-year reduction in operating income.", "Turning to Slide 21, our other expenses had an unfavorable impact of $23 million mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange during the quarter. Moving to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax benefit of $160 million during the quarter compared to an income tax expense of $39 million in the prior year. The year-over-year benefit is predominantly related to the recognition of energy tax credits and lower North American income during the fourth quarter.", "Slide 22 illustrates our working capital results for the quarter. Our working capital balance improved during the fourth quarter when compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our working capital levels were roughly flat with the prior year. ", "Now I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss our free cash flow performance on Slide 23. For the full year, we reported free cash flow usage of $101 million compared to free cash flow generation of $521 million in the prior year. The unfavorable variance is largely attributable to lower cash earnings compared with the prior year and unfavorable variances in working capital. Our 2009 capital spending is expected to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million.", "Turning to Slide 24 I\u2019d like to spend a moment on our liquidity position. First we had $247 million outstanding under our $2.2 billion revolving credit facility and we were in full compliance with our covenants. This is a committed facility maturing in December of 2010 and is comprised of a syndicate of 22 banks. From a long term debt perspective, we have only one significant maturity during 2009 which is our $200 million variable rate note which is due on June 15.", "Now I would like to expand upon a comment included in this morning\u2019s release. We have initiated discussions with banks to seek additional flexibility within our capital structure. We are proactively taking steps to assure our future financial flexibility given the generally negative and highly volatile global economic environment. Given that these discussions are ongoing, I will not be able to comment further on this matter. Should anything change with respect to finalization of a decision on this topic, we ill make a public announcement at the appropriate time.", "Finally, I\u2019d like to turn to our outlook summary on Slide 25. As Jeff mentioned, based upon current economic conditions and business plans we expect to earn between $3to $4 per share during 2009. Slide 25 provides you with some direction on our key operational drivers. We expect to experience significantly lower industry unit volumes during the year. Jeff and Mike detailed our assumptions by region earlier, but we expect North America and Europe to remain the most challenging markets during the balance of the year.", "From a currency standpoint we anticipate a negative impact on our full year results based upon recent exchange rates. Finally, we expect material costs will be unfavorable for the full year. We are currently projecting a $200 million unfavorable impact for the full year 2009. We expect productivity and price mix to be favorable factors during 2009. Productivity is expected to be a significant positive during the year based upon the many factors that Jeff noted earlier. We are currently executing our previously announced restructuring programs as well as a significant amount of additional actions which we expect will drive substantial savings during the year.", "We also expect our global price mix results to be favorable in 2009 as a result of our previously announced pricing actions and ongoing product mix initiatives. Finally I would like to note that we are in a highly volatile global economy and we are providing you with our best available view given the information available to us at this time.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Thanks Roy. Let me take a minute to sum up our comments today. Clearly we are in a very difficult global environment. We are not expecting this to change soon and we do expect to see a lot of volatility throughout this recession. ", "Our top priority is to take all the necessary actions needed to maintain and insure our financial strength and flexibility through this prolonged economic downturn. To do this we\u2019re focusing all of our resources on doing three things very well. The first as I\u2019ve mentioned is to radically reduce our global cost structure and production capacity. In essence, lowering our overall break-even level significantly which will enable us to deliver profitability even in this extreme demand environment that we see today.", "The second area is to drive those actions across the business to generate cash. To insure that we can appropriately invest in our business and at the same time reduce our overall debt levels. And third as we\u2019ve mentioned in a number of cases we will effectively balance our volume, price and mix equation to optimize our overall results. We won\u2019t chase volume in a down market. We also won\u2019t advocate our market position. We clearly have the right tools in the form of great brands and product innovation to achieve our fair share of the market and in the same time improve our margins with our price and mix actions.", "Finally I would say that I do believe we understand the global dynamics of every part of our business and we are in the midst of a very negative economic period that again we\u2019re not expecting to change soon. We will take, have taken and will continue to take all necessary actions to insure we deliver the best possible results during this period, providing very importantly we also will be partaking the right actions to insure that we emerge from this economic period as an even stronger company that will have significant value creation upside when we return to a more stable demand environment.", "The actions we\u2019re taking today will significantly lower our overall cost structure and breakeven point. Our brands, our product innovation and our overall business execution will only get better during this challenging period. And I believe with these fundamentals in place we\u2019ll be in a great position when the global economy does recover to do what we would consider more normal economic growth levels.", "So let me end here and I would now like to open this up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Very good sir. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "First off and I guess this would be the 800 pound guerrilla in the room. Jeff with demand falling off as it is and you\u2019re asking for pricing as much as others in the industry are, what have you seen thus far in terms of the stickiness of the pricing? And help us with your expectations. I know you\u2019re expecting two points for positive pricing in mix for the year, but help us reconcile when on the one hand very difficult business environment and on the other hand the need to get pricing and the likelihood of receiving that.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Sam, in fact a large number of these actions have been in place for several months. So we\u2019ve got pretty good data in parts of the world whether it be Latin America and Asia, parts of Europe, parts of North America and we did in some markets early on lose some market share based on that. Without exception all of these markets are to date they are retaining this price mix and we are recovering systematically the market share through our other actions like new product innovation and our point of sales conversion work.", "We have scaled down our expectations since October, September when we thought material costs were going to be dramatically higher than where we see them today. We\u2019ve taken some of this and reinvested it with the trade in terms of conversion and trying to not only bring some consumers in to shops but to convert them once we get them in. ", "So I would say to date we have a pretty good \u2013 some cases a month, same cases two to three months where we have a pretty good idea what the run rate is with all this. And I think they\u2019re pretty much aligned with the expectations that we shared with you.", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Sam, its Roy. Just to give you a little perspective to Jeff\u2019s comment on run rate for 2008 we ended the year with about 1.5 points of positive price mix. We came out of the year though in Q4 with 2.7 points of positive price mix. Basically 50-50 Sam between price and mix, just to give you a little bit of perspective in terms of run rate.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "Second question and you just referred to this a little bit, Jeff, but in North America looks like the value brands you might have lost same share, then Latin America looks like you lost share again. Was that as a result of the increased pricing? Or is that something fundamentally happening in the industries and at what point do you expect the share particularly in North America and Latin America to stabilize?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Well let me talk about that and then I\u2019ll let Mike talk about the U.S. First of all as we talked before in the U.S. we took a fairly substantial mid-year price increase. We had a very strong share position for Q1 and Q2 last year. We took a fairly strong price \u2013 a much needed but strong price increase mid-year. We lost share in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter we improved our share versus third quarter but year-over-year it was still down. So the trends were going in the right direction. I would say in the U.S. and in terms of Latin America we\u2019ve [inaudible] share. ", "In fact for the year we actually increased share for the regions. We did in any given month I think in September and perhaps October we might have lost a little bit of share in Brazil but by year-end that had largely come back. And we\u2019re in a pretty good position there.", "Michael A. Todman", "", "This is Mike. Let me just add on to what Jeff said. As you know we had a lot of momentum in the first half of the year. As Jeff said we implemented the price increase in mid-year. We have seen sequentially in all our major brands improvement in share from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and frankly we\u2019re expecting those trends to continue in the first quarter of the year. So that we get back to the share levels that we\u2019re comfortable with. They may be slightly below last year but they certainly will be sequentially improved with over even the fourth quarter. ", "And what we are doing with our pricing is selectively assuring that we provide the right value to consumers. And that is driving appropriate price mix in the marketplace.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "My last question and I suppose this would be to Roy trying to go through your free cash flow guidance and trying to determine what working capital as a source of funds might be, I mean you have $225 to $300 million in net income, about $100 million in the lighter CapEx versus depreciation, you have $75 million in asset sales \u2013 there\u2019s going to be some takes to that. I\u2019m guessing that the pension contributions, the cash restructuring over the expense, but I\u2019m trying to figure out what the other line items in the cash flow statement might be to give us a sense of where \u2013 of how much of it is from de-cap and how much of it is operating.", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Sure Sam. Let me \u2013 I\u2019ll start with your first question and then I\u2019ll come back and touch upon pension and your question on restructuring cash as well. First of all you\u2019ve got the big components right. When you look at our cash earnings and you look at the delta between depreciation and amortization and CapEx it\u2019s somewhere around $375 million of true cash earnings. ", "And if you look at what we\u2019re committed to in the way of benefit funding and I\u2019ll come back and specify that for you, but benefit funding if you look at the hedge commitments we have outstanding and the cash flows related to those, and then you look at our standard accruals for restructuring, warranty, etc., you end up with about $50 to $100 million of positive cash left over in terms of those commitments relative to the overall cash earnings.", "Then as we said in our release this morning we\u2019ll have between $50 and $100 in asset sales and then Sam that leaves you with roughly $200 million of favorable cash coming out of working capital. Jeff talked about this. I talked about it in our script. We plan to hold working capital at a minimum flat with the current year. We ended Q4, Sam, with 10.0% working capital as a percent of sales.", "What that means is we have to take tough actions and Jeff talked about this in his comments in terms of managing the inventories down with lower demands. But as we do that obviously that\u2019s a natural source of cash generation for the company in 2009. ", "Now your questions on pension specific, Sam, our funding pensions specific and again this is based on our own policy and the latest policy changes that we understand coming out of Washington would be $80 million of funding in 2009. And from a restructuring commitment, Sam, we\u2019re looking at cash \u2013 we ended up using $20 million in Q4 as we indicate on our last call we came in right at the $20. We\u2019ll use about $65 million in 2009 and then the remaining $25 million to cash related to restructuring will happen in 2010.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "So your free cash flow already includes the cash contribution that you\u2019re going to be making to the pension over and above the P&L impact?", "Roy W. Templin", "", "It does, Sam. That\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "Can you provide a little more color on Latin America? I think the revenues were down sharply relative to what the trend has been there and I guess I\u2019d like to understand a little more what\u2019s within that and your conviction on 2009. And then also how the tax credits should play out in an environment now where the revenues seem like perhaps they\u2019re contracting there.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Yes, Eric, let me give you a quick snapshot here. You know first of all think about our Latin America business as three different parts. There\u2019s our global compressor operations in Embraco and [inaudible]; there\u2019s our Brazilian appliance business and then there\u2019s the 32 appliance market outside of Brazil within that Latin America. You know in terms of kind of fourth quarter and so on I would say that compressor operations face a significant decline in demand which you would expect given that they saw the OEM\u2019s who if they were like us were rapidly reducing their inventories.", "And I would say also the large international markets, those markets outside of Brazil, had a fairly steep decline in demand. Our Brazil business was actually fairly flat to solid if you will and was least impacted during that period of time. So those are the three components. As for going forward, I do think the first part of the year as people continue to adjust inventories and the general overall state of demand that we will have decline in our compressor operations. ", "The Latin America markets outside of Brazil on one hand they\u2019re diverse so you have a lot of complementary nature to it. On the other hand they\u2019re volatile, so I would say that they will decline. We don\u2019t give a forecast on exactly how much but we see them declining. Brazil we see as again fairly solid, solid meaning no growth if you will. Roy can speak about the BPX but in general the BPX was all driven off the Brazilian business at the exports and we are expecting lower exports which is reflected in our BPX.", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Yes, Eric its Roy. Good morning. Eric a couple of comments with respect to BPX, first just a little bit of background perspective as you will recall we export about 70% of our compressors and 10 to 20% of the appliances that we produce in Brazil. The BPX credits are really an offset to a tax called the IPI tax which in essence is very similar to a value added tax, which each of those taxes are based upon the type of product produced with laundry having the most significant tax all the way down to microwave and air con which have no IPI tax associated with them.", "As we look at 2009 we do and we have in this guidance forecasted lower overall BPX tax credits. Now part of that Eric is simply due to foreign currency translation. If you noted in my comments we had $38 million of BPX credits this year relative to $49 million in Q4 last year. So that $11 million dealt the bulk of that delta, Eric, was currency driven versus demand or mix driven.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "And then secondly on the working capital situation with the volumes down as much as they are and you talk about maintaining I think inventories flat on a year-over-year basis is there a consideration that you should be doing more than having flat inventories and a sharply lower global unit environment?Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Yes, Eric, actually my [inaudible] said. \u201cWait,\u201d he said. If we only kept our working capital as a percent to sales flat we would yield X. We clearly intend to yield cash out of working capital and reduce inventories both in absolute dollars but also in rate. So our two big levers there are to your point lower demand and revenues with the same percentage would yield a cash from working capital, but in addition we expect inventory rates to be better therefore generating even more working capital than just percentage wise.", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Yes, I think the other relative comment, Eric, with respect to working capital as you transition from \u201908 to \u201909 you saw on our cash flow statement this morning and you\u2019ll see more details I know when we file our 10-K, but obviously our payables position at the end of 2008 was significantly lower than 2007 and frankly significantly lower than where it typically is because of the fact that we took down 20% of our production in both North America and Europe. And so that\u2019s another key item with respect to the roll over year-over-year on working capital.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "I have a couple of questions actually but the first question just was hoping if you could give us some more granularity on the cost actions in terms of the benefits you expect for \u201909 and specifically how it would affect the different regions? And sort of what you\u2019ve taken already that would benefit into \u201909 and what contractions that you might take and if possible to give that to some degree on a regional basis.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Michael, this is Jeff. Actually I\u2019ll give you the totals. I\u2019m not sure I can break it down regionally sitting right here. But what I did say was because I would say all these are proportional because we\u2019re doing aggressive things around the world is that if you remember in my remarks I said we will significantly reduce our product costs. That would imply that all these actions I outlined have to be greater than the $200 million of raw material cost increases we expect plus the volume impact of conversion which is fairly substantial. ", "So and what I talked about was product redesign \u2013 in other words, products we\u2019re coming out with are redesigned with less material content in them. Commonization of components \u2013 with every one of our new mega projects they\u2019re developed on a global basis and we have a dramatic simplification of components and more global scale on those components. We continue to aggressively deliver lean manufacturing initiatives in all our global manufacturing facilities which is a plus. We expect the cost of quality to go down as our quality continues to get better.", "And then we\u2019ve got and I don\u2019t have the exact number in front of me but the overall restructuring benefits we talked about last fall we will be delivering either in the form of product cost reduction if they\u2019re product related or in SG&A if they\u2019re SG&A related. So in total again what I\u2019m saying is they have to overcome the negatives which are the $200 million raw materials and the volume.", "On the SG&A logistics side again these are significant and I don\u2019t want to break out but it\u2019s between $200 and $300 million of lower costs in SG&A when just combined year-over-year. So if you think about that that\u2019s \u2013 and again these are directionally the same in all regions although I would say probably that the biggest beneficiary of these is in North America.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "Before I just hit on my next question also on some of the big pluses and minuses for next year, you know you were good enough to give your view on raw materials that would be a net $200 million but I would assume that perhaps it might be a bigger net negative in the first half of the year and perhaps even a slight positive in the back half of the year. I was wondering if you could give us a view on how you\u2019re thinking first half, second half or even quarter-by-quarter.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "I think the important thing you think about here is the significant run up \u2013 you know it was only July when oil was at $147 a barrel. And spot steel prices were $1,100, $1,200 a ton. So parts of our business had significant mid-year onward price increases, so from that perspective they actually will have \u2013 they had a run up in Q3 and Q4, they will have declines versus Q4 declining costs, but quarter over quarter, year-over-year they\u2019ll be substantially higher. So a little bit how this plays out for the year I would say generally speaking to your point, on a year-over-year basis we\u2019ll have higher material \u2013 the majority of it in the first half and very little in the second half.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "I was wondering also if you could give a little bit breakdown on the tax rate what was going on there in the fourth quarter. I believe you had guided to the full year being about a \u2013 and correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, roughly like a 38% benefit and that on our numbers got us somewhere around the $130 million benefit and it came in for the full year of $200 million or so. I was wondering if you could kind of walk through the changes there and also what type of tax rate you\u2019re expecting in \u201909 and \u2018010.", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Sure, Michael. It\u2019s Roy. First of all you\u2019re right we guided to roughly a minus 40% tax rate for the year at the end of Q3 and we ended up at minus 82. And Michael that entire miss is almost entirely driven by the lower overall EPT that we had in the quarter relative to what we said we thought we were going to have when we did our guidance in October. ", "With respect to next year\u2019s tax rate we estimate that rate Michael between 5 and 10%. And the key drivers as you think about sort of the typical statutory rate of 35%, we\u2019ve got a 15 point reduction for the energy tax credits. We\u2019ve got about a five point reduction coming from the BPX that we\u2019re projecting for next year. And then about a five point reduction coming from tax planning initiatives that we have under way that will impact 2009. ", "And then the difference between the five and the ten Michael will ultimately be determined upon the overall dispersion of our income. Right now we are projecting more dispersion to lower tax countries which would give us a little bit of a benefit with respect to our rate next year.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "And you think that five to 10% range you may be closer to 10% if North America rebounds a little bit? But that type of a number for 2010 as well or would any of those other initiatives, the energy or the tax planning initiatives fade in the out year?", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Well, as we said on the last call we think and we\u2019ve estimated that we\u2019ll earn about $100 million of tax credits in \u201908, \u201909 and \u2018010. But beyond that, Michael, I can\u2019t really comment on the 2010 tax rate at this point.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "Where were the other gains on sale? You had $43 million for the quarter over all. I think you only broke it out in North America.", "Roy W. Templin ", "", "Yes, we had 23 in gross margin and $20 million roughly in the other income other expense, Michael. Excuse me, in SG&A. I\u2019m sorry.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "But regionally though?", "Michael A. Todman", "", "Europe and the U.S.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David MacGregor - Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "You talked about your manufacturing being down about 20% on the quarter. I was just wondering if you could quantify for us the impact on the P&L from the plant idlings and the curtailments?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Dave I can\u2019t give you an exact number other than to say \u2013 I mean, simplest thing is if you take our production over our fixed costs in manufacturing you know the per unit rate was quite substantial. It varies factory by factory place in the world in total but it was a substantial number. I can\u2019t quantify it for you.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "How achievable was \u2013 you talked earlier about getting your breakeven down significantly. What\u2019s an achievable number?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Well, as I told you think of it two ways. All of our fixed costs in manufacturing are reflected in our product costs and we said that we would have significant product cost reduction overcoming increases in raw materials and the volume effect of less manufacturing. So I would say our product cost reductions are going to be a substantial number. If you just do the math and relate it to our earnings you\u2019d see it would have to be over $500 million just on the product side. ", "And then I gave you the SG&A logistics number. You ought to think of the largest portion of SG&A as fixed cost base and a portion of logistics at a fixed cost base. And I said that\u2019d be near $300 million. So it is a big number. And we think it\u2019s very achievable and appropriate for this environment.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "You talked about the raw material costs being up $200 million year-over-year, raw material and energy related. How much of that is yet to be negotiated or how much of that is pretty much locked up at this point?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "I\u2019d break it out in a couple of ways. I would say in principle you know North America and Europe generally have more locked in contracts although they\u2019re very few contracts that even go a year anymore. A lot of them are indexed to whatever their raw material element is. But we have I would say the large majority of those things in place, which mean they\u2019re at some level but within a band of variability, let\u2019s say on a quarterly basis. ", "Probably the two things out there that are more variable is outside of Europe and North America and largely in the emerging markets steel is generally a daily, weekly, monthly negotiation if you will. And in oil related as I just mentioned logistics obviously is adjusted a lot faster. So I don\u2019t know a percentage but I\u2019ve got to believe we\u2019ve got probably 80% of our costs at least defined within a band today.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "And then just on the two covenants, can you give us an update? I know that you don\u2019t have full visibility on the elements of those covenant calculations.", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Yes, David, it\u2019s Roy. David with respect to covenants let me say a couple of things. One we have $247 million out on our revolver at the end of the year. We were in full compliance with our covenants. David as we looked at the volatility both in the global demand levels and particularly the volatility that we saw in the fourth quarter with respect to currency, we proactively initiated discussions with the banks to take steps to insure we had more flexibility with respect to both our financial flexibility and liquidity. ", "I really can\u2019t say a whole lot more than that at this point in time, David, other than we had less cushion than we felt comfortable with given the volatility that we\u2019re seeing, particularly in the last quarter of the year. And so again we proactively launched those discussions with the banks.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Dave, just let me add to that as well. You know what I said and we firmly believe our number one priority is to insure the financial strength and flexibility of this company during this prolonged downturn. And to Roy\u2019s point you know there\u2019s a lot of unknowns out there. You know how long and how deep will this demand part of this recession last. As you saw in the fourth quarter currency swings at 20 to 50% within the quarter. The complete \u2013 the volatility in the material costs market. ", "You know all of those things combined just gave us the belief that anything we do to enhance our flexibility is good and that\u2019s to Roy\u2019s point that\u2019s why we really entered into some of these discussions.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "Now on your covenants I realize you\u2019re in discussion with your bankers now and I don\u2019t want to sort of press you on a point that\u2019s going to complicate those discussions but your debt to EBITDA covenant was less than 3.0. Your interest coverage was greater than 2.0. Did you end the quarter through either of those covenants?", "Roy W. Templin", "", "No. We were in full compliance with those.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "No. As I said in my comments, David, we were in full compliance with our covenants at the end of the year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investments.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investments", "", "Just a follow up on that, Roy, can you tell us where you are on debt to EBITDA as it\u2019s defined by the credit agreement?", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Jeff, I\u2019m not going to comment as I said to David given where we\u2019re at. I\u2019m not going to comment any further than what I\u2019ve already said beyond we\u2019re in full compliance as of the end of the year.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investments", "", "As the credit agreement stands now, what is the consequence of a covenant break if you don\u2019t succeed in renegotiating?", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Again, Jeff, I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I don\u2019t want to speculate on a covenant break. We are and have been in full compliance with our covenants. And it really isn\u2019t \u2013 it isn\u2019t appropriate for me to comment on what might the actions going forward because again we\u2019ve been fully compliant with our covenants to date.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investments", "", "Can you tell us where your pension deficit actually finished the year?", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Sure I can, Jeff. We ended the year with a deficit of $1.3 billion. As you\u2019ll remember we came out of the year before at $500 million. So our deficit grew by about $800 million Jeff in the year. That was driven off of a negative asset return of about 20% and a lower discount rate in 2009.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investments", "", "And did you go through a year-end exercise on Maytag? You know, market cap today is sitting near what you actually paid for Maytag. I\u2019d have to think there was some impairment discussion going on there.", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Well, I think someone asked me on the last call Jeff with respect to impairment and I said at that point in time we actually do impairment studies both on you\u2019re talking about the intangible assets to good will here. We also do them relative of course to our deferred tax position as well. ", "We do those analyses Jeff on a quarterly basis but of course year-end we do a much more thorough analysis with respect to the value of our intangibles, good will and our overall deferred tax positions. And we did not have any issues for any impairment with respect to those assets at the end of the year. But we did complete very thorough analyses in each of those areas.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investments", "", "The asset sales, what are the origin of these? Are these just kind of random facilities that have become available as you\u2019ve shrunk the footprint? Or is there some certain complexion to what you\u2019re finding to divest in this period?", "Roy W. Templin", "", "It is, Jeff, and as you know we execute the GOP and Jeff talked about the five facilities and we look to streamline our G&A facilities as well and G&A assets. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving these numbers. ", "Now let me clarify because there may have been some confusion on Michael\u2019s question earlier. Again there\u2019s $43 million, $23 of those came through the margin and $20 came through SG&A. So the geography of those, the $23 million that came through gross margin is the North America benefit and the $20 million again related to other corporate assets that came through SG&A. And you\u2019ll find that in other corporate or other in eliminations which is that last line on our key stats worksheet. So it\u2019s not in a region per se, it\u2019s in the corporate center.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Laura Champine - Cowen and Company.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company", "", "I just wanted to confirm that I heard Roy say that you expect pension contributions of $80 million. And then had a question on your thoughts on continuing to pay the $1.72 dividend.", "Roy W. Templin", "", "Laura, you are correct. The pension contribution for this year \u201909 is estimated to be $80 million.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Yes and Laura this is Jeff. Regarding the dividend obviously our board determines our dividend level. We\u2019ve made no changes to date. Amongst all the things we look at all the time, we consider it and again to date we\u2019ve made no changes.", "Greg Fritz", "", "Thank you.", "Jeff M.

For opening remarks and introductions I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations Greg Fritz; please go ahead sir.", "Greg Fritz", "Thank you Kevin and good morning, welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation First Quarter Conference Call.  Joining me are Jeff Fetig our Chairman and CEO, Mike Todman President of Whirlpool North America and Roy Templin our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations.  Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10K and 10Q.

Listeners are directed to Slide 32 for additional disclosures regarding this item.", "Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investor section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.  With that let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fetig", "Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.  I think you\u2019ve seen earlier this morning we released our first quarter financial results.  Now I\u2019d like to give you an update and a summary of where we are.", "For the first quarter net sales came in at $3.6 billion, which were down 23% over the first quarter of 2008.  This decline was driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and significantly lower unit sales volumes.  At a constant exchange rate revenues declined by about 14% due to lower demand.  ", "Our earnings per share came in at $0.91 per share compared with the $1.22 that we reported last year and while there are several moving parts in the quarter we did see very strong year over year improvement in our North American and Asia businesses where our overall operating margins improved and margins remain strong in Latin America and declined in Europe.", "For the quarter free cash flow improved by $73 million year over year despite sharply lower production volumes.  Overall I believe we made very good progress in our cost reduction initiatives throughout the company.  We continue to execute our previously announced restructuring actions and made significant progress through all the key cost reduction areas that we\u2019ve targeted.", "If you turn to Slide Four here we list the key factors impacting our business.  These are the ones which we outlined on our last call and today I want to provide you with an update on where we are today.", "On the positive side we are on track to significantly reduce total product cost.  We\u2019ve taken swift and aggressive actions through product redesign in moving towards global standards for parts and components.  We\u2019ve also implemented productivity and quality improvements, which are positively impacting our conversion rates and we\u2019re also realizing the restructuring benefits from what we\u2019ve previously announced relating to manufacturing footprint relocations and overall job reductions.", "The second area that we are aggressively attacking is non-product cost primarily related to our SG&A levels.  Our efforts during the quarter to reduce headcount and decrease spending in most areas are yielding very good results.  In total we reduced our first quarter SG&A costs by more than 25% in dollar terms and we also reduced levels as a percent to sales in what was we see one of the most challenging sales decline environments that we\u2019ve seen.", "The third area which is very much benefiting our business is through improved price and mix.  During the first quarter we realized a three point margin improvement as a result of favorable price mix.  While price mix will remain one of our key priorities for the year we expect that the rate of increase that we\u2019ve had will somewhat mitigate itself in the second quarter and the rest of the year.", "There are several reasons for this.  First, we see a somewhat more challenging demand environment than we previously expected.  Secondly, in some markets around the world we see that some consumers are trading down in mix although we\u2019ve had very good success with both our innovative products and our energy efficient products.", "Finally we begin comping against positive price mix numbers in the second quarter and beyond so although you\u2019ll see a reduction in year over year percentages as the year progresses overall we continue to expect that strong price mix management will be an important contributor to our margin expansion for the year.", "The two other areas where we expect to see continued positive benefits are in cash generation and they are working capital and capital spending.  From a working capital standpoint we made good progress in managing inventories down during the quarter.  As a result, we were in line with our normal seasonal trend in working capital and we continue to expect working capital to be a significant source of cash generation as we continue to progress throughout the year.", "On the capital side we expect to reduce our capital spend by at least 10% for the full year and our plans remain on track to do this.  We have significantly reduced all non-product capital spend but we\u2019re continuing our investments in new product innovations including some very exciting new product launches in every major product category in all regions of the world throughout the year.", "Innovation does attract consumers to our global portfolio of leading brands and it generates higher margins.  We\u2019re making continued but focused investments in innovation and our global innovation pipeline remains very strong.  ", "We continue to see demand, material costs and currency having a negative impact on our business this year.  There have been some pluses and minuses in each category since our last call however.", "First, I would say that demand is slightly weaker than our previous expectations and I\u2019ll detail that in a moment.  Secondly, we now expect material costs to be modestly better from our previous estimate.  During the first quarter we continued to experience higher material cost but we see a downward trend in prices of some of our key inputs.  There is a lot of volatility in many of these costs and we anticipate that they will continue to mirror demand patterns in the global marketplace.  But on balance I would say that things continue to move in the right direction.", "The third area that I will mention; during the first quarter we saw a lower level of foreign exchange volatility compared to what we experienced in the fourth quarter.  While foreign currency translation remains unfavorable rates have been by and large in line with our expectations. ", "Overall, the factors affecting our business in 2009 remain largely unchanged and we remain focused on generating cash and reducing costs in every part of our business to align to minimize those factors which are having a negative impact on our business.", "Now I\u2019d like to spend a moment on our regional unit demand outlooks, which are shown on Slide Five.  In the US and Europe we\u2019re seeing some signs that demand is stabilizing at lower levels.  We now expect industry volumes to decline by 10% to 12% in the US and in Europe we expect industry demand to decline by about 10%.", "In Latin America based on our current economic outlook we are confirming our previous expectation of appliance industry unit growth in the range of flat to down 5% and in Asia also we expect to remain flat to 5%.", "Moving to Slide Six we can continue to expect for the year our earnings to be in the $3 to $4 per share range and we expect to generate positive free cash flow in the range of $300 million to $400 million.  Of course our projections are based on our current economic assumptions and environment and the plans that we have in place today and while there is some volatility and uncertainty remaining in this economic outlook our focus is firmly on taking all the actions needed to insure that we address this difficult economic environment.", "At this point I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike Todman to update you on North America.", "Michael Todman", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone.  I\u2019ll begin by reviewing North America\u2019s performance in the first quarter.  ", "As shown on Slide Eight our net sales declined 20% during the quarter to $2.1 billion with US industry demand for T7 appliances declining approximately 16%.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange our sales decreased 17%.  While our year over year volume declined substantially during the first quarter we did experience a slowing of the decline as the quarter progressed.  The volume decline was more than offset by favorable price mix and our ongoing cost reduction efforts including reductions in overhead and SG&A costs.  These areas benefited from reduced head count and other cost reduction initiatives that aligned our capacity levels with demand.", "During the quarter we realized an operating profit of $164 million compared to $44 million reported in the prior year quarter.  The improvement in profit was due to favorable price mix, our ongoing cost reduction initiatives and an $87 million gain related to the curtailment of a retiree health savings account.  Results were partially offset by significantly lower production levels, higher material costs and a $23 million expense related to a supplier-related product recall.  Excluding special items our operating margin improved to 4.5% compared with 1.7% in the prior year.", "Turning to Slide Nine I would like to take a moment to discuss the industry demand dynamic during the quarter.  You\u2019ll see that we experienced the most acute US industry demand decline in the first two weeks of the first quarter as many of our trade customers went through a significant de-stocking of inventory.  During the balance of the quarter we saw the rate of decline and industry demand decrease compared with the first two weeks.  In fact, excluding the first two weeks demand declined approximately 12% on a year over year basis versus the approximately 16% reported for the quarter.", "Given the demand in the first quarter as shown on Slide Ten for the full year we now expect US demand to be down in the 10% to 12% range.  Looking at the components of demand we now expect to see a 41% decline in new home completion.  This is down approximately six points from our previous estimate.  Our forecast for existing home sales remains unchanged at a 9% decline.", "In addition, we continue to expect discretionary spending to have a negative impact on overall results as high unemployment levels persist.  Some consumers continue to delay replacement purchases even for appliances that are beyond repair due to the economic uncertainty.  However, many of our products are considered basic necessities by consumers and any purchases that can be delayed ultimately will be replaced.", "As a result, we believe it is just a matter of time before these buyers return to the marketplace and when economic concerns subside we are better positioned than ever before with better products, a heightened focus on energy and water efficiency and even more consumer relevant innovations.", "We are seeing, as evidenced on Slide 11, consumers are purchasing energy efficient appliances.  Energy efficiency represents a great financial value to consumers especially during these tough economic times.  During the quarter we were recognized with the 2009 Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy.  This marks our tenth Energy Star Award and our fourth consecutive Sustained Excellence win.  Today, we offer the widest array of energy and water efficient appliances to the global marketplace.", "Our priorities for 2009 in North America are shown on Slide 12 and we are executing to these priorities.  During the quarter demand levels were less than expected.  We remain focused on appropriately adjusting our production levels and inventory to expected demand levels throughout the year.  ", "Our cost reduction efforts during the quarter were strong.  We are acting with speed as we manage all costs across our business including manufacturing and supply chain costs through focused lean activities, organizational SG&A costs and all other costs that do not impact making, selling and distributing our appliances.  ", "We continue to execute the previously announced restructuring plans in the areas of reduced labor and production capacity.  Production ceased at the Oxford Mississippi plant this month and the close of our Jackson Tennessee facility is scheduled for August.  ", "In addition, we continue to optimize our volumes and price mix in the marketplace by insuring we strike the appropriate balance between volume and realizing our price mix.  We are executing this by continuing to introduce new product innovations in our brands that our trade customers and consumers are benefiting from.", "Yet, despite this focus, given the demand environment we have increased our promotional activity on selected products in the marketplace.  As a result, in the second quarter and for the balance of the year we expect our price mix to be impacted by the lower demand levels and the fact that some consumers are choosing to trade down when it comes to appliances during this period of uncertainty.", "While we continue to balance our volume and price mix beginning in the second quarter year over year comparisons will be against favorable price mix trends in the prior year.  As such, while we expect to continue to see improvement in price mix we do not expect to see the level of year over year improvement we posted during the first quarter.", "Finally, with regard to our consumers and trade customers we will continue to accelerate our disciplined and systematic approach to deliver the right product at the right value.  This is particularly evident as we have already discussed in the area of providing consumers to the efficient products.  We continue to execute our priorities and adjust our business to perform during this challenging economic period.  ", "With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff for his comments on our international operations.", "Jeff Fetig", "I\u2019ll now turn to Slide 14 where we have an overview of our international operations, where our results were somewhat mixed during the first quarter.", "Results were unfavorably impacted by exchanges rates, which lowered both sales and operating profit.  We saw significantly lower demand levels in Latin America markets outside of Brazil and in Europe while our Asia and Brazil businesses delivered very solid results during the first quarter.", "On Slide 15 you\u2019ll see our European business where our European revenue decreased by 26% in the quarter.  In local currency sales declined 12% from the previous year.  Industry unit shipments declined by approximately 14% year over year.  During the quarter we saw weakness across nearly all major markets.  Eastern European countries remain the most challenging.", "Our European operating profit declined to break even levels compared to the $45 million earned in 2008 and again these results were impacted significantly by unfavorable currency changes and sharply lower production rates.  Unfavorable foreign currency accounted for approximately 30% of this decline and our ongoing cost reduction efforts partially offset these results.", "I will turn now to Slide 16 to review our Latin America business where revenues declined by 26% during the quarter.  Excluding the impact again from currency, sales decreased by about 9%.  Appliance results reflect very strong results from Brazil and our performance out-paced the industry during the quarter.  In contrast we saw weak demand from most appliance markets outside of Brazil in the region as well as in our global compressor business, which is feeling the effects of substantially lower demand levels in the US and Europe.", "Overall, our operating profit fell to $57 million compared to $119 million last year.  Our results were adversely impacted again by unfavorable foreign currency, lower unit volumes, higher material costs and a $26 million expense related to an operating tax settlement, which we recorded during the quarter.  Partially offsetting these results were favorable productivity initiatives and other cost reduction efforts.", "There are two additional topics I\u2019d like to mention about our Latin American operations.  First of all, recently the Brazilian government initiated a program aimed at stimulating appliance demand.  This program reduces sales tax levied on products sold and is modeled on a similar program which they instituted earlier this year in the auto industry.  We do expect positive demand benefits in Brazil from this program as a result of lower sales tax rates and in fact we\u2019ve seen some preliminary evidence of a positive impact in pickup in consumer demand.", "From a Whirlpool perspective however, the temporary reduction in this sales tax rate will have an unfavorable impact on our ability to monetize VPX tax credits during the quarter and therefore this will likely have a net negative impact on earnings during the second quarter.", "Second, as we disclosed previously, in February we received a grand jury subpoena from the US Department of Justice requesting documents related to an anti-trust investigation of the global compressor industry.  Whirlpool subsidiaries in Brazil where our compressor business is headquartered and Italy also received requests from authorities seeking similar information.  ", "As we stated then we are fully cooperating with all governmental investigations and we\u2019ve taken actions and we\u2019ll continue to take actions to minimize our potential exposure.", "As you all know, these matters are extremely complex and the timing of this is difficult to predict.  We\u2019re dealing with the laws of several different jurisdictions around the world, each with its own process and procedures.  The final outcome of these matters will depend and on many factors and variables.  Today it\u2019s premature for us to speculate as to the potential outcomes at this time and due to the nature of these ongoing investigations we won\u2019t really make further comments on this matter at this time.", "Let me now turn to Slide 17 and talk about the first quarter result of Asia.  Net sales decreased 13% during the quarter.  Excluding the impact of currency sales increased 3% compared with the previous year.  Our operating profit improved to $5 million versus $2 million last year and the year over year increase in operating profit is primarily due to productivity improvements and favorable product price mix.  We did have unfavorable currency impacts, which partially offset these favorable results.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Roy Templin for the financial review.", "Roy Templin", "Thank you Jeff and good morning everyone.  Beginning on Slide 19 I\u2019ll walk you through a summary of our first quarter performance.", "From a top line perspective we saw significant weakness across most major markets during the first quarter with the exception of Brazil, India and China where demand was relatively stable.  Industry declines in our largest markets, North America and Europe, were the steepest we have experienced since the beginning of the recession.  In addition to the decline in global unit volume as we previously communicated to you we experienced a significant revenue decline as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. ", "One of the notable bright spots within this challenging macroeconomic environment was price mix.  From a margin perspective we had positive impacts from our price mix and the enterprise-wide cost reductions we previously communicated to you.  Offsetting the substantial positives were sharply lower global unit production volumes, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and higher material and oil-related cost.", "Finally we monetized $35 million of DTX tax credits during the quarter and recorded several special items during the quarter, which I will now discuss on Slide 20.", "This schedule outlines the impact of special items during the quarter.  On the favorable side we\u2019ve recorded an $89 million benefit related to the indefinite suspension of the annual credit to retiree health savings accounts.  In addition, we adopted the modified units of production depreciation method during the first quarter, which resulted in a favorable P&L impact of $8 million.", "For the full year we expect this change will favorably impact our results by approximately $74 million based upon our current production forecast.  We feel the units of production method better reflects the usage of assets with revenue generation from the assets and is a preferred method relative to the straight line method.", "We had several unfavorable special items during the quarter that more than offset these favorable factors.  ", "First, we agreed to the settlement of a previously disclosed operating tax case in Brazil.  This had a total pretax impact of $42 million during the quarter.  As you will note from this chart we recorded this amount in several line items including $13 million in interest expense.  Second, we incurred $24 million of restructuring charges during the quarter related to our previously announced programs.  Third, we recorded a $23 million charge related to a product recall that we announced in March.  Finally, we incurred $21 million of cost in our interest and sundry expense related to legal cost and a mark to market loss from a commodities derivative contract.", "Turning to the income statement of Slide 21, during the quarter we reported revenues of $3.6 billion, down 23% from the previous year.  The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation accounted for nine points of the decline and was predominantly related to the appreciation of the dollar against the Brazil Real and the Euro.  In addition to this weakness however, we continued to see unfavorable effects across most of our major currencies.  ", "Our gross margin increased 1.4 points to 14.7% for the quarter.  Even excluding the special items noted previously our gross margin improved on a year over year basis despite losing nearly one quarter of our revenue base.  This achievement was predominantly driven by significant improvements in our price mix and progress in our previously announced restructuring and cost reduction initiatives.  ", "These favorable items were partially offset by substantial declines in global unit production, which resulted in significant unfavorable productivity variances.  We also experienced substantial unfavorable variances in foreign exchange and material cost during the quarter.", "SG&A expenses decreased $113 million to $327 million in the quarter.  The variance was largely driven by lower SG&A expenses related to cost reduction initiatives.  Foreign currency translation and the retiree medical plan change accounted for approximately $41 million of the improvement.  Notably, our SG&A improved as a percentage of sales to 9.2% from 9.5% in the previous year despite the significant drop in revenues.", "During the quarter we reported $24 million of restructuring charges related to our previously announced programs compared to $8 million in the previous year.  As a result of the items I just discussed operating profit totaled $166 million compared with $159 million in the prior year.  Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an unfavorable impact of $34 million on our operating income during the quarter, which more than offset the $24 million of net benefits of special items during the quarter.", "We are pleased with this performance given the sharp reduction in revenues during the quarter.", "Turning to Slide 22 our Other Expense had an unfavorable impact of $47 million during the quarter related to foreign currency exchange, legal costs, higher mark to market losses on derivative instruments, an operating tax settlement and other items.  As noted on a previous chart approximately $24 million of these costs were related to special items recorded in the first quarter.", "Moving to our tax rate; we reported an income tax benefit of $16 million during the quarter compared to an operating tax expense of $3 million in the prior year.  The year over year benefit is predominantly related to lower year over year pretax income and the corresponding impact of various tax credits.", "Slide 23 illustrates our working capital results for the quarter.  Our working capital balance improved during the first quarter compared to the prior year on a total dollar basis.  As a percentage of sales however, it increased 2.3 points as sales declined substantially from the prior year.", "Our inventory balance was down on both a sequential and year over year basis during a quarter where we traditionally build significant inventory.  The most significant unfavorable variance was largely driven by accounts payable.  ", "As you know, we reduced our production levels significantly during the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter.  As such, we have significantly reduced our purchases.  This has had a substantial impact on our first quarter payables balance.  Going forward as our production rates stabilize we expect to see our payables balance return to normal and have a positive impact on our cash flow for the remainder of the year.", "Now I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss our free cash flow performance on Slide 24.  For the quarter we reported free cash flow usage of $371 million compared to a usage of $444 million in the prior year.  The favorable variance is largely attributable to lower outflows in other operating accounts, which is primarily related to lower promotional, warranty and incentive compensation payments.", "During the quarter we had a one-time payment of $26 million related to a global multi-year IT licensing agreement that will not recur for the remainder of the year.  For the full year our capital spending is expected to remain in the range of $450 million to $500 million.  ", "On Slide 25 we look at our first quarter cash flow in the context of our five-year average.  As many of you know we traditionally have our weakest free cash flow generation during the first quarter as working capital, promotion and other payments represent a significant use of cash.", "As you can see, our first quarter cash flow was largely in line with our historical average.  We traditionally generate a significant amount of cash flow in the remaining nine months of the year and our expectation for this year we feel with some of the unusual variances in our accounts payable due to our decision to have strong inventory controls we believe we are in a good position to generate significant working capital benefits for the remainder of the year as production rates normalize.  As such, our full year outlook for free cash flow is unchanged at $300 million to $400 million.", "Turning to Slide 26 I would like to spend a moment on our liquidity position.  We had $656 million outstanding under our $2.2 billion revolving credit facility and we are in full compliance with our covenants.  From a long-term debt perspective we have only one significant maturity during 2009, which is our $200 million variable rate note, which is due on June 15th.  ", "As we announced earlier we successfully amended our credit facility during the first quarter.  This amendment resulted in a half-turn improvement in both our leverage and interest coverage covenants, which now stand at 3.5 times and 1.5 times respectively.", "In addition, we gained additional relief from the exclusion of up to $100 million of cash restructuring cost from our income calculations and $200 million of derivative positions from our debt calculation.", "Finally, I\u2019d like to turn to our outlook summary on Slide 27.  As Jeff mentioned, based on current economic conditions and our plans we expect to earn $3 to $4 per share during 2009.  As you might expect, there have been several moving parts to our underlying assumptions as the quarter progressed.", "On the positive side, we have three effects that I would like to discuss.  First, as I mentioned earlier, we have adopted the modified units of production depreciation method, which results in a favorable $74 million impact for the full year.  Second, we now expect a full-year tax benefit of approximately 15% to 25%.  As you know, given our lower levels of pretax income the various credits we record significantly impact our rates from quarter to quarter.  Finally, we are seeing some improvement in our expected material costs for the full year.  ", "Some unfavorable items I would like to highlight are as follows; as Jeff mentioned earlier, we lowered our full year outlook for demand in North America and Europe.  In addition to the volume adjustment we expect to realize slightly lower price mix than our previous expectation for the balance of the year as Mike discussed earlier.", "As we previously disclosed we amended our credit agreement, which resulted in higher bowering cost and fees and recently the Brazilian government enacted an appliance sale tax program that significantly reduces our payment on these items during the next three months.  While we expect this to have a positive impact on demand in Brazil it will significantly reduce the amount of BTX credits that we will monetize in the second quarter.", "We expect to recognize only a nominal amount of BTX credits in the quarter compared with the $35 million that we recognized in the first quarter.  If this program expires in July as currently legislated we expect to begin to return to more normal utilization levels in the third and the fourth quarter.", "Finally, based on our current outlook for global mix of business we expect unfavorable foreign currency impact to be at the high end of our previously announced range of $100 million to $150 million.  ", "On balance, we expect the previous items to offset and we are leaving our outlook unchanged at $3 to $4 per share.  At this point I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fetig", "Thanks Roy.  Let me sum up our comments today.  Overall, the global economic situation is largely playing out in line with the expectation that we\u2019ve had.  Clearly this is a unique period where we\u2019ve seen significant declines in global consumer demand for the last eight months and rapid volatility in exchange rates.", "Overall I feel quite positive that we move quickly to readjust our business to these economic realities and as I mentioned we have a very strong focus on three things.  One, significant cost reduction across the business, secondly, market execution, which is striking the right economic balance between volume and price and mix and third, driving strong cash generation.", "To date I believe we\u2019re on track on all these and I believe this has been reflected in our first quarter results.  Short term we don\u2019t expect the economic environment to significantly improve although we\u2019re now seeing some stabilization in most markets and by stabilization I mean that the rate of decline in the consumer demand is lessening and that global currencies are trading in a much narrower range.", "Our overall view remains the same.  The first half of 2009 has been and will continue to be a very challenging market from a demand decline perspective.  We do still believe the second half demand levels will improve although still be negative but much less so than we are seeing in the first half of the year.", "We will continue to take very strong actions required to significantly reduce our costs, lower our break even levels and best in winning consumer innovation and generating cash.  These priorities will insure our financial strength and position and position us very well for value creation as demand levels normalize over time.  I\u2019d like to end my comments here and we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you sir [Operator Instructions].  We\u2019ll take our first question from the site of David Macgregor from Longbow Research; your line is open.", "David Macgregor- Longbow Research", "Can you just talk in hopefully quantitative terms about the impact of I guess future cost savings from restructurings that have occurred to date that are not yet reflected in the first quarter results?", "Roy Templin", "David, this is Roy, good morning.  As you look at the benefits from the restructuring we had $25 million of benefit as you know in the fourth quarter of last year.  In 2009, David, we are estimating that we\u2019ll have a total of $165 million in benefit from those actions.  I want to be clear here; the $165 million is not incremental to the $25 million.  It is the cumulative reductions through the end of this year and then through the end of 2010 we think that number will total $230 million of benefit and that will be our run rate going forward David.", "David Macgregor- Longbow Research", "Just with respect to these cost savings, which are pretty impressive I guess what are the elements here beyond depreciation?  Can you talk a little bit about the extent to which its being generated from labor versus head count reductions versus plant closings?  Can you just break it open for us a little bit?", "Jeff Fetig", "Think again going back to what we talked about, think about it in two parts; product and non-product.  In the product area we are getting material productivity from the things I talked about including cost design changes, eliminating material from the product cost, moving to global standards and communizing parts and components and getting more scale from the volume that we have.  Those are the primary drivers of material productivity.", "In our factories in terms of conversion we not only have lean manufacturing activities but quality improvements are improving our conversion rates, which are greatly challenged by the volume reductions that we have.  We also are looking at significant improvements in our warehousing and logistics costs and that sort of thing.", "So really, every piece of the business we have under a microscope and we\u2019re managing every both fixed and variable cost to drive savings.  In SG&A, again, it\u2019s a number of items.  As we\u2019ve talked about we have reduced both jobs and benefits.  It\u2019s a very difficult decision but appropriate for this environment.  Spending is also under a microscope and we\u2019re spending only where it\u2019s important to run today\u2019s business and invest in the marketplace today.", "So we have a cost management system that we\u2019ve been building over the last two or three years deployed around the world.  We measure every week, every month, every quarter our cost savings in every part of the business and we are running it at a very strong rate now that we expect to sustain throughout the course of the year.", "David Macgregor- Longbow Research", "Do any of these cost savings put market share at risk?", "Jeff Fetig", "I don\u2019t think so.  We talk about having a balanced approach to the marketplace.  As I look around the world in the first quarter our North America market share was roughly equivalent to fourth quarter so sequentially it was flat with strong VMR.  I think we gained some market share in Latin America.  We gained a few tenths of a point in Europe so we are not taking away investment where it counts for this kind of period.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from the site of Laura Champine from Cowen and Company; your line is open.", "Laura Champine- Cowen and Company", "Good morning, just a couple of things; if you could give the consolidated EBIT impact from foreign exchange and then if you could comment on what\u2019s left in the BPX bucket?  I realize you\u2019ll be recognizing very little in Q2 but if I could get a sense of what\u2019s left over the long term that\u2019d be great.", "Roy Templin", "Sure Laure; Laura, on BPX you\u2019ll see when we file our Q this afternoon we have $518 million remaining in terms of the balance of BPX that you\u2019ll see later today.  ", "Let me talk a little bit about currency, which was the first part of your question and I think we probably captured this a couple places in the script but let me pull it all together.  ", "For the quarter, Laura, we had $44 million of impact at the EBIT level.  We had $34 million negative in operating profit and we had another $10 million negative in other income and other expense.  The bulk of the impact on operating profit is coming from translation.", "As you know, Laura, we really have two buckets that we get impacted from. The first is just as a result of our global footprint where we produce in currencies that is different from the currencies that we might actually have the revenues generated from we obviously have translation.  Then of course we just have the translation of\u2026The bulk of the operating impact in the quarter was coming from translation versus transaction.  Then in OIOE we had about $10 million, which is again the net reduction year over year as the result of balance sheet positions that we hold across the globe in currencies other than that local currency or local functional currency for the operation.", "Laura Champine- Cowen and Company", "Just as a quick follow-on, Roy, what was the total consolidated impact of currency on your earnings a year ago Q1 2008?", "Roy Templin", "If I look at 2008 I don\u2019t know if I have that separate here.  Again, I\u2019m giving you the year over year changes here.  The Other Income Other Expense is ten different and it was a nominal amount in Operating Profit Laura.  I think I remember actually through the three quarters last year it was only $6 million so in the first quarter the operating profit impact had to be a very immaterial number.", "Operator", "The next person in queue is Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James; your line is open.", "Sam Darkatsh- Raymond James", "A couple questions if I might; first off, a clarification question.  Roy, the depreciation is going down by $74 million, which unless I\u2019m misunderstanding something with the accounting standards your Cap ex guidance of 450 to 500 does that mean you\u2019re now spending depreciation in terms of Cap ex because your overall depreciation levels are going down?", "Roy Templin", "Roughly speaking, Sam, that is correct yes.", "Sam Darkatsh- Raymond James", "Why wouldn\u2019t you be under-spending depreciation meaningfully in this type of environment?", "Roy Templin", "Well, again, let me talk a little bit about what we\u2019re spending in Cap ex because if you look at the first quarter on the surface and I made this comment in my script, Sam, but it may not be clear.  ", "If you look at what we traditionally spend in a first quarter sort of year in and year out we typically spend about $85 million in fixed capital in the first quarter.  The number is obviously higher this year Q1 and Sam, that increase is coming almost entirely from the technology investment that I referenced in my script.", "This is a global multi-year investment that we made in technology.  It actually enables us to improve the efficiency of our technology across the globe.  Again, we had the one-time payment, a multi-year contract but it\u2019s distorting what otherwise would be sort of the fixed capital trends that we have in the first quarter.", "We still expect, Sam, for the full year to be in that 450 to 500 range.", "Jeff Fetig", "And Sam, the other thing I would add is that the capital we are spending, which is fairly significantly below last year and recent run rates in the last three or four years is focused on very significant new products that are coming to the marketplace, which are not only very innovative they come with substantial cost reductions and quality improvements.", "The last piece of it is a fairly substantial portion of our capital that\u2019s not being spent on new products is being spent on redesign of products that I mentioned earlier and therefore is driving our cost reduction so we think this capital is very well being focused on those things which drive results this year and next year.", "Sam Darkatsh- Raymond James", "Two more quick questions if I might; the first one would be what are your new assumptions now, Jeff, for price mix versus material inflation specifically?  Then the second question would be Slide Nine was very helpful in terms of the weekly trend in North America for wholesale shipments.  Would we look at something very similarly if you showed us sell through versus sell in or how do those trends look and how much did the retailers take out of inventory?", "Jeff Fetig", "On material, Sam, material prices if you will; we had indicated, again, the year around $200 million.  That is better.  It could be as much as $50 million better but having said that I would note that as Roy pointed out we do have a negative currency.  The currency is at the high end so that somewhat offsets each other, a net gain overall.  ", "Price mix we talked about around 2% for the year.  We were 3% the first quarter so off to a good start.  That 3% rate we don\u2019t think will continue at that rate.  Probably under 2% for the year somewhat given some of the mix changes would probably be an appropriate estimate at this point in time.  I\u2019ll ask Mike to talk about the consumer trends. ", "Michael Todman", "Sam, if we look at sell through for the quarter it actually would have been at about the rate of demand if you take out those first couple of weeks so it was even with around that 12%, maybe slightly lower and what we did see is kind of a continued progression of better consumer purchases over the course of the quarter.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from the site of Jeff Sprague from Citi Investment Research; your line is open.", "Jeff Sprague- Citi Investment Research", "", "Just a handful of questions; first, Roy, I\u2019m just trying to kind of work to an earnings bridge here.  How do we think of the tax effect on the change in depreciation?  Should we use kind of a normalized tax rate as we think about what that adds to your earnings profile here?", "Roy Templin", "That\u2019s fair Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague- Citi Investment Research", "Then on price mix I believe all the discussion we\u2019ve been having and the numbers that have gone around on the call have really been on the profit side of the equation.  Can you give us a little color on what price mix did on the top line and whether it\u2019s biased one way or the other?  Is it really a price driven thing or is it more on the mix side?", "Roy Templin", "Jeff, I\u2019ll take that, it\u2019s Roy.  If you look at the total net sales rec for the quarter as you know our sales were down right at 23% and about 16% of that was the volume reduction.  Price mix, Jeff, was a favorable 2% and foreign currency was an unfavorable 9%.", "Jeff Sprague- Citi Investment Research", "And as you\u2019re looking at the I guess somewhat erosion of price mix over the balance of the year it sounds like it\u2019s mostly a mix that you see shifting down this consumer preference issue or do you think there is some downward bias on price also?", "Jeff Fetig", "Jeff, first of all it\u2019s a lessening of the increase is the way I would describe it compared to what we had in the first quarter and it\u2019s I would say a combination of two things.  One is some and I emphasize some markets around the world are showing a lower product mix if you will and I would say promotional activities are probably consistent with what we\u2019ve seen to date so I don\u2019t see a big change there.  But I would say it\u2019s much more of a mix than anything.", "Jeff Sprague- Citi Investment Research", "Roy, could you give us that same walk you just gave on North America; those are the total Whirlpool numbers but if I look at North America down 20 how that breaks out?", "Roy Templin", "I sure can, yes.  For North America specifically, Jeff, volume down 22%, FX was again a negative 3% and then for North America price mix was a favorable 4% for a net delta of minus 21.", "Jeff Sprague- Citi Investment Research", "I guess finally from me just around the whole BPX question; was this adverse settlement of $26 million in any how related to the issue of contesting how BPX is used or does it relate to BPX at all or is it a separate matter?", "Jeff Fetig", "No Jeff.  It\u2019s a five or six-year old matter in Brazil.  It has nothing to do with BPX.  There\u2019s over 800 companies where the government basically had a favorable ruling on IPI.  It has nothing to do with BPX, an IPI abatement if you will.  Then they reversed themselves two years ago and that\u2019s what created the liability and then it\u2019s still being disputed in the courts.  But there was a settlement offer to all companies at the end of the first quarter and we chose to take that settlement.", "Jeff Sprague- Citi Investment Research", "Just one follow-on on BPX; the fact that you can\u2019t use it in Q2 so has the Brazilian government essentially decided to \u201cpay\u201d for this tax reduction, consumer tax reduction by disallowing BPX or is there\u2026?", "Jeff Fetig", "No, not at all.  Let me break it into two parts.  Our BPX tax credit has not changed and as you\u2019ll see it\u2019s well over $500 million; the validity of that credit has not changed.  The vehicle by which we monetized it on a monthly and quarterly basis was a credit of the we call it IPI but it\u2019s really a sales tax and we credit against that on all sales.", "Well given that the government has temporarily suspended that sales tax credit we therefore have nothing to monetize against during the quarter.  It has nothing to do with the credit.  It has to do with our ability to monetize.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the site of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research; your line is open.", "Eric Bosshard- Cleveland Research", "Two questions, first of all the tax rate now is guided to a full year 15% to 25% benefit and I think previously that had been sort of a 5% or 10% expense; is that right?", "Roy Templin", "That\u2019s correct Eric.", "Eric Bosshard- Cleveland Research", "What changed to drive that swing?", "Roy Templin", "That\u2019s a good, fair question.  Eric, two things I should mention; one is, at these EBT levels given that we have the energy tax credits that we have in our overall base of taxable income our effective tax rate is very volatile and moves up and down the scale very quickly.  ", "The short answer to your question in terms of what happened or what\u2019s different is we have more favorability coming off of assumptions we had made with respect to tax planning coming into the year versus where we now think we\u2019ll end up for the year and that\u2019s the key driver of the change.  But, again, I only pause and say I want everyone to be careful that it\u2019s a very volatile rate right now just because the overall EBT is so low and the credits that we have are so high and this thing really moves quickly up and down.  ", "But that\u2019s the short answer, Eric; it\u2019s more effective planning strategies than what we\u2019d assumed coming into the year.", "Eric Bosshard- Cleveland Research", "Then secondly, the original three to four guidance contemplated a higher tax rate and I don\u2019t think it contemplated this $74 million swing in depreciation.  What are the big items on sort of the other side of the equation that are negating those or should we view this $3 to $4 guidance as extremely conservative?", "Roy Templin", "A couple of things here, Eric, in terms of the big items and basically all these will sort of link up to Jeff, Mike and my comments on our scripts.  Taking the global volume from 8% to 10% obviously had a negative impact.  Jeff referenced slightly lower price mix.  We do and we have of course assumed higher revolver interest from our revolver amendment that we did in the first quarter.  Currency is now more negative as we move to that high end point on the overall currency guidance and then lower BPX coming off of this IPI change that Jeff just referenced earlier.  Those are the big offsets Eric.", "Eric Bosshard- Cleveland Research", "The other question I wanted to ask is that North American units I think you just indicated were down 22% in a market that was down 16%.  Can you talk about what\u2019s going on that\u2019s driving this underperformance of units relative to the market and how you see that comparison playing out and why through the rest of the year?", "Michael Todman", "Eric, this is Mike.  To be honest, we actually feel and we talked about this in the fourth quarter coming in or on the fourth quarter call, which is that we were going to balance our market share with appropriate price mix and we continued to do that in the first quarter.  Actually, sequentially we picked up a little bit of market share and we felt good about that.", "What we expect to do is over the course of the year sequentially is begin to improve our market share position.  But we\u2019re going to continually keep the balance of getting price mix and market share in front of us.  So, in the first quarter just to put it in context we were able to improve our margins by five points based on this price mix so it had a substantial positive impact on our business.", "Eric Bosshard- Cleveland Research", "Then one last question; inventories were down year over year but I think down kind of half of the rate of sales, down 12 versus the overall sales down 23 and I know both have an impact from currency.  But is there a point at which we should reduce production levels, you should reduce production levels to match current inventory to sales or how are you thinking about managing the inventories to get back in line with sales?", "Jeff Fetig", "Eric, you\u2019re absolutely right.  In fact, we\u2019ve done that in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter where our production has reductions; particularly in the case of North America and Europe are well below our sales decline levels.  ", "Historically we always have a seasonal inventory build in Q1 and Q2.  We had an inventory decline this year by a couple hundred million dollars so we are tracking pretty much spot on where we want to be at this point in time of the year.  Sequentially even with negative demand trends we have a seasonal increase in revenues Q2 to Q1, Q3 to Q2 so we\u2019re pretty much where we want to be.  ", "I think we\u2019ll cross over some time in the second quarter based on the assumptions we\u2019ve laid out but we\u2019re pretty fixed on keeping inventories lower and the path we\u2019ve been on really for the last six months is getting us there.  ", "Roy Templin", "Eric, it\u2019s Roy; just to quantify Jeff\u2019s comments a little bit.  If you look year over year production units in North America were down 25% year over year and in Europe were down 20% so to Jeff\u2019s point pretty substantial reductions with respect to production take out.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our last question from the site of Michael Rehart from J.P. Morgan; your line is open.", "Michael Rehart- J.P. Morgan", "The first question just on the changes in the different inputs to the full year guidance; I appreciate the detail.  Hopefully I can press my luck and get a little bit more.  In terms of you kind of went through different line items but on an EBIT basis and that would just basically be before the interest in sundry and the interest expense perhaps I can walk through this with you later.  What is the net delta in terms of what your thinking was three months ago versus today?", "Jeff Fetig", "Michael, I will maybe go back to my comments.  This is a very unique environment.  There\u2019s volatility literally across every part of the business.  The ability to forecast line item details as you can imagine is very difficult in this period.  ", "I guess at a macro level we\u2019ve tried to outline the things that were positively affecting us and the things that are negatively affecting us.  In balance, with pushes and takes on each, I guess as I look at today on the positive side we\u2019ve gotten more cost takeout than we originally expected and we\u2019re off to a good start price and mix so those are the two positives.", "Our inventories are pretty much where we thought although the timing of the payables that is not yet fully reflected in cash flow; it will be.  The demand is somewhat worse than we had expected although as we talked about I think a lot of that was the beginning of the year the holiday hangover effect if you will and the fact that retailers like everyone are managing liquidity.  Retailers around the world have taken inventories down to levels not seen before but that has been a negative.  Materials are mildly more positive and currencies are more negative.  ", "In total that\u2019s why I say I feel very good that our overall assumptions aren\u2019t largely changed but the makeup of them are changing every day.", "Michael Rehart- J.P. Morgan", "I appreciate that.  The higher interest expense was one of the things you mentioned Roy.  Can you give us a sense of what that\u2019s going to be for the full year?", "Roy Templin", "On the revolver, Michael, it\u2019s going to be about $30 million roughly.", "Michael Rehart- J.P. Morgan", "In terms of a net increase year over year?", "Roy Templin", "That\u2019s correct.", "Michael Rehart- J.P. Morgan", "Lastly I was wondering if you could just walk through some ideas in terms of changes in share in North America.  Jeff, I think in your prepared comments you said that you believe North American share was flat sequentially but your overall units or volume was down 22% and for the quarter the industry shipments were down 16%.  I was wondering if you could kind of maybe reconcile that and give us Whirlpool branded, Maytag brand, OEM what\u2019s going on in the different buckets?", "Jeff Fetig", "Let me just give you the total; I\u2019m not going to break out the individual brands Michael.  We talked about this the last couple of calls.  In the third quarter last year we took a fairly major price increase across our largely our US business and also that was the time material costs were skyrocketing and so on.  We balanced with a price increase in volume during that period of time and we lost a lot of share between Q3 and Q2; we expected that.  We actually sequentially increased share in Q4 versus Q3 and we were flat to slightly up Q1 to Q4. ", "But if you look on the year over year basis yes we lost share because actually first quarter last year was our highest share quarter of the year.  Look, we have to get appropriately\u2026We have to have appropriate economics in the marketplace.  We\u2019re gaining our share through the strength of our brands and in innovative new products.  That\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to earn share every day.", "I think economically if you look at our results it\u2019s been the right balance to strike during this period of time.", "Michael Rehart- J.P. Morgan", "Any update in terms of Sears?  I know there\u2019s always chatter quarter to quarter and year to year but if you can give us any sense of how you\u2019re doing with Sears in terms of Kenmore and Whirlpool branded product?", "Michael Todman", "We actually feel very good about our business with Sears, both on a quarter to quarter basis and as well as sequentially, both in terms of the Kenmore product as well as our branded sales.  They continue to be at the levels that we expect and we feel very good about it.", "Jeff Fetig", "Everyone, thank you for joining us again today and we look forward to talking to you in July, thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s teleconference; have a great day.

(NYSE:WHR) Q2 2009 Earnings Call July 22, 2009 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Jeff Fettig \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Roy Templin \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "Michael Todman \u2013 President Whirlpool North America", "Greg Fritz \u2013 Director of Investor Relations", "Analysts", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James", "Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "Operator", "Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation's second quarter 2009 earnings call.  Today's call is being recorded.  For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Greg Fritz.  ", "Greg Fritz", "Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation's second quarter conference call.  Joining me today are Jeff Fettig our Chairman and CEO, Mike Todman President of Whirlpool North America, and Roy Templin our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10K and 10Q.  During the call we will be making comments on free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.  Listeners are directed to slide 32 for additional disclosures regarding this item.  Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investor section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "As you saw earlier this morning, we did release our second quarter financial results, which I'll now take a few minutes to summarize.  Overall, net sales for the quarter were $4.2 billion down 18% from prior period year.  The decline was driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and sharply lower unit sales volumes in both our North America and European regions.  Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenues declined by approximately 10% for the quarter.  ", "Our EPS came in at $1.04 per share compared with $1.53 that we reported last year.  We saw strong year-over-year improvements in our North American and Asia businesses where our operating margins also improved.  Operating margins remain strong in Latin America and declined in Europe.  ", "For the quarter, we delivered free cash flow of $174 million despite sharply lower production volumes.  That takes our year-to-date free cash flow to minus 197, which is inline with our expectations at this point in time at midyear.  ", "I'm going to turn now to slide four, which summarizes and provides you an update on the key factors that we've been referencing throughout the course of this year on our business.  On the positive side, we continue to make very significant progress on our total cost reduction targets.  When we assessed the economy late last year, we took aggressive actions to counteract what we saw as a potential for significant demand reductions, high foreign currency volatility, and severe changes in the financial markets.  ", "We eliminated substantial costs across the enterprise and these improvements to date have helped us to mitigate the impact of the double-digit revenue declines.  In addition to the cost area, we've successfully executed our plans to improve our price mix.  This has been through selecting price adjustments and very strong mix driven by our new product innovation.  ", "During the second quarter, our margins were favorably impacted by 2.3 points of positive price mix management.  As we indicated on our previous call, we expect price mix to remain a positive factor for our full year results.  However, given the fact that we're now comping against significant increases in the second half of last year, we do expect the affect to be less positive in the second half than its been in the first half.  We do continue to see demand material crisis in currency having a negative impact on our business for the balance of the year.  We are, however, seeing some positive trends in certain material costs since our call.  ", "In order to sum it up, I'd say the factors affecting our business in the first half of the year will continue throughout 2009.  We will continue to focus on cash generation and cost reduction efforts across all parts of the business in order to minimize these factors having an adverse affect on our business.  At the same time, we will continue as we have in the first half to appropriately invest in new product innovation and continue the cadence of bringing new consumer relevant innovation to the marketplace around the world.  ", "Now, I'd like to spend a moment on our regional unit demand outlook for the year, which you can see on slide five.  In the U.S., we continue to see signs that demand is somewhat stabilizing at much lower levels.  Our expected industry to volume decline forecast remains at between minus 10% and minus 12%.  ", "In Europe, we've updated our projections and we now expect volume should decline by about 13% versus our previous estimate of 10%.  During the quarter, we saw weakness throughout the entire region with Eastern Europe remained especially weak.  ", "Turning to Latin America, we now expect the Brazilian appliance industry unit volume growth of 10% growth versus our previous expectation of flat to down by 5%.  Much of this growth in the second quarter was primarily due to the sales tax reductions on appliance purchases.  As we discussed on our last call, the Brazilian government initiated a program in April aimed at stimulating appliance demand by reducing the sales tax levied on product.  ", "We're seeing the positive effects of this demand as resolved this program throughout the second quarter.  Across the Latin America region, we continue to see sharp appliance demand declines in our other Latin America markets outside of Brazil and in our global compressor business.  And as such, overall for the regions while these trends will largely offset the strength of Brazil, we do expect demand to be approximately equal to last year.  ", "In Asia, we expect our 2009 industry unit growth to be flat to up 5% versus our previous estimate of flat to down 5%.  The growth we saw in the second quarter is primarily due to improving macroeconomic environment and our relative strong performance across the region.  ", "I'll now turn to slide six.  While we continue to face a very challenging and a very volatile economic environment, we have taken very aggressive actions over the last several quarters to restructure our business.  We continue to align our capacity and resources toward the million levels.  We're beginning to see the positive impacts from those actions as we continue to aggressively execute our plan to ensure that we succeed and deliver in this very difficult environment.  ", "We've updated our earnings forecast.  We now expect earnings to be in the range of $3.50 to $4 per share this year versus our previous guidance of $3 to $4 per share.  Our free cash flow guidance remains the same at $300 million to $400 million and that, again, remains unchanged.  In a moment Roy will go into more detail on our free cash flow.  ", "At this point in time, I'll turn it over to Mike Todman to give you an update on our North American performance.  ", "Michael Todman", "", "I'll begin by reviewing North America's performance in the second quarter.  As shown on slide eight, our net sales declined 17% during the quarter to $2.4 billion with the U.S. industry demand for T7 appliances declining approximately 14%.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, our sales decreased 14%.  During the quarter, we realized an operating profit of $120 million compared to $101 million reported in the prior year.  ", "The improvement in profit was due to favorable product price mix and our ongoing cost reduction initiatives.  Results were partially offset by significantly lower production levels and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.  We realized strong margin improvement during the quarter despite the substantial sales decline.  Our operating margin for the quarter expanded to 5% compared with 3.5% in the prior year.", "Turning to slide nine, I'd like to take a moment to dive a little deeper into the progress we've made on our cost reduction initiatives.  As Jeff mentioned, we've reduced product cost and achieved savings in non-product areas as well.  A good example of this is the work that we've done on the SG&A side.  Here you can see the SG&A reduction in North America during the first half of the year.  In this quarter alone we achieved a 27% SG&A cost reduction.  And we will, of course, continue to take aggressive action for the balance of the year.", "Turning to slide 10, we outlined our full year industry forecast assumptions.  Our outlook for new home completions is essentially unchanged at a 40% decline.  We now expect existing home sales to be down 5% versus our previous forecast of a 9% decline.  The favorable impact of this improvement on the full year industry demand is approximately a half a point.  Offsetting this slight improvement we continue to expect discretionary spending to have a negative impact on overall results as high unemployment levels and low consumer confidence persist.  ", "I would say that on balance the discretionary component of demand has been more challenging than our previous outlook suggested.  As for replacement purchases, we continue to see some consumers delaying replacement purchases even for appliances that are beyond repair due to the economic uncertainty.  We have not witnessed a major change in the replacement market since our last update and believe that any delayed purchases will ultimately be replaced.  ", "We continue to believe it's just a matter of time before these buyers return to the marketplace.  And despite the economic situation, consumers continue to look for value that goes beyond price.  They are making careful purchasing decisions and demanding high quality and relevant innovation with a focus on energy and water efficiency.  We continue to offer those compelling products in the marketplace that provide the value consumers seek and this will continue to have a positive impact on the mix of products that we sell.", "Turning to slide 11, this chart depicts how the U.S. market has performed since 2005.  The shaded areas are the 2009 contributions to this change.  As you can see, we faced the most difficult comparisons versus 2005 during the first half since the industry peak.  As we progress, comparisons will become less difficult and we expect the year-over-year percentage decline will decrease at a lesser rate.  ", "Of course this effect will be more pronounced in the fourth quarter as we compare with a 29% reduction since the fourth quarter of 2005.  As you may recall, we had a very strong July last year and expect this will make the third quarter comparisons more difficult than the fourth quarter.  Based upon what we are seeing in the marketplace today, we are leaving our outlook unchanged and continue to expect the U.S. market will decline between 10% and 12% in 2009.", "In summary, we are executing the priorities that we previously outlined and are making good progress in the areas of cost control, balancing our volume and price mix, and continuing to provide our consumers with innovative new products.  While there is clearly still more work to do, our performance reflects the progress we've made in these areas and we will build upon this momentum going forward.  ", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "", "I'll now turn to slide 13 and talk about our international business where you'll see our international operations continue to have somewhat mixed performance during the second quarter.  The results were unfavorably impacted by exchange rates, but we did benefit, like in all parts of the world, from the significant cost reduction efforts that we've implemented.  ", "During the quarter, we saw significantly lower demand levels in Europe while both Asia and our Brazil businesses delivered very solid results during the quarter.  In fact, our Asia business delivered the highest level of sales and operating profit in our history during the second quarter.", "Turning to slide 14, I'll talk about Europe where our total European revenue decreased by 25% in the quarter.  In local currency terms it declined by 13% versus last year in a market that we estimate was down approximately 12%.  We reported an operating loss of $12 million compared to a profit of $50 million in the previous year.  ", "Our results were very unfavorably impacted by currency fluctuations, lower sales and significantly lower production volumes.  Our ongoing cost reduction efforts and the favorable product price mix partially offset these results.  We do expect these results to improve as we see production levels more matching sales for the balance of the year.", "Turing to slide 15, our Latin America business, we saw revenue decline by 16% during the quarter.  Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased by approximately 1%.  Our appliance results reflected much stronger results from our Brazilian operations primarily, to what I mentioned before, the Brazilian government's appliance incentive offerings.", "We did experience weak demand for appliances in Latin American countries outside of Brazil, as well as lower volumes in our global compressor business.  I would note that our Brazilian appliance business saw its revenues increase by 28% in local currency terms, and we continue to expand our leadership position in the marketplace where our brands and products remain the most preferred by consumers.", "Operating profit for the region totaled $75 million compared to $133 million last year.  Our results were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange, significantly lower monetization of tax credits and our material costs.  Partially offsetting these results were our cost reduction initiatives and refundable energy credits.  ", "Our ability to monetize tax credits was impacted by the Brazilian program aimed at stimulating appliance demand.  That program originally scheduled to end in July has now been extended through the end of October.  We do feel that this action by the Brazilian government has been a strong program that has substantial positive impact on demand, and we continue to believe that Brazil is one of the strongest economies that we see in the world.  However this will unfavorably impact our ability to monetize tax credits largely for the balance of 2009.", "", "Our second quarter results in Asia are shown on slide 16.  Here we show net sales increasing by 3%.  If you exclude currency impact, sales increased 19% compared to last year.  Our operating profit during the quarter was $11 million compared to $5 million last year, and this year-over-year increase in operating profit is due to higher volumes and continued cost reductions partially offset by an unfavorable country price mix.  ", "I'd also like to point out a significant event that we had in our China business last week.  You'll see on slide 17, here you'll see a picture of the joint venture manufacturing facility that we opened last week with Hisense in China.  ", "The facility will produce both washing machines and refrigerators for the Chinese markets and for export.  This new manufacturing center is significant for us because it provides us with increased manufacturing scale for us and adds refrigeration to our Chinese product portfolio.  It also represents an important component of a global offering platform and solidifies our presence in markets with strong growth potential like we're seeing in China.  ", "At this point in time, I'll turn it over to Roy Templin.", "Roy Templin", "", "Beginning on slide 19, I'll walk you through a summary of our second quarter performance.  From a net sales standpoint, we continue to see significant weakness in North America and Europe.  Our appliance unit volumes actually increased in Brazil and Asia during the second quarter.  As was the case in the previous two quarters, we continue to see a substantial unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation in the quarter as FX accounted for 8 percentage points of our year-to-date revenue decline.  ", "From a margin perspective, the key positive factors in our margin performance remained largely unchanged with price mix and cost reduction initiatives continuing as favorable items.  Material and OEM related costs moved to a neutral year-over-year impact on our results.  This marked the first time in many years were we did not experience an unfavorable variant from material cost.  Unfavorable variances were related to the double-digit decline in global volumes, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and lower BPX monetization due to the consumer tax incentives legislated in Brazil.  ", "As we mentioned to you on the last call, we projected lower BPX in the quarter and in fact we recognized $9 million of BPX credits in Q2 well below the prior year level of $47 million.  Finally, we had one notable item related to an $11 million energy refund from a Brazilian utility supplier. ", "Turning to the income statement on slide 20, during the quarter we reported revenues of $4.2 billion down 18% from the previous year.  The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation accounted for eight points of the decline and was predominately related to the appreciation of the dollar against the Brazilian Reais, the Euro, and the Canadian dollar.  ", "Our gross margin declined 1.5 points to 13.3% for the quarter.  Our gross margin was negatively impacted by foreign exchange transaction losses, which accounted for eight-tenths of a point in margin decline.  Lower BPX accounted for another 1.0 point of margin decline, while lower net productivity from reduced volume levels had an unfavorable impact on our margins as well.  On the positive side, we realized 2.3 points of price mix contribution to our gross margin during the quarter and continued to see savings from our previously announced cost reduction programs.  ", "SG&A continued to be a good story at Whirlpool, as we reported SG&A $112 million below the prior year level.  Approximately one-quarter of the dollar decline was due to the effects of foreign currency translation, while the balance of the improvement was related to cost reduction initiatives and lower business activity.  Notably, our SG&A improved as a percentage of sales to 9.3% from 9.9% in the previous year, despite the significant drop in revenues underscoring our progress in cost reductions.  ", "During the quarter, we reported $23 million of restructuring charges compared to $40 million in the previous year.  The most significant restructuring program during the second quarter related to the closure of our Shanghai facility and the startup of our new joint venture that Jeff touched upon earlier. Operating profit totaled $134 million compared with $203 million in the previous year.  ", "Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a negative impact of $71 million on our operating income during the quarter.  Considering this impact, as well as double-digit unit volume declines and a substantial reduction in BPX credits which we monetized, we feel good about our operating results.  Specifically, we made strong progress in the areas of price mix and cost reduction to mitigate substantial negative macroeconomic effect.  ", "Turning to slide 21, we recorded $58 million of interest expense compared with $49 million in the prior year.  This increase and interest cost predominately reflects higher average borrowing cost and overall higher debt levels.  Offsetting this unfavorable impact was a $12 million reduction in our interest and sundry expense from 2008.  ", "As you may recall, we recorded cost related to a legal settlement in the second quarter of 2008.  This favorable impact was largely offset by legal cost related to an ongoing anti-trust investigation.  The year-over-year improvement was made of several small items that provided a net benefit when compared to the prior year.", "Moving to our tax rate, we reported an income tax benefit of $22 million during the quarter compared to an income tax expense of $2 million in the prior year second quarter.  The year-over-year benefit is predominately related to lower year-over-year pretax income levels and the corresponding impact of various tax credits.  ", "Slide 22 summarizes our key working capital balances for the quarter.  Our working capital balance improved during the second quarter compared to the prior year on a total dollar basis.  As a percentage of sales, however, it increased 2.4 points as sales declined substantially relative to the prior year.  Our inventory balance was down on both a sequential and year-over-year basis during the quarter, as we continued to make progress towards our full year inventory reduction targets.  ", "The most significant unfavorable variance was largely driven by accounts payable.  As you know, we continued to run production levels below demand levels during the second quarter and this has equated to reduced purchases.  We did see some sequential improvement in payables and expect this to continue as the year progresses.  ", "Now, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our free cash flow performance on slide 23.  For the quarter, we reported free cash flow of $174 million compared to $262 million in the prior year.  The year-to-year reduction in free cash flow is largely attributable to two main areas, lower overall cash earnings and higher cash restructuring payments, when compared to the prior year.  Mitigating these somewhat were an increase in cash flow from working capital, lower capital expenditures, and an increase in proceeds from asset sales.  For the full year, we continue to expect capital spending in the range of $450 million to $500 million.", "Turning to Slide 24, I wanted to update you on our liquidity position given our recent note offering and second quarter free cash flow performance.  Overall, our net liquidity improved substantially in the second quarter as we completely repaid our revolving credit facility and grew cash on our balance sheet to $247 million.  Given our successful issuance of $500 million of five year notes and $350 million of three year notes, we were not only able to refinance our $200 million note that matured in June, but we effectively turned out our revolving credit balance.", "On slide 25, we depict our term debt maturities and highlight our recent note offerings in green.  As you know when we entered this year, increasing our financial flexibility was a key initiative and we have increased our flexibility substantially with our recent note offerings.  This offering, coupled with our expectation to generate $300 million to $400 million of free cash flow for the full year, provides us with substantial flexibility to execute our restructuring initiatives and fund our new product innovation pipeline.  ", "Finally, I'd like to turn to our outlook summary on slide 26.  As Jeff mentioned, based upon current economic conditions and our business plans, we expect to earn $3.50 to $4 per share during 2009.  This change is largely driven by our year-to-date performance.  Given the dynamic nature of the marketplace, we have seen some movement in many of our assumptions for the second half, and most notable is the Brazilian legislative decision to extend the tax reduction incentive program through October 31.  ", "While we expect this to have a positive impact on demand in Brazil, our full year global volume outlook is largely unchanged given the weakness we are experiencing in Europe and countries outside of Brazil in Latin America, which continue to see substantial decline in demand.  As was the case in the second quarter, this tax incentive will only allow us to monetize a nominal amount of BPX tax credits.  This will result in a substantial reduction in contribution to our second half results versus our previous outlook.  ", " ", "In addition, we see slightly lower price mix for the full year.  While we continue to see a very positive price mix effect for the year, we do expect this to abate as we have a very difficult price mix comparison this second half of the year.  Offsetting this impact will be a positive contribution from material and oil related cost.  Our full year outlook is for an unfavorable $40 million for the full year compared to our prior outlook of approximately negative $150 million.  On balance, when we look at all of our key operational drivers, we now expect earnings per share in the range of $3.50 to $4 for the full year.  ", "With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "", "Let me take a minute now to sum up our comments today.  Overall, we've seen the second quarter, and really the first half of the year, largely play out in line with our expectations.  This clearly continues to be a very volatile global economic period.  Today our largest markets, North America and Europe, have been most impacted, as seen by the double-digit declines in demand.  Our big emerging markets of Brazil, India and China seem at this point in time to have recovered and today we're seeing very strong growth.", "Through midyear, as we said we would in February, we remain very focused on three things.  First is driving significant cost reductions across every part of our business.  Second, executing well in all markets and driving the right economic balance between value and margins.  And third and importantly, ensuring our financial strength by driving improvements in our cash generation and successfully placing our $850 million in three and five year debt.", "To date, although a very challenging environment, we are very much on track to deliver our annual plans to guidance, and I'm very pleased with how our organization has responded to these severe economic challenges.  We don't expect these challenges or the volatility to change soon.  Our overall review remains the same.  We do believe that the second half demand levels will improve, although they will still remain negative, but at a lesser rate.  ", "We will continue to remain focused on our strong actions required to significantly reduce costs, lower our breakeven levels, invest in winning consumer innovation and generate cash.  Our success in executing these priorities will further improve our financial strength and I believe position is very well [inaudible] as we will see demand levels normalize over time.", "So I'm going to wrap up there now and open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from David MacGregor - Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research", "You guys seem to be doing a nice job in terms of managing your costs through this downturn, so congratulations on that point.  Jeff, I wonder if I could just get you to address a point that you didn't cover in the call, and that is the Sears relationship and what happens with Kenmore in 2010?  That's probably the issue on most investor's minds these days and just wondering if you could give us some sense of magnitude with respect to earnings and revenue impact.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, David, within some parameters we have to give you some color.  Let me actually have Mike do it.  Mike manages that business.", "Michael Todman", "", "Yes, David, first of all I'd tell you that our relationship with Sears is strong and I think we both feel very good about our business.  And just to point out, we still have a contract in place for 2009 and we do except that we won't see any significant change in volumes from that this year.  As we talked about earlier, we said that we expected to see some small volume decline in our OEM businesses as we went into 2010.  ", "But I can tell you both, we and Sears, evaluate all of our business based on the value that we can create.  And so we are comfortable that we will be able to offset any potential declines in that OEM business with our brands, and that we can do that because we feel good about strong pipeline of innovation that we have coming and the fact that we are pretty comfortable with our position in the rest of distribution.", "The other thing we ought to note is that this business that we have with them, we evaluate on an ongoing basis.  It's not at any point in time fixed and so we feel good about our position in 2010.", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research", "I guess two follow-up questions.  Number one, how long or what period of time would it take you to make up what you would expect to lose in Kenmore through your branded business?  Is that a couple of years or maybe you could quantify that for us.  And well maybe just address that for us, please.", "Michael Todman", "Yes, just to be clear when I say we can make it up I'm thinking about we won't see any substantial changes at all in our business.  So, you would say on an immediate basis and over time clearly we expect our business to grow.", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research", "Is it definitive at this point or is the volume of the impact still up in the air?  To what extent is there still some uncertainty around this?", "Michael Todman", "There's always ongoing discussions and there's always ongoing evaluations of the business and the opportunities that are available, and both companies evaluate that based on our abilities to create value and that will continue to happen.", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research", "So as you lose Kenmore volume, you make that back with a greater share of the Sears floor?", "Michael Todman", "Our branded business at Sears continues to be very strong, and so we feel very good about the progression of that branded business on Sears's floor.  But I will tell you our branded business with the brands that we have are also doing well in the rest of distribution.  And so on both counts, we feel very good about that.", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research", "Just a second question if I may on the replacement demand, you addressed that on the call.  I'm wondering if you could just quantify the extent to which you believe we've got some pent up demand here and what would be your expectations with respect with your ability to realize on that maybe over the next, say, six quarters?", "Michael Todman", "Well, I can tell you I wish I had a crystal ball that could tell you how the market's going to change next year.  I think there is a fair amount of pent up demand, but to quantify that would be very difficult.  We're not expecting and I'm certainly not expecting to see a significant drive-up in terms of demand, but it will improve.  ", "Jeff Fettig", "David, you hear that from certain retailers, you see it in longer term service parts where the run rates, which means somebody maybe fixing something that they wouldn't have done.  There's no hard data on that, but there's a lot of signs that this is going on.", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research", "Just quickly one final question on Europe, what are the prospects for a return to profitability in the second half?", "Jeff Fettig", "I fully expect them to do that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "Could you address, Roy, what was going on with the LIFO adjustments in the quarter?  I assume that went through the P&L and will there be more of that in the back half of the year?", "Roy Templin", "", "Yes, I sure can, Jeff.  First of all from a LIFO perspective, every quarter we estimate what we think the annual impact will be for LIFO, and a couple of areas that impacted the second quarter.  First of all, to your question with respect to where did it come through.  We did see a $10 million favorable adjustment that is recorded in our cost to goods sold.  And, Jeff, that reflects about half of our annual estimated change in a LIFO reserve, so why.  ", "The why comes from, we saw a couple of areas.  One, we saw a deflation in material costs relative to our prior estimates, and we had some deflation in some purchase product areas and, as you know with LIFO you have to look at it LIFO pool by LIFO pool.  But when you netted those two together, we estimated at midyear that we would have about a $20 million benefit as a result of that and that deflation.", "In essence what we did, Jeff, in very simple terms of course, LIFO means that you run your most current costs through the P&L.  And in that vein we in essence had to book a reduction in our LIFO reserve or a $10 million reduction to our costs to reflect the latest costs that we're actually seeing right now through our product production.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "So if materials continue to reverse to the downside, though, we could presumably expect to see some pretty big benefits there later in the year or into next year?", "Roy Templin", "You could expect to see further reductions, again as I said, this is our estimate at midyear with the numbers we have now, but you're right, we could have more favorable impact if in fact we continue to experience deflation that's greater than what we estimated here at the midyear.  That's correct, Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "And you characterize price mix in terms of its margin impact.  Can you give us some color on the top line components of price and mix?", "Roy Templin", "From a top line perspective for the company when you look at our consolidated change, basically we were down 17.9% year-over-year, 10.2 of that is volume related, 8% is currency, just over 100 basis points, Jeff, is price mix.  It's about 1.1 and then we had eight-tenths negative as a result of lower BPX, which as you know, is recorded on the sales line.  ", "Now, the price mix is probably a little bit less than what you would intuitively expect to see when you think about margins, and that's coming from the mix of business that we had year-over-year.  Again, the ASVs in the North American businesses are much higher than what they are in international businesses, and we saw, Jeff, about a four point shift in terms of more international relative to our total sales base, which sort of skews this price mix number on the top line.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "And you commented about price mix getting more difficult as it relates to the comp on a year-over-year basis, but you actually see absolute price mix eroding in the second half relative to what you had in Q2?", "Roy Templin", "We actually, in our guidance, Jeff, we have assumed about two-tenths to three-tenths of a reduction in our overall price mix relative to where we are today.  That is correct.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "And then just finally from me, I just wondered the staying power of the incentives in Brazil.  Maybe it's still early days, but was there a big front end pop and then a waning influence or is it steady state strong across the last few months?", "Roy Templin", "It's been a big pop and it stayed there to date.  Extending it through October, will it stay there through October, I doubt it.  I do think this really got a lot of publicity.  It stimulated a lot.  We think it will have a positive impact, but I personally don't expect it to have this staying power through October.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James", "Three questions, first off the raw materials being a benefit to your prior expectations as of the tail end of October, specifically where are you seeing that?  It looks like the spot or market prices for most materials have actually inflated since the end of April.  So I'm just curious as to whether it was a specific contract that may have triggered something or what have you, but where specifically are you seeing the benefits from a raw material standpoint?", "Jeff Fettig", "This is Jeff.  The way I would describe it and first of all comparing to year-over-year.  So in the first half of last year remember we had a huge run up in the second half of the year across steel, oil, base metal, etc., and then many of those things turned.  So as we look at it now and the change in our estimates, steel somewhat stable I would say, but it's certainly down from the second half of last year.  For the full year I'd say it's roughly flat.", "And oil related are lower and, again, we know a year ago we had nearly a $150 barrel of oil came down late in the year, but now it's going back up.  So oil is still a wild card in this.  Base metals came way down.  We were above the line because of our hedges, now they're going back up.  So we'll have a crossover at some point in time in the year.  And then in total strategic components are up.  ", "So we really kind of assess this based on the usage, there has not been major contract changes I would say.  So as we've estimated this, and that's where Roy talked about $40 million to $50 million, I'd say that's at any given time with [inaudible] probably got $50 million plus or minus to it right now just depending on what happens to base metal and what happens to oil.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James", "But the $110 million Delta from where you were looking at it just two or three months ago, that primarily came from where?  You were looking at $150 million and now its $40?", "Jeff Fettig", "I would say our average estimate for steel is down.  Our average for the year estimate for oil related is down.  And I would say given that we're hedged at higher prices in the first half of the year on base metals probably our net average base metals will be a little bit down.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James", "Second question, I think you have a pretty significant initiative underway to [commonize], if that's a word, a great many of your platforms and gain a lot of efficiencies that way.  Where are you in that process and how would that whole initiative likely manifest itself from a P&L standpoint and particular in 2010?  You're going to have better productivity, perhaps better share gains there might be some higher CapEx.  How does that initiative affect things as we look at it?", "Jeff Fettig", "There's really a couple parts to that.  One is our global product redesigns where we're more and more moving to global platforms that we use in multiple regions with multiple manufacturing sites.  That by definition will drive [commonization] of designs [inaudible].  Generally, with these major platform changes, they are designed more efficiently with less material.", "So, as you see the new product launches that Mike and others have talked about, a large number of those are coming out, and that will continue because we've continued our investment pattern this year on that.  We have some very major impacted launches early to mid next year, which will continue that.  With that and also independently, we are very aggressively [commonizing] components globally.  And I'd say it has a substantial impact on our ability to reduce costs.  We're tracking very well on it this year and we will continue to have sizable gains from that next year.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James", "So we should anticipate that productivity will be up next year all else equal because of this or would it take a year or two to take hold?", "Jeff Fettig", "I'm not forecasting anything for next year yet.  I would just say that our focus on cost initiatives and productivity, I don't anticipate will lighten up at all.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James", "Last question, if I might.  Could you give some color as to the unit performance by region?", "Roy Templin", "From a North American perspective, again, units will be down 16.8% year-over-year.  In our European business, units are down 13.6%.  Latin America broadly is up 6.1%, and in Asia Q2-over-Q2 is up 17.6% year-over-year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Laura Champine - Cowen and Company.", "Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Got a couple of questions about share outside of North America, can you comment on the trend in Europe and what made the impact in your share there and the direction.  And also the unit numbers you just gave for Latin America implies pretty horrid results outside of Brazil.  Can you comment on that and what your thinking is on volatility in Latin America outside of Brazil as we move through the rest of the year?", "Jeff Fettig", "I'll do that.  Let me start with Latin America.  First of all, in Brazil we had a terrific quarter good run rates.  We're performing well in the market.  I don't have the exact share numbers, but I'd say we're gaining some share in the Latin America market given our position.  Let me next talk about our compressor business.  Our compressor business really mirrors the global refrigeration business, which was significantly down due to two reasons, one is demand and the other is inventory adjustments.", "So our business was down more than demand, if you will.  Just like when we're taking inventories down.  We're seeing that crossover point appears to be taking place now at midyear where I think compressor declines will mirror the global marketplace.  So I see that lessening.  In fact we saw it in June, and we expect to see it for the balance of the year.  ", "The 31 markets outside of Brazil, which account for about 50% of Latin America, are down significantly, and it's hard to kind of give you a good picture there because there are so many different examples.  Venezuela versus Colombia versus Chile and Argentina, but that business is down.  And I guess I would say that it's a little bit more unpredictable.  It's a little less structural business and more subject to big changes in both directions.  It's a very profitable business for us, and we continue to have that profitability, but the demand is a little bit more volatile.", "Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company", "And then in Europe, Jeff, if you can comment on share \u2013", "Jeff Fettig", "Europe, through midyear based on external data, we're roughly holding share or picked up a tenth or so.  It's basically flat.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "A couple of things, first of all the unit dynamics in Europe and North America are pretty similar, but the margins in North America are expanding pretty meaningfully and you're losing money in Europe.  Can you explain what the difference is?", "Jeff Fettig", "First of all, the U.S., well really the whole North America market it's actually now the fourth year of decline, if you will.  And the way I would describe it is our actions have caught up and are now exceeding the negative impacts of external effects, and we're moving across all fronts.  We're radically reducing costs.  We're managing price mix very well, and those positives now are net outweighing the negatives.", "Europe started much later.  We saw the falloff in decline really beginning last September.  So it started later.  It was much more profound than we thought, and I would say through the first half of this year our actions have not yet caught up with the impact of the negative effects.  I think that will happen in the second half of the year.  The other structural issue in Europe is just fixed costs are high, they're expensive and they are [inaudible] but that is not deterring us from taking the actions we need to take to get this business back on track. ", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "", "So does that mean that Europe, like this should be the worse year-over-year in absolute profit performance out of Europe?  ", "Jeff Fettig", "If our beliefs about demand and other things were true, I would say yes.  My only caveat there is there is so much volatility on every part, I would never say never, but it's as bad as we've seen and I hope it's as bad as I expect to see.  ", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "", "The second question in terms of the Brazilian situation, I know in the past you've insisted about the sustainability of recognizing those BPX tax credits.  Do you still have that conviction or is the Brazilian government perhaps looking at things differently in regards to what's happened in this quarter?  Does that make you feel any different about that? ", "Jeff Fettig", "Not at all.  This is simply the vehicle for monetization and suspending that vehicle and stimulating the economy was completely independent action.  And those credits now instead of being used to continue to grow based on interest and currency and so on.  We simply will have a bigger, assuming today's currency and everything we'll simply have a bigger credit at the end of the year.  So when the IPI is reinstated, we start monetizing again the way we have before. ", "Roy Templin", "Jeff's precisely right and, again, we're not saying that we won't monetize any BPX tax credits.  It's just that we'll monetize a much lesser amount because, as you know Eric, when you buy raw materials, there's an IPI tax on the material purchase, which ends up being a receivable.  And then, of course, when you sell product you have this IPI tax payable. ", "So what's happening, the dynamics in our business right now are such that we just have much less of an overall payable for which to monetize the BPX credits, but it no way has changed our ability to monetize then going forward.  ", "We'll file our Q this afternoon, Eric, and you'll see in the Q the balance of BPX's is about $623 million.  Now the increase from the end of the year is almost all attributable to the appreciation in the Brazilian Reais from 12/31 plus a little bit of interest accretion.  But we still anticipate being able to monetize those over time.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Securities. ", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "First question on the guidance, I was wondering if we could just drill down on a few areas.  First off any commentary, you raised the low end of the EPS guidance but didn't do so for the free cash flow guidance, if you could walk through the delta there.", "Jeff Fettig", "I'll start at a high level.  Given our first half performance, I mean we are on track with our plans.  There are a lot of moving parts but we felt, given what we've been able to deliver thus far even with the uncertainty looking ahead, that we felt comfortable grazing the bottom end of our guidance up to $3.50 per share.  There still are uncertainties.  We're very confident now about what we're doing.  We're less confident about some of the demand in currency and even material factors out there and that's why we left the upper end where it is.  ", "On the cash, I would say there are a number of other factors in the play there such production levels, which is the big one for us.  You saw at midyear our biggest delta was payables.  The reason it was, was because we took so much production down.  When that flips, and it is flipping in parts of the world, we'll see a very sizable positive change in our free cash flow, but there's just more things that impact that but we felt comfortable keeping the same range that we had then.  ", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "Couple of other questions on the guidance, if you review with us the tax rate assumptions.  I believe last quarter you raised the tax rate guidance or it went from a tax rate, I believe, of 5% to 10% to a 15% to 25% benefit.  I understand, obviously, a lot of it is driven by lower pretax number and some other incentives, but is there any change to that 15% to 25% benefit as you've adjusted your EPS.", "Roy Templin", "", "Couple of things, Michael, first of all your assumption is correct in terms of the impact of the lower EBT.  In fact, to sort of put that in perspective, if you took the composition of the components of what end income tax expense a year ago second quarter and you simply overlaid this year's EBT of 64 versus last year's of 130, what you'd find is the rate would be minus 35%, which was the same as we experienced in the second quarter of this year.  So you're assumption first of all is correct.  ", "Secondly, from an overall guidance perspective, which goes back to the second part of your question, at this point in time, I would expect the rate be 25 to 35 benefit.  So in other words, that's at 10 point improvement from where we were on the last call.  Again, I'm a little bit cautious here, Michael, because at these EBT levels, changes in BPX credits, changes in energy tax credits and, of course, any delta in our EBT, they all tend to have sort of a dramatic effect on the overall rate on a relative basis. ", "But at this point in time, we would estimate the full year at minus 25 to minus 35, and we would anticipate the third quarter rate would be somewhat similar to what we had in the second quarter.  As you know, we had minus 27 minus 35, so at midyear we're at minus 31 on a blended rate perspective.  I don't expect the third quarter to be significantly different from that with what we know today. ", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "And the driver of that more just being BCX or are there other tax planning initiatives that have come through?", "Jeff Fettig", "", "Is your question, Michael, in terms of the improvement in our rate for the year? ", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "Right.  ", "Jeff Fettig", "The improvement in the rate for the year comes, you're right, two areas.  One, we're now assuming higher energy tax credits that will be earned here in the U.S. based upon the mix of business that we're seeing in North America.  You're also correct in we are assuming lower BPX tax credits, which of course, has an impact on the rate going the other way.  You're right.  Those are the principle drivers of that delta.  ", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "Any change in terms of your thinking for 2010.  I believe we still had in our model kind of the midpoint of a 5% to 10% rate.  Given the changes this year, any update to that thinking? ", "Jeff Fettig", "At this point, Michael, I'm not ready to project a rate next year.  Again though I will say as a reminder that we do anticipate earning energy tax credits next year, so obviously that will have a reduction in what would otherwise be sort of the intuitive statutory rate here in the U.S. in specific. ", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "The price mix which was hit on before, you're expecting a sequential decline of 20 to 30 BIPS.  If you could just kind of perhaps to the extent possible give us color of what's driving that, if that's North America or other regions?  And also on an overall basis, I think you said that in terms of guidance last call slightly less than a positive 2% impact.  Current guidance is that closer to 1% now, you said slightly lower than before, just some color there. ", "Jeff Fettig", "The biggest issue now is we're comping against quarters where we had price increases, and that's one.  ", "Roy Templin", "Jeff, if I may.  Just to sort of quantify that, Michael, Q3 a year ago we had 2.5 points favorable price mix, Q4 2.7 points in favorable price mix as a result of the pricing actions we took in the back half of the year.  Sorry to interrupt, Jeff.  ", "Jeff Fettig", "So it's not necessarily that it's a big decline, it's just the comp is different.  For the full year, I think in the guidance perhaps you weren't clear, but the full year we talked about around 2% and now we're looking at about 1.5% for the full year.  ", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Any driver to that change that you can breakout?", "Jeff Fettig", "I mean half a point on the full year for us, Michael, simply a lot of it its mixed business.  I mean North America is less and Asia is more, and so on and so forth.  In our total global country, brand and product mix, that's not a big change for us.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.  For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Greg Fritz.", "Greg Fritz", "Thank you Chris and good morning.  Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s third quarter conference call.  Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO, Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool North America, and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations.  Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q.", "During the call we will be making comments on free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.  Listeners are directed to Slide 28 for additional disclosures regarding this item.  Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investor section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.  ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.  As you saw earlier this morning, we released our financial results for the third quarter and I direct you now to Slide 2 on our presentation.", "For the quarter, net sales were $4.5 billion, which were down 8% from the prior year.  This decline was driven by an unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower unit volumes in both our European and North American regions.", "Partially offsetting these declines were increases in our Latin America and Asian regions.  If you exclude the impact of the foreign exchange, our revenues were down about 3%.  Earnings per share came in at $1.15 per share which was compared to $2.15 last year.  ", "As we previously announced, our third quarter results were adversely affected by a $43 million expense or $0.50 a share related to an affiliate settlement agreement with the Brazilian Competition Commission.", "Overall for the quarter though, our operating profit improved by 8%, largely as a result of our successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives.  We did see significant year-over-year operating profit improvement in our North America and Asia regions which we\u2019ll discuss in detail in a few more moments.", "Year-to-date we delivered free cash flow of $373 million.  Overall our improved operating performance in the quarter was largely driven by our significant cost reduction efforts and higher overall productivity throughout the business.", "These cost reduction efforts and investments in our consumer relevant innovation and a continued focus on marketplace execution remain our key priorities as we navigate through this challenging and volatile economic environment.", "If you turn to Slide 3 I\u2019ll provide you with an update on the main factors which impacted our business.  As you know, we began the year by outlining the key positive factors that we needed to execute against in order to successfully offset the substantial negative macroeconomic factors that we were facing.  During the quarter our results were favorably impacted by these drivers.", "We have been able to eliminate substantial costs across the enterprise and these improvements have helped us to mitigate the revenue decline that was had in the quarter. We\u2019ve continued to aggressively  manage inventory, we\u2019ve reduced our capital spending, and this continued throughout the quarter.", "While lower demand in foreign currency remained unfavorable items, our operating results improved versus last year.  Despite the uncertain economic environment, our innovation pipeline remains very strong.  We continue to invest in our brands, particularly in the new product innovations which we\u2019re seeing are representing a strong value to our trade customers and consumers in the marketplace today.", "I\u2019ll now turn to Slide 4 and spend a moment on our regional unit demand outlook.  First, on the US we expect industry volume to decline now approximately 10% for the year which is at the higher end of our previous expectation.  We continue to see demand levels in the United States stabilizing albeit at lower levels.", "In Europe we continue to expect 2009 industry volumes to decline by approximately 13%.  During the quarter we saw continued weakness throughout the entire region; however the central and eastern European countries saw the largest overall decline in demand and with some western European countries we saw decline somewhat moderating.  ", "I\u2019ll turn now to Latin America where we currently expect the Brazilian appliance unit volume growth for the year of at least 15%.  During the quarter we experienced the positive effects on demand as a result of Brazilian government sales tax reduction program on appliance purchases, but also as well based on an improving set of economic fundamentals that we see in the country.", "Across the entire Latin American region we continue to see negative demand in the markets outside of Brazil.  While this was at a lesser rate than the previous quarters, the declines affected the overall Latin America unit volumes.  In Asia we expect full year industry growth of 10%.  Industry demand in India is particularly strong and is the main driver of our increased expectations.", "Moving on to Slide 5, while we continue to face a very challenging and volatile economic environment, the actions that we\u2019ve taken to restructure our business have better aligned our capacity and resources to these lower demand levels.  ", "Our results reflect the benefit from these actions and we now expect to deliver higher 2009 earnings and free cash flow compared to our previous expectations.  As you saw in the release, we\u2019ve increased our whole year EPS guidance.  We now expect earnings to approximate $4.25 per share for the full year versus our previous guidance of $3.50 to $4.00 per share.", "Our free cash flow guidance for the year is between $500 million and $600 million compared to our previous guidance of $300 million to $400 million.  Roy Templin, our CFO, will go into more detail on our outlook later in the call.", "At this point I\u2019m going to turn it over to Mike Todman to give you an update on our North America performance.", "Michael A. Todman ", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone.  Let me begin by reviewing North America\u2019s performance in the quarter.  As shown on Slide 7, our net sales declined 9% during the quarter to $2.5 billion with US industry demand for T-7 appliances declining 6%.  Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange, our sales decreased approximately 7%.  This decline was predominantly related to a unit shipment decline of 6% in the quarter.", "It is important to note that on a comparable US T-7 basis, our unit volumes while still slightly negative declined much less than the 6% industry decline.  Operating profit in the quarter totaled $140 million compared to the $74 million reported in the prior year.  The improvement in profit was primarily the result of our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, lower unit production volume, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuation, and lower product price and mix partially offset our favorable cost and productivity trends.  ", "Despite our overall sales decline, we were able to expand our margins on a year-over-year basis.  Our operating margin for the quarter expanded to 5.6% compared with the 2.7% in the prior year.  ", "Turning to Slide 8 you will see the continued progress we are making on our cost reduction efforts and specifically on year-to-date SG&A reductions in North America.  In this quarter alone we achieved a 23% SG&A cost reduction.  Despite our strict cost control measures, we continue to invest in our brands and in new product innovations.  These innovations attract consumers to our portfolio of diverse brands and generate higher margins.  In today\u2019s environment, consumers are looking for great values at every price point, and our innovation pipeline remains robust and we continue to launch new consumer-driven products in every major product category.", "Some of the recent US product launches are shown on Slides 9 and 10 and include the Jenn-Air brand wall oven featuring the industry's only 7 inch touch anywhere LCD screen.  An interactive menu-driven culinary center helps consumers achieve desired cooking while color images illustrate desired doneness options.  ", "The wall oven is part of a new Jenn-Air KitchenAid suite that raises the standards of performance in the premium appliance segment.  The Maytag brand Bravos high efficiency top load laundry pair featuring the largest available capacity in the industry, faster spin speeds, and the Maytag commercial technology.  The high efficiency top load laundry pair now has a capacity of 5.0 cubic feet that can wash up to 18 pounds of laundry per load.  ", "A new Maytag gas range with the industry\u2019s largest oven capacity available, powerful 17,000 BTU burners which boil water faster than a standard burner. The KitchenAid Suberba series E-2 dishwasher that delivers the best cleaning results, best energy efficiency, and the lowest sound levels in the industry.", "The Whirlpool Duet Steam washing machine, equipped with a quiet fan to draw out moisture through a vent to help keep clothes smelling fresh.  Additionally, the fan [inaudible] intermittently tumbles clothes in the wash drum for up to 10 hours after the cycle ends.  The washing machine features advanced water and energy savings while the companion dryer is the first front load category to offer an eco-cycle that uses 40% less energy than a conventional dryer\u2019s normal cycle when paired with a Duet washer.", "The Whirlpool Cabrio high efficiency washing machine and dryer designed to meet CEE Tier 3 energy specifications that the most energy efficient level for a top load washing machine.", "Turning to Slide 11, I want to take a moment to discuss how the North American region is progressing on each dimension of the Whirlpool strategy.  At the foundation of our strategy is achieving the best cost and quality position for the products we produce and the markets we serve.  Our cost reduction and productivity initiatives have been significant in 2009.  We have substantially reduced our manufacturing capacity, greatly improved the cost efficiency of our distribution network, and have significantly reduced our SG&A cost.  ", "We have made substantial progress towards strengthening our foundation for the future.  We continue to make progress providing our trade customers with great brands of products that consumers want to buy, which will ensure that our brands are productive on retail floors.  Our strong product portfolio has allowed us to expand our distribution to reach more consumers.  ", "Finally, we continue to support our brands with a strong and robust innovation pipeline. By the end of this year we will have launched a new line of dishwashers, an all-new Jenn-Air suite, we will have completely revamped our Maytag branded products and launched a new line of Whirlpool refrigerators.  So although we continue to take aggressive cost actions, innovation and product development have been areas we have continued to invest in over the past 12 months.  ", "This innovation will continue and will strengthen our consumer and trade positions.", "With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "Thanks Mike.  I\u2019ll begin by reviewing our European performance in the third quarter which is shown on Slide 13.  Our revenue in Europe during the quarter decreased by 17% and local currency sales declined by about 11% from last year.  Overall industry unit shipments declined about 10% year-over-year.  ", "For the quarter the region reported an operating profit of $14 million compared with $52 million earned last year.  Our results were unfavorably impacted by substantially lower volumes and the non-recurrence of about $14 million in special items that were included last year.  Our ongoing cost reduction efforts partially offset these challenges.  ", "For Latin America, the third quarter results are shown on Slide 14.  For the quarter the region reported sales of $992 million which was basically equal to last year. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased by about 12%.  The sales increase was driven by a strong demand for appliances in the Brazilian market.  During the quarter our appliance revenue in Brazil increased 40% in local currency, further strengthening our leadership position in this important market.", "Operating profit totaled $93 million compared to $116 million reported last year.  Unfavorable foreign currency and significantly lower monetization of tax credits contributed to this lower profitability.  Partially offsetting these results were significant cost reductions and the overall increase in unit shipments.", "As we\u2019ve discussed previously, our ability to monetize tax credits was impacted by the Brazilian program aimed at stimulating appliance demand. This program is currently scheduled to end on October 31.  We recognize the success of the Brazilian government\u2019s program and the positive impact it\u2019s had on demand.  The program however has had an unfavorable impact on our ability to monetize tax credits as we experienced a significant year-over-year reduction in credits monetized during the third quarter.", "Moving to Asia, which is shown on Slide 15, net sales increased 18% during the quarter to $162 million in revenues.  Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 26% compared to last year.  The sales increase here was driven by very strong results across the region with India and China both reporting substantial year-over-year gains.  With our new industrial joint venture in China and our very strong position in India, we are well positioned to benefit from the growth trends that we\u2019re seeing in these markets.", "Operating profit in Asia during the quarter was $8 million profit compared to a break even last year.  This operational improvement was primarily related to these higher unit volumes and our cost reduction initiatives.", "Turning to Slide 16, which really summarizes overall our international operations. Again, overall European results show a return to profitable levels despite lower sales volumes due in large part to our continued focus on cost reduction.  While these results are now positive, our results in Europe are not what we would consider to be acceptable and we continue to pursue aggressive actions to improve the results of the region as we go forward.  ", "In Latin America the economic fundamentals continue to be very strong in Brazil. We feel very good about our position in Brazil with the best products and the best brands in the industry.  While we do expect growth rates to moderate from the significant increases we\u2019ve now seen in the second and third quarter, we do believe that the economic fundamentals in Brazil point to very healthy underlying demand for appliances.", "Finally, in Asia, our strong performance in the quarter highlights our successful growth strategy throughout the region.  We continue to see growth opportunities in this region, particularly in China and India, as these economies have resumed their growth.", "At this point in time I\u2019ll turn it over to Roy Templin for the financial review.", "Roy Templin", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone.  Beginning on Slide 18 I\u2019ll walk you through a summary of our third quarter performance. From a net sales standpoint we continue to see similar trends to the second quarter results.  North America and Europe experienced volume declines, although at a lesser rate than the second quarter, and our appliance unit volumes actually increased substantially in Brazil and Asia during the third quarter.", "As has been the case all year long, we also experienced an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation in the quarter as FX accounted for 5 percentage points of our year to year revenue decline. ", "From a margin perspective, the key positive factors in our margin performance were related to the cost reduction and productivity actions we have instituted.  The most significant negative variances related to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, lower BEFIEX monetization due to the consumer tax incentives legislated in Brazil, and lower global unit volumes.  ", "As we mentioned to you on the last call, we expected lower BEFIEX in the quarter due to the consumer tax incentives in Brazil.  As such, we recognized $8 million of BEFIEX credits in Q3, well below the prior year level of $43 million.  ", "Finally, we had one [inaudible] item of significance and a few smaller items I would like to discuss.  As we announced on September 30, we reported an expense of $43 million related to our affiliate\u2019s settlement agreement with the Brazilian competition commission.  This resulted in an unfavorable Q3 EPS impact of $0.50 per share.  The third quarter impact was a non-cash impact as we anticipate making 12 semi-annual payments over a 5.5 year period. ", "During the quarter we recorded an asset sale gain of $3 million in our Asia business related to a property sale.  In the prior year we recorded $14 million from an asset gain and an insurance settlement.", "Finally, we recorded a $7 million non-cash pension curtailment loss in our North American segment during the third quarter that resulted from a facility closure announcement.  ", "Turning to the income statement on Slide 19, during the quarter we reported revenues of $4.5 billion down 8% from the previous year.  The unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation accounted for 5 points of the decline and was predominantly related to the appreciation of the dollar against the Brazilian Reais and the Euro.  ", "Our gross margin declined 0.2 of a point to 13.8% for the quarter.  Our gross margin was negatively impacted by foreign exchange transaction which accounted for 1.1 points of margin decline.  Lower BEFIEX accounted for another 0.8 of a point margin reduction.  Price mix was 0.7 of a point unfavorable impact on margin in the quarter.", "On the positive side, we realized significant margin improvement from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives as well as a slight benefit from lower overall material costs.  SG&A continued to be a strong contributor to our higher operating margins.  From a total dollar standpoint, we were able to reduce our SG&A costs by $77 million from the prior year.  Approximately 20% of the dollar decline was due to the effects of foreign currency translation while the balance or 80% of the decline was related to cost reduction initiatives.", "Notably, our SG&A improved as a percentage of sales to 8.9% from 9.7% in the previous year despite the decline in revenues which continues to highlight our progress in cost reductions.  ", "During the quarter we recognized $24 million of restructuring charges which was equal to the prior year.  Actions in Europe accounted for $16 million of the restructuring actions in the third quarter.  Operating profit totaled $189 million compared with $177 million in the previous year.  Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an unfavorable impact of $75 million on our operating income during the quarter.  Considering this impact, along with a $35 million year-over-year reduction in BEFIEX credits monetized, we are pleased with our operating improvement in what remains a negative demand environment.", "Turning to Slide 20, we reported $58 million of interest expense compared with $52 million in the prior year.  The increase in interest cost predominantly reflects higher average borrowing cost, largely the result of our notes offering earlier this year and the repayment of our lower cost short term debt.  ", "Turning to interest and sundry expense, we experienced a $48 million unfavorable year-over-year variance. While there are many smaller puts and takes in this line item, the variance is mainly attributable to the Brazilian Competition Authority settlement and the associated legal cost.", "Moving to our tax rate, we reported an income tax benefit of $13 million during the quarter compared to an income tax benefit of $46 million in the prior year.  From an effective rate standpoint, the third quarter expense corresponded to a benefit of 16% which was less of a benefit than our previous expectations.", "For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate to be a credit of 20% to 30%.  This slight change in our outlook is primarily related to additional tax contingencies we recorded in the third quarter.", "Slide 21 summarizes our key working capital balances for the quarter. Our working capital balance improved to 12.8% of annualized sales compared to 13.9% in the second quarter.  Our continued progress in inventory reduction was the most significant driver of the quarter to quarter decline.", "Now I would like to take a moment to discuss our free cash flow performance on Slide 222.  Through the first nine months we generated free cash flow of $373 million compared to a use of $349 million in the prior year.  The year to year increase in free cash flow is attributable to two main areas.  One, lower working capital levels and two, lower cash payments in the areas of advertising and promotion and compensation.  For the full year, we now expect our capital spending to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million.  ", "Turning to Slide 23, I want to update you on our liquidity position.  Overall our net liquidity continued to improve during the third quarter.  This improvement is largely the result of the increase in our cash balance to $725 million compared to $247 million in the prior quarter.  Given our successful amendment and extension of our revolving credit facility, we have now substantially completed the actions necessary to improve our financial flexibility.", "On Slide 24 we show the progression of our net debt balance over the past two years.  As you can see, we have substantially improved this metric and feel we are well positioned to continue to improve our overall credit ratios. We feel very good about our ability to continue to fund our restructuring and product innovation initiatives.  After funding these initiatives, a key priority for us going forward is improving our credit metrics with the goal of returning our credit ratings to pre-recession levels.", "Finally, I would like to turn to our outlook summary on Slide 25.  As Jeff mentioned, based on current economic conditions and business plans, we expect to earn approximately $4.25 per share during 2009.  From a full year perspective there are some positives and negatives but on balance we are coming out slightly ahead of our previous expectations.  ", "On the positive side, we continue to see strong gains in our cost reduction and productivity activities.  In some markets we have seen an overall improvement in our volume expectations and we anticipate foreign currency movements are currently tracking towards an improvement in the fourth quarter.  These favorable items have been partially offset by lower price mix and a lower than expected effective tax credit.", "In addition, we expect to record approximately $65 million in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter.  From a cash flow standpoint, we have increased our free cash flow outlook to $500 million to $600 million.  The change in our outlook is largely related to improved cash earnings in our third quarter and expected fourth quarter results.", "With that, all turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "Thanks Roy.  Let me now sum up our comments today and direct you to Slide 27 which I think illustrates how we are positioning the company for the future. As you all know, we have been through a period of significant volume decline and demand destruction in many of our markets throughout the world.  As a result of this, we have and continue to undertake significant cost reduction actions across all facets of our business to mitigate this.", "With these actions we are structurally repositioning the company to achieve improved results as we leverage this lower breakeven level and will benefit greatly when demand stabilized and returns.  We do believe that demand for our products will return to trend demand levels at some point in the future.  These actions that we are taking now will allow us to generate significant earning power when this materializes.", "One other area beyond our cost reduction which I think is very significant and I think will be very impactful is our continued investment in innovating new products.  We are very excited about the health of our innovation pipeline.  We think it\u2019s very strong and one of the most impactful pipeline of innovation that we\u2019ve ever had.  You\u2019ve seen some of these products that we bring into the marketplace now and much more will be coming in the near future. To date they\u2019ve been very well received by our customers.", "Overall, as Roy said, we\u2019re pleased with the progress in improving our business results. We\u2019re seeing most aspects of our business improving. Our priorities are unchanged and we will continue to execute well across all parts of the business.", "At this point in time I\u2019ll end my comments and open this up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", " ", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "First off, Roy, receivables rose year-over-year with sales down.  Was there a change or an extension of credit to certain customers or what was the driver there?", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "You\u2019re looking at the cash flow. If you look at the balance sheet, you\u2019ll see our receivables.  Compared to Q3 a year ago are 2.7 versus I think 2.6 a year ago but when you look at the cash flow statement which I think is what you're looking at, the key item driving that difference on cash flow is we had very sharp declines in our volumes in November and December so what we traditionally have somewhere in that $2.5 million range of receivables as sort of a normal run rate of Whirlpool.  ", "If you\u2019ll recall, that number was down to about 2.1 at the end of last year and so what you\u2019re really seeing is the delta from the drop off in volumes at the end of the year which lowered receivables and we had the inverse of that at the end of the third quarter.  We saw the strongest part of the pickup in both August and September which drove our receivables higher and so you sort of get the worst case scenario in terms of the comparability for the cash flow purposes.  ", "We are not seeing significant change in terms of the second part of your question and from an overall credit balance perspective, our current receivables are actually slightly better than what they were at the end of last year.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "It looks like price mix slipped sequentially.  Is it mostly price, mostly mix, how should we look at that on a go forward basis?", "Michael A. Todman ", "The fact of the matter is we did see a slight decline in some of our pricing for models that we have in the marketplace.  Our promotional as I actually talked about on the last call, we were going to balance market share with a promotional activity and that\u2019s what the primary driver.  Mix actually continues to be very strong.  ", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Roy, what should we look at for tax rate in 2010 and beyond?", "Roy Templin", "I\u2019m really not prepared to talk about the tax rate in 2010 and beyond.  I will remind you that as you know the key item that\u2019s driving our rate to a credit versus what is traditionally a debit are the energy tax credits and we do anticipate continuing to earn energy tax credits in 2010.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "So you suspect that you\u2019ll overall have tax credits again as opposed to an income tax payable item in your income statement going forward ?", "Roy Templin", "Let me answer it this way.  We do anticipate continuing to earn energy tax credits and if you look at sort of the underlying base tax rate in our business, it\u2019s roughly 30% to 32% of expense and as we look into next year, to answer your question, we would anticipate that  base being roughly the same as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan.  ", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan", "First question, I was wondering if you could kind of walk through the share trends in the third quarter, how the branded and OEM businesses are doing, and also if you could have any updated comments with regards to the Kenmore business in terms of the changes that you expect in 2010 into that channel.", "Michael A. Todman ", "Let me start with the share trend.  Year-over-year actually we did see some positive share frankly across the board in our business.  On a sequential basis, our branded share trends were actually very positive but we did see some declines in the OEM business.  So we feel good about where our brands are being positioned if you will in the marketplace.  ", "In terms of any updates, anything different than I said in the second quarter call, the answer is no.  Basically we still feel good about our position there but we also feel very good about the new innovations we\u2019re bringing to the products that are supporting our brands and we\u2019re seeing continued progression if you will in share for our brands because of that.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan", "On a net basis you don\u2019t expect there to be a material drop in the US business because of the changes into that channel?", "Michael A. Todman ", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan", "Just on Brazil, great results there, and obviously in part driven by the tax credit incentive but also in part just with the overall market strength.  Any view in terms of how we\u2019re to think of more of a normalized environment and to the extent that the tax credit perhaps pulled forward some demand in 4Q, how you\u2019re thinking about more of a normalized rate?", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "There\u2019s really three parts as you know to our Latin America business and our Brazil appliances.  The rest are Latin America appliances and there are [inaudible] compressor business.  Let me just briefly speak.", "Brazil appliance is where we had the great demand as we said.  Revenues were up 40%, multiple currencies during the quarter.  There\u2019s two things going on there.  One is which we talked about is the stimulus that\u2019s going on that\u2019s scheduled to conclude October 31.  When we talked about this in the second quarter, our comment was that we expect the growth to moderate and that there would be a wear out effect a little bit on that.  That didn\u2019t happen. It actually improved and I think that really speaks to my second point which is we\u2019re seeing a very strong Brazil economy, in particular a very strong consumer economy.  ", "Although the stimulus had a positive impact, I think the underlying factors are pretty good. We are expecting as I said again a moderation after the program ends.  I can\u2019t really project in terms of growth rates but I do think there could be a change for a couple months although we\u2019re entering the high season for appliance demand in Brazil.  So we\u2019re not expecting to continue this tremendous growth that we\u2019ve seen but I would say we feel pretty bullish on the Brazil market in general.", "Outside of Brazil, international, the other 32 markets outside of Brazil, very weak the first half of the year. They\u2019re showing recovery so we\u2019re reversing some negative momentum there and actually getting better.  Same with [Embraco], very tough first half of the year because they supply to finish goods around the world which reflected the weak demand and inventory correction and even that demand is improving.  So on balance, we feel good about our Latin America business.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company.  ", "Analyst for Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company", "This is John Curtis standing in for Laura.  She\u2019s in Europe and must have dropped the call.  Can you talk about what is in the other line in cash flow from operations?", "Roy Templin", "This is Roy.  Let me take that question.  Here are the key items.  Let me first of all say a reminder of what is other because it\u2019s sort of like the last line in this section and it really does two things.  It captures cash payments for items outside of working capital and pension and comp which we separately identified in restructuring on the cash flow.  So it captures the cash payment.", "The other thing this line item does is it basically adjusts for non-cash items that are in our earnings.  For example, the Brazilian settlement that I referenced in my script.  That obviously is a negative in net earnings but we will not pay the cash for roughly 5 years in 12 equal installments.", "The other line, there\u2019s a positive adjustment in that line to offset the negative and net earnings which gets you back to net zero cash from operations for that transaction.  Here are the key drivers to that year-over-year delta that you\u2019re seeing.  The first one is lower promotional and advertising payments.  That\u2019s probably $100 million to $110 million lower.  We are in a VAT payable position which his higher than a year ago in terms of the year-over-year comparable.  The key items driving that VAT payable, and by the way, that\u2019s about $90 million, is just the activity and the volume levels that we saw at the end of the third quarter and the pickup, particularly in Latin America.", "The other thing that happened in Latin America is there was a change in law in the way that was remitted and the timing of those remittances which added about $35 million to that $90 million favorability.", "The compressor settlement is plus 60.  The IPI accrual that we made earlier in the year which again is a non-cash accrual is 35.  Then we have accrued interest and some FX losses, each about $25 million which again, we\u2019re negative accruals in the P&L but no cash flow, so those are positively adjusted on that line.", "Analyst for Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company", "As we start cycling some of the commodities of inflation, lapping it to next year, what\u2019s your outlook for commodities, how that\u2019s going to be a benefit or hit next year?", "Michael A. Todman ", "Again we\u2019re not really giving any kind of 2010 forecast.  I would just say if you look at the current trends, we\u2019ve had quite a swing over the last year.  Right now a number of these things like oil are moving up.  Our factors are CL oil, base metals and components and we have not yet finalized our forecast for that but again there\u2019s clearly some things are edging up and you know what those things are.  But I can\u2019t really give you a forecast.", "Analyst for Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company", "I just want to make sure I heard this right.  The 30% normalized tax rate should be offset by the energy efficient credit netting to zero taxes.  ", "Roy Templin", "The 30% normalized tax rate, Sam\u2019s question was can I begin to project the 2010 tax rate and we\u2019re really not in a position to do that.  What I said was\u2026 let\u2019s think about the key components within our tax rate.  First of all, the sort of normalized run rate for Whirlpool Corporation this year is about a 32% expense.  If you looked at the results in the US and international operations blended together.  Now the key offsets to those are the energy tax credits, the BEFIEX credits and then of course R&D credits that we earn in the US and around the world.  So what I said to Sam was we do not see a significant change in that base tax rate.  But we'll still have some of the other credits.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "First of all, on the demand side we saw progress in shipments in North America in 3Q versus 2Q which doesn't seem like you're assuming that continues in 4Q.  Can you just give us your perspective on what happened with overall shipment activity in 3Q and sort of what your sense is how that plays out as we move into 4Q and towards 2010?", "Michael A. Todman", "Eric, let me just talk a little bit about the third quarter and kind of the progression of our shipments because what I said was that we actually saw our shipments better in the third quarter than we had a year ago, if you will.  So we saw a pickup.", "The fact of the matter is from a demand perspective what we also saw was a positive progression of demand in the quarter.  So, for instance, July was lower than August and September was significantly better than any of those months.", "As we now cycle through the fourth quarter, I mean, we've given our 10% for the year and essentially says we expect to see a somewhat continued or improved unit environment, market environment.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And in the rest of the world, again, these different regional businesses decline at a slightly different rate.  Europe really didn't begin to decline last year until November.  So we're seeing the same trend through the quarter there.  We don't expect the year-over-year comparisons to start getting much better until we start comping against the bad numbers last year, which in Europe's case is later.  And of course the emerging markets have already recovered and they're actually experiencing very strong growth.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Can you make an expense of the impact of promotions a year ago or in the first half?  I don't think we saw 25% off deals like we've seen here a bit recently.  How much of the improvement do you think is a function of promotions and how much of it is a function of consumers just at a point where they can't put purchases off any further?", "Michael A. Todman", "To be honest with you, I believe that although promotional activity may be slightly higher, I think that when you look at the overall demand it's based on kind of what consumers need.  I don't think it's being driven by promotions in and of itself.  So promotions are a little bit high right now but not significant enough to, I think, make a huge difference in our demand.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Secondly, a comment was made that there would be a restructuring expense in the fourth quarter, $65 million and I think you had a pretty decent expense in the fourth quarter a year ago.  But can you talk about what that is related to and what the benefit of that expense would be?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Eric, I will - a year ago we announced that we had some very specific things that we were doing.  And I think what Roy indicated was that we would have a larger than what has been our run rate for three quarters in the neighborhood of around $65 million potentially in the fourth quarter.", "No, I would say either I've got to go back to our continued and very aggressive focus on cost reductions.  And we're accelerating those efforts.  We have a number of things around the world, projects that we're looking at, evaluating in its various stages of decision making.  As you know with accounting rules you don't take the charge until you actually make the decision, you form the people and so on and so forth.", "And so I can't give you the specifics other than it's our expectation that given the large number of things we're looking at around the world that we will continue to aggressively move forward with this cost reduction via restructuring.  It really won't have any benefit in 2009 but we certainly would expect benefits in 2010 and '11.", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, and, Eric, to the second part of your question where you ask about the actions that we took last year and the benefits from those, we're still estimating in 2010 that we'll get an annualized benefit from the activities we took a year ago of about $270 million and we think we'll get about $175 million of benefit in the current year, $120 of which we've taken year-to-date from the activities in Q4 a year ago.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then lastly on cash flow, can you just clarify?  I know you increased the guidance by $200 million.  Are there some timing benefits that are aiding cash flow this year?  You talked about the inflection and the VAT and the promotional accrual.  Is there anything within timing that is benefiting cash flow this year?  Or is the cash flow improvement sustainable from this year into next year?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, let me talk about - the first part of your question is do we see anything that flips or turns that's sort of embedded in the third quarter year-to-date cash flow?  And the answer to that, Eric, would be yes.  If you ask me to estimate I think there could be $75 million plus of flip that will naturally occur out of Q3 into Q4.  Why do I say that?  Well, I know there are some promotional accruals in various parts of the world which will get paid out in the fourth quarter.  I know there's some accrued interest that will get paid out.  There are some foreign currency unrealized losses that I anticipate will become realized in the fourth quarter.  And so that natural flip, which by the way, at any point in time we always have some amount of flip embedded in our cash flow.  But that flip is certainly in the year-to-date Q3.", "Now as you look at the fact that we took up our guidance, Eric, a couple of things there.  One, the primary driver of that is just the increased cash earnings and that's why I sort of emphasize the word cash in my script because as you know we've got some key cash items that happened here in Q3 with the settlement in Brazil.  And of course, the Q4 restructuring charges which will be non-cash this year and the cash won't flow until next year.", "The other thing, Eric, that is embedded in there is our continued focus on working capital.  You've known our company for a long time and so if you look at sort of what's implicit in our guidance versus what we traditionally do in the fourth quarter, our number this year is obviously lower than historical trend rates.  And a big part of that is working capital because we're going to get about 70% of what we traditionally get in the fourth quarter, this year in the fourth quarter.", "And, Eric, it's simply because we just came out of the third quarter in a much better position than where we traditionally are as an organization.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then just to clarify one last point, the restructure in 4Q sounds like it's above what you had originally expected by $30 million, $40 million.  Is that fair?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "You're exactly right.", "Operator", "", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "I guess I don't have too many questions on the quarter.  I really wanted to just, Jeff, we don't get a chance to chat with you that much.  I wanted to talk about a couple strategic things.  I guess number one, on competition, it seems like the face of competition's changing here a little bit from sort of the GEs and the Electroluxes to sort of a new crowd from Korea, LG and Samsung.  And I\u2019m just wondering how that changes the game for you in terms of product development and the retail channels and if you can talk about that.", "And then, secondly, it seems like there's been kind of this makeshift in front load laundry which was really kind of a disproportionately large contributor of your profitability in the past away from sort of the four-digit price points down into upper three-digit price points.  And I'm just wondering if as we get into the recovery phase of the cycle is there any chance that those price points can be taken back up and the margins can go with it?  Or has this been kind of a one-time shift and you're just going to be challenged with having to come up with new product to make up for that in the future?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, David, let me first talk about global competition.  I mean, your first statement's absolutely true as it relates to the United States.  The reality is globally you know who they are.  There's five or six global competitors that we compete with everywhere in the world.  And certainly the biggest change in the US market over the last five years has been aggressive entry by a number of Asian competitors and they've gotten a certain portion of the marketplace.", "So the names are different but the level of competition is certainly as intense as it's ever been.  And I think we expect that really in every market that we can compete.  Has it changed in the way we compete?  I mean, our view is the basics is that strong brands, great products, great quality and very competitive cost is the essence of winning consumers in the marketplace.", "And so from that standpoint it has not changed.  I think there are some - where some new competitors have come in there's a lot more, I would say some of the product development cycles are faster.  I would say there is a lot of imitation going on in the marketplace right now and the importance of strong brands and intellectual property and things like that are more important than ever which we're investing very heavily on.", "But, look, competition's good for the consumer.  And we're well prepared to compete in a market like this.  But I don't expect that to change.  In fact, if anything, it will increase.  And some will benefit and grow in this environment.  And if you aren't competitive you will not grow.", "The second question about the makeshift front end laundry, high price points and so on and so forth, yes, there's a lot of dynamics going on there.  First of all, the first big change was there was a big shift from top-load to front-load.  That has stabilized, actually has reversed course during the course of this year and we've been a big part of that.", "We basically are achieving our vision in fabric care to give the consumer the choice to have great energy efficiency, great water efficiency, great clothes care in whatever configuration that they want.  And with the introduction of our new both Maytag and Whirlpool high efficiency top-loads we now are in the position where we can do that.  And the consumers are voting.  And right now there's a shift back to top-load.", "But having said all that and with more competition it has driven price points down below $1,000 in a lot of cases.  Our view is that any time you don't innovate prices will go down.  And our job and I think you're seeing some of it now and the fact that our mix hasn't deteriorated this year I think as you go into 2010 if you see the kind of innovation we're bringing to the marketplace.  Value is based on what you get not just price.  And I think you'll see new value propositions which consumers like very much that they will be willing to pay four-digit price points for.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "And just back to the first point on the Korean competition, I mean, it has been a very promotional environment here in the fourth quarter.  But they also are well regarded for being innovative.  And so I'm wondering to the extent they become more pervasive in your business should we expect a lot more promotional activity and more price discounting or should we just expect a lot more innovation?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, I think a lot more innovation is good for the industry.  And that will bring more consumers into the marketplace that may, as we saw before in the recession, accelerate replacement cycle.  So from that standpoint I hope we do see more industry innovation.", "The price competitiveness and all that, I mean, there's a manufacture level, there is a retail level.  Part of it has to do with what happens to material costs and all those kinds of things.  At the end of the day there has got to be economics for both manufacturers and retailers.  And I don't know that we'll have any more or any less.  We always have a lot of promotional activity.  And I don't think we're in a new era of promotional activity.", "Operator", "And our last question today comes from Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "", "Just a couple quick ones - I was just wondering if you could just refresh our memory in terms of the restructuring charges what roughly was in the numbers in '07, '08 and now '09.", "Michael A. Todman", "Well, Michael, the '08 was just under $150 million total restructuring.  This year's estimate now with the incremental guidance we provided this morning would be in the $130 million to $140 million range for the full year total restructuring.  '07 was roughly $60 million if I recall.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "And just I guess as you take a look at, I mean, this is kind of a bigger picture question and I know you have been talking about an 8%, I think, margin in aggregate for the company.  Recognizing that a lot of that is dependent on a return on volume to some degree, any kind of updated views in terms of time to get there and do you think that with a more normalized return to volumes over the next three, four years that you could see it concurrent with that pace or given the improvements in cost structure that you're looking to get there even faster than that?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, Michael, what's going to - I can't give a future forecast at this time but I would just say there's no doubt in our minds we have a global business and operating platform now to generate at least 8% of the operating profit.  I think what I showed in that last slide, what we are doing, we are substantially reducing our breakeven level.  This is not one time.  It's structural.", "We're doing the things that we need to do with innovation which is going to drive the revenue line.  We're winning in most major markets around the world today in the marketplace.  A flat demand environment we'd probably do pretty well in.  And when we see the growth we ought to benefit greatly from it and that ought to accelerate our pace to get there.  But I\u2019m not going to give you a timeframe.", "Listen, everybody.  Thanks again for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you next time.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.  You may now disconnect.  Have a great day.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Greg Fritz. Go ahead sir.", "Greg Fritz", "", "Thank you, Chris, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool fourth quarter conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool\u2019s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to the many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q. During the call we will be making comments on free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Listeners are directed to Slide 31 for additional disclosures regarding this item. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at WhirlpoolCorp.com. ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Well good morning everyone and again thank you for joining us this morning. Before I begin I do want to briefly discuss the leadership changes we announced in mid-December and that Greg just referred to in the opening comments. ", "First of all, Mike Todman who was previously the President of North America is now serving as President, Whirlpool International. In his new role he will be accountable for Europe, Latin America and Asia regions as well as our global information systems. Mike\u2019s also accountable for several key global, strategic areas including our innovation and global energy efficiency initiatives.", "Marc Bitzer who was previously President of our U.S. operations has moved into the role of President, North America. Both Mike and Marc are two highly capable leaders I\u2019m very confident will do a great job in their new assignments and they\u2019ll be representing their respective region on this call.", "Turning to the release as you all know earlier this morning we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. You can see these results on Slide 2. As we outlined to you last year at this time, we faced a very challenging macroeconomic environment on a number of fronts. All major markets were in decline at that time and we felt that we were likely facing a year with significant revenue decline, higher costs and volatile currencies. For the full year this proved to be accurate as our revenues declined by 10% versus 2008 levels.", "We also at that time outlined the key drivers of our business and separated them into two categories. On one hand we talked about areas that would positively impact our business and things that would negatively impact our business. The negative impacts were significantly lower demand levels, the impact of foreign currency and very volatile material costs. The positive impacts on our business related to our swift, aggressive action to address this challenging environment particularly in regarding our costs and working capital initiatives. These actions helped to improve our operating margins by 1.1 points to 4% during the year despite a substantial decline in sales.", "In addition, we reported for the year a record level of free cash flow of $1.1 billion during 2009, which has significantly strengthened our company\u2019s financial position. If you turn to Slide 3 we highlight our execution against the key operating priorities that we established for last year. From a cost standpoint we had a very strong year. We were able to significantly lower our breakeven point through the structural cost reductions across our global organization. We also continued to build a foundation, a very strong global product platform designs and the supporting component [commonization] initiatives that go along with them. These actions lowered our costs, improved our quality and increased our speed to market from design to market launch. ", "And overall I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in these areas of the business which will continue to benefit us this year. ", "Moving on to cash, again we had the best year ever in terms of generating free cash flow. Our aggressive focus on working capital reduction, particularly in the area of inventory, resulted in a substantial source of cash flow during the year. This performance in addition to our note issuance and credit agreement extension significantly improved our financial and liquidity positions. ", "Finally, our market execution goals for the year were to have a good balance between price mix and market share and during 2009 we finished the year with positive price mix and very good share performance in all of our key global markets.", "Slide 4 highlights one of the most important aspects of our spending initiatives last year. In this case, it\u2019s what we didn\u2019t cut and that was our investments in new product innovation. We continue to invest in our business during the downturn as R&D and capital expenditures actually increased as a percent of total sales. These investments will yield strong gains in new product innovation over the next 12 months and reflects the continued commitment we have to bringing new consumer relevant innovation to the marketplace on a continuous basis.", "Turning to Slide 5, we expect to have a strong year for innovation with our pipeline now over $4 billion in future revenues. From a product perspective you\u2019ll see major launches as Laundry, Cooking and Refrigeration impact. Marc Bitzer will touch on a few of these products in a moment but we expect to have a very strong year of innovation globally across our product line.", "We do see many great opportunities for growth in markets around the world, largely enabled by this record number of new product innovation launches that we have scheduled for this year. On Slide 6 I\u2019ve summarized our current demand outlook for 2010. Overall we expect global industry demand will show modest growth globally in 2010. Obviously there\u2019s still a high degree of uncertainty in many facets of the global economy, but we do feel that we\u2019ll see in 2010 growth from a low base.", "In the U.S. we expect major appliance demand to increase by about 2 to 4%. This would mark the first full year of positive growth in four years and is largely driven by a more normal replacement market. In Europe we expect conditions will remain relatively more difficult with industry demand being flat to 2009 levels. As you would expect, there\u2019s a large range of outcomes by country, but overall we\u2019re starting to see demand stabilizing and are forecasting flat demand for the year. In Brazil we continue to see very strong underlying fundamentals and we\u2019re forecasting industry demand growth to be in the range of 5 to 10% off of the strong year this year. Finally, we expect the markets that we serve in Asia will grow in the 3 to 5% range. We expect India to continue to show very strong growth, leading the region.", "Finally I would direct your attention to Slide 7 where we provide our 2010 financial outlook and guidance. For the full year we expect to generate earnings per share in the range of $6.50 to $7 per share. Also for the full year we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $400 to $500 million this year. We expect the positive impacts to our operating performance will be a continuation of the significant cost reduction from productivity that we had last year, which again will be a significant contributor to our improvement in earnings. In addition, we certainly expect higher unit volumes will contribute in part to our overall revenue growth and aid in improving our margins.", "For the full year we expect price mix and currency impacts will be generally neutral to our operating results. And finally on the unfavorable side, we still see material and oil cost inflation increasing and we expect it will impact our operating results in the $200 to $300 million range compared to last year.", "At this point in time I\u2019d stop here and I\u2019ll turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North American operations.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 9 I would like to briefly go over some of our key accomplishments from 2009. ", "As Jeff mentioned earlier, we maintained a strong commitment to innovation investment both in the form of R&D and capital expenses. And from a market standpoint we delivered a strong increase in our branded share during the year and during Q4 in particular. We also made strong progress in reducing our cost structure, a double digit reduction in manufacturing capacity, a reduced [stress] in the structure by nearly $200 million or 1 percentage point of sales.", "Finally, we saw strong improvement in our logistics network. We have completed our move to a new regional distribution center footprint, we have implemented a new home delivery model that we believe best of class in our industry and we expect this will yield both a better service level as well as a reduction in delivery costs.", "On Slide 10 we detailed fourth quarter results for North America. We marked the first quarter since Q1 \u201907 that we posted a year-over-year sales increase in North America. Our unit shipment growth exceeded the market growth. We reported operating margin of 5.2 percentage points and that\u2019s a 6 point improvement over the year before. And that was largely driven by cost and productivity initiatives and higher volume, partially offset by the lower price mix.", "On Slide 11 you can see some of our news innovation. As you know we are focused on providing consumers with the greatest value by offering a preferred brand that they can depend on with the most and knowledge of features in the most cost efficient way possible. From a dishwasher and disposal [cleaner] to a completely new, side-by-side refrigerator platform, our cadence of new product introductions remains very strong. There\u2019s one product on this Slide that I will talk about in more detail and that is our new Whirlpool brand Vantage top-load laundry pair. You will see on that Slide that this product features an LCD touchscreen control. It\u2019s the industry\u2019s first USB port that allows consumers to update and customize washing cycles and other controls. And finally the fit, finish and design of this product is a leap forward from an industry [setting] class model.", "Turning now to our industry outlook for 2010 on Slide 12, I reviewed some of the background on the components of demand. As part of our forecast we expect to see a 27% increase in new housing starts or approximately slightly above 700,000 units. We expect existing home sales to improve approximately 7% during the year and we\u2019re looking for consumer confidence to be stable to slightly up and they will remain at historically low levels or slightly above that. Consumers are still very cautious given the many uncertainties in the economy and we expect this to remain the case with our 10% unemployment assumption. While general consumer uneasiness lingers, we expect to see stable replacement demand for the year versus some delayed purchases during the beginning of 2009. ", "To summarizing, based on our current estimates of these economic variables we believe the U.S. industry demand will increase 2% to 4% in 2010, which is still well below historical long term demand levels. ", "And now I would like to turn it over to Mike for his review of international operations.", "Michael A. Todman", "", "Thanks, Marc, and good morning everyone. Let me begin with the general overview on Slide 14. During 2009 we saw a return to strong economic growth in Brazil and India. These markets not only had a much faster return to general economic growth rates, but they also saw appliance demand return to growth rates well above the general economy.", "Europe remained the most challenging region from an international perspective as we managed through a broad contraction in most economies. From a Whirlpool perspective we focused significant restructuring resources on the European region during the fourth quarter to better align our cost structure with industry demand levels and insure an appropriate structure for 2010 and beyond.", "Overall, during 2009 we made strong progress toward our cost reduction goals across the region and strengthened our share position. Turning to Slide 15, our European sales improved 2% in the quarter. In local currency, sales declined approximately 9% from the prior year. Our unit shipments declined approximately 9% year-over-year which was largely in line with the estimated industry demand levels during the quarter.", "The region reported an operating profit of $19 million compared with the $2 million earned in 2008. Results were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes while lower costs and higher price product mix harshly offset these challenges. While we have taken necessary actions and made progress in our European region, results remain below satisfactory levels and we will continue to adjust our cost structure accordingly.", "Fourth quarter results from our Latin American business can be found on Slide 16. The region reported sales of $1.2 billion compared to $777 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 28%. The sales increase was driven by favorable foreign currency exchange and strong demand for our appliances in the Brazilian market. Results were partially offset by lower tax credit monetization levels and product price mix. Operating profit totaled $138 million compared to $110 million reported during the prior year period. ", "Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 17. Net sales increased 34% during the quarter to $188 million, up from $140 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 27% compared with the prior year period. The sales increase was driven by strong results across the region. With our new industrial joint venture in China, and our strong presence in India, we are well positioned to benefit from the growth trends in these markets. Operating profit during the quarter was $6 million compared with $3 million reported in the prior year. The operational improvement was primarily related to higher unit volumes. These improvements were partially offset by lower price mix.", "A few minutes ago Marc talked about our ongoing investment in our brand portfolio and a strong cadence of new product introductions. That is the case not just in North America but around the world as we continue to provide consumer relevant innovations to consumers everywhere. On Slide 18 you\u2019ll see just a few of our international product launches. ", "Slide 19 summarizes our outlook for international operations. Overall, appliance industry demand in Brazil and India remains strong and ahead of general economic growth rates. We are seeing some commonalities in both of these markets including improved affordability, a developing middles class, a low base of appliance penetration rates compared to the U.S. and Europe, and solid economic fundamentals. These factors, combined with Brazil\u2019s appliance stimulus program, have strengthened our position in those markets. The Brazil stimulus program ended effective February 1. Although we do not yet understand the impact of this change, it is important to note that all trade inventory prior to that date still qualifies for the tax holiday. ", "In addition, we believe that the underlying demand is strong, irrespective of the stimulus program because of low interest rates and underlying economic conditions. And we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Latin American business in 2010.", "In Europe, however, we expect demand to stabilize during 2010 and we continue to pursue aggressive actions to improve our results in the region. And finally in Asia, our strong performance in the quarter highlights the early success of our joint venture that allows us to continue to add new product offerings and we see significant growth opportunities in the region, particularly in India and China.", "And now with that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Roy Templin for his financial review.", "Roy Templin", "", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Beginning on Slide 21 I\u2019ll walk you through a summary of our fourth quarter performance.", "Our net sales performance marked the first global unit volume increase we have had since the first quarter of 2007, with our units increasing approximately 9.5% from the prior year. Our revenue was also favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation which accounted for approximately 7 points of the year-over-year increase. The favorable impact from currency was primarily related to a stronger Brazilian real and the euro when compared to the prior year. ", "Looking at our margins during the fourth quarter, the positive year-over-year increase was primarily from our productivity and cost reduction actions. These actions were partially offset by lower price mix and BPX monetization, which declined $21 million from the prior year. ", "Finally, before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there are a few items I would like to highlight. The first is a $46 million accrual related to a previously disclosed legal action pertaining to a collection dispute in Brazil. This was recorded in interest and sundry expense. The second item related to interest and sundry was a $13 million expense related to previously capitalized transaction costs. We also recorded a net favorable $13 million adjustment related to operating and income tax settlements in Brazil in response to revised government options.", "Turning to the income statement on Slide 22, we reported net sales of just over $4.8 billion, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Our gross margin rose 3.1 points to 14.1%. As I mentioned previously, the most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost and productivity actions which were partially offset by lower price mix.", "SG&A expense totaled $427 million. Foreign currency translation and the non-recurrence of an asset sale gain in the prior year accounted for over 90% of the year-over-year dollar increase. Restructuring expenses totaled $55 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in Europe. We currently anticipate recording restructuring expenses in the $100 million range during 2010. This amount will be partially offset by curtailment gains due to a previously announced facility closure. Finally, our operating margin expanded to 4.1% from .2% in the prior year. ", "Turning to Slide 23, I wanted to touch briefly on interest expense. Related to the revised tax settlement terms in Brazil, noted in my earlier remarks, part of the settlement adjustment was recorded in interest expense. Excluding this settlement, our interest expense would have increased mainly due to higher average borrowing rates due to our notes issuance during the second quarter. Turning to interest and sundry expense, the items I mentioned earlier substantially offset favorable year-over-year currency resulting from prior year losses on balance sheet positions and an asset impairment, again recorded in the prior year.", "Finally turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $10 million during the quarter corresponding to an effective tax rate benefit of 11%. The fourth quarter credit was slightly below our previous quarterly expectation, largely as a result of higher pretax income and the establishment of reserves for foreign tax audits. Our annual tax credit of 21% fell within our previously disclosed range. For the full year 2010 we are currently estimating a tax credit in the range of 15% to 25%. Finally, we reported EPS of $1.24 per share including a $0.40 per share negative impact from the legal accrual that I noted earlier.", "Moving to our full year free cash flow results on Slide 24, as Jeff mentioned earlier we had an outstanding year. The strong working capital performance during the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations in every part of the world. As a percentage of sales, our full year free cash flow was 6.4% which is well ahead of our long term objective in the 4% to 5% range. Our full year free cash flow generation of approximately $1.1 billion, in addition to our term note issuance during the second quarter and the extension of our revolving credit facility through August of 2012, has substantially improved our financial position.", "Turning to Slide 25 we show our net liquidity position. As you can see from this chart, our net liquidity position has improved to approximately $3.3 billion from $2.1 billion at the end of 2008. At year end our cash balance stood at $1.4 billion and we had full availability under our revolving credit facility.", "On Slide 26 you can see we have significantly reduced our net debt balance to the lowest level in four years. We feel very good about our ability to continue to fund our restructuring and product innovation initiatives. We have also consistently paid our dividend throughout 2009. After funding these operating initiatives, a key priority going forward is improving our credit metrics with a goal of returning our credit rating to pre-recession levels. ", "Finally, turning to our financial outlook on Slide 27, we are expecting to report earnings per share in the range of $6.50 and $7 per share. This compares to the $4.34 we reported for 2009. As Jeff reviewed previously, we expect to have favorable impacts from increased global unit volume as well as our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives. In addition to these factors, the Brazilian government recently announced that it will not renew the IPI Tax Holiday Program that has been renewed several times since mid-April. But there will likely be some lag until all lower IPI based products clears the inventory pipe, as Mike referenced earlier. We have anticipated this change in our outlook.", "From a headwind perspective we are assuming material and oil related costs to increase in the range of $200 million to $300 million in 2010. And turning to our cash flow outlook, we are projecting free cash flow from between $400 million to $500 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in a range of $525 million to $575 million during the year. After our strong working capital performance in 2009, and with our expectation of higher global unit volumes, we expect working capital will be a use of cash during 2010.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Thanks, Roy. I\u2019m going to now turn to Slide 29 where we outline our key operating priorities for 2010. As you will notice, many of these priorities remain unchanged from what we outlined for 2009. ", "We continue to have a very strong focus on cost reduction across our global enterprise. As Roy previously mentioned, we\u2019ll be taking additional restructuring actions during 2010 from previously announced actions, as well as some new actions to continue to drive lower structural costs; lower capacity levels; in taking productivity and other cost initiatives to offset material costs. In total we think we\u2019ll be able to expand our operating margins from our cost activities.", "Cash flow also remains a very high priority for us in 2010. As we mentioned, we had a record year for cash flow last year and we expect to generate solid free cash flow during 2010. This is despite our expectation that we will have some working capital build during the course of the year as we return to sales growth. And certainly given the amount of certainty there remains across the globe and the effects that we\u2019ve seen over the last year, the global financial crisis, you should expect that we will carry a higher cash balance over the course of the year than we maybe historically have, and we think it\u2019s appropriate in this period of time. ", "From a market execution standpoint we will continue to balance our share and price mix as we manage our business in 2010. We feel very good about our innovation pipeline and the cadence of new products that we\u2019ll bring into the market during the course of the year. We expect these new products to help us build our branded position during the year. ", "Our successful execution on these priorities will enable us to deliver strong earnings growth during the course of the year.", "I\u2019d now like to turn to Slide 30 and take a moment to discuss our long term, value creating objectives. We view 2010 as a year of full recovery for our company, where we regain a large portion of our revenues that declined both in \u201908 and \u201909 and improving our operating margins. From this base we expect to build in 2010, we\u2019re recommitting to our value creation objectives for revenue, for earnings and for cash. And that means from a top line perspective we would expect to continue to target annual sales growth in the 5% to 7% range, earnings growth in the 10% to 15% range and continuing to improve our free cash flow as a percentage to sales and try to manage it between the 4% to 5% range.", "We are emerging from one of the most challenging economic environments that we\u2019ve seen in decades. I think a very strong message for us is that I believe we are emerging this period as a much stronger company. We have substantially lowered our breakeven point, substantially improved our financial strength and expect to bring a very strong cadence of new products to the market during 2010 and beyond. While the economy remains volatile, we feel we are well positioned to meet our long term value premium objectives and we\u2019re repositioning ourselves for significant values for our shareholders in 2010 and beyond.", "I\u2019m going to end here and I\u2019d now like to open this up to call out [any] questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "First off, the Latin American expectations of up 5% to 10%, obviously the comparison especially in the second half is going to be pretty onerous and Mike I know you referenced this, but how much did the IPI favorably affect sales units in 2009? And how can you tell how much is the underlying economy helping that business versus the incentives? That would be my first question. My second question has to do with price mix. You\u2019re expecting neutral price mix in 2010, although it looks like price mix degraded pretty sharply in the tail end of 2009. Why does that stabilize would be my second question.", "Michael A. Todman", "Okay. Well, Sam, let me try to answer your first question relative to the market in Brazil. If you remember the IPI tax holiday was actually put on in April of 2009 and we still saw growth in the Brazil business, you know, over 30%, which essentially says that it was not all driven just from the IPI tax. Now you know they\u2019ve just repealed if you will that tax, so it\u2019s hard for us to know exactly what the outcome\u2019s going to be but suffice it to say there\u2019s probably about 30 to 45 days of inventory in the system that will qualify for the tax. And then after that our view is that the underlying economics, both with low interest rates and the general economic conditions, is going to continue to drive a favorable market environment for us. So I feel pretty confident about that.", "The other piece is that we\u2019ve got the international businesses, the Chiles and Colombia\u2019s and etc., which as you know were down significantly in 2009 and we expect to have some recovery in those markets. So you know I can\u2019t give you an exact number of what the IPI tax drove but we feel very comfortable about the 5 to 10% range.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Let me take the price mix question. You know first of all we view managing price mix as a very important capability throughout our global operations. And you know last year, 2009, was the third year in a row where we\u2019ve been able to manage positive price mix in a very competitive global marketplace. So you know our attention is no different in 2010. I would also say that every year we get there in a different way, whether it be price or like-for-like pricing, regional and product and brand mix and that sort of thing. You know the way I would describe it is the story for 2010 is a little bit different. In some high inflation markets like India, we\u2019ve already announced and taken a price increase for 2010. We did that in December. In other regions like Europe we finished the year driving very positive price mix. ", "You know the U.S. gets a lot of attention where we had negative price mix in the fourth quarter. You know there we\u2019re very pleased with where we are today. You know going off of last year and the first half of the year and fourth quarter of \u201908, very high comparisons year-over-year so we\u2019re comping against our highest levels of the previous year. And I see innovation as being the driver of our ability to drive mix in the U.S. So you know, you put it all together, you know it\u2019s hard to predict at the beginning of the year but we have given our track record the last three years I feel pretty good that we\u2019re going to be able to manage that at least to neutral for 2010.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "The tail end of 2009 price mix degrading, was it mostly price or mostly mix?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "That was a combination of both.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "It wasn\u2019t one of them driving it, per se?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "No. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Laura Champine - Cowen and Company.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company", "Roy, a lot of below the line items moved earnings around in 2009. You had some legal expenses that presumably are one time, but can you run us through what your below the line assumptions are in your earnings guidance on tax, interest, sundry? A better picture on that would be helpful.", "Roy Templin", "Sure, Laura. I\u2019ll try to go in the order that you see them in the P&L. First of all with respect to interest expense, you know I made the comment that a part of this Brazil tax settlement in the fourth quarter distorted what otherwise would be our run rate. And I think I\u2019ve said on prior calls the normal run rate for us right now with the base of interest we have is about $60 million a quarter or $240 for the year. Now, Laura, we obviously have the capability to use cash should we decide to do so on the first of May when our $325 million 8% senior note becomes due. Obviously if we use cash, that will change the trend that I\u2019ve just given you, but net net it\u2019s about $60 million a quarter. Interest and sundry, you\u2019re right, we\u2019ve had some one time events this year particularly with now this legal dispute in the fourth quarter and of course the compressor settlement earlier in the year.", "Laura, you know over the years our other income, other expense or interest and sundry has been about $50 to $60 million of expense. If you wanted to increase that somewhat for higher legal costs related to the compressor investigation, that might be prudent to do so which might take you to more of a run rate like $70 to $80 as you look out going forward in the very near term.", "From a tax rate perspective, again I said in my script that you know we\u2019re projecting the tax rate for next year at about the same level of credit that we had this year. Now initially that may not seem real intuitive, but there\u2019s two pieces, Laura, that really offset one another. One is logically the credit would get smaller year-over-year because we\u2019re going to have a much higher base of earnings and therefore that brings down the overall credit that we have as a company. Offsetting that, though, Laura are two things. One, we do think that given the innovation and the energy efficiency wrapped around the innovation that we\u2019ll deliver to the market in 2010, that we will earn higher energy tax credits. And as Mike indicated earlier now with the repeal of the IPI tax holiday, while there will be some volume impact from that we do expect to see and experience higher BFX tax credits in Brazil in 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Ray Horn] for Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan.", "[Ray Horn] for Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "First question, wondering if you could just drill down a little bit more into the 2010 operating margin expectations, particularly in you know North America, you know if you guys can kind of get back up to more of a normalized operating margin there in 2010. And also in Latin America, with the monetization of the BPX tax credit do you think you can get the margins back up to like a 12%, 13% range?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, let me give you a couple of perspectives. One, you know expanding our operating margin is amongst the highest priorities we have throughout the company and we made progress last year. We expect to make further progress this year and I think you can dimension that by our earnings guidance because that largely would all be operating margin expansion. You know the levers that we\u2019re driving certainly will benefit everywhere from some improvement, not a lot, but some improvement in volume, but really significant improvement in our ability to continue to drive cost productivity in costs. Again as you heard me say earlier we expect price mix to be neutral.", "So yes, I do expect a very big improvement. We do expect it around the world, every geography. I mean basically the lower the operating the margin, the higher our expectations for improvement. But we do expect it in all parts of the world. I\u2019ll speak for just a moment on North America and then let Marc Bitzer make some general comments about North America. And also I mentioned Europe. Europe obviously kind of hit the low point, they were negative in the second quarter of last year, they\u2019ve improved every quarter since, so obviously we\u2019re expecting a good improvement in Europe. Latin America is at a very strong level. In fact, ex-BPX they\u2019re at or near some of our highest margins ever but yet given the robustness in that economy, given our market position and our product high point of innovation, you know, we expect to continue to improve our operating margins.", "So you know if we have more BPX, that will only help those margins. But we look at it both with and without and certainly without we\u2019re driving towards some margin expansion. And Marc, I\u2019ll ask you to comment about North America.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "I mean for North America we feel very comfortable about the active run rate which we carried out in Q4. And without getting too much into the statistics but two big components drive mix very much along the same line of what Jeff outlined globally, we expect for North America. Take into account both pretty high comparable rates in the first half of last year of 2009. At the same time a very big amount of product innovation coming into particularly the latter half of 2010. So price mix we expect a neutral impact in the full year very much in line with global perspective. ", "And the other element is along the same lines of what we\u2019ve done very well in 2009, continue to focus on cost productivity improvements which overall should help our growth margin.", "[Ray Horn] for Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "Actually drilling down on the cost reduction in productivity, you had also mentioned your run [too] of about $200 to $300 million. Do you guys think the productivity and the cost reductions are going to more than offset $200 or $300? Or are you guys expecting some additional opportunities on the cost saving side?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, yes. Our first task is to minimize the $200 to $300 million but that\u2019s right now the range where we see it today. But the direct answer to your question is yes. As we did this year, we expect our combined global cost reduction activities and our productivity coupled with, you know last year as I said we radically lowered our breakeven point to the volume level. So with some additional volume and with these cost reduction productivity activities, we expect to expand our margins meaning we exceed these cost [savings].", "[Ray Horn] for Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "Then the $200 to $300 million raw materials, how much of a raw material increase is that baked in in terms of like steel and oil prices?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, that\u2019s what it reflects. The $200 to $300 million includes oil, steel, base metals, components, etc.", "[Ray Horn] for Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "On a percentage basis year-over-year, like where do you guys think steel can end in 2010 versus 2009?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "I\u2019m not projecting that by category. I\u2019d say that the biggest factor and probably uncertainty is oil and [inaudible]. You know where it is today, it\u2019s up substantially from a year ago, where it hit a much lower level. So that\u2019s probably the biggest driver. Steel just due to its weight is probably second and then components, base metals and so on are probably third.", "Roy Templin", "I think the other thing to keep in mind is two things. One is as you know we do hedge commodities and so many times it\u2019s difficult to look at the commodity curves and then link it directly back to Whirlpool. That\u2019s the first point. The second point is keep in mind the circular flow of some of these components as Jeff indicated, because we see it not only in the commodity prices but then within the components, motors, pumps, compressors, electronics, etc., that we purchase to put into our products. So you sort of get a double impact there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David MacGregor - Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research ", "Just one more on commodities. What percentage of your total 2010 raw materials requirements are price protected as of today?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "David, this is Jeff. I don\u2019t have that statistic in front of me. I would just say that steel, you know obviously that\u2019s our biggest purchase. In the emerging market that\u2019s always open discussion. In the big markets like Europe and North America we do have agreements within ranges, so I think our steel is pretty predictable, at least in the big markets.", "You know oil, oil resins, we don\u2019t hedge it. We can\u2019t hedge oil so that is what that is. Resins are related to oil and they generally have some type of broad band of range there. And then I would say all of our strategic components and that kind of stuff is pretty firm. So I don\u2019t know what that equates to in terms of a percentage but that would be the color around those areas.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "As I was looking at your Slide 30 where you talked about long term value creating objectives, Jeff, there was no mention of the longer term 8% EBIT margin goals so I guess I wanted to just see if that\u2019s still sort of your frame of thought on EBIT margins.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes. You know we\u2019ve talked about operating margins. Our expectation for what we believe this business out to be able to deliver over time and we\u2019ve absolutely not changed our expectations about that, 8%.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "So just on that point I guess two parts to the question, and I know the question was asked earlier about trying to drill down. Maybe I\u2019ll ask the question a little bit differently. What\u2019s the extent of your unrecovered commodity cost inflation today? And secondly, what\u2019s your capacity utilization rate today?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "David, we don\u2019t give out capacity utilization rates but I would say we took out close to 5 million units of production capacity in the last 15 months. And the things we\u2019ve already announced for this year we\u2019ll take out more. I would say our utilization is increasing faster than the market has improved.", "Roy Templin", "To build on what Jeff said, just a couple of statistics because Jeff\u2019s right. The issue is that if we get real specific then we end up getting in some competitive sensitive areas. ", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "The 5 million unit number is very helpful. That helps a lot.", "Roy Templin", "So we took out just below 10% of the units from a breakeven unit perspective in 2009, so a big number. Secondly when you look at units produced, because we\u2019re comfortable giving that number, David, year-over-year in the fourth quarter 15% but you would expect us to be, right, because we were so low a year ago. But for the year we still ended up with about 3% unit production decline across the company versus a year ago, David.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "Is there any way you can address just the unrecovered commodity cost inflation over the last five years and just where you are? I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand how do you cover this 300 to 400 basis point gap from where you are today at 8% margins.", "Roy Templin", "", "You know, David, over the last five years let\u2019s say the raw materials cost increases were well over $3 billion. And I think if you go back to five years ago, the margin at 5.5 to 6%, you know, we\u2019re still short that much in terms from all of our actions from recovery. So again, 200 to 300 is not insignificant at all but I think given our scope and capacity, given I don\u2019t think 2009 was a one time event. You know we have at least as strong a global initiative on this in 2010 as we did in 2009. We have less headwinds on terms of things like volume and currency. We still have material to deal with, but I feel very comfortable, given what we know today that based on these assumptions we will execute very well on costs and productivity. We should be able to more than offset these costs and have cost improve our margins in 2010.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "Could I get you to address the Kenmore issue and you\u2019d mentioned a couple of quarters ago you thought you\u2019d be Delta neutral this year, you\u2019d replace the lost business. Can you elaborate a little further on where you are in that?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "As you know we don\u2019t get into the specifics of a contract with any given trade partners so what I can tell you, however, is there is business as we stated before in similar calls. We do expect for 2010 a somewhat lower OEM business in total. At the same time we expect to more than mitigate that through brand of business growth with Sears and with other trade partners. So we feel very comfortable, very well prepared to mitigate any potential OEM offers.", "Michael A. Todman", "David, the only thing I would add is a big part of that transition already started in Q4 so if you look at our Q4 performance, you know, as we said we expect to rapidly grow our branded business. That happened in Q4. We lost some OEM business or it went away in transition, so that transition\u2019s really already started last year.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "Do you expect to have any negative revenue repercussion at all in 2010, just because there\u2019s a gap from a timing standpoint?", "Michael A. Todman", "", "What we said has not changed. For the full year 2010 we expect to maintain and improve our market share in the North American market and that basically means more branded share and less OEM.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd A. Schwartzman - Sidoti & Company, LLC.", "Todd A. Schwartzman - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "Just a follow up on Sears. Where are you with the Jenn-Air business at Sears at this point?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "On the Sears Jenn-Air business as you know and has been previously communicated, Sears had the Jenn-Air business for many, many years and there\u2019s a significant amount of individual replacement demand which goes with [inaudible]. Sears has stepped up significantly in their commitment in terms of [inaudible] requirement on the respective floors and they have upgraded a lot of floor requirement, and that business from what we see is progressing pretty well.", "Todd A. Schwartzman - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "", "Is there any way to get some numbers in terms of the incremental business from you?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "No, we don\u2019t break out any specific branded numbers.", "Todd A. Schwartzman - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "", "Can I get you to speak to 2011 tax rate assumption at this point? Maybe even in a range?", "Roy Templin", "No. I\u2019m comfortable going out in 2010 and as I said that\u2019s based on all of our current assumptions. As you go out into 2011, two things that you need to think about, Todd. One is I\u2019ve said before piercing through [inaudible] that exist in today\u2019s rate, you know this company\u2019s normalized run rate would be a tax expense of about 30%, high 20s to 30%, Todd. And so that\u2019s point number one. Point number two would be keep in mind that under the current legislation, the energy tax credits will end this year. And so as you know that\u2019s been a big impact with respect to that otherwise normalized rate and those credits will end this year. But beyond that, it\u2019s too early for me to go out in 2011.", "Todd A. Schwartzman - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "", "Is it possible to provide any additional color on the pricing environment by geographic segment?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Look, we never talk about forward pricing. You know we have had some markets and I mentioned like India where based on high demand levels and also high inflation levels, we\u2019ve taken some price increases that were announced late last year. But overall you know I would say we don\u2019t see any big changes around the world. We\u2019re focused on really driving a positive level of mix, using our innovation to drive that mix. We\u2019re seeing some demand recovery in some of the like the North American market which is a big help, but that\u2019s really all I can say at this point in time on pricing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citi.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citi", "Just first on BVX, you guys recognized about double in Q4 what you did in Q2 and Q3 and I thought the tax credit regime down there was not allowing you to recognize BVX?", "Roy Templin", "Yes, Jeff, this is Roy. That\u2019s a good question. If you look at the details of, as you know this thing\u2019s been extended a couple of times, but there was a very important detail in this last extension which enabled us to recognize more BVX credit but also of course we incurred more IPI tax result. And here it is, Jeff. If you look carefully at the last extension, they basically did the extension by energy efficiency category. They have categories A through E, more energy efficient to less energy efficient. So on those lesser energy efficient models, the holiday went away and so what you\u2019re seeing is it\u2019s the impact of the mix of business we had, but you\u2019re right. Net net we had more IPI tax in there for an incremental billing to monetize, although no where near where we\u2019ve been in the recent past but certainly greater than Q2 and Q3.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citi", "", "And Roy, would your guidance kind of assume that some kind of normal BVX of $120, $130 million a year for 2010?", "Roy Templin", "I think that\u2019s too high, Jeff, and I say that because you know the way I think of this is we have a couple of recent goalposts. You have two years ago, where had $169 million. That\u2019s too high because as Mike said we had a period of tax holiday in addition to the very important point that everything that\u2019s in the trade that they purchased without IPI tax of course can be sold to the consumer without the IPI tax. That\u2019s one. And the second thing is if you look at the fact that it\u2019s dependent upon a mix of business and our demand, I think Jeff it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019ll be greater than the $69 that we just had in 2009 but less than the $169. And I would have a number closer to $100 million versus your $120 plus.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citi", "", "Just on free cash flow, obviously there\u2019s some big swings between \u201908 and \u201909. I\u2019m just trying to think about the idea of normal cash flow in the 4% to 5% range. Just my observation here but if we average \u201908 and \u201909 to take out that volatility you get about $500 million free cash flow a year on kind of average earnings over those two years of about $5. You know now we\u2019re looking at $6.50 to $7 in earnings and we\u2019re talking about cash flow that\u2019s the same as those prior two years, maybe lower, in the $400 to $500 million range. I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s some pension funding and maybe some other dynamics, but could you just elaborate on that? Is there anything there we should be aware of in thinking about how the cash works through this year?", "Roy Templin", "Well, first of all I think to your broader question of course you have a margin change assumption in your broader equation, right? So as you look at the value creation objectives that Jeff shared, obviously you get the higher margin. As you know, Jeff, our principals sort of year in and our out, the principal pipe for cash flow in any business of course is your after tax earnings and so that\u2019s a very important element with respect to that. ", "I\u2019ll come back to the second part of your question, though, and you\u2019re right. As you look at next year\u2019s guidance it sort of falls in the level of what we\u2019ve seen combined the last two years. I think a couple of key things. One is we are expecting and of course it\u2019s clear in the guidance to have higher cash earnings in 2010, but that is going to be offset by working capital. Working capital will be a use of cash as we again grow our working capital to support and elevate demand levels. But remember now that\u2019s coming off of a $618 million source of cash in 2009, so it makes the comparables a little bit hard to follow.", "The other area that\u2019s important, Jeff, to your question is the other operating accounts. And as you know and you\u2019ve asked me I think in the prior quarters, that\u2019s been a big line item for us in this year because of two things. One, we\u2019ve had non-cash charges that are negative in the earnings but then positive in other operating because there\u2019s no cash associated with them. And the second area is as you would have expected and we did experience, we have lower promotional payments coming into the year. For example, I mean that was roughly $100 million when you take our normal trended cash flow, a better improvement in 2009, that won\u2019t be there in 2010 and of course wasn\u2019t there in the prior years before that.", "Pension funding which was the third piece of your question, you know all up I think two things. One, we did make a voluntary pension contribution of $74 million, which is embedded in the 2009 cash flow. As a result of that, Jeff, we will have no required minimum contributions in 2010 for the U.S. pensions. We may or may not elect to fund some monies but again there\u2019s no required minimums. When you look at the all up funding, that\u2019s looking at pensions, 401(k) and OPEC, because that\u2019s really the relevant question given the frozen status of our plans, we\u2019ll be at about $160 all in for funding for all benefit plans versus $290 in 2009.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And Jeff, to answer your question on a go forward, you know absent any changes in any given year the simple answer is I think over time and our long term value creating goals, our focus and desire to significantly expand our operating margins will directly play into our ability to get that 4% to 5%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "On the inputs and the cost savings, can you give us what the 2009 numbers were and what the 2010 looks like?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "I\u2019m sorry, Eric, would you explain that a little? I\u2019m not quite understanding your question.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "Sure. I think you characterized it the inputs input pressure in 2010. I think you indicated it was 200 or 300. What was that number in 2009?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "I believe we originally in 2009 the number was close to 200 but it actually lessened throughout the course of the year and it was negative but not very much.", "Roy Templin", "Basically flat, Eric.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "And then what were the cost saves or restructuring saves, however you would characterize that? I know that productivity is sort of more along the way but can you just give us any sense of the cost saves achieved in \u201909 and if there\u2019s a sense of what that number is in \u201910?", "Roy Templin", "Eric, I think your question is we\u2019ve been projecting the cost savings that we were going to have around the actions we had taken in the fourth quarter of last year. We did end the year with about $175 million of cost savings from those actions, which is spot on what we estimated. We had $55 million of benefit in Q4. And Eric we continue and we see no reason to believe that we will not achieve the $270 million of annualized benefit in 2010. We are absolutely on pace to do that.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "So that\u2019s roughly another $95 million of savings in 2010?", "Roy Templin", "That\u2019s correct.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "Secondly, with the free cash flow progress last year and you indicated you have this note coming due in May but what are the thoughts on the capital structure? Are there thoughts on restarting the share repurchase? Can you just give us some thoughts on that?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Certainly our priorities are fairly consistent. Number one is to fund the business. We\u2019ve indicated what that is and that\u2019s nothing out of the norm in our guidance. Along with that is paying down debt and appropriately funding our pension obligations, which we\u2019ve dimensioned what that is and you can see it. Right now whether it be share repurchase or dividend, that\u2019s obviously a board level decision that we look at over time to time. But I would say that is not our top priority right now. You know we did say that we would be carrying a higher level of cash than what has been our historical norm for the reasons that we explained and I think that\u2019s a common thing across many companies these days.", "So right now it\u2019s just very focused on driving this execution of the business, bringing these new products to the marketplace and funding debt pensions are a priority.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "And then lastly within Europe where you said there were some restructuring efforts focused in the fourth quarter, can you give us any sense or guidance of the magnitude of the efforts and how that can manifested in profitability improvement in 2010?", "Michael A. Todman", "Essentially, we had two areas where we had the restructuring. One was just in the salaried workforce and we had some fairly significant reductions there. And the other was to reduce if you will the people that we had in our factories. And so we really took down if you will the workforce that we had in those places and I think you know in Europe that it takes a little while for that to flow through. We expect to see some great benefits from that in 2010.", "Operator", "It looks like that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I\u2019ll turn the call back to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, again I just want to thank you for joining this call today.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.  For opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Greg Fritz.", "Gregory A. Fritz", "", "Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation first quarter conference call.  Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Mark Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool\u2019s future expectations.  Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10K and 10Q. ", "Turning to Slide Two, we want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures.  As many of you will note, we\u2019ve added some additional non-GAAP disclosures this quarter.  We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.  We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better base line for analyzing trends in our underlying business.", "Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 27 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.  Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investor\u2019s section of our website at www.WhirlpoolCorp.com.  With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "As you saw, earlier this morning we released our first quarter financial results.  These results are summarized and you can see them on Slide Four.  Overall, I believe we had a very strong quarter with sales reaching $4.3 billion which represents a 20% increase versus last year.  If you exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation revenues increased approximately 11%.  Our earnings per share was $2.13 per diluted share compared to $0.91 in the prior year.  ", "Overall, I think we saw strong operational performance in each of our regions and I\u2019m very encouraged by the 18% increase in our global unit volumes that we had during the quarter.  Our adjusted operating margin improvement was 3.2 points over the same quarter last year.  Also for the quarter, free cash flow improved by approximately $300 million year-over-year.  Our overall results reflect our lower breakeven point, our continued investment in innovation and our ability to expand our global product offerings.  By continuing to drive our operating priorities throughout the business, we\u2019ve been able to expand our operating margins at the same time we\u2019re accelerating growth.  ", "Now, turning to Slide Five, I\u2019d like to provide you with an update on our regional demand outlook revisions for 2010.  While there is still some degree of uncertainty in many facets of the global economy, we continue to expect growth throughout this year in almost all the markets around the world.  In the United States, we saw much stronger demand in the first quarter and we now expect major appliance demand to increase between 3% and 5% versus the previous guidance of 2% to 4%.", "Assuming this will occur, which we believe it will, this would mark the first full year of positive growth in consumer demand that we\u2019ve seen in the US market in over four years.  In Europe we continue to expect conditions will remain relatively challenging compared to other parts of the world and while our overall demand appears now to be stabilizing and we did post a modest increase in unit volume during the quarter, we continue to expect flat demand for the balance of the year.  ", "In Latin America, the underlying fundamentals remain very strong and we\u2019re now forecasting industry growth of approximately 10% versus the previous estimate of 5% to 10%.  We expect industry growth to remain positive as the year progresses though our outlook does imply a slowing of the rate of growth in the region over the balance of the year compared to what we saw in the first quarter and of course, the year-over-year comps start to change after the first quarter as we saw growth in the later part of last year.  ", "Finally, we now expect our served markets in Asia to grow in the 5% to 8% range versus our previous guidance of 3% to 5%.  We continue to expect India to show strong growth trends during 2010, somewhat offset by lower growth rates in some of the other markets.  ", "Turning to Slide Six, you\u2019ll see the key factors impacting our business for the year which we showed previously.  We believe our cost reduction and productivity will continue to drive improved earnings while higher unit volumes will contribute overall to both the improvement of our overall revenue growth and help the expansion of our margins.  We continue to anticipate price mix and foreign currency impacts will generally be neutral to our operating results for the year.", "Finally, we continue to expect material and oil related cost inflation will negatively impact our operating results during the year.  While you\u2019ve seen the recent trends in raw material prices which have been higher, we expect material cost inflation to still fall within our $200 to $300 million range that we previously provided although now we see it towards the higher end of that range.", "Given this backdrop, we now expect to generate earnings per share for the year in the range of $8.00 to $8.50 per year versus our previous guidance of $6.50 to $7.00 per share.  Our free cash flow guidance for the year is now $500 to $600 million compared to our previous guidance of $400 to $500 million.  Roy will go in to more detail later on in our outlook later in the call.", "At this time I\u2019m going to turn it over to Mark Bitzer for his review of our North American operations.", "Marc R. Bitzer, Ph. D. ", "Turning to Slide Eight, I would like to briefly go over some of the highlights during the quarter.  We saw solid improvement in industry volume, we had a favorable impact during the quarter from healthy replacement demand and the cash for appliances program.  This was particularly visible in March and to date the industry remains robust.  ", "From a full year perspective, we still see a modest positive contribution from the cash for appliances program and have incorporated this in our outlook.  As Jeff mentioned, we have raised our full year outlook slightly to 3% to 5%.  From a market share standpoint, we delivered a strong increase in our share compared to last year.  This improvement was driven by significant improvement in our branded share growth and partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the expected lower OEM share in the quarter.", "During Q1, we have had numerous new home builder contracts.  Some of our notable wins include new business with Ashton Woods, Beezer Homes, Equity Residential, Shea Homes and Toll Brothers.  We feel that we are making good progress in gaining a larger presence with new home construction.  As home construction returns we believe we will be very well positioned to fully participate in the industry upturn.", "On Slide Nine, we detail first quarter results for North America.  Our net sales have increased 7% to $2.3 billion and excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, sales improved 5%.  Our unit shipments increased 11% while US industry demand for key seven appliances improved 6%.  On an adjusted base, our operating margin was 6.2% compared to 4.8% in the prior year.  This profit growth was driven by cost and productivity initiative and higher volumes partially offset by lower price and mix.", "On Slide 10, you can see some example of some of the products we introduced in the quarter including a Whirlpool brand tall cup dishwasher for the value conscious consumer segment which sold exceptionally well during the first quarter.  It holds up to 12 place settings, features a one hour wash cycle and is the most energy and water efficient in its class or you will see also a Whirlpool brand [Calvary] high efficiency top load washing machine which features the largest capacity in the market and a low water wash system that uses less water per load yet delivers better cleaning performance.", "Lastly, in the middle you see a KitchenAid brand French door refrigerator featuring a large capacity, a full door LCD screen that displays use and care information and offers a kitchen timer, access to suggest ingredient substitution and USB support.  In summary, we\u2019re off to a very good start.  We have positive momentum as demand levels improve, our strong productivity throughout the business and we\u2019ll be launching a number of our new product innovations in the second half of the year.  ", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations.", "Michael A. Todman ", "Let me begin with a general overview of the international operations on Slide 12.  During the first quarter we saw a continuation of the favorable trends in our key emerging market businesses. Latin America and Asia reported strong results as these regions continued to report solid economic growth, particularly in Brazil and India.  More importantly for our business, consumers are increasingly benefitting from the quality of life improvements that our products provide.", "European market conditions remain challenging during the quarter, however, we did begin to see moderate demand improvement in Western Europe during March.  As the region begins stabilizing our focus remains on continuing to improve our cost structure.  ", "Turning to Slide 13, our European sales improved 6% year-over-year to $739 million in the quarter with unit shipments increasing 1% from the prior year period.  In local currency sales declined approximately 2% from the prior year.  The region reported an operating margin of 3.6% as a results were driven by cost and productivity initiatives.  ", "First quarter results from Latin America are summarized on Slide 14.  The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 65% increase from the $689 million reported in 2009 as appliance unit shipments increased 50%.  Excluding the impact from currency sales, sales increased approximately 40%.  The sales increase was driven by strong demand across most of our served markets in the region and favorable foreign currency exchange.  On and adjusted basis, operating profit increased $167 million compared to $83 million reported during the prior year period.  ", "Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 15.  Net sales increased 60% during the quarter to $192 million up from $120 million in the prior year period.  Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 49%.  Unit shipments also increased 49% during the quarter.  Our increased unit shipments are being driven by continued strong growth in India as well as growth from our expanded product offering and strong product sales in China.", "Operating profit during the quarter was $11 million compared with $5 million reported in the prior year.  The operational improvement was primarily related to higher unit volumes.  These improvements were partially offset by lower priced mix.  Our international businesses also produced a strong cadence of product introductions in the quarter.  On Slide 16 you\u2019ll see just a few of our international product launches including a line of built in steam ovens in Europe, the first echo efficient refrigerators in India, with these premium frost free refrigerators coming in in both two door and three door models, and water purifiers in Latin America that can be both installed and maintained by consumers. ", "Our global innovation pipeline continues to be strong and we are meeting the needs of our consumers everywhere in the world in more ways than ever before.  In summary, for the international business we are seeing strong demand in the key emerging markets which is supported by a strong product offering and increasing consumer demand while productivity improvements are offsetting higher material costs in those markets which is contributing to improved operating margin and we are seeing a stabilizing European market in which our cost focus is now contributing to improved operating earnings.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review.", "Roy W. Templin ", "Beginning on Slide 18, I\u2019ll walk you through the summary of our first quarter performance.  Our net sales marked the second consecutive quarter of strong  year-over-year increases with our first quarter units increasing approximately 18% in the prior year.  Our revenue was also favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation which accounted for approximately eight points of the year-over-year increase.  The favorable impact was primarily related to a stronger Brazilian Real and the Euro compared with the prior year.  ", "Looking at our margins during the first quarter, the positive year-over-year increase was primarily from our productivity and cost reduction actions as well as higher sales volumes.  These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower price mix.  Finally, before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there are a couple of items that I would like to highlight that impacted our first quarter.  The first is a $75 million accrual for a supplier related quality issue.  Second, we recorded a $29 million curtailment gain related to a post retirement benefit plan.  Finally, we monetized $41 million of BPX credits during the first quarter.", "Turning to the income statement on Slide 19, we reported net sales of just under $4.3 billion, an increase of 20% from the prior year.  Our gross margin rose three tenths of a point to 15.0%.  As I mentioned previously the most significant favorable impact on our gross margin improvement related to our cost and productivity actions which were partially offset by lower price mix.", "SG&A expense totaled $371 million.  Foreign currency translation and the non-recurrence of the prior year curtailment gain accounted for approximately 80% of the dollar variance compared with the prior year.  As a percentage of sales SG&A declined to 8.7% from 9.2% in the prior year.  Restructuring expenses totaled $20 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in Europe and a previously announced facility closure.  We continue to expect to record restructuring expenses of approximately $100 million during 2009.  Finally, our operating margin expanded one point from the prior year to 5.6%.  On an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 6.7%.", "Turning to Slide 20, I wanted to briefly discuss interest in sundry expense.  The main favorable variances from the prior year\u2019s level relate to foreign exchange and higher interest income from our overall higher cash balance.  Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $3 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax rate benefit of approximately 2%.  The first quarter credit was below our previous expectation largely as a result of higher pre-tax income.  Given our revised earnings outlook we are currently estimating our full year tax rates to approximate zero plus or minus 5%.  Finally, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.13 per share.  On an adjusted basis, our EPS totaled $2.51 per share.  ", "Moving to our first quarter free cash flow results on Slide 21 and as Jeff mentioned earlier, we had a strong year-over-year improvement.  This improvement was driven by a year-over-year increase in cash earnings and a lower amount of working capital investment as we increased our production levels.  These items were partially offset by higher capital spending levels during the quarter.  ", "Turning to Slide 22, we summarize our net liquidity position.  As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position remained over $3 billion at the end of the quarter.  Our cash balance was just under $1.2 billion and we had full availability under our revolving credit facility.  Given our strong liquidity position, we are planning to repay our $325 million 8.6% coupon note which is due on May 1st to further improve our credit metrics and generate interest expense savings.", "On Slide 23, you can see a summary of our revised full year outlook.  We are now expecting to report earnings per share in the range of $8 and $8.50 per share.  This outlook includes approximately $0.10 of net expenses related to the $75 million accrual for a supplier related quality issue recorded in the first quarter and a $62 million gain related to the full year impact of an [OPAD] curtailment gain.", "As Jeff reviewed previously, we expect to have a more favorable impact from increased global volumes as well as our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives.  From a headwind perspective, we continue to see cost inflation as our main challenge this year.  Given the recent trends in some raw material prices, we now see our material costs trending towards the higher end of the $200 to $300 million range for the full year.  Turning to our cash flow outlook, we are projecting free cash flow between $500 million to $600 million up from our previous expectation of $400 to $500 million due to higher cash earnings.  ", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "Let me summarize.  We are pleased with our progress and results so far in the first part of this year.  As you know over the last two years we have been challenged with both significant volume and production declines due to lower consumer demand and as we\u2019ve discussed many times over this period of time, we\u2019ve taken very strong steps to structurally align our cost structure and improve our asset utilization.", "Slide 26 illustrates what we have done and I think importantly what we\u2019re continuing to do.  I believe our first quarter results reflect the impact of what some demand growth enables us to do with a very efficient cost structure.  Going forward we are remaining very focused on cost reduction and cash generation as we did last year and in addition we will benefit from revenue growth due to both our strong new product innovations which we\u2019re bringing to the marketplace throughout the course of this year and improved demand levels.", "I truly believe this combination will produce very strong operating results and we look forward to continuing these trends as we go forward.  I\u2019m going to end here now and I\u2019d like to open this up for questions and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Josh Pollard \u2013 Goldman Sachs.\u2013", "Josh Pollard \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "It sounds like despite the improvement you\u2019ve had in both the top line and EBIT margins you all still seem unsatisfied with the margin profile.  Can you talk in a little bit of detail about what percent of the $95 million or so in cost saves you projected for 2010 you\u2019ve already captured here in the first quarter?  Then, can you talk a little bit about by region what you guys are doing to drive even better profitability?  I think the US is clear that you\u2019re driving the price mix in the back half of the year but if you can dig in a little bit on the other regions it would be extremely helpful.  And, I have a follow up.", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "Let me give you just kind of broad based comments here which is true for all parts of the world.  First and foremost we continue to be very focused on cost reduction productivity initiatives.  Typically, and this year is what I would call so far a typical year, these ramp up throughout the course of the year as you execute projects and that sort of thing.  Obviously, increased volume and production is immediate because we see that in the conversion costs, so that\u2019s really dependent upon that.  But, I would expect we would continue to execute very well in productivity and if anything probably accelerate the rate of productivity throughout the course of the year.", "The flip side of that is of course material costs.  We said it\u2019s in the $200 to $300 million range.  Probably at the higher end of that range as we see it right now, those two will probably ramp up as we go throughout the course of the year.  Regarding volume, volumes positive to our margins so you saw the outlook, we\u2019ve increased that so that should help and then PMR or price mix if you will, first of all we\u2019re very pleased with the results we saw in Q1.  Year-over-year comparisons are tough because we had such a big increase Q1 of last year but sequentially from Q4 we\u2019ve actually improved our price mix.", "We\u2019re seeing very strong mix in our business.  I think we have some very impactive product introductions throughout the course of the year which are high volume which should have a positive impact on the mix.  That\u2019s why even with a negative first quarter comparison on price mix we think for the full year it will be generally neutral.  Again, how we get there is slightly different per region only because environment is different but I would say in general those are all the same characteristics we\u2019re focusing on everywhere.", "Roy W. Templin ", "Josh in reference to your $95 which I think you\u2019re talking about the program we announced in 4Q 2008, we continue to be on track with respect to that.  We still think we\u2019ll end up with a run rate of $275 million of benefits as a result of those actions.  To the second part of that question, we had just under $60 million of benefit in the first quarter and as we look forward to the next three quarters we see $60 to $65 million of benefit in the next three quarters as well.", "Josh Pollard \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "My other question is on Latin America.  We continue to hear very positive things in Brazil via our channel checks there, even after the stimulus expiration and we recognize they\u2019re 30 to 40 days that you have of additional time to use that.  What are you assuming happens in the back half of the year or in other regions within Latin America that gets you to only 10% full year growth in that region?", "Michael A. Todman ", "Let me take that, let\u2019s go back to last year, this is a stimulus program in Brazil and I\u2019ll focus on Brazil right now.  Through this IPI tax holiday really began in late April, that\u2019s when it was initially initiated.  So if you just think of the first quarter of last year it was not impacted by the stimulus program so this is really a quarter this year running through that.  If you remember, it ended in January but there was inventory in the pipeline and so that inventory has kind of come through the system.", "As we look forward therefore, what we think is we\u2019re going to see some moderation in the growth because we\u2019re now at fairly high levels and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying the growth for the balance of the year is going to be more moderate but think about it\u2019s more moderate on already pretty high levels as that stimulus program kicked in over the remainder of the year.  The last point I\u2019d like to make is just the underlying economics in Brazil and frankly for many of the other Latin American countries is pretty strong.  So we\u2019re seeing kind of positive momentum throughout those markets although maybe at a slightly moderated rate.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "In North America I think you said that units were up 11 and up six market which was an even wider favorable gap than 4Q and we know the OEM, the Sears impact is sort of grown and now where  it is.  Can you just talk about how you\u2019re accomplishing this and the sustainability of this and also speak to if there\u2019s any supply issues that are having any impact on this as well.", "Marc R. Bitzer, Ph. D. ", "Yes, you\u2019re right in your observation, we picked up market share in Q1 on a year-over-year base and sequentially versus our very strong Q4 we\u2019re pretty much flat on a total share base.  However, even sequentially we\u2019re on a brand share base quite a bit up versus Q4 which basically shows you as we said before fully mitigated any potential OEM losses which are by now behind us.  So from a market share perspective OEM losses are pretty much a non-event.  That is largely driven by increased floor space pretty much across all retailers, in particular on our branded side.", "There\u2019s not one channel we would point out, there\u2019s a number of parts across all channels which expanded our floor space.  So we feel overall very good about our share momentum coming out of Q4 in to Q1, in particular on our branded side.  Yes, as you have observed, that has led to some availability issues in some parts of the business.  It\u2019s been a consistent strong demand behind our products throughout Q4 and Q1.  We ran in to some component availability issues which we expect to be fully recovered by the end of Q2.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "Secondly, the comment on price mix negative for the last couple of quarters and the comment that you expect it to be neutral by year end, can you just talk about why it\u2019s been negative and what improves it?  And also, touch on the thinking related to pricing increases as your input costs could move higher.", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "I\u2019ll talk about that globally.  You probably recall first quarter last year we had a very positive price mix, I think it was about three points.  So, the starting point is we\u2019re comping against a very strong comparison.  We\u2019re down two points versus Q1, so two points versus that up three last year.  We\u2019re up about a point from Q4 so sequentially we\u2019re improving our price mix.  You may or may not recall but in Q3 last year and a little bit in Q4.  ", "We did say that we did do some structural price repositioning and particularly in the North American market place on certain very competitively intense categories.  We did that, you saw the momentum we got by doing that both in Q4 and Q1 but at the same time we continue to drive mix and we had a again, a very favorable mix period improvement almost over a full point versus even Q4.  So the trends are I would say pricing stable, mix growing as we start comping against last year\u2019s numbers that\u2019s how we\u2019ll get to be neutral plus or minus a little.", "In terms of pricing now, I can say is we\u2019ve done pricing and we talk about some markets like India where we\u2019ve had very high material cost inflation.  I believe we announced two price increases so far one in December and one a month or so ago.  Some of the emerging markets have slightly different dynamics with both material cost and pricing and we\u2019re managing them appropriately.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "As you look at higher input costs as we move through the year and potentially in to 2011 as you indicated, is pricing an alternative to help offset that, a realistic alternative?", "Jeff M.

I guess to what extent have you anticipated this in your guidance and what gives you some assurance that you might be able to deal with this from a competitive standpoint or from sort of a balance and negotiating power in the channel standpoint better than you were able to in 2008?", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "Well David, I guess first of all steel is still largely a regional market.  Through Asia and Latin America we basically negotiate daily, weekly, monthly and so that\u2019s already reflected and by the way so was last year.  We manage that through a combination of all the things that we do.  Negotiation through cost take out through pricing, etc. again, as we\u2019ve shown to date.  So then you have North America and Europe, as we\u2019ve talked in the past the large majority of our needs we typically contract with multiple suppliers.  ", "We pretty much know the range of outcomes, certainly for the balance of this year and we\u2019re comfortable those are well represented in our guidance.  The surcharge and all that talk I don\u2019t really have any comments about that.", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research, LLC.", "But there are no surcharges anticipated in your guidance at this point?", "Jeff M.

", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research, LLC.", "Second question, it seems like with the numbers that are coming out which are pretty impressive.  You\u2019ve got to be running at a pretty high level of efficiency within your organization right now.

Fettig ", "It\u2019s already happening.", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research, LLC.", "Can you give us some sort of quantitative guidance on to the extent that we should be modeling that in?", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "It\u2019s a little bit hard because it\u2019s by product, by factory and by market.  I would just say literally we\u2019ve added shifts.  We\u2019ve got some facilities now in both Latin America and North America running 24/7.  We\u2019re very I would say aggressive about ensuring our supply.  We\u2019ve had some availability issues in certain products, that has not been an assembly issue it\u2019s been a component supplier issues which we\u2019re working our way through and hopefully we\u2019ll have that behind us.  Overall, given demand levels in the case of the United States was down 35% from 2005 to 2009, we\u2019ve had a nice step back up 7% or so.  I mean, we\u2019ve got plenty of capacity and we\u2019re adding back folks as we need them.", "David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research, LLC.", "Last question,  just on the stimulus program, 11% volume improvement in the quarter is pretty good.  How much of that do you think was related to the stimulus program versus how much was good underlying recovery in demand?", "Marc R. Bitzer, Ph. D. ", "I think it\u2019s a combination of both.  It\u2019s difficult to quantify exactly what portion each aspect has.  I would overall say that the stimulus program drove more traffic in to stores than was originally anticipated by the retailers and us.  Despite a fragmentation across different states, but it drove quite a bit of attention.  I think what is most encouraging in the states where the stimulus program has now passed, the demand level has stayed on a fairly elevated level.  So there is good sell through, good inventory moves and that all added in to overall demand in the first quarter which we see still maintaining.", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "As you know, some of these state-by-state, some lasted for hours, some lasted for day.  But, to Marc\u2019s point I don\u2019t think it was actually that which has positive impact, I guess we kind of see it at a broad level it was bringing consumers back to the marketplace which was probably the biggest positive impact.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners.", " ", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Jeff, I think in your earlier response to a question about price mix you were answering it on a global basis, the -2% year-over-year and plus 1% quarter-to-quarter.  Can you just give us that read in North America.", "Marc R. Bitzer, Ph. D. ", "I can give you that for North America.  The Q1 impact has been a negative on the price mix and that is largely as we expected very simply because we had last year in Q1 kind of the peak of our price increases post the August \u201908 and January \u201909 price increase.  So some of that we expected.  On a sequential base for North America our Q1 price mix is up in particular driven by the mix component.  So kind of on a sequential base we\u2019re actually pretty comfortable about the pricing run rate, year-over-year, that is what we expected in the first quarter.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Just understanding the difference between 11% unit growth and 5% sales growth it\u2019s technically 6% but you\u2019ve got Mexico and Canada and a bunch of other stuff in there so is 6% the negative price mix in North America year-over-year or is it a different number than that?", "Roy W.

Obviously, price mix, materials, all that sort of stuff is going to swirl around that but is that the right type of ball park for us to think about now with what you\u2019ve done to the cost structure on how incremental revenues might convert through the P&L?", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "To your point, there\u2019s pluses and minuses to both but yes, I think the leverage we saw in Q1 is not unexpected given both the conversion that I\u2019d also like to add our continued focus on driving our breakeven points down which we made again, more good progress in Q1 which we will continue.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Can you characterize how much lower your breakeven is?", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "The difficulty of that Jeff is it varies by product, by factory and by market.

First of all, let me be real clear, the $41 million should not be assumed to be sort of a run rate going forward.  As you know when we had the two months in which to earn BPX on a lot of the products but keep in mind what Mike said in terms of exceptionally high demand, we also had a very rich mix.  So as I look at BPX we would naturally be up from the $100 and I would say probably 20% to 25% above that number is what we would estimate now for the full year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen & Company.", "Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen & Company", " ", "Just to talk about your share gain, you addressed the price mix in North America was a bigger impact on top versus bottom so it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re driving share through pricing actions.

As I said before, our demand has kept up pretty strong even post the stimulus program so it\u2019s pretty much across all product categories.  We\u2019re right now particularly also [inaudible] the cooking progress but it\u2019s pretty much wide spread across most categories.

I know obviously every state is a little bit on a different timetable but generally speaking I was wondering if you could share your best sense of where we are in the program and if you do expect any type of fall off following the program?  I mean obviously March was up 9% in AHAM shipments and you\u2019re expecting 3% to 5% for the year.  So it\u2019s kind of a question on where we are and how it effects demand on a shifting type basis?", "Marc R. Bitzer, Ph. D.

As of today, we\u2019re pretty much through 85% if you take the volume weighted average.  What we\u2019ve seen, pretty much as we indicated before, obviously with different degrees, but it was very successful in most states.  But, as we said before, the demand stayed up pretty high in most states.  People came back in to the stores, it brought quite a bit of traffic.  We\u2019re also seeing that retailers came very, very low on inventory levels in to the first quarter but it\u2019s now more balanced.

Fettig ", "Not really because as I said we buy open market in Latin America and Asia and Europe we obviously can\u2019t talk about our steel contracts.  So the delta let\u2019s say is oil and oil related.  It depends on what assumption you take on base metals.

Recall that the BPX credits are not taxable, that\u2019s about a six point benefit on our overall tax rate and then we get roughly four points of benefit from global R&D credits that we earn around the world.

Templin ", "Well Michael I can give it to you in US dollars, $645 million is the remaining balance, you\u2019ll see that when we file our 10Q this afternoon.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 JP Morgan", "Lastly, and I think this was talked about before but I just want to make sure I understand, the slowdown that you\u2019re assuming in terms of your full year growth relative to what you saw in the first quarter, it looks particularly striking in Europe and Latin America in that the comps get a little bit tougher in the second and third quarters.  4Q \u201909 is certainly a different story but if you\u2019re putting out anywhere close to the growth in the first quarter it would seem that the guidance, the full year guidance is a little bit conservative.  So I just wanted any color on that, any thoughts around that type of statement and if there\u2019s something we\u2019re missing here or if you\u2019re just being a little conservative?", "Jeff M. Fettig ", "Well Michael, I would just say we\u2019re up 20% in revenues in Q1.  We\u2019re not forecasting that for the balance of the year.  Some of the comps, for example in Latin America, they are pretty significant comparisons because the market really took off after April and continued strong throughout the year.  We had good growth in North America in the fourth quarter last year so I mean we do start having some comp differences.  ", "As I said, as you look at the variables if you will, we still think it is a gradual economy.  Four months in to the year we\u2019re not completely convinced that the growth trends are stable enough to say that they\u2019re going to continue at these rates, it\u2019s early.  I think as I said earlier, the biggest variable is really demand.  If demand is better we\u2019ll do better.  If demand is worse we\u2019ll have to find ways to make it up.  So I think demand you\u2019ll have to be the judge of whether it\u2019s conservative or aggressive.  But that I would agree with you if the variable.", "We appreciate you joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again in July.

Today\u2019s call is bring recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Greg Fritz. Please go ahead.", "Greg Fritz", "Welcome to the Whirlpool Third Quarter Conference Call. Joining me today Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Michael Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we began let me remind you that we conduct this call we will be making forward looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our actual results could differ maturely from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10K and 10Q.", "Turning to slide 2, we want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as the exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with the better baseline for understanding trends in our underlying business.", "Listeners are directed to the pending section of our presentation on slight 28 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items the most directly comparable gap measures. Our remarks track with the presentation available on the investor section of our website at Whirlpoolcorp.com.", "With that let me turn over the call over the Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "As you saw earlier this morning, we released our third quarter financial results and you can find these results summarized on slide 4.", "During the quarter, as we expected, we faced the challenge in environment in some markets which resulted in slowing the sales growth compared to the first half of the year. We were able to quickly adapt to these economic changes due to our ongoing focus on cost reductions, productivity, and our innovative new product launches.", "Revenues for the quarter came in $4.5 billion and that is flat versus last year. On an adjusted basis, our EPS was $2.22 per share compared to $1.67 in prior year. Our productivity results were very positive during the quarter enabled us to meet the challenges related to volume in some markets, price mix and higher material cost. On a year-to-date basis free cash flow was flat which was an improvement from the first half usage of $80 million.", "Turning to slide 5, I would like to provide you with an update for the full year on our regional demand outlook. In the US, we now expect our full year demand in shipments to be up approximately 3% versus the 5% that we had discussed early this year. We did see some softness in demand here in the third quarter. In spite of this weakening demand environment, overall we performed very well from a brand and share perspective.", "In Europe, we continue to see industry growth improvement during the quarter. We increased our full year outlook to a demand growth of 1 to 3% as we now see demand growth for three consecutive quarters across the region.", "In Latin America, we saw appliance demand rebound after some moderation in demand late in the second quarter. As you may recall, we had some significant events and results during the second quarter related to the expiration of the IPI tax holiday and the effects of the World Cup. We see the underlying economic fundamentals there remaining very strong and we continue to see full year growth in demand in the range of 10%.", "Finally, we saw healthy growth again in Asia. Our businesses there continued to grow at a strong double digit rate during the quarter. We have increased our full year industry outlook for Asia to 8% to 10% for the full year.", "I will now turn to slide 6, where you see the key drivers which are impacting our business for the year. We expect our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will continue to be the main driver behind our overall improvement as they have throughout the year. We managed our cost reductions efforts effectively and we expect to continue to benefit from these actions for the balance of this year.", "As you know, we have seen foreign currency exchange become very volatile during the quarter but we\u2019ve been able to contain and mitigate these risks and expect foreign currency impacts will be manageable at today\u2019s (inaudible).", "Finally, as we expected, we continue to see unfavorability in the area of material cost for the third quarter. For the full year we now see material cost trailing towards the lower end of the $200 million to $300 million estimate that we gave you throughout the year.", "Finally, given the trends that we saw in the third quarter, we now expect price mix to have an unfavorable impact on our full year results, and while we have had a very positive consumer receptions to our new product innovation launch during the third quarter, the overall price mix environment was more challenging than our previous expectations particularly in North America.", "Looking all these factors in total, we\u2019ve been able to offset the negatives that we saw in the external environment with the internal actions that we\u2019re driving. We continue to expect to generate our adjusted earnings per share for the year in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share. Our free cash flow gains remains unchanged for the year, which is $550 million to $650 million.", "At this point in time, I\u2019d like to turn it over to, Marc Bitzer for his review of the North America operations.", "Marc Bitzer", "Let me start by giving my perspective on North America\u2019s performance in the third quarter. As shown on slide 8, we saw strong branded share growth during the quarter, driven by our consumer relevant innovation and improvement in some of the product availability issues we experienced during the second quarter.", "Our three new product launches are well-received by consumers, but on the same time industry volumes and the pricing environment were more challenging than expected and we took actions to meet some aggressive competitive pricing pressure.", "On slide nine, we detailed North America\u2019s performance in the third quarter. Net sales decreased 3% to $2.4 billion driven by lower average sales values in the quarter. I will touch on this momentarily, but this decline is largely related to reductions in three major product categories.", "Our North America unit shipments increased approximately 1%, while U.S. industry unit shipments of major T7 appliances decreased 3% during the third quarter. We had, as mentioned before, a strong increase in brand and share during the quarter. Our operating margin was 4.7% compared to 5.9% in the prior year. Overall the results were unfavorably impacted by lower price mix and higher material costs. Favorable cost reductions and productivity initiatives partially offset the unfavorable items.", "On slide 10, you can see some of our new products that we expect to continue to support our branded share growth. The Maytag brand Ice20 Easy Access Refrigerator which is the industry\u2019s most efficient four-door refrigerator. It features an external counter height refrigerator door that holds up to five bags of groceries. We also launched the Whirlpool brand most premium front load Duet (inaudible). This is the industry resource efficient washer and dryer.", "Finally, the KitchenAid brand dishwasher featuring a modern version of a recessed handle found on (inaudible). I would like to point out that all of these new launches happened towards the end of the first quarter.", "On slide 11, the chart depicts ASU, average sales value industry trend by category. First thing you will note is that we generally buy distribution on a year-over-year basis; there is some categories up and others down. You will also note that the overall reduction is mainly attributable to two categories. We like to rest some of our price points in these categories given the competitive environment and we saw subsequently a strong in our brand and share performance.", "It is also important to note that our new products innovations start to provide an overall ASV lift and we continue to focus on successfully launching our new products and continuing to generate more new products in the future.", "Overall, I would sum the third quarter as challenging from a demand and price environment. We continue to address the green consumer relevancy product to market and keeping a strong focus on cost control and productivity.", "Now, I would like to turn over to Mike for a review of our international operations.", "Michael Todman", "Let me start with an overview of our international business. Our international operating results continued to benefit from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth from our emerging markets. During the third quarter we experienced improved market conditions in Brazil, slight improvement in Europe while Asia unit volumes remained very strong.", "Turning to slide 13, our European sales declined 8% year-over-year to $827 million in the quarter with unit shipments increasing 6%. Excluding the effects of currency, sales were essentially flat compared to the prior year. The region reported an operating profit of $26 million during the third quarter compared to an operating profit of $14 million in the previous year. The profitability improvement was driven continued cost reductions and productivity improvement which was partially offset by higher material costs and lower price mix.", "Slide 14 shows a summary of our Latin American third quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 13% increase from the prior year period as the appliance unit shipments increased 9%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 9%. Operating profit reached $143 million compared to $93 million reported in the prior year. The profitability improvement is primarily related to the increase in volume, cost reduction and productivity initiatives and increased monetization of certain tax spreads. These favorable items were partially offset by higher material cost and lower price mix.", "Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on slide 15. Net sales increased 21% during the quarter to $195 million, up from $162 million in prior year period as unit shipments increased 18%. Excluding the impact of currency sales increased 16%.", "On an adjusted basis operating profit reached $5 million for the quarter versus the $5 million generated in the prior year period. Favorables, volume growth and productivity was offset by higher material and oil related costs.", "Turning to slide 16, you will see just a few of our international product launches during the quarter including the Bauknecht brand, Cosmos built in coffee machine in Europe. The machine makes coffee and froth\u2019s milk at the press of a button and can make espresso, caf\u00e9 latte or cappuccino.", "The Brastemp a TV and washing machine in Latin America. It features an additional wash basket for delicate clothes and a special option on the machine can reduce soap stains by premixing soap and water before it comes into contact with fabrics. The new Whirlpool brand Ace semi-automatic washing machine in India, which offers a built in work surface and a handle and wheels for portability.", "Turning to slide 17, I would like to summarize our international outlook for the remainder of 2010. We see demand levels improving slightly in Europe and expect to continue to see margin expansion as a result of our ongoing productivity efforts. As we discussed on the previous call, in Latin America, the slight negative growth rate in the second quarter recovered nicely in the third quarter despite more difficult comparisons, and we expect continued growth in the region for the remainder of the year. In Asia, we expect to continue to see positive growth through year-end.", "In all the international regions, we will continue to focus on productivity to offset continued cost increases. In addition, the international organization is focused on continuing to bring consumer-relevant innovation that will improve our price mix. Our innovative new products continue to improve our price mix in the third quarter, despite the overall degradation we experienced. Going forward, we are focused on bringing more of these products to the market at a faster pace.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review.", "Roy Templin", "Beginning on slide 19, I would like to summarize our third quarter results. For the quarter, our sales grew one half of a percentage point to $4.5 billion. Appliance unit volumes increased 5% from the prior year, while all of our regions reported unit volume increases during the quarter the overall increase was largely driven by higher unit volumes in our international operations. We continue to see a significant benefit from our productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the quarter.", "In addition to this, we monetized $56 million of BEFIEX credits compared to $8 million in prior year. If you recall in the prior year we saw a significant reduction in our BEFIEX monetization due to the IPI tax reduction, legislated by the Brazilian government, which expired on February 1. Finally, these favorable effects were partially offset by lower price mix and higher material cost.", "Before we take a look at the income statement in detail, there is one item I would like to highlight. During the quarter we recorded a $93 million accrual related to Embraco settlement agreements. This resulted in an unfavorable impact of $1.20 per diluted share on our third quarter results.", "Turning to the income statement on slide 20, we reported net sales of just over $4.5 billion. Our gross margins rose 50 basis points to 14.3%. The most significant favorable impacts on our gross margin improvement related to our cost take out and productivity actions and the higher BEFIEX credits, which were partially offset by lower price mix and higher material cost.", "SG&A expense totaled $391 million. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $5 million of the $9 million year-over-year decrease. Despite our relative flat sales results during the quarter, we continue to generate good SG&A leverage, as SG&A as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points to 8.7% of net sales.", "Restructuring expenses totaled $16 million during the quarter and were largely related to cost reduction actions in the North America. Given our year-to-date restructuring spend and our fourth quarter outlook, we now expect to record restructuring expenses in the $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. Finally, our operating margin expanded approximately one point from the prior year to 5.2%.", "Turning to slide 21, I wanted to briefly discuss internet and sundry expense, the $93 million of Embraco settlement expenses, were recorded in this line during the third quarter. In the prior year, we recorded $43 million expense related to the settlement agreement with a Brazilian competition commission.", "Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $7 million during the quarter corresponding to an effective tax benefit of approximately 9%. For the full year, we continue to expect to record an effective tax benefit of approximately 5%. Finally, on an adjusted basis, we reported diluted EPS of $2.22 per share compared with $1.67 per share in the prior year.", "Moving to our free cash flow results on slide 22, through the first nine months; we generated free cash flow use of $1 million compared with a $373 million free cash generation in the prior year. The main variance from the prior year\u2019s record nine month results relates to higher working capital levels from the prior year end. The current year free cash flow results include a tax refund of approximately $105 million.", "The most significant driver of our increased working capital balances relates to inventory. A higher inventory cash usage is due to a multitude of factors including product transition inventory, related to some of our high volume, new product launches, a general rebuild from the low level of inventory at year end and some excess stock at the end of Q3, due primarily to slowing industry demand levels in North America.", "We have specific plans in place to reduce these balances during the fourth quarter, in addition to our typical seasonal drawdown. On a year-to-date basis, our capital spending has increased $39 million, largely as a result of new product launch spending in the North America region. We continue to expect full year capital spending will be between $575 million and $625 million.", "Turning to slide 23, I would like to highlight our progress in debt reduction. On a year-to-date basis, we have repaid $380 million of borrowings. While our net debt levels increased slightly since December 31st, we expect to bring our net debt balance below the prior year end levels based on our full year free cash flow outlook.", "On slide 24 we summarized our net liquidity position. As you can see from this table, our net liquidity position was over $2.7 billion as of September 30th. Based on the amended credit agreement that we entered into last year, our revolving credit facility is scheduled to downsize by $522 million in December. Even with the facility step down, our cash balances and remaining $1.35 billion credit line availability provide us with significant liquidity.", "On slide 25 you can see a summary of our full year outlook. We are now expecting to report GAAP earnings per share in the range of $7.80 and $8.30 per share. On an adjusted basis our outlook is for diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.56 to $10.06 per share. As you might expect given the macroeconomic volatility we have been managing, there are several moving parts to our outlook.", "The major unfavorable driver from our previous outlook is lower full year price mix. We now expect to see lower price mix for the full year given some of the recent trends, we experienced in the third quarter. We expect to offset lower price mix through continued productivity and cost reduction gains, slightly lower material cost and higher BEFIEX monetization.", "Turning to our cash flow outlook, we continue to project free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $650 million. As noted earlier, we are executing several actions to reduce our overall inventory levels in a somewhat volatile demand environment. The level of volatility may impact our success in reducing overall inventory levels and therefore, influence whether we hit the high or low end of our cash guidance.", "At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Let me summarize, overall I feel that we made strong progress this year executing against our key operational priorities. Our successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives have enabled us to significantly expand our margins during 2010, despite some unfavorable trends in the macroeconomic environment and somewhat slow growth in demand in the developed markets in North America and Europe.", "From a global unit demand standpoint, our expectation for moderating unit demand is largely unfolded as we\u2019ve expected, although I\u2019d say North America demand is a bit softer and Europe is a bit better than we previously expected. In some of our other markets and key emerging markets such as Brazil and India, we continue to see very strong growth and are creating significant value for our Company there. We remain bullish on the long-term prospects for these economies and believe that we are very well-positioned to capitalize on the economic growth potential in these markets going forward.", "For the full year our key priorities are unchanged. Our entire organization is very focused and aligned to execute against these priorities as we believe there the keys to successfully navigating through a somewhat volatile global economic environment. In total as we said through our guidance in July and I\u2019ll say in reaffirming it today, we expect to deliver a record year of operating results and value creation to our shareholders this year.", "At this point in time, I will end and I\u2019ll open this up for questions from our callers.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "We will take our first question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "North American margin you had shown good progress for a number of quarters in a row and you\u2019ve explained and given us some color that incremental price promotion, these are the factors contributed to the clientless quarter. Can you give us the sense of your outlook and confidence in the trend as we look in 4Q and as we look into 2011, where and why the margins go from here?", "Jeff Fettig", "Let ask Marc Bitzer to answer that.", "Marc Bitzer", "Eric, obviously we don\u2019t give a regional forecast or guidance for fourth quarter. Let me talk about the price margin impact in the third quarter. First of all, as we expected and we to some extend talked in Q2 already about it, we did see some degradation of industry price mix during the quarter and we felt the impact as well. In particular with the some pretty aggressive competitive moves in two critical product categories already during Q2 and given our leadership positions, in these categories we decided to meet these new competitive price points.", "As a result of that, we saw some immediate market share gains amidst the same category. Obviously, our job is to balance that price mix as we did in the past going forward. What gives us confidence is some of the products which we highlight in the presentation, we just launched towards the end of the third quarter and that should give us momentum. At the same time, we do expect from the promotion environment that\u2019s around us to sustain and we\u2019ll continue to match the cost side very aggressively to mitigate that.", "Jeff Fettig", "Eric, the only thing I would add is, in the third quarter of North America, we saw a fairly sharp change in demand which we expected to a certain degree with higher material cost and we made a conscious decision to make a pricing adjustment in a couple of key product categories.", "Having said that, in terms of our expectations for margins in North America, this was an adjustment, we expect to improve from here and we have the tools to be able to do that.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "I\u2019m interested in your perspective on this, Jeff. You said you\u2019ve made an adjustment, you expect to improve from here and again I\u2019m not trying to pin you down to the fourth quarter margin. What I\u2019m trying to figure out is this margin going to continue to work its way towards 8% or are we seeing a structural change in price points in this business that is going to flatten the rate of improvement or margin recovery in this business back towards what you\u2019ve talked is a median or longer term goal of someday moving back towards whatever 8% or 10%?", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, again, as you said, if we go back to third quarter last year, we\u2019ve made four quarters of progressive improvement. I see this is an adjustment, but not a change in direction, where we want to go.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Secondly, a similar question in Latin America, excluding BEFIEX, the volumes were good, the margins flattened out and the margins in the first half it sound nice year-over-year improvement, sequentially ex- BEFIEX the margins in Latin America eased. Can you give a little bit of color and perspective in terms of where that goes from this point?", "Michael Todman", "Sure, Eric. It\u2019s Mike Todman. Sequentially there were kind of three things that impacted our margins in Latin America in the third quarter. The first is there is a normal seasonality of business that happened kind of from the second quarter when you go on to the third quarter. We didn\u2019t see it last year because of the IPI tax holiday. That had an impact.", "The second is we did experience higher material and oil-related cost in the third quarter of this year than we did in the second quarter. The third reason was that, we ended the second quarter with higher inventories, because if you remember, we saw a slight reduction in demand. We took actions to reduce production in the third quarter and that had an impact overall on the margins. I can tell you that I feel very confident that we will see margin expansion in Latin America in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh Raymond James", "Few couple quick questions here. First off the energy tax credits, that are set to expire at the end of this year, included in your guidance is there an assumption that you will hit the limit as to what you\u2019re able to recognize or is there still some wiggle room on your behalf to maximize those credits in Q4?", "Roy Templin", "Sam, this is Roy. In our guidance we do assume that we would hit the limit by the end of the year and a lot of that Sam is based upon what Marc talked about, which is the success rate with the new product introductions coming out in North America.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "On a related topic then, you mentioned that you want to work the inventories down a little bit sequentially. If you can put a little color on that in terms of where we should quantify inventories by year end?", "Roy Templin", "Let me start and give you a little bit of perspective in terms of the inventory build and I\u2019ll now talk specifically about what we\u2019re going to do and actually Marc may jump in here as well. If you look at year-over-year Sam, we\u2019re up roughly 12 days in inventories. Now, the first thing that sort of first perspective is that we came into this year with inventories much lower than where we normally are in December, if you remember.", "In December 2008 we were at $2.2 billion. If you look at sort of our normal traditional exit rate in December, we\u2019re more like $2.5 billion, and we saw some impacts of that, Marc talked about that. He talked about Latin America in terms of availability because of low inventory levels we had coming out of the year.", "First of all, 62 days a year ago, roughly $200 million Sam or five days of the increase from where it were at the end of the year ago is basically just what we call the normal build to get our inventories back to where we wanted inventories to be, so that takes you to 67 days. We got about a day for seasonality coming out of Asia, Deepavali this year is in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and we got about a day here in North America, with respect to some other build for the fourth quarter.", "There is two days there that we call seasonal build that gets you to 69 Sam. We have about four days of excess inventory that I referenced in my script that we\u2019re going to work to get out by the end of the year and as I said in my script Sam, that\u2019s mostly all in North America and then we\u2019ve got one incremental day which is transitioned inventory in North America as we transition our products. Sam, that one day will still be there at the end of the year from a sequential perspective. The sequential piece is really taking out this excess inventory and the action that Marc Bitzer and his team have already taken in North America.", "Marc Bitzer", "Let me also allude a little bit to this one. North America has right now flattish to high inventory. It\u2019s about what we could consider optimal. That space is two-fold. One is, yes, there is quite a bit of Q4 pre-build around some trade commitments and the other piece is we saw the market slowdown in particular during the second part of the third quarter. Obviously, it takes a little while to take that out of inventory.", "We have taken measures towards the end of September, in particular, on October and November to run down production to what we would consider appropriate levels of inventory, which given the somewhat choppy demand environment, will be slightly high because we got to be able to respond to the changing demand trends. What I would like to point out is also the energy tax credits and the inventory are two independent issues. Actually, if you would just peel back the onion on our energy tax credit units, actually we run lower inventories than the rest of the average, quite a bit lower, in particular in some of the new products, which cause (inaudible) a bit when we run very low inventories. These two things are fairly unrelated to each other.", "Roy Templin", "We do not recognize energy tax credits based upon production under the accounting rules. You actually amortize the total expected annual demand based upon EBT. There\u2019s not a direct to direct relationship between production in the amount of credits that you have recognized.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "You\u2019re guiding for US shipments flat to down 4%. If my math holds in order to get to the year of 3%, which suggests that you\u2019re looking at essentially similar demand patterns on a year-on-year basis in Q4 versus Q3, but the comparison gets much more onerous and so on a two-year stack basis, it would seem as though your expectations with that things improve meaningfully, sequentially, what are you seeing that gives you that confidence to look at it in that respect?", "Marc Bitzer", "I will concur with your first statement. Yes, mathematically, if you take our 3%, that\u2019s where you would end up 0% to minus 4%, minus 5%. I wouldn\u2019t conclude from this moment sequentially to have significantly improved. Actually, we do see and that\u2019s what we expect all from four quarters a somewhat volatile market environment and that\u2019s what we see in the first couple of weeks in October and that\u2019s pretty much what we expect for Q4. Its obviously this is a promotion environment where you\u2019ll have quite a bit of volatility in the demand, but where we are right now focused, it\u2019s 3% for full year while 0% to minus 4% on the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Joshua Pollard with Goldman Sachs.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs", "Can you give us a quick update on the commodity hit that you guys have taken in the third quarter through the first three quarters of the year and what\u2019s your new expectation is for the full year?", "Roy Templin", "This is Roy. Let me start and then Jeff may wish to add a couple of comment. The first part of your question, if you remember in the first quarter, we actually had favorable material costs year-over-year and then in the second quarter, we had little over $50 million impact. What we\u2019ve said and what we\u2019ve said on the second quarter call.", "Josh it still holds true today is, we only incurred about 15% of what we\u2019re projecting for material cost increases in the first half of the year, and we have about 85% or for us roughly a $190 million of impact that will impact us in the second part of the year. For the quarter, the second part we estimated, it was right about $80 million of impact Josh, and that was 1.8 points of hit on our gross margins.", "You heard Mike and Marc and Jeff all commented on that in their scripts, but it all came back to just under 2 points of negative impact on gross margins. We\u2019ve been guiding all year $200 million to $300 million, we\u2019re still in that range, but we would now tell you, Josh, we see it at the low-end of that range.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs", "You see it at the low end, is it right to assume that there\u2019s a slightly higher impact, negative impact in the fourth quarter coming?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, a small. Just if you do the math that Roy gave you, but again it\u2019s pretty much fixed at this point in time and we\u2019ll only get two and a half months or a little over two months left and what\u2019s going to be and that\u2019s pretty much we are there.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs", "My other question it\u2019s just around taxes, as we think about it and we think about 2011 versus 2010, you guys have pretty significant net operating loss carry forwards in the U.S. and also in Europe, so I would expect the tax rate in those regions to be zero. Whatever the total benefit will ultimately be for the energy tax credits in the U.S. that will go away, and then you guys are sort of looking at somewhat standard tax rates on your pre-tax income in Asia and in Latin America. Is that the way to be thinking about your taxes for 2011 versus 2010 or should we be thinking about it some other way?", "Roy Templin", "Josh, you referenced a number of variables there and you talked about the effective tax rate and cash taxes as well, but let me say it as simply as I can. We said we typically don\u2019t get into 2011 guidance at this point in time, but I understand the reason for the question. It\u2019s an important question because we\u2019ve had the energy tax credits, which have basically taken us to a negative rate.", "I said on the last call and it\u2019s still true that you take the energy tax credits out and you\u2019re correct, they are currently set to expire at the end of this year. I don\u2019t know whether there will be any action with respect to future energy tax credits or not, but you\u2019re right, they are set to expire. Once they expire, if you look at 2011 and you take that out of the picture, you go back to that rate that I\u2019ve been referencing for some time, which is that high 20% tax rate for the global business.", "That rate does include the benefits of BEFIEX, I know there have been some questions whether BEFIEX was in or out of that number, so when I step back Josh and I look at sort of the run rate, tax rate for this enterprise looking at our current dispersion of earnings to the second part of your question, I see it in a high 20s to 30%.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Laura Champine with Cowen and Company", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company", "Just a clarification on the inventory line, are units up about the same as dollars or given the rising raw material environment are units not up as much as dollars year-on-year?", "Roy Templin", "Laura, let me answer it this way. If you look at because I referenced to Sam the days, we do have some year-over-year benefit. For Whirlpool, a day of inventory is $42 million this year. That\u2019s probably $4 million higher than it was this time a year ago. There is some benefit from a days perspective there. Beyond that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any significant shift between units and dollars.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company", "On the slide that you had on page 11 that talked about the average selling value focused on a few categories. What are those categories and what drove those categories down?", "Marc Bitzer", "Obviously the reason why we didn\u2019t put up the categories is because we didn\u2019t want to publish it. Let me put it this way, the one on the very right side is one which has been very far, which was front loaded. The near ones are pretty much what we call P6 or P7 categories, but it also shows you yes on washing machines, there is an exposed price competition out there but it\u2019s not across all P6 or P7 categories.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company", "Was Whirlpool a leader in price competition in Q3 and is that what drove you\u2019re units much better than the industry?", "Marc Bitzer", "I wouldn\u2019t say that.", "Jeff Fettig", "There are a couple of product categories. Certain competitors have been extremely aggressive for some time. Now in the third quarter that we\u2019re in a position to launch new product innovation. In both these categories, we decided it was appropriate that we come back to where others were establishing market prices.", "We absolutely have not been driving the leaders in driving that down, but what we found, which we knew that at a comparable value for products with our brands that we would have a positive impact in share and we did. At the same time though on top of that very importantly, we\u2019re establishing new products in the marketplace, which over time will actually raise the mix back up.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Just a few questions for the model, if I could. The BEFIEX run rate going forward, $56 million on the quarter, should we be thinking about that as the quarterly run rate going forward or just help us think through that?", "Roy Templin", "David, look, for the year now - last call, I said we thought it\u2019d be roughly $165 million given the run rate in the third quarter. What we\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter, it will be more like $195 million now for the year. If I remember right, it was about $41 million and $47 million in the first two quarters and then $56 million this quarter and obviously that is $51 million left in the fourth quarter.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "For 2011, I realize you won\u2019t talk a lot about \u201811 at this point but -", "Jeff Fettig", "David, it depends on sales levels and it depends on the mix of products within that, so there\u2019s really not basis that - we really can\u2019t give you guidance\u2026", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "For 2011, again, forgive me for trying to reach forward here a little bit, but pension and OPEB cost, if rates were to remain as they are now, how does that change year-over-year?", "Roy Templin", "David, I don\u2019t really want to go into 2011. First of all, I can\u2019t go into 2011 pension costs because I don\u2019t know the variables yet and so I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that. If you look at sort of all up pension and OPEB cost, this year, because we have the OPEB credit in there, it\u2019s about $80 million. If you look pension 401(k) OPEB, all as a bundle, its $80 million. If you take the OPEB credits out, its $140 million and that\u2019s basically flat-lined with what it was last year.", "Again depend upon where discount rates go, David, particularly in this environment, I just can\u2019t speculate on what that\u2019s going to be next year. Probably the one point I can make to you though with respect to cash and funding of pensions as you know, we have roughly $1.3 billion unfunded status in our defined benefit plans. Of course, they\u2019re frozen now, but we see the minimum funding requirements given current pension rules to be roughly $200 million in 2011 and that\u2019s an important point from a cash perspective. I just can\u2019t speculate yet, David, on the expense side.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "The competitive environment right now, you\u2019ve got Samsung and LG that have been very aggressive in the U.S. market, we\u2019ve been talking a lot on this call about the third quarter. You certainly are formidable target for them. I mean, you are a big player in the North American market, and it\u2019s easy to see why they would focus on you from a targeting standpoint?", "If we talk about Latin America for a moment, you\u2019ve even more formidable presence in that market and our sense is that LG and Samsung are dialing up the gas down there as well. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the changing competitive environment in Latin America and sort of talk if you can about how that plays over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Michael Todman", "Frankly, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing today significant change in terms of the competitive environment and we feel pretty good about our position there. We continue to actually grow our market position. We feel good about the brands and what we are offering in that marketplace and so we\u2019re very competitive and that we\u2019ll continue to expand our margins and our businesses in Latin America.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "In North American market, these two competitors seem to be motivated more by share grabs and by profitability. Is it your sense that the same situation down there?", "Jeff Fettig", "I don\u2019t know that we can David speculate on others intentions. What we do know is as part of our business, we know that we have very competitive cost structure vis-\u00e0-vis anyone in the world. We know our brands and the markets we serve are preferred brands. What others do is up to them, but as long as we can offer good values in the marketplace, bring the latest innovation, continue to manage our cost structure, I feel very confident that we can compete with anybody in the world.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Last question, just North America, the Black Friday channel sales, seems like the independents are going to get in this year whereas they weren\u2019t last year, so it would seem that maybe there is more product going into the channel. I wonder if you could just talk about how the channel sale this year compares from last year?", "Marc Bitzer", "I\u2019d right now say from an overall perspective. We\u2019re in the promotion environment, but I don\u2019t expect that site to play out very different from the previous years. We see the typical channel moves, the typically exposure of different channels at different degree, independent retail tend to be less exposed from Black Friday than other retailers, but they are still somewhat participating. That\u2019s what we would expect for Q4 as well.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan Securities", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "You had mentioned, Roy, that you\u2019re targeting some reduction in inventory about four days worth due to the slightly softer than expected demand in North America, depending on the success of that inventor reduction, is that how we\u2019re to think about whether or not you\u2019re going to hit the - let\u2019s say if you fully get rid of that inventory that you could hit the lower end of EPS? I know you talked about cash flow as well, but from an EPS perspective, is that the main driver in the remaining range from an EPS perspective?", "Roy Templin", "My comments, Michael, were more with regards to the high end or the low end of the cash guidance, but not from an EPS perspective.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "In the guidance, if you do have that inventory reduction and your facilities are running at a lower rate, wouldn\u2019t that impact margins as well?", "Roy Templin", "Yes, if your question is, did we have some overhead in that excess inventory; the answer is certainly we do. We think that\u2019s a few tons of a point at the end of the third quarter, but you are correct. There is definitely overhead sitting on the balance sheet associated with that excess inventory.", "Jeff Fettig", "The expectation of the impact is clearly in the guidance.", "Roy Templin", "Yes, absolutely.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "That\u2019s built in there. Also, looking at Europe tracking at this 3% plus or minus for the full year. Demand is coming a little bit better than expected, but can you talk about obviously at earlier points, you were at 5%, 6% type of range from like, let\u2019s say \u201803, \u201804 to \u201807. How do you feel getting back to that? I mean, is that something that given some of the improvements you can see over a 12-month basis or is it more of a 24- to 36-month basis?", "Michael Todman", "Michael, let me just give you a perspective. As you can see, every quarter we are making progress in terms of expanding our margins in Europe. We\u2019re focused very much, and I talked about this before ensuring that we drive the right cost productivity, so that as volumes begin to come back, we can absolutely see that our margins are going to continue to expand at a pretty strong rate. I\u2019m pretty confident that we will get back to our previous operating margin levels. I\u2019m not going to give you the exact timeframe on that, but I certainly think it\u2019s well within our reach.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Last question if I could, the litigation and the settlement with regards to the DOJ; one, I just want to make sure, is that kind of end of the road in terms of this path in the U.S.? Are we completely kind of through this issue in the U.S. and if you have any update, if there is any action going on from a European Union perspective?", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, Michael, as we\u2019ve disclosed for some time now that we are cooperating with several jurisdictions. We have settled the two we\u2019ve talked about which is in Brazil and U.S. Other jurisdictions, we\u2019re still obviously in discussion with them, cooperating on, but there is really nothing new we can say about that.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "A lot of ground covered, just a couple of other things. We kind of hit on this inventory issue quite a bit, but how does what is currently in your excess stock line up with where the market is? In other words, is the stock in laundry is it at the wrong price point? Is that why it actually backed up or is it kind of just a more generic demand issue?", "Jeff Fettig", "It\u2019s pretty simple actually. The demand in North America was slower than we expected going into the quarter. Big part of the slowdown started by the middle of the quarter. We decided to start making adjustments and in terms of the mix of inventory and anything like that I don\u2019t - again we\u2019re talking about four or five days. That\u2019s not an unmanageable amount for our kind of business.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Roy, you went through that in pretty good detail, but I was just going back and looking at inventory to sales Q4 of the last several years and it\u2019s been about 50% plus or minus which would say $2.4 billion as where you\u2019d want to end the year on a normalized basis, and you are actually $600 million above that right now.", "Roy Templin", "I was actually computing $2.5 billion, but we\u2019re in the same relevant range.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "You only really see a couple of $100 million needing to come. You\u2019re going to be above $2.5 billion, but you wouldn\u2019t view that as abnormal given the seasonality and product transition that you are talking about?", "Roy Templin", "The point I was trying to make. Jeff is that we came into the year with low inventory levels. We\u2019ve talked about that first couple of quarters. We have the intention of building a couple hundred million dollars of inventory from where we ended the year last year. In the third quarter, that\u2019s typically a quarter if you sort of look at as year-in and year-out where we use about $100 million in terms of incremental inventory build.", "This year that incremental inventory build was $300 million and that 200 delta was my point with respect to this access inventory from traditionally where we\u2019re at in the normal inventory builds and seasonality. I\u2019m not trying to imply that we now lifted a new level with respect to what\u2019s normal.", "I\u2019m just trying to isolate how much of this is what we intend to do, how much of this is for a seasonality based build, which are two days and then this excess of four days that we have. As I said Jeff earlier, we do have this one day in transition, but Marc and I would both tell you that\u2019s going to be with us for a while until we get through these product transitions.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", " Just trying to reconcile the comments on negative mix versus branded share being strong, so there is mix erosion within the branded business, but you are shifting more towards branded overall. Is that the correct way to think about it?", "Marc Bitzer", "For North America, yes we have a significant mix goal towards our branded business. We had in the overall mix, which is obviously the combination of brand mix, trade partner mix, product mix. In the third quarter, we had a slightly negative mix, which is different from the first half. With a lot of new product innovations coming in, we expect to stabilize mix going forward.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Finally, Roy could you just true us up on where the BEFIEX balance is at the end of the quarter given all the currency machinations and everything that\u2019s gone on?", "Roy Templin", "The ending BEFIEX balance will be in the 10-Q this afternoon, 590. I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019ll look at that up, Jeff, and if I\u2019m wrong I\u2019ll come back and clarify it on the call. I believe it\u2019s going to be 590.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Robert Kelly with Sidoti and Company", "Robert Kelly - Sidoti and Company", "You talked about the slowdown hitting you in the second part of 3Q and making some adjustments with your inventory. What is your sense of your key customers\u2019 inventory? Did they have to make adjustments as well and how does that play into your expectations of price mix for the coming quarter in North America?", "Marc Bitzer", "There is few reliable data point, which gives you good statistics on customer inventory level, on an overall level. The two hints which we have, is one, if we compare overall sell-in for the industry, the data points which we have on sell-through for the industry, actually sell-through is even softer than sell-in, so you would expect that the inventory is slightly elevated. The opposite appears to be true for our branded business. Actually our sell-through data for the third quarter is better than the sell-in data. On these data, we have also from our trade partners reliable data and their inventory levels I would describe our branded inventory levels with trade partners fairly balanced.", "Robert Kelly - Sidoti and Company", "Your expectation is price/mix stable or slightly better in 4Q in North America?", "Marc Bitzer", "We are working on mix initiative. We have a lot of new products, which will support this one. Be careful, when you compare sequential results year-over-year because you have a promotion period in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn it back over to the floor for any closing comments.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, listen everyone, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your attendance and comments.

Today\u2019s call is bring recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Greg Fritz. Go ahead, Sir.", "Greg Fritz", "Thank you, Ty and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Whirlpool Fourth Quarter and Year-End Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin let me remind you, that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10K and 10Q.", "Turning to slide two, we want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to our core operating results. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for understanding trends in our underlying business.", "Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 28 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable gap measures. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investor section of our website at www.Whirlpoolcorp.com.", "With that let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you saw earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. These results you can see on Slide 4. ", "For the full year, sales came in at $18.4 billion, which were up $1.4 billion versus last year. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $9.65 per share compared to $5.01 in 2009. We generated free cash flow of $502 million during 2010 and overall we are pleased with the progress that we made towards all of our value creation objectives last year.", "Slide 5 summarizes the highlights of the year. We saw a return to growth with our net sales rising about 7.4% versus last year. We improved our operating results for a year, I think a clear indication that our brand value creations strategy continues to drive profitable growth. We delivered significant, in fact record levels of consumer relevant innovations, managed cost and executed well in the marketplace. ", "In total, we improved our financial position. We (inaudible) by strengthening our balance sheet and by reducing debt by just under $400 million. And we returned the shareholders in the form of dividends of $132 million, while maintaining a $1.4 billion cash balance. Overall, we made good progress to reducing our overall leverage as a company in line with our stated objectives.    ", "  ", "On Slide 6, summarize our current outlook for 2011 that geographies across the world. This year we continue to expect positive demand growth around the world. In the U.S., we see our full year shipments to be up approximately 2% to 3%. Marc Bitzer will discuss the North American industry growth rates in more detail in a moment. ", "But last year, industry demand grew the first time in four years and we expect this trend to continue in 2011.", "In Europe, we see industry growth demand improving by 3% to 4% for the full year and we've seen appliance demand has grown for the last four consecutive quarters across the region. We continue to see strong underlying economic fundamentals in Brazil and other Latin America countries. And we're forecasting industry growth in Latin America in the 5% to 10% range. And finally, we can expect to continue to have healthy growth in Asia with expected 6% to 8% growth rate for the year. ", "Turning to Slide 7, you can see the key drivers which we see affecting our business in 2011. First of all, we expect our cost reduction and productivity initiatives to have a significant positive impact on margins in 2011. We once again achieved very strong gains in cost reductions and productivities during 2010 and I expect this to continue this year. ", "In addition, we will have higher unit volumes and very importantly, we're driving very strong consumer product innovation for our global brand portfolio, which will contribute to improve growth rates and operating profits. From a price mix standpoint, we have announced or implemented price increases in most major regions and markets around the world. ", "For the full year, we expect these increases to result in, for the full year, a flat to slightly higher price mix and importantly reverse the unfavorable trends, which we saw during the second half of 2010. We continue to manage currency risk and expect currency impacts to be manageable at today's levels for the year. ", "And finally, we expect raw material inflation to drive higher cost and therefore have an unfavorable impact on operating results. For a full year, we're estimating material costs for the year as an unfavorable impact of $250 to $300 million. We've taken into account all of these factors. Our guidance for 2011 is that we expect to deliver EPS in the range of $12 to $13 per share and free cash flow of $400 to $500 million. ", "I would point out that our free cash flow guidance includes an expected U.S. cash pension contribution of approximately $300 million. Roy Templin will go into more detail on this outlook in a few moments. ", "This year we remain very focused on delivering higher margin innovations, realizing significant cost productivity and achieving profitable growth, which will be driven by some recovery in demand and developed economy, continued strong growth in many of our merchant markets. ", "We also expect to expand our operating margins this year, despite the significant global inflation and we will generate good levels of free cash flow, which will drive further strengthening of our financial position. ", "So at this point of time, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for an update on our North America operations.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America\u2019s performance for the year. ", "As shown on Slide 9, which generated record brand share gains in the fourth quarter and fully. This performance validates the power of our brand and our product innovations. And we continue to provide strong value to our trade customers for our trusted brands. ", "Our ongoing innovation investment resulted in a great year of product launches in North America. And our new products have been very well received by consumers. In addition, we're pleased to see that 2010 marked the first time we saw growth in four years. ", "On Slide 10, you'll see North America\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter. Net sales of $2.6 billion were down 1% from the prior year. And our adjusted operating margin was 1.7% compared to 5.6% in the prior year. The results are unfavorably impacted by one, the negative price mix in a very promotional environment, two, higher material costs and three, lower production volumes, as we started to balance our inventory positions (inaudible) and demand. ", "On the other hand, favorable cost production, unit volume had improvement and lower incentive compensation partially offset the unfavorable items. As a result of an inflationary environment and the unfavorable product mix, we have announced a significant price increase in the U.S. on most of our products and brands. And we're very confident that the actions we have taken in the areas of cost reduction, price mix and new product innovation will put the business back on track to improve our operating margins as we move through 2011.", "On Slide 11, you can see a sample of just a few of our new products that we launched in Q4. These products have been favorably received in marketplaces and contributed to our record level of new innovations in full year. These launches include Kitchen Aid brand dishwasher, featuring a modern version of a reset handle found in models from past decades. ", "The Maytag brand Maxima (inaudible) and our latest fab innovation have been recognized by a leading consumer magazine. In January of this year, we received top ratings for 11 of our latest top and front-loading models. We also plan to add advantage washers. We're rated number one in the front and top loading categories respectively. ", "With the Maytag Maxima, which you see in the picture taken the number two spot in front load. We also launched the Maytag brand ", "Gemini Double Oven freestanding range, featuring two separate ovens and the industry's largest capacity. In 2011, we will continue to introduce consumer relevant products but strike a positive balance between our product price, mix and share. ", "And finally, turning to Slide 12, I would like to turn to our industry outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we had our first year positive demand in shipment turns in four years during 2010. Both full year, we expect U.S. industry shipment of major appliance to increase approximately 2% to 3%. We're seeing signs of stabilization, new housing starts and improvements in the existing home sales.", "When you look at the year however, it is important to note that we have a very difficult comparison in the first half of 2011 as we compare against the cash for appliances program impact of 2010. We are anticipating slightly negative industry growth trends in the first half, which will be more than offset by positive trends during the second half of the year. ", "From a full year perspective, we are optimistic the industry remains on a path to recovery and to still remain well below long-term trend demands.  ", "Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike for a review of our international operations.", "Michael Todman", "Thanks Marc. And let me start a 2010 review of our international business on Slide 14. Overall, our international business performance was strong for the year. During the fourth quarter sales in our international businesses accounted for just under 50% of our total company sales. Our operating results benefited from our ongoing cost reduction and productivity efforts and solid volume growth in our emerging markets. ", "We generated unit volume growth and improved operating margins in Europe. In Latin America, we saw strong growth rates for the full year despite the strong year ago comparisons, enabling us to further extend our leadership position in Brazil.  We generated strong operating margins along with this growth. ", "Our Asia business experienced significant growth throughout the year, while due to material inflation our margin performance was mixed across the region. ", "Turning to slide 15, in the fourth quarter our European sales declined 4% year-over-year to $922 million, with unit shipments increasing 6%. Excluding the effects of currency, sales increased approximately 4% compared to the prior year. The region reported an operating profit of $29 million during the fourth quarter compared to an operating profit of $19 million in the previous year. ", "The profitability improvement was driven by continued cost reductions and productivity improvements, as well as higher unit volumes. The improvement was partially offset by lower price mix and higher material cost. Overall, we made solid progress improving our profitability in Europe and will look to build upon and accelerate this trend in 2011.", "Slide 16 shows a summary of our Latin American fourth quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.4 billion, an 18% increase from the prior year period, as appliance unit shipments increased approximately 15%. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 17%. Adjusted operating profit reached $193 million compared to $142 million in the prior year. The profitability improvement is primarily related to the increase monetization of BEFIEX tax credits, cost reduction and productivity initiatives. These favorable items were offset by higher material cost, lower price mix and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.", "Our fourth quarter results in Asia are shown on Slide 17. Net sales increased 9% during the quarter to $204 million, up from $188 million in the prior year period, as unit shipments increased 4%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 4%. Operating profit reached $4 million for the quarter versus the $6 million generated in the prior year period. Favorable volume growth and productivity was offset by higher material cost. ", "Turning to Slide 18, you'll see just a few of our international product launches during the quarter, including a line of Whirlpool brand, energy efficient, frost free refrigerators in our Latin American region. The refrigerators feature improved aesthetics, more freezer space than previous models and the ability to adjust interior temperatures with exterior controls. The Bauknecht brand, Cosmos in Europe, featuring a brushless motor that consumes up to 50% less energy than comparable Bauknecht goods. And the Whirlpool brand , Charisma 6th Sense dryer, featuring faster drying time and an A class energy rating. ", "In 2010, we had innovative product launches in every major categories around the world. We entered 2011 with a continued commitment to strategically strengthen our position in all markets through our global brand portfolio and a diverse and innovative product offerings that meet the unique needs of consumers around the world.  ", " ", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Roy Templin for his financial review.", "Roy Templin", "", "Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Beginning on slide 20, I would like to summarize our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, our sales grew 3.7% to $5.0 billion. Appliance unit volumes increased 7.6% from the prior year, led by 15% growth in our Latin America region. All other regions reported mid single-digit volume increases during the quarter. We continue to see a significant benefit from our productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the quarter.", "In addition to this, we monetized $81 million of BEFIEX credits compared to $17 million in the prior year. During the prior year, we saw a significant reduction in our BEFIEX monetization due to the IPI tax reduction, legislated by the Brazilian government, which expired on February 1. We also saw a year-over-year improvement from lower incentive compensation expense and recognized a $10 million or $0.08 per diluted share gain from the sale of an asset in the current quarter. These favorable effects were more than offset by lower price mix and higher material cost.", "Turning to the income statement on slide 21, we reported net sales of just over $5 billion. Our gross margin contracted basis points to 13.2%. The most significant unfavorable impacts on our gross margin were lower product price mix and higher material cost. These were partially offset by cost take out and productivity actions and higher BEFIEX credit monetization. ", "SG&A expense totaled $441 million compared with $427 million in the prior year. The increase in SG&A spending was related to higher infrastructure spending on strategic initiatives and increased revenue generation spending. SG&A expenses were 8.8% of sales during the quarter, which was equal to the prior year level. ", "Restructuring expenses totaled $16 million during the quarter and were the result of cost reduction actions in Europe and North America. For 2011, we expect to record restructuring charges between $75 and $100 million. Finally, our reported operating margin declined 10 basis points to 4.0%. On an adjusted basis, our operating margins contracted approximately 60 basis points.", "Turning to slide 22, I wanted to briefly discuss interest expense. The most significant increase in interest relates to a favorable tax settlement in Brazil during 2009. Excluding the prior year tax settlement, interest expense was down slightly year-over-year due largely to lower overall debt levels and a lower average interest rate. Lower interest and sundry expense was a result of a reduction in legal cost and contingencies and the non-recurrence of a $13 million charge in the prior year related to previously capitalized transaction cost. ", "Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an income tax credit of $46 million during the quarter, corresponding to an effective tax benefit of approximately 35%. The fourth quarter credit was an improvement from our previous expectations due to lower pre-tax income, higher BEFIEX credits and a favorable impact of fourth quarter tax law changes here in the U.S. Finally, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.19 per share compared with $1.24 per share in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS was $2.11 per share compared with $1.67 per share in the prior year.", "Moving to our free cash flow results on slide 23, we generated free cash flow of $502 million during the year compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year. The main variance from the prior year\u2019s record results relates to changes in working capital levels from the prior year-end. Overall, our free cash flow was below our expectations. ", "The most significant driver of this variance relates to inventory. While we made some progress in reducing our inventory balance during the fourth quarter, we did not, excuse me, we did continue to have some excess stock at the end of the fourth quarter. For the full year, our capital spending totaled $593 million, which was in line with our previous expectations. ", "Our 2010 capital spending, as a percentage of sales was equal to the prior year at 3.2%. For 2011, we expect our capital spending to be between $600 million and $650 million. ", "Turning to Slide 24, I would like to discuss our 2011 outlook. As you read this morning in our press release, we expect to generate earnings per diluted share between $12 and $13 for the fully. Given the recent tax legislation, the U.S. energy tax credit program was extended through 2011. As a result, we expect to earn approximately $4 per share of these credits during 2011. We have included this amount in our outlook and expect our corresponding effective tax rate will approximate our 2010 rate. ", "As Jeff mentioned previously, we expect unfavorable material and oil related cost of approximately $250 million to $300 million during 2011. We expect to more than offset these costs through our cost reduction and productivity initiatives, favorable unit volume contribution and slightly higher price mix. ", "Turning to our free cash flow, we expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $400 million and $500 million during 2011. We have assumed U.S. pension contributions of approximately $300 million within this estimate.", "Finally, turning to Slide 25, I'll close my remarks by discussing the cash flow priorities for the business. In the near time, we are focused on returning our credit ratings to pre-recession levels. During 2010, we executed well against our priorities and paid down just under $400 million in debt while funding our capital expenditures pension and maintaining our dividend. ", "As we move into 2011, we continue to see these priorities unchanged. We have repaid just under $400 million of debt during 2010, which helped us improve our overall leverage ratio. Over the next 15 months, we have $650 million in debt maturities and we expect to make a cash pension contribution of approximately $300 million this year. ", "While we continue to focus on improving our leverage ratio, we will consider these maturities and contributions as a part of our normal capital structure review. Overall, however our cash flow and credit rating priorities remain unchanged from our previous priorities and we will continue to prioritize our cash flow accordingly.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you, Roy. Turning to Slide 27, only to take a moment to review our outlook relative to our mid term value creation objectives that we shared last fall. We expect our revenues to be in the range of our mid term objectives of 5% to 7% with growth this year. As you can observe from our industry demand assumptions, this is largely driven from our merging market businesses, as our developed market still have not returned to what we would consider a normalized level of demand. ", "Over time, however we do expect the U.S. Housing market, with new construction, resale\u2019s and remodeling to begin to return to more normalized levels. And ultimately, I believe this will accelerate our developed market growth rates in North America. But our 2011 forecast reflects only a modestly improving housing market and still at year record lows from a historical perspective. ", "Turning to profitability, we expect to grow our operating profit and expand our operating margins during 2011 and make good progress towards our goal of delivering at least eight plus percent of operating profit as a percent to sales. We expect to grow our operating earnings at the high end of our 10% to 15% goal during 2011. ", "And finally, turning to our long-term free cash flow target of 4% to 5%, as we've mentioned our outlook of 400 to 500 is below this objective but I would say we also look at the fact that this includes $300 million in U.S. cash pension contributions, which is much higher than it's traditionally been. If you remove that contribution, we do expect to improve our free cash flow performance as a percent to sales to be at the lower end of our 4% to 5% range, with significant improvement over 2010.", "So I'd summarize and say we're vey focused on delivering higher margins, realizing significant cost productivity in achieving profitable growth. We expect positive but uneven demand around the world. Raw material inflation is driving costs higher but we expect to fully mitigate these costs with improvements in cost productivity, the benefits of our very strong innovation and our recently announced price increases.", "Overall, based on these assumptions we expect to have a record year performance in 2011. ", "At this point in time, this ends the formal comments. We'd like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Go ahead, please.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Good morning. Can you give a little bit more color on the price mix situation in the U.S. in 4Q perhaps relative to 3Q and relative to your expectations of 4Q and then how you expect that to behave in 2011? ", "Jeff Fettig ", "Marc, why don't you answer that.", "Marc Bitzer ", "Eric, it's Marc Bitzer. So let me give you a little more color on the price mix in North American Q4, which was in a way we expected. So on a sequential basis, because that was your question, Q3 versus Q4 deteriorated largely driven by a very big element of the promotions around Black Friday holiday period, which extended more than a day, more than a week. It's basically almost the entire quarter. There was a long pre-buy period. And the overly promotional element in our sales in Q4 were higher than expected and brought our price mix lower than expected.", "So in a sequential basis it was worse than what we had accounted for. So very different situation year-over-year and sequential on the price mix. On the questions going forward, we had indicated we have announced some price increases to our trade partners. And in Q1, we also obviously will not have the impact of this Black Friday promotion element in there, which takes some burn off the pricing pressure.  ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "And I'm sure it's something Roy will give us a little more numbers but I guess from a bigger picture perspective, as you move away from this in the first half of '11, how do you think this impacts your units and your market share performance?  ", "Marc Bitzer", "Eric, it's Marc Bitzer again. So first of all, bear in mind Q4, we ended on an all time record market share. So obviously as you enter the period of price increases, you know coming from traditional strength or market share gives you certain confidence on the market share. So that just gives us a lot of momentum as we go into Q1. So overall, in Q1, we don't expect the promotion entity to be as extreme a market base as it was in Q4. So I don't think that will come at the expense of market share. And in Q2, we'll have to see. ", "Roy Templin", "Eric, let me give you a little bit of color to your point with respect to some of the numbers. Price mix impact on margin in the fourth quarter, year-over-year was minus 3.2 points. North America was a little worse than the global amount. But obviously, the international businesses were better, with respect to their price mix impact on margin. From a top line sales perspective, when you look at the sales recs, price mix globally in the sales recs was minus 4.6 points in the sales reconciliation. So those are the global impact and again the relative numbers with respect to what happened in North American International. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "And then just the last question on this issue. Look at whichever those numbers you want to choose. And I appreciate that you ended 4Q on a record market share and better volumes than you expected in 4Q. But I guess, is if you reverse the price mix, I would think it would have a corresponding influence on your market share performance on your unit performance? How do you assume that works in 2011 and especially in the first half of '11?", "Jeff Fettig", "Eric, this is Jeff. Let me maybe give you just one other perspective because this is an important point. This fourth quarter U.S. promotion period of, a lot of people will talk about Black Friday, Black Friday became a week and then it became two months and I think a lot of the decisions that were made about that at every level, mainly manufacturer retailer, et cetera, were largely made six to eight months before when the environment in the U.S. was very different. There was good growth, material cost was at relatively stable levels and a lot of these plans were put in place. ", "And the fact of the matter is, the environment in the fourth quarter, really was very uneconomical. Total revenues sold in this industry were probably below 2008 levels, given demand and declining prices. So, I don't think it's, at least from our view, it's not economically feasible to stay there. As Marc said, we're not promoting after November. So that promotion set driven on our part comes back to us in Mike's price mix in the first quarter. ", "The second part, I guess I would just say too is, we had the most impactful innovation in the market we've every brought in the last four months of last year. That is driving our business very strong right now. We just got top ratings in all of the consumer magazines for washing products. People want to buy them. So we have good, what I would call, consumer driven demand for our brands right now and we want to make money selling them.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Great. Thank you.", "Jeff Fettig", "Yup.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Joshua Pollard with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. ", "Joshua Pollard \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey, the first question is on your guidance. Just want to know very quickly whether or not you're including the $75 to $100 million of restructuring and your $12 to $13 of guidance? And then if you could also talk about, on the margin front, are you expecting, I respect the 4Q over 1Q comparison that you guys are talking to, but as you look at the whole year, are you somehow expecting next years Black Friday to have a different promotional environment, such that you'll have a positive price mix in 2011 versus 2010?", "Roy Templin", "Josh. It's Roy. Let me take the first part and the simple answer to your question is yes, we have included the 75 to 100 in the guidance.", "Jeff Fettig", "And on the second part Josh, we can't project what's going to happen November of 2011. I would just stick to my comment, 2010 was value (inaudible) and I don't think that's sustainable. ", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs", "I guess that another way of asking the question is, could you break out sort of the components that get you all to margin expansion? When you talk about the unfavorable commodity mix, 250 to 300 million, you take the midpoint of that versus 2010 sales, you get a reduction of about a point and a half? And I'm trying to understand from where you guys are ending the third and fourth quarter? What gets you back into positive territory for 2011?", "Roy Templin", "Josh, it's Roy. Let talk. We're not going to give specific line item guidance. Let me talk to you sort of from a high-level perspective and then Jeff, Mike or Marc maybe can append to my comments. But when you think about operations, as we step forward from '10 to '11. The way I think about it is that there are three major pieces to the positive side. One is, as we said in our scripts, a higher volume on a global basis and the impact from that contribution margin from that. ", "The second area we're assuming is, is flat to slightly positive price mix. So we've got some benefit in there for that. And then the importunities, which gives direct reference to your comments on material costs, is that we have assumed in our guidance, given our plans that we will have more cost take out than we will have in material cost increases. ", "Now Josh again, a couple of things to keep in mind. Jeff's talked for a number of calls about all the components that go into that cost take out so think about all those items, plus 2011 is the year when we will be to our total run rate from the cost savings that we will benefit from all the restructuring we have done in the recent past. So this year, we're assuming $270 million of benefit from the restructuring we've done. So all those components together, get you the operating side. And then again, in fairness of full disclosure, the other key item, as I said in my script, is energy tax credit this year, we're in the low 200's to 225 roughly. But we have assumed $300 million in the guidance for next year. So there's a benefit from that.", "Jeff Fettig", "Josh, the other perspective I would give you is that our number one priority and focus is margin expansion. So that's how we're prioritizing our investments, our decision-making. Our expectations in all regions around the world are expected to improve. As you look at the growth rate we've indicated, clearly Latin America is growing the fastest. And it has already double-digit operating rates so that's a natural mix improvement in our total margin. ", "And of the price increases, we either implemented or announced the highest, that we publicly announced are in North America, which we're fully committed to achieving. So that along with, again what I would call another very strong year of cost productivity and those two combined, we feel confident will offset the material cost inflation and provide for margin expansion.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, so let me just ask one quick follow-up. You guys gave the cadence of the growth you expect first half versus second half in North America considering the comps. Would you guys care to give the cadence of your 2011 price mix by half, considering that you're looking for it to be up? And it seems like your first half comps, considering what you're seeing sequentially in the second half of the year, are going to be difficult? I guess the other quick one is, on the BEFIEX, could you just give a balance, an outlook? Thank you, guys.  ", "Jeff Fettig", "Josh, first of all on the growth. We did talk about the North America. We are going over large year-over-year comps in Q1, and so our expectation is that will be the lowest comps, perhaps even negative for the first quarter or first part of the year, as Marc said. But you also have to look at the other parts. We see Latin America rate continuing. The rate they've been on. We see Asia continuing on the rate they've been on. We see Europe continuing on the rate they've been on. So we don't see the same comp issue for and by the way, a very important point, our international businesses are now roughly equal to our North America business. So we do have that geographical balance. ", "Secondly, the pricing is really hard to give that. I mean some, what we've talked about is either already executed or announced in or for execution so we don't talk about any future pricing beyond that. So it really is market specific. I think the biggest one, is the one Marc talked about, where we had an appropriate increase has been announced for April 1 which we're committed to executing. We've had some markets start in November, December and some of the emerging markets. I mean its a little bit of everything but your basic premise is that margin improvement from pricing will grow throughout the year is true. ", "Roy Templin", "Josh, it's Roy. Two things. One, again in terms of sort of calibrating, again the price mix impact, I talked about three positives. The volume in you price mix and the cost take out but please appreciate price mix is by the far the lowest of those three. I want to be clear on that. Second thing, in response to the second part of your question. We have assumed $200 million of BEFIEX credit in this guidance.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Yes, good morning everyone.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning, David.", "Roy Templin", "Good morning, David.", "Marc Bitzer", "Good morning, David.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "You talk about flat to barely positive price mix for the coming year. You've talked about these substantial innovations during the market. You've got a price increase coming through. Help me reconcile why it's only slightly positive price mix? ", "Jeff Fettig", "", "Yes David. Very, very quick. It's, (inaudible) negative. So first you have to make up the negative run rate and so if you think of Roy's number. You talked about 3.2. I meant that's coming into the year. If we did nothing that would be for certainly three quarters, that would be our run rate, which we're going to reverse as fast as possible. So we're, as we eliminate the negatives and then start adding to it, that's how we get to modestly positive. ", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay. Are you at all concerned about the fact that the Korean manufacturers haven't gone along with this price increase?", " ", "Jeff Fettig", "I don't. I guess you'd have to ask them. I don't know what they've done.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "I'm just asking if you're concerned about your ability to collect a price increase in light of the fact that they're not going along?", "Jeff Fettig", "I feel good about our ability to execute this because I know that in multiple product categories, we have tremendous consumer demand for our new innovations. ", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay. Roy, is there any way you can help us understand the extent to which the hedging programs may have helped offset (inaudible) cost inflation in your guidance mixture?", "Roy Templin", "Well again, David let me answer it broadly and then Jeff, if you want to append to my comment. If you look at, again, we've got in our guidance, 250 to 300 with respect to the impact from material cost increase. I know you've all asked on a number of occasions how much of that might be protected with respect to either hedges or collars or cash or contracts, et cetera. Roughly speaking David, there's about 40% of our total buy that is exposed to variation and roughly 60% of the total buy in some way, shape or form is protected by one of those elements that I mentioned. ", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "I guess that's helpful. Thank you and then with respect to cost reductions. You're getting raw material cost inflation so where are you getting the decreases? Is it headcount reduction? Is it the unit of production DNA? ", "", "Roy Templin ", "Yes, David. It's really all across the business but really some of what I've described in the past. But first and foremost, it comes through, smart, more efficient product design. So we're more efficient in use of material in our new products. Everyone of our new brands that we bring into the market generally has less material contact than the one we had prior. ", "We talked in the past and we continue to mine global component organization. We continue to make great advances in our factories in terms of great manufacturing and savings and less labor hours per unit. We see big, our quality, we've had tremendous improvements on our already industry leading quality rates. And that ultimately leads to cost reductions in the costs of quality. ", "Logistics cost, even though the oil and fuel related to it is going up, you know as we look now or are starting to grow some volumes on our infrastructure there, we get leverage off of that. And candidly we had a global cost leadership system embedded globally and every piece of the business contributes to this on an ongoing basis. So it's hard work. It's what we do everyday but I don't, we've been on this just for the third straight year and we fully expect to deliver.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Last question. Thanks for that answer. Last question, just January off to a pretty weak start here. I guess the first three weeks were off about 20% year-over-year industry wide. Will we see more production curtailments from you in the first quarter?", "Roy Templin", "Well we don't. I just said, outside of the U.S., we haven\u2019t seen any thing happen normal in our run rates that we saw before and Marc, you can mention whatever you want to say.", "Marc Bitzer", "David it's Marc Bitzer. What we saw in Q4 is that their trade inventory position at the end of the year was elevated. Basically, as you know we were, the industry data that we referred to as selling a shipment data to a trade partner was sell through to a consumer front for entire Q4 or below that selling number. So we know the trade partners, may trade personnel were at an elevated inventory position at the end of December and we see a correction of that in January. Some of these trade partners have (inaudible) January or February. That is not completely surprising as we saw an elevated position building in December. Our sense to sell through is not as bad as will be suggested from the numbers you used.", "Roy Templin ", "David, conversely the consumer sell through was not as good as people speculated in Q4. Actually we think better than people speculated in Q1. ", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "So there won't be any production curtailments in North America in the first quarter?  ", "Marc Bitzer", "David, it\u2019s Marc again. I mean, to Roy's earlier point of the inventory position. We started balancing our inventory levels, we actually saw demand coming down and that process is not yet completed. So it's more our long-term optimization balancing of the inventory position which we expect to continue in Q1.", "Roy Templin", "And we will, yes we do have and will have scheduled down days David. ", "Marc Bitzer", "And that's all included in our guidance.", "Roy Templin", "It is included. That's correct.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay. Thanks very much, everyone.", "Roy Templin", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Go ahead, please.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Good morning, gentlemen. I'm proud to say that I think I helped your quarter a little bit. I bought a Kitchen Aid fridge this quarter and we're very happy with it. ", "Jeff Fettig", "", "Thank you.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "So a couple of housekeeping questions as many of my questions have been asked today and answered. First off, with respect to David's last question regarding production plans. For 2011, I guess if my math holds, you're anticipating global unit shipments growth of about 4%. Are you anticipating for the year production in excess of that, similar to that, below that? How should we look at your production plans versus your shipment plans? ", "Jeff Fettig", "David, first of the global number is about correct and as Roy mentioned, we had in days, two or three days. Probably more than where we were optimally like to be at the end of the year. Of course the year before, when demand picked up very quickly, we had less inventory than we wanted to have. So there's always the balancing that's going on and the situations are somewhat different all over the world. ", "We have some parts of the world where we're doing everything possible to keep up production with demand. And then we've had a market like the U.S., where demand grew 10% in the first half of the year and was flat in the second half of the year. So, that volatility does create some two or three months worth of changes in what I would call both production levels and inventory levels. And so for the full year, I mean sitting here today, yes we want to finish next year at the right inventory levels that we think we should be at with the right availability levels to our trade customers. So I'm not frankly worried about having two or three days more or less inventory.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "And that's where you would take the excess data, at two or three days?", "Roy Templin", "Sam. We would, I would tell you we have three excess days and to help you sort of calibrate that, for a corporation you've got low 40s of the value of a day and that will help you sort of calibrate in your mind. ", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Thank you. Second question. The cash tax benefits of the U.S. energy tax credits versus the stated P&L, are they similar of how should we look at that from a cash flow standpoint? ", "Roy Templin", "Again, a couple of things Sam. If you look in a cash flow statement, and it's sort of, it's a tough line to review but there's a line there that I think it says deferred taxes and other. Embedded in that line though Sam, is a bad guy for the overall tax credit on the P&L. So if you had clear visibility to see what did we book in the way of tax provision, what did we pay in the way of cash taxes, you would find that we reverse out the income statement effect from the energy tax credits because as I've said on prior calls, those are non-cash in the current period. So we book the tax asset for those. Those will be used to offset otherwise payable taxes in future periods. But they are not a cash credit in the current year. ", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "What I'm getting at, is for 2011 though, for tax expectations. For the $4, how much of that gets monetized in cash and how much of that gets pushed out to 2012 and beyond?", " ", "Roy Templin", "It would all be in '12 and beyond. There will be no cash benefits from those. They're non-cash tax credits in 2012 or 2011, excuse me.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "So it will all or 2012? So the end cash flow guidance?", "Roy Templin", "2012 and beyond, Sam. I want to be very clear. 2012 and beyond.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "So the $4 on the P&L does not show up in the cash flow statement until 2012? ", "Roy Templin", "", "And beyond.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Okay and last question, just a clarification. How much at the end of Q4 was remaining under the BEFIEX program? Did we find the cause? ", "Roy Templin", "540. We'll file our 10-K in February 16 but it'll be 540 million in the 10-K Sam.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Thank you much.", "Roy Templin", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Go ahead please.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks. Good morning everyone. First question, I was hoping if you could just review, you talked about gaining branded share but I was wondering if you could just review maybe branded but also overall share for 2010 and 4Q, let's say in 2010 overall in North America? Was your overall share up or down? And maybe break it out between OEM and brand?", "Roy Templin", "Mike. Just to be clear, we don't give on a routine basis the overall share number. We can give you directions and give you some indications of our branded share but before Marc answers that, we do not regularly give out the exact market share numbers. But with that Marc, why don't you answer that.", "Marc Bitzer", "Mike, it's Marc Bitzer. Again, I'm referring to U.S. branded and overall market share. Our overall market share was steady year-over-year and was a composition of continued down OEM share and significant elevated branded share. The branded share, particularly driven by Kitchen Aid, whirlpool and Maytag. All these three brands were on a very, very healthy shape overall. But one reference point I can give you. In our financial analyst presentation we basically showed the reported market share. Our Q4 share will be above that run rate, what we showed in the financial analysis by roughly one to two points.", "Roy Templin", "Our branded market share is at an all time high, post the Maytag acquisition. ", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. I appreciate that. Second question on raw materials. If you could just kind of give us what the overall 2010 number was and looking into 2011 the 250 to 300, if there's anyway to kind of give us a sense of maybe how much of that do you expect to be led by steel versus other, either plastics or oil related, just to give a sense of the breakdown there?", "Roy Templin", "Sure Michael. The total, first of all, the first part of your question. This is Roy. 217 million was a total impact for 2010 and as you know, that's roughly 85% of that in the back half of the year versus the front half. I'll let Jeff talk about the composition.", "Jeff Fettig", "Mike, in terms composition of our business. There's three big ones, which account for more than 80% of the total material cost. Steel, resins, which we use in plastics and base metals such as copper, which is at an all time. All three of those buckets are going up. Steel is the largest simply because it's the largest purchase but proportionately all three are going up. And that's where the increases are coming from.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "And for steel, in your assumptions for the overall headwind, are you using current steel prices or over the last couple of months, because obviously over the last two, three months, steel has had a pretty nice move? Just trying to get a sense if you're using let's say January?", "Roy Templin", "Michael, as you know steel is basically a regional market. As we've said in the past, in North America and Europe you should expect that we have contracted our rates in some form, either an exact price or within a range or whatever. As we traditionally have done in Latin America and Asia, it's a weekly, monthly buy. It goes up and down. So I would say our forecast is based on our absolute best view today.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. If I could just squeeze one last one. You mentioned that you have in North America, I believe you said your price increases are scheduled for April 1. But that at the same time the first quarter you don't expect the negative hit from the Black Friday promotions that extended throughout 4Q. Is there any way to give us a sense of what that particular negative headwind was in 4Q just to get a sense of looking into 1Q? What that would look like without that hit or just talk about that hit more specifically? ", "Marc Bitzer", "Mike, it's Marc Bitzer. We can't get into too much forward-looking speculation about what may or may not happen on Friday. In principle you are right, we're taking two components of us lifting price mix in North America. One is just a simple discontinuation  of a promotion in Q4. That is not a question that, it's just a question of us deciding or participating or not participating. And we made already that decision and that is in effect. That will help our Q1 run rate from a price mix. ", "Don't confuse that with the year-over-year comparison but in our run rate of sequential, yes we do expect improvement coming out of this one. And you should assume by the big (inaudible) of all of Q4 versus Q3 deterioration was driven by the promotion intensity. The second part has been the price increase. And yes that is in effect in April 1 and we do expect, determine behind the price increase.) ", "Roy Templin", "Michael, I'll also add. There's a number of moving parts. That's one. The year ago, consumer demand was really picking up and we had less inventory than we needed so we ramped up production as fast as we can. This year, as Marc said, consumer sellout was not as robust as people thought in Q4 so there's a little too much inventory. So we're sort of ramping that down. And then lastly, the timing of material cost and our own productivity. Those are kind of the factors we look at, at any period of time.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Did the high raw material hit, you said the 217 was back half waited. Was 4Q worse than 3Q as well so that maybe also contributed to the market deterioration?!", "Roy Templin", "For sure. 4Q was, half of our annual increase was in the fourth quarter. 4Q was $100 million, Michael. I apologize but we probably need to move because we've got several folks in the queue but.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "Appreciate it. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Laura Champine with Cowen and Company. Go ahead please.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company", "Good morning guys. I wanted to ask about product productivity. I think you've been about a 3% rate of productivity improvement. What's your run rate now and what are the components within that?", "Jeff Fettig", "Laura, this is Jeff. You ought to expect a similar level. Two years ago we radically ramped up the net productivity meaning after inflation, and all this kind of stuff. You and I expect that similar productivity this year, number one. Although the timing may vary a little year in and year out, the rate and the plans we've deployed last year for this year are fully underway. Again, a little bit to a similar, the largest portion will come from the productivity around our use of material. Because materials such a large cost. Again that comes from product redesign, that comes from components in our, it comes from continuing to revise our products.", "But the big kick always comes from our new product designs which we have a lot of that right now. So we're fully benefiting and will continue to benefit from that. The second area again, is our efficiencies, manufacturing, the factories. We use the logistics. We use it in warehousing. We use it just in every part of the business. We've done a good job of leveraging all of our fixed costs whether it be warehouses or SG&A or order volumes. So when we drive volume growth we're generally getting margins and productivity leverage from that. So I would say the tools are largely. The proportions somewhat change but the material productivity will be the number one every time.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company", "And then on the investments that you made in energy efficiency, I mean the pay off in tax credits but also as being able to take advantage of some stimulus. Do you think there's any more demand stimulus coming this year and part B of that question is there a way to measure the returns that you're seeing on those investments in those product lines?  ", "Jeff Fettig", "Well Laura, we do on a project-by-project basis for all of our capital projects so whether they're energy or innovation or anything else, we do measure those. I can't give you a broad answer on energy. I would say that first of all, we do invest a lot to have the leading energy efficiency products in the marketplace. We have a wide margin, more energy store models than anyone else. So it does take investment and most of the time it's added product cost. So you've got to recoup that in the marketplace. The way we see it we have to recoup the product cost in the marketplace. The energy tax credit is helping us justify the investment.", "Marc Bitzer", "Laura, it's Marc Bitzer. In addition to, I think one important point is also, the stimulus program obviously helped drive up higher share and eased our product into the marketplace. After we expired these programs the actions had been on an elevated level.  2010 compared to 2009 that share of products about 10 points higher than before. ", "Jeff Fettig", "That's a good point and with rising utility costs in most parts of the country, I think the consumer awareness of this that was brought through the stimulus period was very beneficial. And that's why we're seeing what we think is probably a permanent price change.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Todd Duvick with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Todd Duvick - Bank of America", "Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate your comments about the free cash flow priorities for 2011 and I just wanted to dove down a little bit further on that. In terms of getting your credit rating back to mid triple B.", "Obviously, we all know that's not out of your or in your control, so with respect to the specific priorities, paying down the debt, I'm wanting to know if you can tell us the $650 million that you talked about maturing over the next 18 months, are you saying then that's a priority for you to pay down the debt or that you're just considering the options in terms of refinancing or paying down the debt?", "Roy Templin", "Todd, this is Roy. Let me answer your question. A couple of things. First of all, this is probably the fifth or sixth quarter in a row where I've talked about the importance about taking our credit ratings back to pre-recession levels. And if you hear Jeff or I, either one of us talk about this. It's all in the vein of financial flexibility and for us, financial flexibility comes from two fronts. ", "One is a solid investment grade credit rating and the second area, which you see and have seen for some time, is we will carry more cash on our balance sheet than we've historically carried. My comments and my script were more in the vein of, as we look at our capital structure. Again, we'll keep this flexibility in mind from both fronts. But we will in fact consider that we've got the 650 in term debt payments and the pension contribution. ", "As you know Todd, we're always looking at the lowering of our term debt over periods of time. It's something that Jeff and I do regularly. It's something we share with the finance committee of the board regularly in terms of our financial strategy. But it's all about maintaining the financial flexibility of the enterprise, which comes from both of those fronts. ", "Jeff Fettig", "And Todd, the other thing I would add to that is in the slide that Roy showed. In the first items, fund the business, pay down the debt and pay down or contribute to pension. Those are within our plan, within out guidance. So we will do those things. The fourth , which is very important, return to shareholders either dividend, share repurchase or looking at, what I would call ,strategic acquisitions have not been our priority.", "As we make progress on those other things, as we see more stability, as we go through the years, those could be becoming more important. We review those on an ongoing basis both as a management team and with our board and we'll continue to do so.", "Todd Duvick - Bank of America", "Okay. All right. That's very helpful. Thank you for your comments.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you Todd. Well listen everyone. Thank you for joining us today.

MacGregor", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Larry Venturelli, Senior Vice President, Financial Whirlpool Corporation. Please go ahead.", "Larry Venturelli", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Second Quarter Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q.", "Turning to Slide 2, we'd like to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or unrelated to our core operating results. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business.", "Listeners are directed to the Appendix Section of our presentation beginning on Slide 29 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at www.whirlpoolcorp.com.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on the call. As you saw earlier this morning, we released our second quarter financial results. And you could see these results summarized on Slide 4. For the quarter, sales reached $4.7 billion, which was a 4% increase from the prior year. On an operating basis, excluding non-operating charges for recent legal developments, our EPS was $2.76 a share versus $2.82 a year ago.", "And while earnings are down slightly from last year, our second quarter performance demonstrates that we have the ability to quickly adapt our business to build up our revenue growth and operating earnings due to our strong global leadership position even in what I would describe as a very challenging environment.", "In our release today, we are reconfirming our annual operating EPS guidance of $12.00 to $13.00 a share and free cash flow guidance in the range of $400 million to $500 million. Given the current operating environment, which we'll describe as we see it in great detail in a few moments, we now see EPS at the low end of the range. As a result of our non-operating charges reported, our GAAP EPS guidance is now $7.25 to $8.25 a share and free cash flow is now $160 million to $260 million.", "While our second quarter results were impacted by non-operating charges, we are pleased to have substantially reduced our legal uncertainties and financial liabilities going forward. The Brazilian collection matter is now completely behind us, and we took an accrual for the ongoing European Union investigation for the Compressor business. ", "Now I'd like to provide you some perspective on 3 things: The global economic environment and how we see it impacting our business and the industry, the actions we are aggressively taking to adjust to this changing environment, and how we expect these factors to play out in the second half of the year versus what we've already seen on the first half of the year.", "Now turning to Slide 5, you can see we've revised our full year 2011 demand assumptions to reflect what happened in the first half of the year and how we see the second half. Overall, we expect global demand in the second half of 2011 to be up approximately 1% to 2%, roughly equal to what we saw on the first half, which we believe in today's realistic assumption in light of the current environment.", "North American demand in the first half of the year has been weaker than expected. The first half demand was down 5%, which was composed of flat in the first quarter and down nearly 10% in the second quarter. In fact, the second quarter industry demand levels were back to the same levels we saw at our 2009 recession lows. Also in this slide, you can see that our full year demand forecast is now forecasted to be down 1% to 2%, which means we expect the second half to be flat to approximately 2% increase.", "The first half demand in Europe was up 2%, which was comprised of Western Europe being down 3%, with good growth in the Eastern markets. We expect the second half to be flat to slightly up, and therefore, the full year forecast up 1% to 2%.", "Overall, we really don't see a lot of change in our Latin America full year demand forecast of 5% to 10%, although we do expect to see growth slowing somewhat from what was a very strong second quarter of this year. Asia demand has modestly changed, and we've revised the 4% to 6% for the full year. Our business is having very good growth in China, but we have seen the slowing of growth in India. ", "Overall, as we step back and look at consumer demand around the world, we believe that high unemployment, low consumer confidence and recessionary housing levels are the driving factors in demand patterns that we see in North America and Europe, while high inflation is beginning to impact some growth in the emerging markets.", "As I said though, we do expect to see demand growth globally in the second half of the year, but we have lowered our previous estimates and this has all been factored in to our new financial forecast.", "I'd now like to turn to Slide 6 where you can see a comparison of the key drivers of our results, both what we saw in the first half and what we are anticipating in the second half. I've already spoken about demand, so I'll move on to costs.", "Raw material and oil-related costs are at record levels, and we've now seen them for the full year in the range of $450 million to $500 million. As a reminder, that's almost 2x greater than our original estimate that we made in early February.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "That we have in place. So we really don't see these costs changing very much in either direction through the end of the year. As we've seen this high inflation in our costs, we have been taking very aggressive actions throughout the first half continuing into the second quarter of the year to help offset the impact, particularly in the area of productivity. There's really 4 key drivers of our strong productivity that we've had so far and expect to continue to have for the balance of the year. ", "First is material efficiency. This is really driven by our new innovative product designs, which come in with lower material content, our continued global parts standardization and our continued optimizing our value feature content across our product lines.", "The secondary is quality, which we're very pleased about. Our quality levels continue to improve. In fact, they're at their best levels ever, which is resulting in lower service and warranty costs. ", "The third area of focus is continuing to optimize the supply chain, thereby reducing freight warehousing costs, which is helping us to offset much higher fuel costs. ", "And finally, we continue to make very good progress in reducing our global infrastructure costs. So overall, we will achieve a very strong level of productivity this year, and we're confident in our ability to deliver these savings to help mitigate the impact of this high inflation. ", "The next lever or driver I would turn to is price. We do expect the negative year-over-year price mix impact that we've seen, which was about 2 points negative in the first half of the year to turn positive, and we'll add at least 2 points to our margins in the second half of the year. This is supported by the strong consumer demand that we've seen for our new product innovation.", "These have already been announced or implemented price increases and the ones that have not been implemented to date will be between now and October. And they cover virtually every market around the world. ", "Finally, 2 other topics I would touch on, first is energy tax credits, which are based on consumer demand for our U.S.-produced, highly energy-efficient products. They are expected to remain strong as we've seen all year and they'll be even stronger in the second half of the year. We continue to expect that $300 million to $350 million of energy tax credits this year.", "The secondary is BEFIEX credits in Brazil, which is, as you know, are driven by appliance sales and mix in Brazil. We expect those to be close to first half levels, And overall, expect to generate between $250 million and $300 million for the year.", "So with this as the backdrop, I would just summarize all this by saying that we continue to have a challenging and volatile global economic environment, which has been more challenging than we previously expected in the first half of the year. ", "We have and we'll continue to take very aggressive cost, productivity and price mix actions to quickly adjust to these conditions. And as I said before, based on these set of assumptions, today we see our results towards the lower end of our EPS forecast with demand, and therefore, volume as the factor that we see right now that's the most bearable in the second half of the year. We're very confident in our costs, our productivity and our price mix assumptions that we see in the second half. And as we have before we will continue to take strong actions to drive margin improvement and earnings improvements throughout the second half. So at this point in time, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his update on our North American business.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving you my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. ", "As shown on Slide 9, we continue to achieve solid productivity and direct cost reduction gains across the region, which only partially offset low volumes and higher material costs. ", "As Jeff mentioned, our April price increases have been fully implemented, and we have announced an additional cost base price increase for August due to further material cost increases. And as a result, our price mix while still negative on a year-over-year basis, improved substantially quarter-over-quarter.", "Regarding industry unit shipments, we'd expected to see negative U.S. industry unit shipment trends during the second quarter, given by the 2010 cash provided program and housing credits. However, the decline was clearly steeper than expected.", "On Slide 10 you will see U.S. T7 industry for the first half of the year, compared to prior periods back to 2005. You will note that the first half 2011 industry volumes has dipped to 2009 recessionary levels, has continued high unemployment and low consumer confidence continues to depress the U.S. housing market and discretionary purchases.", "In fact, given the current U.S. economic environment, the percentage of our business representing replacement purchases is at an all-time high. Based on these recent trends, we expect to see only modest growth in the second half and now expect industry shipments to be down 1% to 2% for the year compared to our previous forecast of up 2% to 3%.", "On Slide 11, you will see the North America's financial performance in the second quarter. Regarding our overall unit volume, we saw our North American unit shipments down 5% in the second quarter, despite the U.S. industry, down within 10%. Net sales of $2.4 billion were down from $2.5 billion in the prior year due to weak industry demand. Our adjusted operating margin was 3.2% compared with 6.6% in prior year. The results are favorably impacted by cost reduction and productivity initiative and the factors offsetting our productivity were a combination of significantly higher material costs, lower year-over-year product mix, and however, as I previously mentioned, we did see solid sequential price mix improvements due to a positive impact of cost base price increases.", "We are positioned to benefit from previously announced price increases during the balance of the year. And we also expect the overall promotion environment in the second half of the year to be lower than last year's levels, especially in the market where almost 61% of all consumer purchases are direct purchases.", "And we will also continue to leverage our strong product innovation for growth over long-term. Based on all these factors, we fully expect to have sequential margin improvement and significantly higher asset margins.", "On Slide 12, you can see just a few of our new products that we launched in the second quarter. Before I highlight these new launches, would like to briefly discuss some recent product leadership recognition. Whirlpool Corporation's 100 year of legacy of innovations has lead to several top ratings in the leading consumer magazines in the refrigeration, cooking and dishwashing category for all our brands. The company scored #1 rating from the French door bottom mount, conventional bottom freezer, built-in refrigerator, 30-inch and 36-inch dual fuel range categories. That is in addition to all our non-operatings[ph], which we're communicating through our last earnings call. ", "Now turning back to some of our recent new product launches, which includes a Maytag brand EcoConserve top-mount refrigerator, which featured improved ENERGY STAR qualifications and precise temperature control. Jenn-Air brand induction cooktop that feature the most powerful cooking element available for the home kitchen and also shown here is our Maytag brand Maxima 9000 front-load high-efficiency washing machine featuring the industry's first PowerSpray feature that evenly slides detergent solution.", "Before I close, I want to say that we are confident in the actions we're taking to address the weaker-than-expected economic environment. Our strong focus on innovation, cost reduction, productivity, marketplace execution and price mix will provide us with earnings momentum throughout the second half of 2011 and into 2012.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for further review of our International operations.", "Michael Todman", "Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a second quarter 2011 review of our International business on Slide 14. ", "Overall, compared to last year, our International business' balance of sale grew from 45% to 50%. Sales of $2.4 billion grew 17%, growing 7% excluding currency.", "In Europe, developed market economies continue to remain weak and the region continues to face high material cost inflation. To address these costs, we have announced 5% to 7% price increases in most countries across the region, which will take effect between August and October.", "In Latin America, unit volumes were up 21%. We saw solid demand growth both in Brazil and also within the remaining countries that make up our Latin American region. Demand in Brazil during the second quarter was significantly higher as the industry comped against a weak quarter last year, due in part to last year's World Cup, as retailers shifted their focus to brown goods from white goods.", "Material costs are also significantly impacting this region of the world, and during the second quarter, we announced and are implementing cost based price increases to mitigate the impact. ", "And in Asia, we saw a slowing demand with unit volumes 4% below 2010 levels. Inflation and a weak summer season in India due to adverse weather conditions were partially offset by strong unit growth in China, despite a softer industry in China.", "Now let me walk through each region individually to provide more detail.", "Turning to Slide 15, in the second quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales improved 14% year-over-year to $841 million with unit shipments increasing 2%. Excluding favorable impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 2%.", "The region's operating profit of $20 million was flat with the previous year. Results were unfavorably impacted by lower product price and mix and higher material costs, partially offset by cost reduction and productivity initiatives and higher unit volumes. We expect that the impact of previously announced price increases and continued cost reduction initiatives will improve margins within the region towards the latter part of the year. ", "Slide 16 shows a summary of our Latin American second quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, a 25% increase from the prior year period, with appliance unit shipments up 21%. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased approximately 16%.", "Operating profit totaled $166 million compared to $165 million in the prior year. Cost reduction and productivity initiatives and increased monetization of tax credits favorably impacted results.", "These factors were partially offset by higher material costs and unfavorable price mix. We expect announced price increases and our ongoing cost and productivity initiatives to result in margin expansion throughout the second half of the year.", "Our second quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 17. Net sales decreased 2% during the quarter to $257 million down from $263 million in the prior year period, as unit shipments decreased 4%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 5%. Operating profit of $14 million is essentially unchanged from the prior year period. Favorable product price mix was offset by inflation, including higher material costs. Continued productivity efforts, along with the introduction of new price innovations, will result in margin expansion in the second half of the year. Now I'd like to turn it over to Roy Templin for his financial review.", "Roy Templin", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 19, I would like to summarize our second quarter results. First, before focusing on our operating results, I'd like to comment on the quarters 2 non-operating charges. ", "As we discussed earlier on the call, our results include $4.86 per share of expense to settle a Brazilian collection dispute and provide for recent developments in the ongoing Embraco antitrust matters. As previously disclosed, we reached an agreement on June 22 to settle all claims arising from a long-standing dispute in Brazil. The settlement enabled us to remove significant uncertainty and financial risk by bringing financial closures to the matter. The settlement amount is within the range between the previous disclosed accrual and the previous disclosed maximum exposure. During the second quarter, we reported an additional pretax charge of $439 million with an interest and sundry expense to adjust our accrual to the full amount of the settlement.", "Based on recent developments, we made an $83 million accrual this quarter for the ongoing EU investigation of Embraco and other matters related to the global antitrust investigation. The accrual is reflected within interest and sundry expense. As previously announced, the Brazilian and U.S. antitrust investigations of Embraco have been settled. Taking these matters into account, we remain in a strong financial position and continue to maintain our liquidity priorities.", "Now I'd like to comment on our base operating results for the quarter on Slide 20. Our sales grew 4% to $4.7 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were down slightly on unit volumes, which increased 1.4% from the prior year led by Latin America. ", "We continue to benefit from higher productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the quarter. Based on volume and product mix, we also monetized $79 million of BEFIEX credits compared to $47 million in prior year.", "These favorable results were effectively offset by lower price mix and higher material and oil-related costs. You will note that our gross margin contracted 270 basis points to 14.1%. The most significant unfavorable impacts on our gross margin were higher material cost and lower product price mix.", "These were partially offset by cost takeout and productivity actions, and as I previously mentioned, higher BEFIEX credit monetization.", "SG&A expense totaled $425 million compared with $401 million in the prior year. The majority of the dollar increase in SG&A was related to foreign currency translation. Higher advertising spending was partially offset by lower infrastructure costs.", "As a percentage of sales, SG&A was up slightly from the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $14 million during the quarter and resulted from cost reduction actions in Europe and North America. For 2011, we continue to expect to record restructuring charges of between $75 million and $100 million.", "Turning to Slide 21, I wanted to briefly discuss interest and sundry expense. While several individual line items roll into this caption on the income statement, the key year-over-year variance was the settlement of the Brazilian collection dispute and the incremental accruals for Embraco antitrust matters that I previously discussed.", "Turning to our tax rate, we recorded an effective tax benefit of 56% during the quarter and compared to a benefit of 4% last year. The difference in rates is primarily due to the change in pretax earnings. ", "We have included a table on Slide 22 to provide you with a reconciliation of our 2011 second quarter tax rate. In addition to the BEFIEX credits I previously discussed, we also recorded $79 million of energy tax credits in the quarter compared to $87 million in prior year.", "For the full year, we continue to expect between $300 million to $350 million of energy tax credits. The delta between our prior guidance for our effective tax rate of minus 10% and our current outlook is due to a projected drop in earnings before taxes. ", "And finally, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.10 per share compared with $2.64 per share in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS was $2.76 per share income compared with the $2.82 per share in the prior year.", "Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 23, we reported a free cash flow use of $473 million during the second quarter compared to a use of $88 million in the prior year. The main variances from the prior year's results relate to lower cash earnings and a $212 million U.S. cash pension contribution.", "There are 2 additional items I would like to highlight. As previously disclosed in June, we completed a $300 million 10-year bond issuance at a coupon interest rate of 4.85%. This issuance replaces dollar-for-dollar the debt that matured this June 15, which carried an interest rate of 6.125%. The new issuance is the lowest coupon bond in our capital structure allowing for flexibility with liquidity. ", "Also in June, we entered into a 5-year amended and restated long-term credit facility. The new facility extended our existing credit facility scheduled to mature in August of 2012 to June of 2016 and increased our existing $1.35 billion facility to $1.725 billion.", "We regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities, which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support our innovation and productivity initiatives, funding our pension plan and termed debt liabilities, return to shareholders and potential acquisitions. These priorities are aligned with our goal to return our credit ratings to pre-recession levels. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thanks, Roy. I'd like to take a moment now and kind of put all these pieces together and provide you with a perspective of how we see the business. I'm going to be referring Slides 25, 26 and 27, which showed the priorities, which we laid out and discussed with investors late last year at our Investor Day conference. ", "As a company, we are now at our 100th year of operations. We are today the global leader in the major home appliance business, and we see significant levers for us to grow in the future. We remain very well positioned, and I think we're demonstrating that we are capable to quickly adapt to changes in the environment. For a reference, during last 3 years, we've substantially lowered our break-even point by reducing capacity, fixed cost and optimizing our global operations, and we see more opportunities in this space. We've invested and continue to invest in great new product innovation, and I think today have the best portfolio of winning new products than we've ever had in our history. As Roy mentioned, we have greatly strengthened our balance sheet, we've improved our liquidity and we have dealt with some very large historical liabilities that are now behind us. In addition, we continue to grow and are getting an even stronger position in critical emerging markets like Latin America, India and China.", "What we expected late last year was some economic recovery in our developed markets. We certainly didn't foresee the extraordinary inflation that we've experienced this year or the weakening of demand levels. So this economic challenge has delayed the growth rate and margin improvement that we expected in the first half of this year. But it has not changed our expectations or commitment to execute our roadmap for growth and valuation[ph], which we've presented last year. ", "We are aggressively responding to these economic realities that we see today around the world as we've laid out throughout this presentation, we've implemented additional price productivity and cost actions to overcome higher material costs, higher inflation and lower demand levels. We clearly expect second half margins to improve, particularly in the fourth quarter, where we will have the full impact of our announced and implemented price increases with cost and productivity levels, which will fully offset inflation and positively contribute to our margins well. So to summarize, we are in a period where global growth is uncertain and in that environment, we are taking necessary actions in order to expand our operating margins, improve our earnings and generate cash in line with our target range projections, which we remain committed to delivering. So with that, I'd be happy to open this call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the phone of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "On Latin America, I'm wondering if you can just give a little bit more color on the margins there which have, excluding the BEFIEX, seen some erosion. In the U.S. it seems like will start to stabilize or improve the margins a bit, but can you just talk about what's going on with Latin American margins, what's driving the change there?", "Michael Todman", "Yes, Eric, this is Mike Todman. We did see a reduction in margins in Latin America in the second quarter. We actually saw that, that had started in April, largely driven by material costs, but also driven by price mix. And that's why we executed price increases beginning in the second quarter and kind of taking effect through the quarter and into next quarter. But we did see some erosion, we expect that to improve as we go to the back half of the year because of the price increases to offset the erosion.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Can you talk about your sort of confidence and conviction in that and perhaps compare and contrast that to North America? Because you're absolutely dealing with similar issues?", "Michael Todman", "Yes, we're actually very confident. We've already started the execution of those increases, and we are beginning to see them, to see the results of those. So we expect them to absolutely to take hold, and we're very confident that we will see them in our margins as we go in the second of the year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then I guess the second question, a follow-up question. In North America, you've talked about the being less promotional in the back half of the year. Pretty meaningfully less promotional not being a favorable contributor to margin. Can you just talk about your expectation about how that will influence volume and how you expect the discipline to be in the industry to hold that position if volumes continue to behave in a challenging fashion?", "Marc Bitzer", "Eric, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, the comment referring to, the overall promotion environment in the industry. Obviously, promotions are determined and decided by the retailer. The reason I will believe the overall promotional noise is going to be less than last year is very simple. But if for any reason, the return on investment in promotion is significantly less than last year. And that is very simply driven by the fact that the direct purchases or base of purchases are at an all-time high. There is just no return of putting a promotion out there for [indiscernible] And we saw that already in the second quarter, but I would say the lift which many retailers got from promotions were lower than expected anticipated, and we therefore, expect that the retailers adjust that behavior also somewhat in the second half. I don't think it will overall impact the levels of industry demand and we've factored that promotional assessment already into our expectation for second half industry volumes, which again as I mentioned before, we expect the full year to be down minus 1 to minus 2. And if you translate that into a second half, we expect the second half to be up plus 1 to plus 2.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Cowen.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Can you comment on your inventory levels? Still up 15% in this kind of demand environment. Looks a little frightening, and I'm wondering how much it is impacting price mix globally and how much it should impact price mix in Q3?", "Roy Templin", "Yes, Laura, this is Roy. First of all, Laura, let me talk a little bit about inventory. In the general, at $3.1 billion, that's up just under $400 million from a year ago on the balance sheet. And first of all, and very importantly, $200 million of the $395 million, Laura, is just simply the result of the changing currencies year-over-year. And then you've got, what I would estimate just under 3 days or about $115 million would relate to what we would call excess inventory. And a lot of that is in our International businesses and a lot of that is seasonal related inventory with the chunk of that related back to what Mike talked about in terms of the seasons that we experienced in some of our international markets relative to that inventory. And so we'd that's about $115 million. And then the other $80 million, Laura, is 2 things. Part of it is just the cost lift as a result of higher commodities, and then when you look year-over-year, obviously, a year ago, we were building inventories relative to a low position. And so, we had some availability issues. And so if you look year-over-year from that perspective, those 2 components give you the other $80 million. From a company perspective, Laura, and I know you've followed us for a long time, we normally build somewhere around $425 million of inventory in the first half of the year just so to support the seasonality in the business. This year, we built less than that at $280 million. We did take 5% of our units out globally in terms of production year-over-year. The greatest reduction being in North America, in Marc's business, where we took out about 8% year-over-year in terms of production units. And we've planned and have plans in place to continue to take production down over the back half of the year to get our inventories aligned. I think last call, Larry Venturelli mentioned that our plan was to take inventory levels down to $2.6 billion or roughly thereabouts. We still have those same plans in place. We have our production schedules aligned with the most recent demand that Jeff talked about in order to achieve that inventory reduction. It is, Laura, admittedly more reduction than we typically do, midpoint, end of year. But we did the same level in 2008, and we did $309 million of take down in 2009. So we're confident in our ability to get the inventories down over the remainder of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the side of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "A couple of quick questions. First off, there seems to be a lot of things going on in price mix. Can you parse out the price part versus the mix part both in the quarter and then your expectations for the year?", "Roy Templin", "For the quarter, Sam, this is Roy. Let me give you a little bit of high level. For the quarter, Jeff talked about we had roughly 2 points of impact on price mix from a margin perspective. I want to emphasize that. Like-for-like, Sam, it was about 0.5 point relative to the 2 points. Allowance is about 0.5 point and then if you look at mix globally, that was about 1 point of the 2-point reduction. And Sam, those numbers relative to year-to-date are probably fairly similar. As you know, in the first quarter, we had minus 2.3 and this quarter minus 2.0.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Two more quick questions if I might. Any early read through so far in terms of 2012 inflation based on what you're looking at the raw materials markets right now?", "Jeff Fettig", "Sam, this is Jeff. No, I don't think we really have a -- I think there is a lot of things that are changing very quickly. We're kind of at an odd point in time in the economy where you have record high in inflation and relatively weak demand. So we are seeing, again included in this forecast, some turning of material costs, but it's -- we probably don't really begin negotiations or getting a firm handle on that 'til late third quarter, early fourth quarter.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Last question if I might. Electrolux yesterday or the other day mentioned that the Latin American industry, they've pegged a 7% growth and you folks with the very high market share grew your units considerably more than that and also took your BEFIEX rates higher. What are you seeing there from a demand standpoint? Is it a fair amount of market share gains and why would that be or is it definitional? Why the discrepancies?", "Michael Todman", "Well, Sam, first of all, we said for the year, we are holding to the 5% to 10%. If you think about it, the second quarter was up fairly substantially year-over-year because of the down quarter last year. So I'd say that's the first thing. Now in terms of our business, as I said on the last call, we've expanded our distribution to areas of growth within the country. There is some 6,000 cities in Brazil and a lot of them were small. But that is where we're seeing growth, and so we've expanded our distribution there, and so we're enjoying good solid growth in those regions.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "So if I could take that further, you would anticipate growing perhaps considerably more than the 5% to 10% industry growth that you're pegging?", "Michael Todman", "No, I'm not saying that, Sam. I think that's a reasonable level of growth that we should expect.", "Roy Templin", "Sam, this is Roy. Let me talk a little bit about your BEFIEX question. Because I think it's an important one, and by the way I know you've been following us for a long time, so you know the connection here. But with respect to BEFIEX, we did take up our guidance. We did have a higher BEFIEX in the second quarter. But a couple of things, Sam, to emphasize here with respect to the why. As you know, this is not only volume driven, but it's also very much tagged to the mix that you have within that volume, and we have the highest IPI taxes, and therefore, the highest BEFIEX offset in the laundry category at 20%. And as you know, the lowest at cooking at 4%. And so what happened in the second quarter and what we project happening over the remainder of the year is one, we have taken share in laundry and improved our laundry mix. Laundry mix is up 6% year-over-year. We have a case of innovation that we're bringing into the market, continuing throughout the back half of the year. And so that was the reason one for the higher BEFIEX in the quarter, but very importantly, to your point too, the reason we've taken the guidance up for the year related to those 2 matters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the side of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor", "Hopefully this heat is helping your replacement refrigeration sales. I guess a couple of questions. It appears that you gained some share in North America, so I wondered if you could address that. And then the second question just pertains to your ability to secure price increases in a down commodity market. And history would suggest that at the peak of the commodity markets, manufacturers typically have a tough time securing a full pass-through, and where does your confidence come from that you can be a little more successful in this time around as commodity prices continue to come down?", "Marc Bitzer", "David, I'll take the first part. It's Marc Bitzer. Just on the share, first of all, when we talked about our overall unit that went down 5% in an industry that's down 10% percent, keep in mind this overall unit include our entire North American business, everything from Mexico, Canada, et cetera. If you look at our core appliances piece at market share, which is obviously a subset of our overall North American business, we would say on a year-to-date base, our share is flat, year-over-year it is flat. However, it is sequentially down from the first quarter. That is total combination of somewhat seasonality but it's also we expected some share drop as a result of our price increase in April 1. So I would say we're pretty pleased with where we are today from share it's flat. Some share loss which we expected due to our price increase, and we're pretty comfortable to where we are today in share position.", "David S. MacGregor", "How much share do you think you forfeited with the price increase?", "Marc Bitzer", "I would say a big part of the Q2 and Q1 drop, but a result of us going very early and aggressively and decide to give a price increase, and we expect over time to get that back.", "Jeff Fettig", "David, that's not an abnormal pattern for us. Let me address the price increase, David. I don't think I could agree that we're yet in a down commodity cycle. In fact, we raised our material forecast from again to $450 million to $500 million. I know there was a period where we had some peaks, but I mean, we never buy the peak, we never buy the bottom. The trend is still up. What I said was we've expected the second half to be high. In fact we peak in the third quarter and then, but stabilizing. There are a few isolated cases where you've seen small declines, but if you take that material cost increase at the second half of last year plus this, it's been the biggest commodity and material cost inflation push that we've ever seen. So I think the price increases we're asking for are very justified. And unless -- well I certainly don't think that cost situation turning. We think it's very predictable between now and the end of the year, simply, as I said based on hedging and contracts. So if they did turn the next year, that's a different issue. But I would say margins have been hugely impacted at every level due to this inflation, and we've got to recoup it with price.", "David S. MacGregor", "Just Roy, quickly on the credit facility revision or extension, were there any change in the covenants?", "Roy Templin", "No. Same financial covenants, David, that we have before.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the phone of Josh Pollard with Goldman Sachs.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "My first question is on your cost initiatives. I think it was back in 4Q when you guys first laid those out, you guys laid those out again. But I think what investors are looking for is actually some dollar figures to actually put around those initially when you gave guidance in 4Q, you said you'd be able to offset the $250 million to $300 million unfavorable impact from inflation. When you raised it in 1Q, your inflation numbers, you said, you'd still be able to offset it. It seems like now you guys aren't saying that you will offset it fully. So I really don't have a good view on what the total dollar figure is of cost initiatives you guys are having, how those breakout by the items that you outlined, Jeff? And then I'm also trying to get a sense of how they breakdown by quarter.", "Jeff Fettig", "Josh, I can give you a couple of those pieces. First of all, relative to the original material guidance of $250 million and $300 million on our productivity will offset that. The issue, obviously, is the material cost increases, and we now see it as $450 million to $500 million, which makes the task obviously much harder. I would say also don't forget that is just raw material costs. It does not include logistics costs, which globally is probably with fuel is another $150 million to $200 million, and what I would say it's a very high inflation, particularly in emerging markets on salaries, benefits, basically everything. So and again I won't have an exact number, but if you put all those together you will have over $1 billion of inflation across all parts of our business. So what I said was our productivity -- it is fairly well evenly distributed. That our productivity will exceed this inflation by the fourth quarter. So we've had high levels of productivity, simply just not been enough to offset this inflation. So it's impacted our margins. What I would say, we peak in Q3, we cross over positive to positive territory productivity exceeding raw material costs and inflation in Q4. So it will become a positive addition to our margin then, but for the first 3 quarters, it's net negative.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So maybe we can take a step back, $450 million to $500 million on a quarterly basis. So 1Q, 2Q, what you're seeing so far and then I can do the math on what's in the second half, and I would make the assumption that, that 3Q is harsher than 4Q. What are those numbers?", "Jeff Fettig", "For raw materials?", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Yes.", "Michael Todman", "I'm sorry I missed the question.", "Roy Templin", "So we had $94 million in Q1, as you know, Josh. $133 million this quarter, and we would project, again these are round numbers, okay? We peaked out about $140 million and then come down to somewhere around $125 million in the fourth quarter. That will get you to $490 million, but those back half are round numbers, Josh.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then your cost initiatives, can you give those by quarter as well? Because I think that's where really your investor base is struggling to get a sense. How these things will shape up?", "Roy Templin", "Yes, Josh, again we don't give out productivity by quarter. I would just say let's talk about this quarter and then let me talk a little bit about year-to-date and then as a point of reference, maybe I'll point back to Jeff's comments to last year. First of all, this quarter, if you look at sort of everything Jeff talked about x the materials, we had about $100 million of benefit in the margin in Q2 or just over 200 basis points, Josh. Now, the bad thing, as Jeff referenced is, we have $133 million in material or 280 basis points on material. So if you look at this year-to-date, again, the material number is just about 250 basis points almost spot on with the productivity at about 200 basis points. So again, we're tracking, but we're still beneath the headwinds that Jeff referenced. Again, while we won't do it quarterly, in his comments, you saw it play out last year where we ended the year with roughly 350 basis points of productivity for the full year. And then of course, as you know Josh, that allowed us to expand on margin because it more than offset what we experienced with pricing and more than offset what we experienced with materials. That, for a local corporation, is fairly traditional because of the way we build the pipe and execute the pipe over the course of the year. And we always get stronger productivity in the back half. In terms of specificity on back half, we don't provide that.", "Jeff Fettig", "Again, I would just say that the price mix will, we said, will add at least 2 points to our margin in the second of the year versus the minus 2 points in the first half. We said that raw materials will stay high, but stabilize and our productivity will exceeded this oil inflation by the fourth quarter, which means it will be positive to the fourth quarter. So that's the -- those are the 2 big levers we see with demands still being the most variable of those factors.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And I just want to make sure that when you say it will add 2 points to margin that's relative to the first half of 2010 or is that relative, that's correct?", "Jeff Fettig", "2011.", "Roy Templin", "Yes, you're right, Jeff. 2011.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the side of Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "First question, just to look at the 200 bps of benefit from the price increases for the back half of the year. How much of that do you expect from the price increases that you've already announced and implemented versus the ones that you are going to be implementing from today through October?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes. You know, let me kind of give you a macro view. We took what we thought at that the time appropriate pricing increase in the U.S. in April. Then we saw the higher inflation, and Marc can tell you that I think he did tell you the quarter-over-quarter benefit we've already seen. So that would carry through and then the additional one is the one we did in August. In Brazil, we took, and we're seeing late in the second quarter already the benefits of what was implemented, announced in May and implemented. They'll be fully implemented through June, July. And Europe is largely being implemented between now and October. Mike said, 5% to 7%. So we would expect to net a high percentage of that. And then in places like India, we've done it every month or every other month and you can see, and we've been able to fully offset inflation in places like that, and we'll do that as needed. So our run rate of margin improvement is improving. But it's a combination of that and the new ones that gives you the 2 points.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Right. I guess you have obviously a lot of experience in price increases over the last year or 2, but I guess what people particularly in the U.S. are looking at is the continuation of that trend amid a weaker-than-expected demand environment. And so I guess is the price, the confidence from achieving those price increases, does it stem from some new products or from just your gauge on how your big customers will react or if there is anymore color on that perspective?", "Marc Bitzer", "Mike, it's Marc Bitzer. I'm trying to answer your question now. We're not trying to speculate about expectation of future price increases or how much it will stick or not. Let me maybe first as the, in retrospect, what we saw in Q2 in what was an exceptionally weak market environment. Our prices increases are fully executed, and we delivered exactly what we internally had in mind. The confidence about what would happen is very simply that we have a very strong innovation pipeline. We have this number of [indiscernible] leading consumer magazine ratings, which are exceptionally strong and a couple of innovation, which gives you confidence in the marketplace, yes you can execute certain market places price increases. And with confidence up in Q2 and that would also carry into Q3.", "Jeff Fettig", "Mike, I'd only add that, I mean, again, I want to put this in percent, a record level of inflation globally across our business, not just raw materials, but logistics costs, other costs. And the reality is without a price increase, the comparison between the price increase and some volume, clearly favors a price increase, and because selling products that you don't make any on doesn't really create any value. So we made a strong commitment around the world with what we've announced where we intend to execute them and recouped a small portion of the material inflation, another inflation that we've already experienced. The rest were offsetting completely with productivity.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. I appreciate that. Last question, in Latin America if you strip out the BEFIEX contribution, your core margins were down about a little over 200 bps sequentially. And so it seems like that is, I believe, you identified as due to both material cost and price mix. I was wondering if you could kind of break out which, with material cost, half or 2/3 of that, I think you said was primarily due to material. And on the price mix side, what's driving that? Is it just more due to mix or is there increased competition there?", "Jeff Fettig", "I'd say Michael, on the price mix side, let me just take that. It's -- we have seen some mix erosion, but it's really is a combination of both. We've also seen some like-for-like. Again, that's why we executed the price increases that we did. And in Brazil, it was 4% to 5%. And we are already saying that we are able to net that. In terms of the inflation and material headwind, I'd say that it's about 50-50 I mean, I'd just put it in those terms. So that's kind of what the breakdown is.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And BEFIEX balance at the quarter end, Roy if you have that?", "Roy Templin", "Sure, Michael, we'll talk to you this afternoon, it will say 474.", "Bracken Darrell", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the side of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "You said you expect a 2% increase in price around the second half. Can you highlight perhaps different regional swings, and second, does that imply for your April price perhaps only 25% to 35% of its stock or can you talk about the difference between your back half price and what was talked about in terms of the April in the U.S. at least?", "Jeff Fettig", "The 2% is global. So it does vary by region and the timing of that. But it's the net margin contribution, which is different, could be very different than what is implemented in the marketplace. So in the April 1 in North America, we executed what we said we're going to do, and we see those prices in the marketplace.", "Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay, and then I guess with the slowing in playing field, like using Europe as an example, but it could be for Brazil as well, which I think you were talking about, the volume that you've talked about. The mix you said in Brazil, you expected to be recovering it. In Europe, could you maybe kind of talk about that and should we think about mix having a downward impact relative to slowing demand or is that really just volatility you would not have any inside into kind of the back half of the year?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, I would say that this is much volatility. I think we feel pretty confident that we can both recover mix. Remember, mix is also new product introductions to help drive that, innovations help drive that. So that's not something that we're concerned about. We think we can do it.", "Well, listen everyone.

MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opener remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Larry Venturelli, Senior Vice President of Finance.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Third Quarter Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Roy Templin, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q.", "Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to, our core operating results. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business.", "Listeners are directed to the Appendix Section of our presentation beginning on Slide 36 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investors Section of our website at www.whirlpoolcorp.com.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thanks, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported an increase in revenue and earnings in the third quarter compared to last year. However, these results were lower than we expected as our price increases and productivity improvements were more than offset by the impact of weakness which we saw in global demand and high material costs.", "As you see today, we have announced very aggressive plans to substantially reduce our structural costs in order to improve profitability. You may remember as we stated in our second quarter call that given this period's uncertain economic growth and consumer demand, we will be prepared to take the necessary actions to expand our operating margins and improve our earnings if conditions deteriorate. And as you all know, since July, consumer confidence in the U.S. has declined and is now at its lowest level since March of 2009. Demand is also falling off sharply in parts of Europe and slowed in emerging markets.", "So given this economic environment, we've taken significant actions to substantially reduce our cost and capacity, which will improve our operating margins and profitability. I would say these plans are the result of a comprehensive global review of our operations, products and manufacturing facilities and are expected to reduce our fixed cost structure by approximately $400 million by the end of 2013.", "Before I get into those details, let me first turn to our third quarter results, which you can see on Slide 5. For the quarter, sales reached $4.6 billion, which represents a 2% increase from last year. Our EPS was $2.27 versus $1.02 a year ago. Year-to-date, we have had $739 million of cash usage, which includes $589 million used upon the legacy and financial liabilities, which we previously discussed.", "We have started to benefit from previously announced price increases in all major markets in the world. We also had announced additional increases in several markets, including a price increase in the U.S., which will go into effect next year.", "I'd ask you to turn now to Slide 6 where you can see our full year's revised demand assumptions. In the U.S., demand remains at recessionary levels. Our 4-year forecast is now for a 3% to 5% decline for the region. As you know, Europe has been significantly impacted by the sovereign debt crisis and low consumer confidence, and we now expect full year industry demand to be flat.", "Demand in Latin America region declined by about 5% during the quarter, and we now expect full year demand to be between flat and up 5% for the year. And we've modestly reduce Asia's growth just 2% to 4% as we expect to see continued growth in China but we are seeing declining growth in India.", "I'll now turn to Slide 7 where you'll see material costs, which have had a significant impact on our margins. Despite a generally weaker slowing growth around the world, we didn't see raw material or related cost at very high levels, and we believe though they've peaked during the quarter.", "Turning to Slide 8. Given these external challenges, we made very clear what our business priorities are. First is to expand our operating margins. Second, we will continue to invest on our global operating footprint in brands to continue to offer strong teams of consumer-relevant innovation to the marketplace. Third, we're reducing our cost structure. And as you see, we're taking immediate actions to align our cost structure with current and expected near-term industry demand levels, and we'll provide you with the detail of that in a moment.", "Fourth, we're implementing the already announced cost-base price increases in all major markets around the world. We must continue to pass on some of these costs to the market in order for us to enable to continue to bring innovative new products to the marketplace. And lastly, we continue to make very good progress on our U.S.-focused fair trade actions.", "I'll now turn to Slide 9 where we've highlighted the actions we're taking to reduce our cost and capacity, which will accelerate our margin growth beginning in 2012. As you saw in the release, we will implement a workforce reduction in more than 5,000 positions, primarily in North America and Europe, which includes a reduction of about 1,200 salaried positions. Yesterday, we announced the closure of our Fort Smith, Arkansas refrigeration facility, which will close by mid-next year. Production from this facility will be consolidated into current North American sites in order to leverage existing capacity. We've also announced the relocation of our dishwasher production from Germany to Poland early next year, and our additional organizational efficiency actions in both North America and Europe.", "In total, we expect capacity to be reduced by approximately 6 million units based on these announcements and other actions that we've taken. The capacity being reduced is targeted on high-cost locations and product segments with low profitability.", "Of course, these decisions are never easy, but they're very necessary to ensure that we retain a cost-effective business structure in a weak demand environment. We are proactively taking these necessary steps to improve our operating margins and deliver long-term value creation to our shareholders.", "I'll now turn to Slide 10 where we show we expect these actions I've outlined today to produce an annual savings of approximately $400 million by the end of 2013. And this will result in a restructuring charge of approximately $500 million, which will be incurred beginning in the fourth quarter of this year through 2013. Roy will provide you with more detail on this in a moment.", "Overall, given the weaker-than-expected economic environment we're seeing, we are lowering our full year earnings guidance, which you can see on Slide 11. Earnings per share are going from $7.25 to $8.25 per share to $4.75 a share to $5.25. And free cash flow guidance was $160 million to $260 million positive, it is now $150 million to $200 million negative. We will not be providing any 2012 forecast today, but as we normally do, we will provide annual guidance when we report our year end results in early February.", "At this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our North America operations.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving you my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. Shown on Slide 13, the price increases we announced in April and in August have been fully implemented, and we have announced an additional 6% to 7% price increase on all SKUs effective January 2012. These increases are necessary to mitigate higher material costs.", "As a result of these cost-based price increases, our product price/mix has improved both sequentially and year-over-year. At the same time, our margins saw continued pressure because of weaker-than-expected industry shipments, which were down 4% in the quarter. Significant raw material costs continued to be a headwind for us during the quarter. We saw material reach record levels in August, and we expect cost to remain at these elevated levels.", "On Slide 14, you see annual U.S. industry T7 units since 2005. Demand has dropped back to recessionary levels and in the U.S., we've seen replacement demand become the vast majority of the overall demand. Based on recent trends, we now expect industry shipments to be down 3% to 5% for the year compared to our previous forecast of down 1% to 2%.", "On Slide 15 you'll see North America's financial performance in the third quarter. Regarding our overall unit volume, we saw North America unit shipments down 3% in the third quarter. Within the U.S. industry, that was down nearly 4%. Net sales of $2.4 billion were down 2% from last year due to the weak industry demand.", "Turning to Slide 16, you can see just a few of our new products that we launched in the third quarter, including a Whirlpool brand side-by-side refrigerator with 6th Sense technology that monitors and adjusts temperatures to help food stay flavorful. The refrigerator combines counter depth styling with a full-capacity refrigerator. In the middle, you see the Maytag Bravos XL top-load high-efficiency washing machine that offers the cleaning while using up to 76% less water and 78% less energy compared to traditional top-load washers. And finally, a new Whirlpool dishwasher that features 40 targeted spray jets that scour away baked on foods and deliver twice the coverage. The dishwasher can save consumers up to 20 gallons of water per load.", "Let me also add at this point a few comments on the expectation for Q4. As mentioned before, we expect industry demand to be down over quarter in the range of 1% to 2%. We announced to our customers promotion activity for the Black Friday season that will be lower than last year's level. Because we have determined this is a weaker demand environment with replacement driving more consumer's purchases, we don't see value in heavy promotions during this time.", "We expect the combination of cost-based price increases and the significant cost reduction actions, which we announced today, to contribute to North America margin improvement beginning in Q4. We will also continue to leverage our strong product innovation for growth over long-term.", "Let me also spend a minute on our fair trade actions and the Department of Commerce preliminary decision on antidumping that was announced yesterday. A preliminary determination by the U.S. Department of Commerce found South Korean and Mexican producers violated U.S. and international trade laws by dumping bottom-mount refrigerators in the United States. These preliminary findings of dumping validates legal actions we're taking to protect fair competition. And as a result of yesterday's preliminary determination, importers will be required to post bonds, a security for payment of antidumping duties if U.S. wholesale prices are not raised to fair value. While the investigation is not yet complete, we remain very confident about the case. The U.S. Department of Commerce will conduct a thorough audit in the next phase of investigation, and we expect the final rulings would accurately reflect the damage inflicted by the dumping of bottom-mount refrigerators.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our International operations.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Marc. Let me to start with the third quarter 2011 review of our International business on Slide 18. Overall, compared to last year, our international businesses' balance of sale grew from 47% to 50%, driven primarily from sales in the emerging markets.", "Sales of $2.3 billion grew 7%, excluding currency sales were flat. Our Europe business was particularly affected by weak demand, high material costs and unfavorable price/mix during the quarter.", "In Latin America, high inflation contributed to a slowing of growth as we experienced a unit volume decline resulting in a slight sales growth after adjusting for currency. Operating earnings were impacted by higher inflation and significant raw material costs.", "in Asia, we saw unit volumes growth of 4% over 2010 levels. High inflation reduced consumer spending in India, resulting in a very weak demand environment. And this was partially offset by strong unit growth in China and continued productivity improvements across the region. ", "Turning to Slide 19. In the third quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales increased 6% year-over-year to $874 million, with unit shipments flat compared to the prior periods. Excluding the favorable impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 3%. The region reported an operating loss of $12 million versus a $26 million profit last year.", "Results were unfavorably impacted by significantly higher material costs, lower product price/mix and production reductions to align inventory to its demand, which were partially offset by cost reductions and productivity initiatives.", "Slide 20 shows a summary of our Latin American third quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.2 billion, an 8% increase from the prior year period, with appliance unit shipments down 5%. Excluding the impact from currencies, sales increased approximately 1%. Operating profits totaled $147 million compared to $143 million in the prior year. Cost reduction and productivity initiatives increased monetization of tax credits, and favorable price/mix impacted results. These factors were offset by notably higher material and oil-related costs and production cuts to keep inventories in line with demand.", "Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 21. Net sales increased 10% during the quarter to $215 million, up from $195 million in the prior year period as unit shipments increased 4%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 7%. The region's operating profit was $4 million for the quarter compared to $5 million in the prior year. Overall, declining volumes, high inflation and high material costs in India were offset by volume improvement in China and ongoing productivity initiatives.", "On Slide 22, you can see a sampling of our new products launched in the third quarter around the world including: a Whirlpool brand Green Generation dishwasher in Europe, featuring the lowest water consumption of any dishwasher in the industry; a Consul brand washing machine in Brazil, featuring a detergent and softener dispenser that can be preloaded for up to 10 washes; and a Whirlpool brand washing machine in China, featuring both the smallest footprint and the largest load capacity in the market.", "In closing, several of the cost reduction actions today are specifically designed to address higher raw material cost and lower demand levels, particularly in Western Europe. The actions that Jeff outlined at the start of this call will reduce manufacturing capacity and high cost locations to support margin expansion and strengthen our overall global competitive position.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roy Templin for his financial review.", "Roy Templin", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 24, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our third quarter results. Our sales grew by more than 2% to $4.6 billion. We benefited from both price/mix and currency. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were down slightly on global unit volumes, which decreased 2.3% from the prior year. We continued to face elevated raw material and oil-related cost, which peaked in August.  Additionally, weaker-than-expected industry demand resulted in further production reductions. We continue to tightly manage inventory levels given the challenging and volatile global demand environment, and we continue to expect year-end inventories to be in the $2.6 billion range. Based on volume and product mix, we monetized $62 million of BPX credits compared to $56 million in the prior year.", "Turning to the income statement on Slide 25. You will note that our gross margin contracted 190 basis points or 12.4%. The most significant unfavorable impact on our gross margin was higher material cost. This was partially offset by favorable product price/mix and positive productivity despite significant production declines.", "SG&A expense totaled $394 million compared with $391 million in the prior year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was down slightly from the prior year as a result of lower infrastructure cost. Restructuring expenses totaled $36 million during the quarter and resulted from cost reduction actions in Europe and North America. In light of today's announcement, which Jeff discussed earlier, we now expect to record restructuring charges of approximately $160 million during 2011.", "Turning to Slide 26. I wanted to point out interest and sundry expense. While several individual line items roll into this caption on the income statement, the key year-over-year reduction was related to legal contingencies incurred during the prior year. We reported diluted earnings per share of $2.27 per share compared with $1.02 per share in the prior year, or $2.35 per share and $2.22 per share on an adjusted basis.", "Included in our results is a tax benefit primarily due to the recognition of $122 million in energy tax credits. For the full year, we now expect approximately $350 million of energy tax credits, which is on the high end of our previously disclosed range.", "Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 27. We reported a free cash flow use of $739 million in the 9-month period of 2011 compared to a use of $1 million in the prior year. Current year results were impacted by lower cash earnings and include $266 million in pension contributions and a $301 million payment related to the settlement of the Brazilian collection dispute.", "I want to spend a few minutes on the expected impact of the actions we announced today. Slide 28 shows our current estimate of how the $500 million in restructuring cost will be allocated over the next 2 years. It'll be approximately $105 million in the fourth quarter of this year, approximately $280 million in 2012 and approximately $115 million in 2013.", "Slide 29 shows the anticipated efficiencies of approximately $200 million in both 2012 and another $200 million in 2013. You've heard us talk today a lot about capacity reduction. And here again, you see on approximate 6 million unit target based on today's announcement and other actions already underway in 2011. It is important to keep in mind that this is high-cost capacity take out designed to reduce our fixed cost structure, not limit our ability to boost production when demand levels improve.", "Before I turn the call back over to Jeff, I want to talk briefly about CapEx. I often get questions on capital allocation, and given today's announcement, I thought it would be helpful to provide a high-level breakdown that you can see on Slide 30. While there is some variance year-to-year, generally speaking, and looking at a historical 3-year average, capacity comprises 10% of our capital spend. Maintenance of business is roughly 20%, and cost efficiency and quality initiatives are roughly 30%. You see innovation on the chart at 40%. As you can see, these investments are critical to position the company to successfully execute our strategy, particularly with respect to bringing a cadence of innovation to the market and continued improvements in cost and quality.", "As Jeff mentioned earlier, continued innovation investment is a big piece of our long-term growth strategy in both the core appliance business, as well as adjacent business opportunities.", "At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thanks, Roy. As I mentioned previously, we are focused on aggressively expanding our operating margins and executing all of the actions which we described on Slide 22 that we've discussed on today's call.", "I'd like to turn to Slide 33. Many of you may remember, about last year at this time, we hosted an Investors' Day and shared our value creation targets, which used 2010 economic data as a basis. At the time, we certainly didn't foresee the extraordinary material cost inflation or the weakening of industry demand levels that we've seen this year. And of course, these macroeconomic assumptions were critical elements of setting our long-range financial goals and timeline.", "Certainly, these challenges have delayed our revenue growth and the rate of improvement, margin improvement for most of this year. And we do expect the volatility we've seen in the global, macroeconomy will have a continued impact on the industry demand in the near term. Having said that, we still remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-range financial goals, including achieving 8% operating margin. However, given current economic conditions, it may take us additional time to realize these targets.", "Turning to Slide 34, we show what we expect to be the main contributors to our margin expansion. The first are the announcements we're making today regarding fixed cost capacity reduction. We expect this result in 2 points of margin expansion in 2012 and '13. Secondly, we expect ongoing productivity initiatives to more than offset inflation going forward and positively contribute to our margins. Next, as you heard from many of our speakers today, we expect improved price/mix driven by innovation and already announced or implemented cost-based price increases, and we expect this to have substantial margin impact next year. We also continue to grow our adjacent businesses which are providing positive mix in our margins. These businesses are growing at a faster rate and offer higher margins than our core appliance business.  And finally, in the midterm, we do believe we will see normalized demand returned, which will also have a positive impact on our margins. While any one of these individual assumptions may vary, we have strong confidence that our long-range targets can be achieved, given the strength of our brands and product innovation, I believe our proven ability over time to reduce cost and the growth we are seeing in our adjacent businesses. Ultimately, we do believe the industry demand environment is a shorter-term challenge, and we're confident in the opportunities that we see in all parts of our business to grow. And some of those examples are on Slide 35.", "So in summary, we have not changed our expectations or commitment to execute our roadmap for growth and value creation. Overall, we believe the actions announced today will strengthen our global competitive position. I believe our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, our recently announced cost-based price increases and continued innovation investment will in fact expand our operating margins and deliver long-term shareholder value.", "With that, I'd like to end the formal remarks and open this up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Thomas Mahoney", "This is Tom Mahoney calling in for Eric today. You guys commented about price/mix and that it would add substantially to margin in 2012. How do you think about this being relative to an industry that's getting more competitive in the U.S. and in Brazil, plus the consumer that is more focused on value and lower prices rather than higher prices at this point?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Tom, this is Jeff Fettig. You know, first of all, we've -- we just had an important turning point in that third quarter where price/mix has turned positive for us. And this is after several quarters, 4 or 5 quarters of negative price/mix, more driven by what I would call very aggressive competitive actions in the marketplace and a lot of major markets. We're seeing a very strong acceptance to our new product innovation. Given the economics of this business, we've made the decision that we had to pass price increases through based on the high cost that we're seeing, and we're adjusting our business accordingly. I don't -- this is not a consumer issue. There are -- the price points that remained and -- the affordability factor and the price points that remain in the marketplace today will be there tomorrow. It's the value feature content for what you saw at the price. In the case of the U.S., yes, this is the biggest replacement market percentage wise we've ever seen. So people are buying -- or people who's products break and they're in the market for 2 or 3 days and they buy a new one. So I think the tough economic environment, we agree with. We do believe people, particularly if they've been in the market -- haven't bought a new washing machine or refrigerator for 8 or 10 years, recognize the new innovation value and are willing to pay for it. But we also know that there is a small percentage of very, very limited price-only shoppers that may buy the opening price point. And we're just -- that's just not a piece of the market that we're as heavily invested in.", "Thomas Mahoney", "Okay. And then a follow-up on Latin America. What do you guys see as the driver of the swing in unit demand there? 2Q, up 21%; and 3Q, down to 5%. Is it the market? Is there any moving pieces you can share there? And then also, does it temper your expectations as you look into 2012 for the region?", "Michael A. Todman", "Tom, this is Mike Todman. What we've seen in Brazil, as we have seen in some other emerging markets, is inflation. And that's what's caused the kind of the consumer dampening for our types of products, if you will, durable goods. Having said that, what we saw -- if you take our core 3 products in Brazil, which is washers, refrigerators and ranges, we actually did see increases. Where we saw decreases was in some -- was in air conditioners and microwaves, and particularly at the low end. So what we're expecting is to have an environment that's less favorable, if you will. But we still expect to see some positive growth in the region.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Marc, you had said you expected improvements. I believe you're referring to North America in the fourth quarter. Could you give us a sense -- I mean, if you were talking about the $2.6 million in the third quarter? Or was that the year-over-year versus the $1.7 million.", "Marc Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc, I was referring to the essentials and given the poor margins of Q4 relative [ph] also the year-over-year.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I know you guys said that the largest headwind to your gross margin was material. But could you kind of talk about, given the -- I mean, I think obviously people had seen the AHAM data that was out there, but you guys obviously took down the volume. Would you be willing to quantify how much the volume was impacting you guys in terms of underproduction?", "Roy Templin", "Yes. Ken, this is Roy Templin. A couple of things. One, your first part of your question on materials. When you factor in the LIFO piece in the materials, it was actually about 310 basis points negative on our margins in the third quarter. That's the first part of your question. The second part of your question though, you're right. Conversion was a really big deal on the quarter. We took out roughly 6% of production units when you look at year-over-year production levels. And that cost us, Ken, about 130 basis points in gross margins. So typically, we're at 2-point plus of productivity and cost takeout every quarter. This quarter, we were about 0.6 points, and the reason is because we had 130 basis hit from production takedown.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and I guess that 6% is referring to North America?", "Roy Templin", "That 6% is a global production number. So global pro is down 6% year-over-year. Yes.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And now, I guess, just to be clear, the 3% you reported in North America, I know last quarter you guys had outpaced the AHAM data. Would you say that 3% versus the 4% -- 3% North America decline versus the 4% AHAM data is more on a like-for-like basis versus last quarter?", "Marc Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. Again, let me also first verify what the typical T7 or T6 AHAM data is not exactly consistent with overall North American unit shipments because there are other products grouped in their segments. Having said that when you particularly refer to market share, markets share in a sequential base has been approximately flat or marginally up. And in a year-over-year basis, down.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of clarification questions and then one, I guess, meaty one. First off, the restructuring, Roy, that you had announced. Is that incremental to core restructuring? Or is that going to be overall restructuring for the next couple of years?", "Roy Templin", "That's overall, Sam. So there's an incremental piece in 2011, but all these numbers are total restructuring that we expect. So you see the stub in 2011 of $105 million. That's about $80 million, Sam, for new initiatives and about $25 million for things that were already underway. And then you see in '12 and '13 the $280 million and $150 million, but those will be all-inclusive numbers.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "My second clarification question, Marc, what were specifically your North American unit expectations for Q4? Maybe I'm a little confused.", "Marc Bitzer", "As I made in my script, we basically refer to 2 numbers. We refer to a full year number of down minus 3 to minus 5, and I was also referring to a Q4 numbers roughly in the range of minus 1 to minus 2 compared to last year.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So then, if you take a look -- I mean, you just -- the industry just did a minus 4, and the comparison gets much more difficult in Q4. And you're saying the promotional environment may even ease. How does that put logically or rationally? I'm confused.", "Marc Bitzer", "And Sam, again it's Marc. Of course, there's a lot of uncertainty going forward on market or expectations in demand. Having said that, we know that there is a certain base element, which is so strong and replacement-driven, which almost puts a certain floor to the overall unit demand. Of course, yes, it need to be seen but the overall demand level. But again, our model right now would indicate a minus 2, a minus 1 to minus 2.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, last question, then I'll defer to others. The U.S. energy tax credit program is set to expire at the end of this year. I guess there's some banding about in Congress as to potentially extending it. If the program is allowed to -- at least theoretically is allowed to continue in its current form, how much additional capacity do you have to -- in terms of incremental production of the applicable units since I believe the credits are based on incremental production on a year-on-year basis.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Sam, this is Jeff. There's a lot of pieces to that question. First of all, we don't have any insight to whether those will be extended or not. The way we're planning is they expire at the end of the year, and that's how we're playing the business, one. Two, there are and it's been reported there is some bills, bill proposals in Congress that potentially could include some type of continuation in these credits. The how and what are the rules, et cetera, et cetera -- I mean, first of all, will they get passed? And second of all, what will the content be? We don't know. And again, that's why we're not planning on anything. The third question is those requirements would then determine how you calculate incremental. But basically, we'd have to sell more than we did this year and because we basically do our production based on what we saw.", "Roy Templin", "Yes, Sam. This is Roy. I mean, it's a deep question, you're right. I think ultimately, as you know, a couple of factors. One, it's units produce above a ruling baseline. And again, as Jeff said, the very important piece will be what will the new baseline be? Will there be a baseline? And secondarily, of course, there's always a total limit. Right now, it has to be on gross receipts. But again, what might that limit be? How might it be calculated? And once we -- if, in fact, they were extended, we would have to first understand the components of legislation and figure out what it would mean for Whirlpool. And we wouldn't dare be in a position to speculate on that at this point.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "But the capacity takeout announced today does not necessarily impact your ability to produce over and above what the baseline has been, at least theoretically?", "Roy Templin", "It does not, Sam. And that's why in my script, I was careful to talk about -- the focus that we have is on high-cost capacity but absolutely, with laser focus on the ability to continue to sync it up, if in fact and when in fact demand improves we have the availability to take capacity up.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Robert Kelly with Sidoti.", "Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "I had a question last quarter, and you touched on it again during your earlier remarks. You have a goal of about 200 basis points from cost, productivity action that you try to get, assuming that everything breaks your way with material and whatnot. Do the actions that you announced today, would that be incremental to that 200 basis point margin goal? How should we think about the structural changes that you announced today?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Robert, the way -- you should think about them the way we think about them. You should look at the restructuring actions. We expect to take down our fixed cost structure by $400 million. That's why I said I expect that to be directly focused on expanding our margins. Beyond that, in a normal productivity year, and this was not one, in 2011, and if you go back to the last 4 or 5 years, our productivity has exceeded our inflation in the business. And so we have a global productivity program in place at all times, and we would expect -- yes. For example, last year, I think we achieved 3.5%. This year, with the high inflation, raw material, high inflation in the emerging markets, this is candidly the worst inflation year we've ever seen. But going forward, and as we get more visibility next year, we would expect that we're building our plans beyond the restructuring to have net positive productivity, which would enable us to improve our margins as well.", "Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "And then over and above the ratings [ph] announced.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "That's correct.", "Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "One final one if I may. You talked about the raw material pain being behind you at this point. Have you seen, as far as the competitive landscape, the urgency to match price increases or continue the price increases staying there with raw materials leveling off?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Robert, let me -- first of all, let me be clear on raw materials. They've stabilized at a high level. So they've not really -- in fact, they haven't gone down. And we don't -- again, it's too early for us to talk about 2012, but we certainly don't expect to see the kind of increases that we saw throughout this year. So not going up is viewed as a positive. Regarding pricing, candidly, we can only comment on what we do. I can't really make any comments about what competitors are doing.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I guess, Jeff, just what -- on the most recent question there, you indicated that raw materials have stabilized at a high level. I mean, it's pretty clear that raw material markets are rolling over pretty hard here. Do you have hedges in place or contractual obligations that are going to keep you at these price levels and represent some divergence from what's happening at spot markets?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, David. If you look at our cost structure for raw materials, steel, resin, base metals, copper, oil related, so on, those dynamics -- everyone of those markets has its own contract structures. And on base -- let's just take base metals, we've talked about this before, we have a very consistent forward hedging policy that we, within limits, adhere to at all times. When metals are going up, we usually enter the curve. When metals are going down, we may cross over for a while, be over the curve. But the point is, it's predictable for us. And even with the metals market, I mean, at which point in time do we talk about? Because the volatility, as you know, has been very extreme. So that's one. Two, resins have been one of the biggest increases this year. I think quarter-over-quarter, our spot rate for resins is 25% up. Those contracts are negotiated all the time. They're generally shorter term durations. And so they go up and down with the market. Steel is a little bit different, as we've talk about in the past. And in the emerging markets, steels everyday every week discussion. In both Europe and North America, we have multiple types of structural contracts with -- that do provide us within the limits and predictability for an annual period of time, but we don't have any steel contracts going on an annual period. So there's a lot of volatility, but I just -- to be clear, raw materials have not really gone down. In fact, as we said, based on the set of contracts and the way we, the mechanisms, we have, we actually think we peaked out, meaning increases in the third quarter, and now look forward to some stabilization without having increases month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I guess the other question was just given the announcement yesterday on the trade cases, there's a lot of interest in that this morning. Can you just talk about the potential to pursuit other trade actions based on how this looks like it's playing out?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, David. Let me first -- as I said, we're very pleased with the progress on the trade case that we had in the U.S. And just to be clear, there's 3 parts to the process. Last May, there was a 5 to 0 ruling by the Commission that there was grounds for this. This was the second step in the process, which was very important, where Department of Commerce had issued their preliminary ruling. And now we enter the last phase, which is -- every phase is important. The last phase is the auditing process where all materials will be verified with an expected final ruling in late April or early May. So we, in our statement, reiterated our confidence in our position, and we're very confident as were when we filed the case. We're not speculating on anything beyond that. We don't do that, and so we're really focused on this case.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, good. Just last question, my understanding is that you elected to take Maytag out of Best Buy. And I'm just wondering if there's many major changes going on in terms of brand strategy with Maytag, and is there a market share delta there that we should be talking about?", "Marc Bitzer", "David, it's Marc Bitzer. What I would prefer in this case -- and we usually don't comment on specific trade partner arrangements. There's always a lot of tactical SKU moves. In this specific case, you need to also keep in mind that the initial volume we meet are very, very, very small.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Have you changed your brand strategy there?", "Marc Bitzer", "No.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, our brand strategy is really built around consumers.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question, I was hoping just to go back to raw materials for a moment. I don't believe you've quantified what the full year expected headwind is now at, and I was curious if you could do that. Because obviously, it's I think one of the key drivers to the reduced guidance. And as part of the raw material conversation, I understand that certainly, a big issue of this is just how it works through the system and again, some of the hedging. But as mentioned earlier -- I mean, at this point, you have cold rolled down 20% from year earlier peaks. You obviously have oil and other materials down as well. Why wouldn't that necessarily be a little bit of a tailwind in 2012?", "Roy Templin", "Michael, this is Roy. Let me first of all answer I think the first couple parts of your question. First of all, our full year outlook continues to be $450 million to $500 million as it was last time we provided guidance. So there's been no change in terms of the full year outlook. And I think Jeff gave a thorough response to David's question, maybe a little more mathematics behind it for your perspective. If you look at local corporations sort of quarter in, quarter out; period in, period out, if you look at what we have in the way of fixed contract, what we've protected through cash, collars, hedges, et cetera, what you find, Michael, is about 60% is covered with some kind of derivative or fixed contract, and the other 40% is floating. So to build on all of the things that Jeff said from a mathematical perspective, those are the numbers behind how much is fixed and how much floats and is variable.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And Michael, your second question, I think that -- general discussion about weak demand levels and high inflation don't tend to go together, but that is the environment. And that's what it's been. And we're not prepared to talk about 2012 yet. As I said, we will in early February. And candidly, there's a lot of discussions and negotiations going on between now and then too.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate it. The second question, just to hit back on some of the anti-dumping, the preliminary ruling there, can you give us any sense of ultimately what that means on a practical basis in terms of the market? I understand that obviously, there's some tariffs that would have to be put in place if prices aren't raised by some of those parties. What does that mean on a practical level? I mean, do expect there just to be some further price increases then or price adjustments by the competitors? Would there be a reduction in the volume of those competitors if they don't necessarily act immediately? Or would this alternatively be just more tied up by more litigation in the near-term?", "Marc Bitzer", "Michael, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me first try to answer question to -- first of all, what is factually happening. Okay? What's factually happened is as of next week, a number of importers, Samsung and LG being among them, will be liable to pay dumping duties if they fail to set U.S. wholesale prices to fair value. So they basically have to submit bond basically. That is what's going to happen factually. What will also happen in the course of March, April and the final announcement in 2012 is the final determination which is based on the formal in-depth order by the DOC, which will reveal a lot of -- full picture. So that's what's actually happening. What different players will do in the marketplace, from my perspective is pure speculation at this point. I can't say how they will deal with that, and that somewhat needs to be seen and that needs to be viewed in subsequent months.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes. And just to be clear also -- so the period that this begins is next week, is November 2.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right. So that would effectively be addressed by the posting of a bond, and I guess we'll get the final determinations late 1Q?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "No, we're in May. I mean, there's a public schedule by the agencies, which give you exactly the process and the dates. In fact, it should be on our press release yesterday.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "No, no, it is. I appreciate that. One last one, if I could, the pension expense that was reiterated, any initial thoughts in terms of -- is that type of a level something that we can expect, the contribution level over the next few years? I know you didn't necessarily want to talk about guidance, but given all the changes in -- market assumptions and return assumptions, if you could have any comments on that front would be helpful.", "Roy Templin", "Sure, Michael. I can't go fully into 2012, but I can give you perspective here. Our defined benefit pension expense this year will be roughly $28 million with the expense next year, what can we give you[ph] a finite number will not be significantly different than that number. So the first part of your question on expense, you should expect next year to be very similar to this year. From a funding perspective, we're going to end up funding just under $300 million this year. If you ask me to estimate, while it's not perfect, what we'll fund next year, I would guess it would be approximately $250 million. So down about $50 million from this year.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Josh Pollard with Goldman Sachs.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "My first question is for Mike Todman on Brazil. I want to understand everything that's really going on there. You're talking about production cuts in Latin America, which is not something that we were expecting. Electrolux, about an hour ago, said that the market was up 4%. You said that your volumes or your shipments were down 5%, and your margins are right around that 7% level x, BEFIEX. Should we be thinking about this as a 7% margin business until something changes on the demand function? And where do you feel like your share is headed?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, let me comment -- first of all, address the first piece of that. What I said to an earlier question is actually, when you look at the core 3 products, we actually saw an increase in our sales of around 5%. Where we actually had some decreases, which we elected to, is in microwaves and air conditioners really at the low end. So Josh, that's where we made the adjustments that we needed to make. And I feel very good about kind of where and how we're positioned, if you will, in the marketplace on -- in terms of both our competitiveness and our ability to maintain our share. So I'm very comfortable that in the 4 categories, we've done that.", "Roy Templin", "Yes. And in fact, Mike, if I can, just so Josh -- just so you're not confused, the 6% reduction takedown that I referenced earlier, and again, I've mentioned that's a global number. And so Mike is exactly right when you look at production in the Latin America region by itself, production is in fact up year-over-year. It is not down. Okay, just for clarity.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's very helpful.", "Michael A. Todman", "And I guess the other part of your question is our operating margins. And actually, what we saw, even if you strip out BEFIEX, our operating margins went up. They were around above 8%, okay? So not at 7%. And what we have done is we've executed some price increases in the marketplace already, and we're beginning to see the positive effect of those. So we expect that our margin will continue to improve throughout the business.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Josh, I'd just add -- the only other color I'd add to that is we're still very positive at our Latin America business. It had spectacular growth. We don't see easing of growth for shorter periods of time as a bad thing, given some of the inflation that's going on in those markets. But the general trend has been and I think continues to be up. There's a lot of talk about what's going on in the Brazil market. I guess there's a lot of clarification we can add to that, but the point is we feel very good about our position. We have implemented price increases in Brazil. That was a conscious decision given all the inflation there, and actually feel very good about our business there.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. I'd love to discuss with you guys how you get to the 8% plus when -- maybe after the call if you guys have some time. My second question is around cash flow for 2012. I'm just going through a couple of line items between the Brazilian cash settlement, the pension contribution that you mentioned a few minutes ago, the cash restructuring that you guys outlined and then the makeup of your CapEx of roughly maybe being flat next year. I get cash, sort of cash obligations, just from those 4 buckets of about $1.4 billion next year. I'm wondering, am I off on that? I'm trying to understand how you guys get to cash flow positive next year when you add that and also consider the debt that you have due in '12.", "Roy Templin", "Josh, it's Roy. Well, first of all, no, I don't think you're off in terms of assumptions you're making with respect to the payments for next year. Again, I mentioned to Michael what we think pension funding will be -- you're exactly right. We do have a softer payment, and we have some significant outflows next year. But what we haven't talked about yet, and unfortunately, what we can't talk about on this call because we're, quite frankly, just not prepared, is all the other components of operating cash flow. In particular, the delta and cash earnings when you look year-over-year to next year, et cetera, what we're going to do with working capital. And when you see that side, then I think the story will come together better for you. But in terms of have you identified some big cash outflows next year that we are in fact seeing as headwinds in cash flow, yes, we have.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the last -- if I could sneak one last one in, on the promotional environment. You guys made -- mentioned that it would be better. I'm just comparing and contrasting that with the comments that we heard from Electrolux about an hour ago that they expected to be equal, if not worse, and a pretty big player here in the market. I'm wondering just what gives you the confidence that the promotional environment would be better this year? I just really want to understand if there's something different about the sales environment or about the pricing or competitive environment that would suggest to you that the promotional environment could be better this holiday season.", "Marc Bitzer", "Josh, It's Marc Bitzer. I was referring to our promotion plans for the holiday period. And the big difference on our plans versus last year, last year, most of promotions were in the ballpark of 10 to 20 days. Right now, we're talking more about 6 to 10 days maximum. So we roughly cut our promotional window, if you want to say so, in half. It also means, with our promotional price investments, which we've put in to the holiday period, is roughly half. We are a very significant part of the market, and that's what we can tell as far as actions. I can't comment on any competitors' actions for the holiday period.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes. And Josh, and in fact, we talked about this last quarter is that we, given the high material cost, given the fact that we were -- we had announced and now implemented price increases, given the fact that this is a highly replacement market, that's what drove the decision making we had around our own plans.", "Marc Bitzer", "And Josh, it's Marc Bitzer, just to add also on this one. Maybe that explains our own reasoning. In hindsight, if you look at specifically promotions windows around Labor Day or July 4, the typical lift which we saw in the market from promotions in the market was a fraction of the past. That's why you just don't get where -- we don't expect any return from promotional investments, and that's our decision.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Can I sneak one last one in?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes. Last one, Josh.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "All right, I promise this is the last one. From a strategy standpoint, it seems like between your production cuts, the focus on not being as promotional last year, that you guys are taking on a strategy to be more profit-focused over market share-focused. And I recognize that you don't always have to make the decision one versus the other. But given the industry dynamics, it seems like that's one of the decisions that has to be made. Are you guys leaning more -- if having to choose between those 2, are you guys leaning on the side of profit margins? And if you just want to talk about any initial plans for that $350 million?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Josh, let me wrap that up. I wouldn't call it strategy. I would say, if you look at the margins and the profitability that we -- yes, I tried to be very clear about that. Our #1 priority has been operating margin. With the material cost increases that we've seen, we're not overly interested in selling appliances for a loss. So that's not really  strategy, that's just value creation. And so our strategy is to drive innovation, drive great brands and get appropriately paid for those products. And so even in our restructuring plans, that's why we focused on taking high-cost capacity of low-profit segments offline, because we didn't see a near-term path to create value from that. So listen everyone, I appreciate you joining us today. Thank you. We look forward to talking to you next time.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference.

Fourth Quarter and Year End 2011 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Jel[ph]", "Unknown Executive", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corp. Fourth Quarter and Year End 2011 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investor section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corp's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q as well as in the appendix of the presentation. ", "Turning to Slide 2. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 37 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. With that let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Earlier this morning as you saw, we released our fourth quarter and yearend financial results. And I'd say to sum up Q4, we did exit the year with good momentum coming from improving price/mix, significantly lower inventory levels and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. With these positive trends, we are well-positioned for margin expansion, earnings growth in the coming year. Turning to Slide 4 we'll talk about our full year results. ", "In 2011 we reported annual net sales of $18.7 billion, up 2%. Our GAAP net earnings per share were $4.99 compared to $7.97 in 2010. And as we discussed quite a bit last year, we did have higher material and oil-related cost which came in at approximately $450 million and that significantly impacted our results last year. ", "Turning to Slide 5, you'll see a recap of the actions we previously discussed that we're focusing on to improve our operating results. As we expected, the global conditions remain challenging particularly driven by Europe, which is driven by the Euro debt concerns. However, we have made substantial progress on the actions, which we outlined last October. And those were to improve our operating profitability, to reduce our fixed cost structure, to realize previously announced price increases and to continue to deliver a very strong cadence of new product introductions. And these actions already have began to yield results that you see in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, our North American region delivered a 2x margin improvement year-over-year despite a 3% industry unit decline. We see the strength of our global brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong consumer preference for innovative new product offerings, and this is driving a positive mix and margin. ", "Our cost reduction and capacity reduction actions which we announced last October are on track, and as we said then, we expect them to yield  $200 million in fixed cost savings in 2012 and another $200 million in 2013. We also continue to drive strong cash flow from our ongoing business operation, which has enabled us to fund a number of legacy liabilities in 2011. As a reminder, these included over $300 million related to a Brazilian collection dispute, $44 million related to antitrust resolutions and $298 million in pension contributions. In total, these legacy items were funded by almost $650 million, but even with these items, we ended the year in a very strong financial position and with $1.1 billion of cash at year end. ", "Also, while we have benefited historically from both U.S. energy tax credits and Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits, we do recognize that this has created some difficulties in evaluating our ongoing business operations. Due to this, we have clearly defined our ongoing business operational performance by showing our baseline operating results without x items which are restructuring, U.S. energy tax credits and the monetization of BEFIEX tax credits. ", "So then turning to Slide 6, looking at just our ongoing business operations, last year our net earnings per share were $2.05 compared to $4.47 in 2010. Our cash from ongoing business operations without legacy liabilities was approximately $400 million last year. ", "Turning to Slide 7 and 8, you'll see our 2012 priorities and how the actions that we've outlined are expected to impact our results. Again, we are focused very strongly on margin expansion, and we expect the actions that we've already taken to have a significant positive impact for the year. We will continue to benefit from the global price increases we took last year as their  benefits carryover into 2012. In addition, we implemented price increases in several large markets, but went into effect at the beginning of January of this year. We also will continue the strong -- the cadence of strong product innovation which will contribute to overall revenue growth, mix and operating profit. ", "Even in the fourth quarter, we have begun the benefits from our cost capacity reduction actions, which will accelerate throughout the year in 2012. And lastly, we still see this year 2012 estimated raw material inflation to be a headwind, and we're forecasting those increases to be between $300 million and $350 million, but we expect to more than offset these costs with our other normal strong productivity activities. ", "Turning to Slide 9, it summarizes our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, globally, we expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world. In the U.S., we expect demand to be flat to up 3%, with the demand primarily being driven by replacement purchases as we saw last year. In Europe, we're forecasting a demand decline of 2% to 5% for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak. We see -- continue to see strong underlying economic fundamentals in Brazil and other Latin American countries and are forecasting demand growth in the 2% to 5% range. And finally, we expect moderate growth of 2% to 4% in Asia this year.", "So taking all these factors into account, our assumptions on the external environment, but more specifically the factors which we are executing and have put in place, we expect to deliver GAAP EPS this year, 2012, in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and overall positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. On an ongoing operational GAAP basis, x-ing out the items I previously described, our guidance this year is $6.50 to $7 per share, and we expect cash flow from our ongoing business operations to be $950 million to $1 billion. So with that, I'm going to turn over to Marc Bitzer for his review and comments on North America.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 12, we realized more than 2x profit improvement year-over-year, which is a clear indication that our previously announced actions are yielding intended results. All previously announced price increases are fully implemented, including the most recent 6% to 7% price increase effective January 1, 2012. As you know, these increases are necessary to mitigate higher material costs. As a result of a cost base price increases, our margins have substantially improved both sequentially and year-over-year. And we are well-positioned to expand margins in 2012. ", "For the quarter, sales grew 1% despite an industry shipment decline of 3%, and margins improved significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period last year even if adjusted for the non-operating supply recovery and curtailment gain. However, raw materials continue to be a headwind for us, and we continue to take actions to adjust our inventory to industry demand. ", "On Slide 13, you see our annual U.S. industry T7 units since 2005. For 2011, the year ended this demand bumping along the bottom at these recessionary levels we saw in 2009. It is clear that replacement is driving demand at this point. Approximately 60% of all consumer purchases are direct -- are replacement purchases. Based on this, we expect North America industry shipments to be flat to up 3% in 2012. ", "On Slide 14, you'll see North America's financial performance in the fourth quarter. Regarding our overall unit volume, we saw our North America unit shipment down 3% in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the U.S. industry decline of 3%. The net sales of $2.6 billion grew 1% from last year, driven by improved product price/mix. ", "Turning to Slide 15, you can see a sampling of our innovative new products that we launched throughout the year. Before I hand it over to Mike, I want to highlight our business priority for North America in 2012 as shown in Slide 16. As Jeff had mentioned, we're primarily focused on actions driving margin expansion. In 2012 we will build upon the positive momentum we saw in Q4, but stable the price/mix, and pricing carryover will continue and pricing would grow with the recently implemented January price increase. The cost and capacity reduction initiative that we introduced in the last earnings call are on track to generate the expected benefits. And we will continue to leverage our strong product innovation and higher-margin adjacent businesses for growth over long-term. ", "Let me close with some comment on the antidumping petition we filed in December 30. We took necessary actions to promote a fair and open global trading system, protect American jobs and to innovate and invest in America by filing antidumping and countervailing due to petitions for large residential clothes washers with South Korea and Mexico. We expect to receive a final determination on this petition February 2013, and a final determination related to earlier open market refrigerator petition in May of this year. While neither investigation is yet complete, we remain very confident about both cases. And now I'd like to turn over to Mike for his review of our international operations.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Marc. I'll begin on Slide 18 with a review of our international business. During the year high material cost and soft demand were global issues, and we saw high inflation and low consumer confidence slow the rapid growth rates in emerging markets. Europe remained the most challenging region from an international perspective as the European financial crisis drove weak consumer demand across the Euro zone. We focused significant restructuring resources and significantly reduced production in the European region beginning in the fourth quarter to better align our cost with industry demand levels and lower our fixed cost structure going forward. We are confident that these actions will positively impact our future performance in Europe. ", "In Latin America as you may know, the Brazilian government declared an appliance sales tax holiday in December. As a result, we monetized less BEFIEX during the quarter. The stimulus program set to expire on March 31 is similar to the program instituted by the Brazilian government in 2009 that drove increased demand in the region and lasted for 9 months. ", "Irrespective of the stimulus program, however, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Latin America business. In Asia, we experienced growth in China, while high inflation dampened consumer sentiment leading to a reduction in demand in India for the quarter and the year. ", "Turning to Slide 19. In the fourth quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $848 million with unit shipments down 4% compared to the prior period. Excluding the favorable impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region reported an operating loss of $32 million versus the $29 million profit last year. Results were unfavorably impacted by weak consumer confidence, higher material costs and significantly lower production to adjust to a weak industry demand in the region and then slightly negative product price/mix. We expect our cost reduction actions, ongoing productivity initiatives and previously announced price increases will have a positive effect on results going forward, and we will return to solidly profitable position this year. ", "Slide 20 shows the summary of our Latin America fourth quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, down 5% from the prior-year period with appliance unit shipments down 4%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 1%. Our demand decline was mix driven. Through pricing actions we purposely reduced our sales of lower end products such as microwave ovens and air conditioners, while maintaining our strong share in the critical categories of washers, refrigerators and cooking. Operating profit totaled $155 million compared to $193 million in the prior year. Favorable product price/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credits, higher material costs, unfavorable currency and reduced production levels. On an adjusted basis, excluding BEFIEX tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $96 million compared to $112 million in the prior-year period. ", "Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 21. Net sales decreased 2% during the quarter to $200 million, down from $204 million in the prior year period with flat unit shipments. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 4%. The region's operating profit was $2 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price/mix and volume improvement in China was offset by higher material costs and weak consumer demand in India. ", "Turning to Slide 22, you can see just a few examples of our new products that we launched in 2011. We have innovative product launches in every major category around the world. ", "Turning to Slide 23. We are focused on executing the margin expansion actions already in place. We expect to benefit from: one, our previously announced price increases in every region of the world; two, cost and capacity reduction initiatives in Europe; and three, ongoing productivity programs. Overall, we are well-positioned for a solid performance throughout the year. Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 25, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our fourth quarter results. While we did have significantly improved year-over-year price/mix during the quarter, our sales declined approximately 3% to $4.9 billion, primarily due to lower industry volume and the impact of currency. Excluding currency, sales were down 1 point on global unit volumes, which decreased 3.5 points from the prior year. Raw material and oil-related costs continued to be a headwind during the quarter, and given industry demand trends, we significantly reduced production to align inventory with the current demand environment. Overall, we ended the year with $2.4 billion of inventory, which is $700 million lower than where we were in June and more than $400 million lower than December last year. We are very well-positioned with our inventories entering 2012.", "Based on volume and product mix, we monetized $59 million of BEFIEX credits compared to $81 million in the prior year, which was lower than expected due to the tax holiday that went into effect on December 1 in Brazil. For the year, $266 million of credits were recognized. ", "Turning to the income statement on Slide 26, you will note that our operating profit was up slightly from the previous year. Results were positively impacted by continued improvement in price/mix and cost productivity. Higher raw material cost, lower production to adjust inventories to weak global industry demand and lower monetization of Brazilian tax credits adversely impact the results during the quarter. Results also included significantly higher restructuring expense at the benefit of $96 million from a previously disclosed supplier recovery and benefit plan curtailment gain. ", "Turning to Slide 27, you'll see that the income tax benefit we recorded in the quarter was primarily the result of recognizing approximately $110 million of energy tax credits. For the year, $366 million of credits are included in our results. As a note, it's important to point out that the energy tax credit program in the U.S. was not extended into 2012. Primarily due to the conclusion of this program, our 2012 effective tax rate will be in the 26% to 29% expense range. We reported diluted EPS of $2.62 per share in the quarter, compared with $2.19 per share in the prior year. ", "Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 28. We reported a free cash flow use of $55 million for the year compared to the generation of $502 million last year. It's important to point out that full year results include approximately $300 million in pension contributions and approximately $300 million for the first of 2 payments related to the Brazilian collection dispute. Specifically, you can see our working capital improvement in 2011 driven largely by significant inventory reductions. I will go into further detail regarding free cash flow from our ongoing business operations in a few minutes. ", "Finally, included within other cash are the pension and legacy legal liability payments we made during the year. As Jeff introduced earlier on the call, our 2012 guidance is shown on Slide 29. For 2012, we expect to deliver diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. As you will note, we are forecasting significant improvement in our ongoing business operations during 2012. To provide further clarity and comparability between both our reported GAAP results and GAAP guidance with our ongoing business operations performance, we have included a table on Slide 30, which I'd like to provide some comments and perspective on.", "I'll first discuss tax credits which have been recognized as a direct result of our operating performance for the past several years and are either concluding or have a limited remaining life. First, you will note that our 2012 earnings guidance does not include any benefit from the U.S. energy tax benefit program given that, that program was not renewed at the end of 2011. Therefore, we're adjusting 2011 results to facilitate comparability between the years. Secondly, over the past several years we have realized BEFIEX tax credits through our operating performance in Brazil. I'd like to provide some detail regarding our remaining credits.", "At the end of the third quarter 2011, $383 million of credits had not been monetized. During the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, we monetized $59 million of credits. Two additional adjustments to available credits were made during the fourth quarter. First, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus the real reduced credits by $24 million. Second, based on changes to government inflation index tables in Brazil, there was a $62 million reduction to future available credit monetization. Therefore, based on credits recognized to date, changes to applicable government inflation factors and currency translation, there's approximately $240 million of future cash monetization remaining. Given that these are near completion of monetizing, we have also adjusted both our 2011 actuals and 2012 guidance to facilitate year-over-year ongoing business operation comparisons. ", "For 2012, our guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BEFIEX credits compared to the $266 million recognized in 2011. As Mike mentioned last December, the Brazilian government announced tax breaks to consumers, which are essentially identical to the program enacted during 2009, which was extended and remained in effect for 9 months. This program significantly reduced the amount of BEFIEX credits we could recognize. For all of 2009, we recognized $69 million of credits. We are modeling our 2012 guidance similar to the previous program. Should the current 4-month program not be extended to 9 months, we would be able to monetize additional credits during 2012 of approximately $150 million. The remaining $60 million balance is associated with court order fees, which will be monetized in subsequent years. In addition to tax credits, we're also adjusting for restructuring expense. As you know in October, we announced the largest restructuring program in company history, which is expected to be completed during 2013 and will provide approximately 200 in benefits -- $200 million in benefits during 2012 and an additional $200 million in benefits in 2013. ", "Slide 31 illustrates that we expect approximately $250 million to $270 million of a restructuring expense in 2012. Our total program remains at approximately $500 million of expense beginning in Q4 2011 through 2013. Finally, during 2011 we had several unusual items including settlement of legacy legal liabilities, supplier quality recovery and a benefit plan curtailment gain, all of which are being adjusted for year-over-year comparability. Taking into consideration all these items as shown on Slide 30, our ongoing operations from our business performance was $2.05 per share. You will note that our 2012 GAAP guidance of $5 to $5.50 adjusted for 2012 BEFIEX tax credits and restructuring expense translates into an ongoing business operation outlook of $6.50 to $7 per share. This represents a significant improvement from our ongoing business operation performance compared to 2011.", "On Slide 32, we highlight the main drivers of our expected year-over-year ongoing business operations performance improvement. During 2012, we expect 2-plus points of margin improvement from price/mix largely driven from material price increases implemented during 2011, as well as new price increases implemented in January, approximately 1 point of margin improvement from restructuring benefits, and we also expect that we will deliver between 0.5 to a Full point of margin expansion from our normal productivity. This includes offsetting approximately $300 million to $350 million of year-over-year material cost headwinds. And finally, higher marketing investment, increased benefit costs and unfavorable currency will reduce margins by approximately 1 point during 2012. ", "On Slide 33 you will note we have $55 million in free cash flow usage during 2011 and our guidance of positive $100 million to $150 million in 2012. It's very important to note that we have significant cash outflows for legacy legal liabilities, which will be largely behind us after this year, and we also have the bulk of our restructuring program cash outflow during 2012. ", "Slide 33 depicts the underlying cash flow we are generating through our operations after taking account the short-life cash requirements. Our underlying ongoing business operations' free cash flow improvement is largely driven by cash earnings, which is a direct result of the components of the profitability improvements I discussed earlier as well as lower capital spending, which is expected to be $500 million to $550 million compared to $608 million in 2011. You will also note that our pension contribution will be $250 million compared to $298 million in 2011. ", "Before I close on Slide 34, I want to discuss our short-term cash flow priorities. First, it's important to point out that our legacy legal liabilities will be largely behind us after this year. Given these required cash outflows, our 2012 cash priorities are: funding the business, which includes capital expenditures and pension contributions; dividends, debt repayment, and as I previously mentioned funding the remaining legacy legal liabilities. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thanks, Larry. Let me sum up our comments today. As I said at the beginning, we are pleased with the momentum that we had coming out of 2011. We are seeing and have seen improving price/mix. Our inventory levels are in great shape, and we have the strongest innovative product lineup we've ever had in our 101 year history. On today's call, as we outlined in October, we talked in great detail about the actions that we've taken to accelerate our ongoing business operations posed to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. We are executing very rapidly these strong actions, and we expect them to continue to improve our operating margins through our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, our ongoing productivity and the previously announced price increases. Again, we're planning for a flat to a slight improvement in demand. We will have raw material inflation in the range we talked about, but we expect to fully mitigate those increases through our productivity. So overall based on these assumptions, we do expect 2012 to be a strong year with ongoing business operations improvement and driving strong shareholder value. ", "So at that point in time I will conclude our formal comments and will open this up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the side of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I'm looking at Page 32 in your presentation. The margin walk that you guys highlight. If you look at the puts and takes, how would you kind of rate the risk of each of these categories? If you could just give us some of that sensitivity to where the concerns are. Obviously I think the pricing capacity is probably a fairly secure forecast, but can you talk about the...", "Jeff M. Fettig", "This is Jeff. Again, this is very similar to what we outlined in October, but I would say this, is that we have already turned around what for over a year was a very negative price margin mix hit to our earnings. And certainly in the third quarter, we have turned that from negative to positive. You saw in the fourth quarter that ramped up very nicely. So we're entering the year with a lot of positive momentum. We're one month into the actions we took at the beginning of the year, and we're very committed to this. As you go around the world, we haven't seen a material impact on our business from a market share standpoint. This is enabled by a continuous strong flow of new product innovation. So we may be losing some business in some areas, we're making it up in other areas. But net-net given our margin levels, with external inflation, we decided early last year, this was a critical initiative that we're very committed to, and we remain committed, so I fully expect to deliver upon what we're saying here, that the cost and capacity is the restructuring benefits. I think, as you know, we have a very strong track record of delivering. I expect the full $200 million that we committed to in October we will deliver this year. The normal productivity of 0.5 to 1 point, I'd say that I feel very good about our actions. The 2 dimensions that affect that of course are raw materials, which sitting here today we feel comfortable with the $300 million to $350 million. That can change either way, and demand, which has an impact on conversion in the factory . So right now, we're very comfortable with what we're presenting, and I would say in any of these, that we have equal upside as we do downside, and we're confident that we're going to deliver this kind of improvement in operating performance.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Ken, just a couple of things to keep in mind as we talk about carryover price increases from last year. As you remember those price increases really started building momentum here in the back half of the year. In fact, in the fourth quarter, year-over-year we had about 3 point improvement. So we're carrying over about 1 point to 1.5 points of price increases in the next year. The second thing to build on,  what Jeff said, if you think of the inventory takedown we had in the -- from the first half of last year to the end of the year, I mean that cost us, I would say from a conversion perspective, at least 1 point, so...", "Jeff M. Fettig", "I'll make one final comment, again, on these dimensions is, one is, the pricing we expect to see to fully reflected in the first quarter onward. Of course, in the second half of the year, we're up against different comps, but for the full year, it really -- has already started, whereas restructuring benefits and productivity will hold follow their normal build that they increase as we go throughout the year.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I appreciate that. Here's a question for Mark. Looking at the strength in  the 4Q margins in North America at 4.1%, which has led to -- connected to what looks like a 3% price gain. Can you talk about rebates and if you held to the 10 to 20 days you mentioned in the third quarter call, and if that discipline of rebates, how that was -- did the retailers followed you, what was their response if there's any confusion on their part? I appreciate that.", "Marc Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc. Let me first clarify so 4.1% margin for North America. The 3% that Larry was referring to pricing was a global number. The North America pricing on a year-over-year has been substantial above that number and has been in improvement on sequential base, which is kind of unusual given what already occurred in Q4, and we feel very good about the pricing progress in Q4 and have been also the subsequent carryover to 2012. Specifically, to your question on the holiday period, and I do appreciate that there has been a lot of reports out there, not all of them are correct, I think pretty much -- it unfolded the way how we expected it during our last earnings call. And the fact that I say it's -- we said there's a high, high amount of consumer direct demand out there and in that market environment we didn't see very strong return investment and promotional activities, and we therefore reduced our investment compared to previous years. That's what we've done, and as a result of it, our pricing has been pretty good in Q4. Our overall promotion period was flatly short in previous year and that's how we managed it. We feel pretty much reflects the way we expected it.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I guess if I could have one last one is that favorable series of ITC rulings. You had 2 petitions so far. One's in a preliminary state of tariffs. How would that flow through results, and how should we look at it? So refrigerators that's already in place. Can you comment on the benefit that you actually saw in fourth quarter perhaps year-over-year realizing the washing machine is still very, very preliminary, but you should have already started seeing that, is there any clarification you can give us?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Ken, basically we're not -- I mean, it's not done yet. As Marc outlined, there is another step of the process, which will be completed by early May. That's when the final determinations are made. I think what you're referring to is the fact that preliminary duties came out at the end of October, so basically [indiscernible] are potentially liable for after that date. So in that standpoint that is true. Our position is, we're not really willing to comment on any changes on that until the case is determined and over with.", "Operator", "We move next to the side of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Two, I'd love some clarification on. One, can you give us the quantification of what price/mix was in 4Q and in total for 2011?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes. I'd say -- first let's say answer your second question -- this is Larry. Price/mix as you recall was down 2 points in the first half. That reversed in the second half, so price/mix is essentially flat for the year. If you look at fourth quarter year-over-year on the margin, price/mix is up 3 points.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "So 3 points in the fourth quarter, 2 points in the back half of the year and then on that same metric, the guidance is 2 points for all of 2012?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, we said 2-plus points.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay. And within this, what's changed, we saw obviously 2010 and into 2011, I guess beginning at 4Q '10 price/mix was pretty bad and now it's changed. And I'm sure you always intend price/mix to be positive. Is there something that's changed from a competitive dynamic or something that's changed in the market that's allowed you to make the progress that here you've obviously aspired to for a while?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Eric, it -- we really have to look at the cycle that we have seen here. It really began in the second half of 2010. We came off of a first half where we saw some -- somewhat ardent [ph] stimulus-driven growth, but good growth in the first half of the year. And then seemingly in the second half, the growth just stopped. And there was a lot of competitive dynamics at every level that drove us into a period of really 12-month period of very negative pricing, and I'm talking largely in the North American business. At the same time, coming into 2011, we, and I believe most companies were negatively surprised about the material inflation that accelerated. So you had basically negative demand, significantly negative pricing and very negative increases in cost. And that had a profound impact on margins across the board. Like I said, we took a decision for ourselves that we would -- given the innovation we had in our pipeline, given the level of margins that were unsustainable, that margin expansion was our number one priority, and we announced price increases early last year in the case of North America, and as we saw inflation ramp up even more, we took a second price increase and announced the third for January of 2012. We think those are the right decisions for the business. We obviously have higher margins to continue to invest in bringing more innovation and value to consumers. We're pleased with the progress. We're satisfied with the innovation that we're gaining, that our market share hasn't materially changed. And that's just the course one, I can't comment about others, but that's the path that we're on.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And the second question, the Latin American business was down 3 or 4% in the back half of '11, and your, I think, guidance is for the market to grow 2% to 5% in '12. I'm curious about what you're seeing in the business or thinking about the business, even the early feedback on stimulus that's just the volumes you're going to turn from contracting in the last 6 months to improving over the next 12.", "Michael A. Todman", "It's Mike. What we did see, and similar to what we saw I would say in the last stimulus program was it actually drove about a 10% increase in the month of December, and we're continuing to see that kind of growth as we turn the page into the new year. So we do see that it's having a positive impact. Again, we don't know exactly how long that program is going to last, but the fact of the matter is it has driven some benefit. The other thing we're seeing is in markets outside of Brazil, we're continuing to see very strong growth in those markets. So we're feeling that this range that we've given is very appropriate.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "The only other comment, Eric I could think about Brazil and Latin America in general is that, not only did we have the stimulus in other words, the reduction in essence, sales tax on certain products. That has reignited the market, but also the government has taken -- they had taken some anti-inflationary steps earlier in the year to constrain demand. They've reversed those. There's a lot of talk of lowering interest rates, so there's balancing going on, and we're seeing a general pick up in total. At the same time, and it's similar to your question I referred to on North America is we did take a strong stance last year, throughout the year on pricing. We have achieved that pricing. We've also taken a strong stance on mix and we've really focused on stepping up the mix, and we're having good results with that.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to the site of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. First I want to rephrase an earlier question if I could. Specific to bottom-out fridges post-October, what did you see in wholesale industry prices and your specific market share?", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam, it's Marc. First of all, let me reiterate what Jeff was saying. Even with French Door [ph] [indiscernible] we are still in the preliminary phase of that entire process. So the final determination of this one is not happening before April of this year. So as long as the final are not out, I would expect that situation to be somewhat unstable. We saw in Q4 a slight increase of French Door prices, but I think it's too early to draw any broader conclusion on this one.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Sam, again, I just add on this, both of the actions that we've taken. We are confident in the submission. We are confident in the process, and we're confident we'll have a positive outcome.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Second question I know people are beating to death the price/mix assumption. I want to look at it in a different way if I could. It doesn't look like you're assuming for any material degradation in demand from the higher prices as it relates to elasticity, yet it seems as though demand, over the past couple of years, has been much more elastic to changes in price than perhaps anybody was looking for. So is that -- is there a reason why you think demand would be still impervious to these prices?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Sam there is, and again I would talk, it's a little bit different around the world. I would talk in the case of North America directly to answer your question, yes, we do think there's a very little relationship between change in prices and demand. And the reason we discussed before is that, that does not mean that there is not affordable products available to consumers. And we generally don't vacate price points, but we changed the value feature for price points, and the consumer who's in the market ever 10 years doesn't really have a preconceived notion about what that value feature content is. So as we've been through this the last 5 years, candidly, I don't think the price increases have any impact at all on demand. In other parts of the world, it's somewhat different. Where you have emerging markets where you're having first time consumers coming in where there is an affordability threshold, then we're a little bit more -- when we -- although we saw up the same need to raise prices, we're also innovating for the masses, if you will, in trying to bring more, let's say, continue to expand the affordability range with the consumers. So it's a little bit different around the world.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Last question if I might. It appears as though assuming that the IPI gets extended into the summer time based on your BEFIEX guidance, would that also assume then that the stimulus would be lasting that long as well? If the IPI actually does expire on March 31, how would that change your vision of Latin America and unit demands for the April 2012?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Sam, we've got the 2% to 5% is Brazil and the rest of Latin America. The rest of Latin America already is at a higher run rate than that. So that -- and that's about 1/3. So the other 2/3 is Brazil. And I would say that short-term with the IPI, I think we're seeing the -- beginning -- December, January we're seeing higher much rates than that. So our balance 2% to 5% for the year, I think, depending on the broader general economic environment, I think whether they extend it or continue it, I think, if they extended, I would frankly expect higher demand. If they discontinue it, I think we're safe in the 2% to 5%, but of course then we'll be able to monetize BEFIEX through IPI. So that's kind of how I look at it.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So it sound like October and November were pretty soft prior to the IPI. I don't know how well advertised the IPI was ahead of time, maybe that pushed some demand into December, but it would seem as though the natural demand would be a little bit lower than the 2% to 5% based on what was happening prior to the IPI.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "A couple things, Sam. I mean, we did see a softness coming out in summer into the fall, some negative comps, but we're also comping up against a big increase the previous year. But you're exactly right with one exception, is that the IPI reduction was not well-communicated in advance. It was -- I mean within 2 days, the government met, they decided on it, and I think it was like the last day of November they communicated it and started December 1. We were prepared to respond to that on December 1, but we saw immediate -- actually an immediate change in direction from demand with that.", "Operator", "We go next to the site of Josh Pollard with Goldman Sachs.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Could you just walk through how much in additional price increases need to occur in order for you to achieve your 2%-plus overall price/mix guidance for '12?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "None.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair. And when you look at the overall number for productivity and cost improvement, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm getting numbers that total about $650 million between the sort of big broad cost productivity program that you guys have run in $200 million, and then the additional sort of \"normal productivity\" that you guys expect in excess of commodity inflation. Can you walk us through just some of the bigger, broader buckets through which that should come, and then give us a cadence over which we should see those benefits for the year?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, Josh. This is Larry. Let me talk a little bit about the benefits that we put in our guidance. We did say through the cost and capacity reductions that, that'd be about 1 point. So if you just use this year's sales that will be $185 million. We said we had $300 million to $350 million in headwinds, but we would more than offset that with the -- and our total productivity in total would be 0.5 to 1 point. So if you net those off together, you're probably talking about $325 million net. If you want to gross up the headwinds, then you've got about $300 million to $350 million.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And then again, Josh, net the productivity is completely over and above separate from the restructuring benefits, which we call out separately.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So if I do that math, I get a negative of $300 million to $350 million from commodities, but over and above that, you guys expect to get a 0.5 point to 1 point, so all in, that looks like that should be a benefit on my quick math of about $465 million in addition to the cost and productivity of $200 million. Am I thinking about that right?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes. Again when we talk about productivity, it's net productivity, meaning that we have to generate enough productivity to offset all inflation, which includes raw material. It includes inflation in emerging markets, salary, et cetera, et cetera. So to net out 1 point, and 1 point is roughly $200 million to net out 1 point with $300 million to $350 million in inflation just on those 2 factors alone, we have to do $500 million to $550 million in gross productivity, and of course we have other inflation. So our gross productivity is in the $800 million to $1 billion range.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then if you could just update us on the cadence for margins for 2012. You guys made some comments about continued improvement as you get through the year. I wanted to see if you meant by those comments that you expect margins to go up sequentially on 1Q, and then if you could talk about how you'd expect those to progress throughout the remainder of the year.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Let me talk in general. I would say we would expect margins to improve sequentially throughout the year and I'm talking about the ongoing business operations, okay? So obviously we'll have restructuring expense, but if you look in BEFIEX, but if you x those out, we would expect margin improvement throughout the year. Historically we've had -- we do have seasonality in our business, Josh, historically 45%, 55% from a volume basis. Due to carryover, our pricing will be more weighted to the first half of the year than the back. Our history, if you look at our history, productivity tends to be more back-end weighted, and the restructuring benefits, I would say, would be more 40-60 but more back-end weighted. And as we mentioned we're assuming that the extension of the IPI tax holiday occurs, so the BEFIEX will be more back-end weighted.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And if I could just plug a last one in there. Pension expectations into the future, you guys sort of called that out as not a part of the ongoing expense, but for how long should we expect you guys to be in that $200 million to $300 million range on cash outflows for pension.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "I think it's a good question and obviously interest rates depend a lot on what we will pay out in any given year, and we're at historically low interest rates. So if rates were to stay this way for the next 4 years we'll pay probably around $200 million on average, but obviously if rates go up that number changes.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "So I just want to follow up on a couple of previous questions. There is no midyear price hike built into your guidance.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "David, we don't talk about any future pricing.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "With respect to the guidance, Jeff, is there...", "Jeff M. Fettig", "No. My comments was that, I think Josh asked the question, and my comment was based on the carryover from 2011 and what we've already announced and implemented that -- it's sufficient to do the 2-plus we talked about. Now regarding future price increases, that's a different discussion, and it's something we don't comment about.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Secondly on the BEFIEX credits, the assumption right now is that the program will conclude March 31. I think you'd indicated -- I just want to make sure I got is correct, but if it were to extend for the 9 months as it did in 2009 that there'd be an additional $115 million, 1-1-5?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes. David, this is Larry. A couple of things. We're assuming -- we're modeling this year's tax holiday program consistent with what 2009 was, which ran for 9 months. So in our guidance we're assuming that carries over in the 9 months, and if you look at 2009, for the entire year, there was about $69 million of BEFIEX tax credits recognized. So we're being very smoothly between 60 and 80.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "David I think if it does conclude as currently prescribed on March 31, and there's no other changes, then we'd have initial up to $115 million more BEFIEX than what we were.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Thanks for that correction. So if I do the math correctly using a 29% tax rate that's additional $1 per share of earnings. Would that take your guidance then up to $7.50 to $8?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Again David if, in fact, the IPI tax holiday is not extended, and we will provide you with additional guidance on BEFIEX. The tax rate you should use would be more of a statutory rate in Brazil, which should be about 34%.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So it's approximately $1 a share. Would that be taking your guidance up by approximately...", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Let's be clear. The $6.50 to $7 x's out BEFIEX.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. How much of the cost savings of the $200 million actually go to the bottom line?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "All of it.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "And then European pricing, Marc -- thanks very much for the specifics on your ASP lift in North America, can you give us a similar assessment for your European pricing?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, David it's Mike. We took an amount to price increase and went out in pricing and it was effective October 1. What we've seen sequentially, we have begun to realize some of that pricing had effect in the fourth quarter. It was up about 2 points from the third quarter. What we're expecting is to see continued, if you will, benefits from this pricing as we move forward into 2012. So we're already beginning to see that as we come into January, but we did see some sequential improvement, and we're expecting that to continue.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Free cash flow guidance for 2012, what's you're working cap delta?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "We ended at 5.1% we've got of cash flow, David, expect some improvement in cash flow, but not to the extent we saw this year.", "Operator", "And for that final question we'll go to the site of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First on the -- I'm sorry to get back to the price/mix, but I just wanted to make sure I understood for 2012. You said before, Jeff, it assumes no incremental pricing, but I was just curious how much of the information, how much of the expectation rather is from 2011 initiatives versus what you've begun to, and certainly you said you've already been able to fully realize a bit what was from the portion from what you've already done in '11 versus what you put into effect in 2012.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, Mike, this is Larry. We have about a little over 1 point carryover.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Second question on the European margins. It's a number that -- and obviously a lot of turnover in the region itself. But the European margin line certainly has moved around a lot this year. Just trying to get a sense of with the material amounts of benefits from the cost reduction program, how much of that would be in Europe, and how should we think about a European margin in 2012?", "Michael A. Todman", "Michael, this is Mike. What we did in the fourth quarter as we talked about, as we took production down significantly, that had a major impact. What we're expecting as we have going into 2012 is we're expecting to see improvement coming from price/mix that we just talked about. We're expecting to see improvement from the restructuring, which we're already beginning to realize in the first quarter, and we're expecting to see improvement from normal productivity initiatives. So I would expect us to see a fairly significant over the course of the year improvement and the European operating margins.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "And I think, Michael, you asked about restructuring -- about a quarter of that benefit is within Europe.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Just one more if I could. Understand [indiscernible] in terms of the lower level of productivity in -- I'm sorry or production levels, which I assumed you also kind of translated into productivity, I was just trying to get a sense of how that negatively impacted North America and European margins in the fourth quarter, and if the rebound in the productivity levels is something that you're capturing in the net productivity gain of 0.5 point to 1 point that you're expecting in 2012.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Michael, again I think the Q4 impact you're talking excess of 1 point due to do the productivity cost take on, actually that will be a good guidance for us going into next year.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, thanks everyone. Thank you for joining us then. We look forward to talking to you next time.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's program.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.", "Joseph Lovechio", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before you begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. ", "Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 36 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. As you saw earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Overall, we had a very strong start to the year as we benefited from our margin expansion efforts and our continued innovation investment. Our previously announced and implemented cost-based price actions, along with our cost-reduction initiatives, have put us on track to deliver our full year 2012 guidance. We have particularly strong operating performance in our North America and Latin America regions. In fact, in North America, ongoing operating business profits tripled year-over-year despite a 10% industry unit decline in demand.", "I think the strength of our global brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong consumer preference for our innovative new product launches, which, overall, is driving very positive mix in many of our key markets. And despite the weaker-than-expected demand, our working capital in the first quarter is at a record low, driven largely by lower inventory levels.", "As a reminder, during our last call, we clearly defined what we call our ongoing business operational performance, which excludes unusual items, restructuring expense and tax credits. You can see our results for the quarter on Slide 6.", "Sales were relatively flat despite weaker appliance demand, unfavorable currency and the effects of a lower BEFIEX monetization. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $1.41 a share compared to $0.64 a year ago with our operating earnings more than double. And we saw year-over-year improvements in our free cash flow from business operations, which we'll discuss in detail later.", "Turning to Slide 7. You'll see a summary of our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, our outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world for the year. However, in different parts of the world, we've seen a slower start to the year, but overall, globally, we see the same demand levels as we originally forecasted. ", "In North America, we're currently seeing demand trending towards the lower end of our previous flat to plus 3% range. In Latin America, in part due to a continuous -- continuation of the Brazilian tax holiday program, combined with strong underlying economic fundamentals both in Brazil and other Latin American countries, after a very good first quarter, we see demand at the high end of our plus 2% to plus 5% range for the region for the year.", "In Europe, we continue to forecast an industry decline ranging from minus 2% to minus 5% for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak. ", "And finally, in Asia, we expect our full year demand in Asia to be at the lower end of our previously stated plus 2% to plus 4% after a relatively weak demand level in Q1.", "I'll now turn to Slide 8, which shows our key business drivers for the year and how they are tracking versus our previous guidance. As I mentioned, overall, we continue to benefit from the already announced global cost-based price increases. As we progress through the year, we will comp against the 2011 global price increases, so we do expect price/mix to continue to be a positive driver of margin expansion throughout the year, but at a lesser rate than we saw in the first quarter. Our restructuring costs and capacity initiatives are on track and these benefits will ramp up and accelerate throughout the year in 2012. In addition, we will continue to bring the cadence of strong innovation which will contribute to the overall improvement in our revenue growth, our mix and overall operating profit.", "And finally, we estimate raw material inflation to be at the higher end of our $300 million to $350 million range, but we still expect to more than offset all this inflation through strong productivity benefits, which will ramp up in the second half of the year. ", "So overall, we're pleased with the very good start in the first quarter. We are -- as we look out through the rest of the year, we believe we are on track to deliver our EPS and free cash flow guidance for the year.", "At this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer for an update on our North America operations.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 10, overall U.S. industry unit shipments decreased 10% during the quarter. Despite a very weak industry demand, our ongoing business operations margin grew to 6.7% during the quarter, up from the 2.3% in the prior year. This is largely the result of our previously announced and fully implemented cost-based price increases and an overall improved product price/mix. ", "It is important to note that our market share is up sequentially, which clearly speaks to the success of our innovation in the marketplace and our flawless execution of the price increases. Raw materials continued to be a headwind for us, and we have announced an additional cost-based price increase effective July 1. In addition, our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives are on track for the region. ", "Turning to Slide 11. Net sales of $2.2 billion decreased 1% from last year driven by an overall unit volume decline. We saw our North America unit shipments down 7% in the first quarter, which is slightly ahead of the U.S. industry decline of 10%. Operating profit reached $151 million versus the $59 million in the previous year. Ongoing business operating profit was also $151 million as compared to $52 million in 2011, which means we nearly tripled our operating margin.", "Turning to Slide 12. You can see just a few examples of our innovative cooking product launches. You also see a picture of our new Cleveland, Tennessee manufacturing facility. The facility officially opened early this month and includes a state-of-the-art production facility and distribution center and will be the largest premium cooking plant in the world. ", "As demonstrated by our improving market share, despite our cost-based price increases, it is clear that our innovation is a competitive advantage and key to our success in the marketplace. We have a strong cadence of new product innovation planned throughout the year. ", "I want to highlight the progress we've made against our business priorities for North America during the quarter as you can see on Slide 13. As mentioned before, we have successfully implemented our cost-based price increases, but the cost and capacity reduction initiatives as well as our ongoing productivity programs will ramp up during the second half of the year and are on track to generate the expected benefits. We were also able to leverage our strong product innovation during the quarter, realizing not only sequential margin improvements but sequential share gains.", "Now before I turn it back over to Mike, I want to take a moment to address the recent ITC decision related to our bottom-mount refrigerator antidumping petition. We know the fact clearly demonstrated that bottom-mount refrigerators from South Korea and Mexico were being dumped in the United States market. And in March, the Department of Commerce confirmed that, in fact, dumping has occurred, and issued a final antidumping and countervailing duty determination, assigning both antidumping and countervailing duty margins. Obviously, we are extremely disappointed with the ITC decision and we will explore every option, including appeal to resolve the apparent disconnect between Commerce's final determination that dumping is occurring and the final ITC determination that these dump imports did not cause injury to the U.S. industry and their workers.", "In addition, and this is very important, going forward, we will continue to monitor foreign producer behavior in the marketplace. If we see a reversion to the dumping activities that prevailed prior to 2012, we will take all appropriate legal actions. It's very important to know that this decision does not influence the actions that we took last December when we filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions for large residential clothes washers from South Korea and Mexico. ", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Mark. You'll find an overview of our international business performance on Slide 15. We had solid performance in our Latin American region, both within and outside of Brazil. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, up 3% from the prior year period, with appliance unit shipments up 2%. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased 7%. We saw improved price/mix across the region. There was strong demand for T3 products, which include washing machines, refrigerators and ranges. While it was previously discussed, we elected to move away from lower-end, unprofitable microwave ovens and air conditioners. Strong sales and product price/mix gains were partially offset by higher material costs and lower monetization of Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits. ", "As we discussed on the last call, the Brazilian government declared an appliance sales tax holiday in December. The program, originally set to expire on March 31, was extended for an additional 90 days through June 30, 2012, as expected. Irrespective, however, of the stimulus program, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Brazil and Latin American international business. Europe remained challenging during the quarter with continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone. Our cost-based price increases and cost-reduction initiatives are expected to progressively yield margin improvement sequentially throughout the year. In Asia, Q1 industry demand in India and China was lower than expected. China's economy grew at its weakest pace in nearly 3 years in the first quarter of 2012, and inflation in India continued to dampen demand. However, we continue to expect recovery throughout the year as we comp against easier numbers.", "If you turn to Slide 16, you'll see our Latin America first quarter results. Operating profit for the quarter totaled $121 million compared to $174 million in the prior year. Favorable product price/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credit, unfavorable currency and higher material costs. On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $114 million compared to $108 million in the prior year period.", "Turning to Slide 17. In the first quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $688 million with unit shipments down 4% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 3%. Operating profit of $5 million improved sequentially from the $32 million fourth quarter loss, but was down from last year -- prior year of $25 million.", "Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 18. Net sales decreased 3% during the quarter to $202 million, down from $208 million in the prior year period with unit shipments increasing 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 2%. The region's operating profit was $9 million for the quarter compared to $11 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price/mix and volume growth was more than offset by unfavorable currency and material costs.", "Turning to Slide 19. You can see just a few examples of our international product launches during the quarter. In addition to the products you see here, our Bauknecht brand expanded into Hong Kong, allowing us to reach consumers in super premium segment in that growing market. And in Latin America, we've launched the region's first premium front-load laundry pair leveraging our new global laundry platform for Brastemp brand consumers.", "And in India, starting in March, we are launching more than 150 new products during the year across 6 appliance categories, the largest launch in the region's history. The products deliver innovation, designs and features that consumers want and at price points that make the products accessible to every consumer segment.", "In China, as you will see on Slide 20, we established a strategic alliance with the retailer, Suning, expanding our ability to large numbers of consumers through a respected trade channel. As part of the strategic alliance, we have preferential access to Suning's national distribution network of 1,700 retail outlets throughout China and preferential access to fast-growing market segments into China's smaller but faster-growing cities. This relationship demonstrates our strong commitment to the China market. Suning's distribution network, as well as its excellent reputation as a leading electrical appliance retailer in China, make it the ideal choice for this partnership, which is a key enabler to our China growth strategy to become the leading international appliance brand in China and grow our domestic sales to $1 billion over the next several years.", "Turning to Slide 21. You'll see the progress our international business made towards our operating priorities. While demand remains soft in some markets, we are beginning to see signs of growth returning for our business in emerging markets. Our margin expansion efforts are on track through improved price mix, productivity and realizing the committed restructuring benefits. And lastly, we are supporting our business with a strong year of innovation, which is driving the growth and price/mix improvements we are seeing across the company.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by putting into context our first quarter performance relative to full year guidance. During our last call, as shown on Slide 23, we guided to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $6.50 to $7. Free cash flow guidance was $100 million to $150 million with our ongoing business cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion. Our first quarter results are well on plan to deliver annual guidance, which we are reconfirming this morning.", "You may recall that guidance reflected essentially flat industry growth for the year and was based on margin expansion, driven from price and mix improvement; restructuring benefits from our costs and capacity reduction programs; ongoing productivity, which we expect during the second half of this year; the loss of material cost headwinds; and finally, we are increasing our marketing investment to support a significant new product innovation we're introducing this year.", "As we discussed on our last call, we expect annual ongoing business operating profit margin to be between 5.5% to 6%. On Slide 24, you'll note that our ongoing business operating profit margin essentially doubled from 2.7% in Q4 to 5.3% in Q1, essentially at the bottom of our full year range. We are very pleased with our margin progression and remain confident in our guidance for the year.", "On Slide 25, you'll note that for the quarter, GAAP EPS was $1.17 per share compared to $2.17 last year. It's very important to note that last year included $1.54 per share for BEFIEX tax credits and the energy tax credit program, which was not extended this year. Our 2012 first quarter results reflect only $0.08 per share from the BEFIEX tax credits. Adjusting for restructuring expense and the previously mentioned tax credits, our ongoing business operations delivered $1.41 per share, more than doubling from the $0.64 last year.", "Slide 26 shows the drivers of our year-over-year ongoing business operations improvement, which was entirely driven by margin expansion. Price/mix contributed approximately 4 points to our margin expansion during the quarter. We expect strong year-over-year price mix for the first half of the year and will begin to comp against last year's price increases during future quarters. Our cost and capacity reduction program is on track and contributed proximately 1 point to margin improvement. We remain confident in achieving the $200 million or 1 point of margin improvement this year as these benefits continue to build throughout the year. And additionally, we expect 1 point of margin improvement from this program in 2013.", "We did generate approximately 0.5 point of margin improvement from normal productivity. Our productivity, consistent with our project pipeline, will build throughout the year and we expect to more than offset material headwinds during the second half of this year. Material headwinds negatively impacted margins by approximately 2.5 points. And as Jeff mentioned, we currently estimate headwinds to hit the higher end of our previous 3 to 3.5 -- $350 million range. In summary, delivering a 5.3% ongoing business operations margin during the first quarter, which is our lowest volume quarter of the year, puts us well on track to achieving our annual guidance of 5.5 points to 6 points. ", "I wanted to briefly discuss 3 items. First, our effective tax rate was 27%, which was consistent with our annual guidance of 26% to 29%. And It's important to note that last year, we benefited from $54 million of energy tax credits. Secondly, restructuring expense was $34 million, up significantly from last year. Slide 29 illustrates that we continue to expect the total expense of our restructuring program to be approximately $500 million through 2013. And as I previously mentioned, we are own track to deliver the $200 million in benefits in 2012 with an additional $200 million of benefits in 2013. Thirdly, BEFIEX tax credits, included in our GAAP results, was $7 million compared to $66 million last year. The biggest driver of this decrease was a tax break program initiated by the Brazilian government, which reduces the amount of BEFIEX credit we are able to monetize. The program, which started December 1, 2011, was extended an additional 3 months through June 30, 2012. ", "During our last call, we told you that our 2012 guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BEFIEX credits compared to 260 million -- $266 million recognized in 2011. We modeled our 2012 guidance similar to the government's previous program, which was extended to 9 months. Should the current 7-month program not be extended to 9 months, we would be able to monetize additional credits of approximately $45 million. And just as a general reminder, both restructuring expense and BEFIEX credits are excluded from our ongoing business operation results and guidance, along with last year's energy tax credits and other one-time items.", "Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 30. As expected, we reported a free cash flow use of $515 million for the quarter, compared to a use of $336 million last year. These results include the final installment of $275 million related to the Brazilian collection dispute. In comparison to last year, we also had higher pension contributions, higher restructuring cash outlays and significantly lower monetization of BEFIEX tax credits.", "Slide 31 depicts the underlying cash flow through our operations after taking to account these short-term cash requirements. As you can see, we are driving improvements in our cash flow from ongoing business operations as we largely put our legacy legal liabilities behind us this year. Overall, working capital is at a first quarter record low, driven largely by lower inventory levels.", "On Slide 32, you'll see that our 2012 cash priorities remain funding the business, including capital expenditures and pension contributions; dividends; as I've previously mentioned, funding the remaining legacy legal liabilities, which will largely be behind us after this year; and debt repayment. ", "Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, let me sum up our comments today. As you heard, we are on pace  to deliver our earnings and cash flow guidance for the year. Even as we continue to expect flat to slight demand improvement, we are executing very well against all of our key initiatives and remain confident in our ability to meet our margin expansion targets. Overall, we delivered a very strong first quarter, and we expect the full year 2012 to be a very strong year of operating profit performance improvement.", "Long term, we remain very confident in the opportunities that we see to grow the business as we've outlined in Slide 35. In shorter term, we will continue to rapidly adjust our overall business to adapt to changes that continue to take place in the overall global marketplace. ", "So with that, I'll conclude our formal remarks. And at this point in time, I'd like to open it up and take any questions that any of you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] With that, we'll take our first question from the side of Eric Bosshard.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Curious about North America, specifically. You showed good progress with price and units obviously were softer, I think softer than what you would have expected. As you look through the balance of the year, how are you seeing retailers respond to how things played out in 1Q and if you think this is a sustainable situation?", "Marc Bitzer", "Eric, it's Marc. Let me try to answer your question, put it into 2 different buckets: one is the units, the other is the pricing, as you mentioned. First of all, unit. As we reported, units were down on industry shipments, 10%, which is slightly worse than we expected. At the same time, you got to also know that during the quarter, we saw quite a bit of trade inventory reduction, which is, as you know, difficult to peg, but I would peg it at around 3%. So through sell-through about probably minus 7%. And in addition, if you compare to previous year quarter, there was industry inventory build. So you've got to take that into account. With that in mind, we still forecast the full year industry shipments to be roughly flat, which is at the low end of our previous guidance. So that's the unit side. On the pricing, our pricing stuck. But what is more important even is the quality of our pricing because it was not just like-for-like, we also had a very strong mix in our Q1 performance and we see that continuing. So we remain, in fact, very confident at our full year, which is in line with our previous guidance.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "I guess to refine the question a little bit, how are the retailers looking at pricing and promotion? With sell-through down 7% in the first quarter, how are they thinking about the balance between unit sell-through and profitability?", "Marc Bitzer", "And Eric, and as you know, most major retailers, they report their numbers in a month from now. It's a good thing, but I would argue that most retailers see similar benefit as we have. You can sustain a softer unit environment if your price realization for the entire industry value chain is healthier. But it's too early to say that. And at the end of the day, we've got to waive off the retailers' report.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes. Eric, this is Jeff. I would add just maybe to Marc's comments is this is really, as we talked about, particularly at the second half of last year, this is a replacement market. As we look through the data and see the type of purchases, it's not a discretionary market due to where consumer confidence is now. If you look at the retailers that have reported over -- at this point, the smaller retailers, the ones that are doing well are expanding their margins. They're benefiting from -- they understand that it's a replacement market. They're benefiting from margin improvement and they're getting comp store sales increases because of those higher revenues. And that's something that, I guess, as you think about it, being a fundamental replacement market is easy for them to understand.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "I guess following on to that, you commented that you thought price/mix would be the most favorable in 1Q and would ease a little bit 2Q to 4Q. It sounded like that was a function of comparisons. But should we be thinking that there's any change or erosion in what took place in the 1Q on the price and promotional change? Help us understand a little bit better if you would.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Eric. No, that is not the case. What  we talked about, the plus -- 4-plus points of price/mix in Q1 year-over-year, it's based on the comparison. As you perhaps recall, we began -- it varied per market, but we started -- we had a very significant price increase in North America, I think, April 1 of last year. So the issue -- it is not an erosion of current pricing or mix, it is a comparison of against the pricing we took last year.", "Marc Bitzer", "Eric, it's Marc Bitzer. In addition to this one, first of all, the 4% that Jeff referred to is globally. North America was north of that number. The other thing is we have announced a price increase July 1 so that is already out there in the market, and we are executing that.", "Operator", "We'll move next to the side of David MacGregor.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I guess just on the price increases, if we could pick up from where you just left off, Marc. What percentage of your current North American revenues will be impacted by that? My understanding is this is going to be a more selective kind of a price increase. I'm just trying to get a sense of breadth here.", "Marc Bitzer", "David, it's Marc Bitzer. We don't communicate the details. I mean, of course, our trade firms make up the price list and that is well out the market. I can only characterize in general terms, it's not in the same magnitude as the April last year one, but it's -- we're serious about this one and we have real mature cost increases, and we'll reflect them in our cost-based price increases.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "And to what extent have all your competitors gone along with this, so far?", "Marc Bitzer", "David, honestly I can't comment on -- you probably need to ask -- sorry.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "And I know it's pretty difficult to -- doing business in Europe right now, but presumably you've got raw materials cost inflation there as well. So how do you go about securing a price increase in Europe if, in fact, that's possible right now?", "Michael A. Todman", "Well, David, as you know -- this is Mike Todman. We announced price increases in Europe and we're in the process of executing them. We actually did see some positive price mix in the first quarter. We expect for that to progressively get better as we go throughout the year. And then we're just being -- we're sticking to and committed to the increases that we've announced.", "Operator", "We'll move next to the side of Michael Rehaut.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First, just going back to better understanding pricing relating to the raw materials. Conceptually, should we be thinking that the price increase announced for July 1 to roughly offset the impact of the higher raw materials, is that a good way to think about it and maybe not just in North America but to the extent that you're trying to do this on -- continue to push price on a global basis?", "Marc Bitzer", "Mike, it's Marc. Let me just comment on North America. The answer is yes. So July 1 is conceptually reflecting the real material cost increases we have, as well as the last 4 ones also reflected a long-term trend of material cost increases.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Michael, the more micro question globally is absolutely we do expect to offset raw material increases in part via price and the other part productivity, not only in North America but around the world. We have already announced in -- either implemented or have announced in other markets in Latin America and India and other places, price increases also where we have high inflation. When you have a high inflation environment, there's really not any other options other than to do that.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, Michael, this is Larry. Just for reference, if you go back to the last 3 years including 2012, we're absorbing close to $1 billion of higher material cost inflation, so we obviously are taking up pricing to recover that.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great, I appreciate that. And just as a follow-up, thinking about margins on a longer-term basis, kind of a two-parter. One, can you just remind us how you are thinking about incremental operating margins company-wide for incremental sales? What is that on an incremental margin basis -- operating margin basis? And if you can also, longer term, kind of walk us through from a timing perspective, the 8% consolidated operating margin goal that you've laid out in the past. I believe on your Analyst Day a year ago, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you were thinking that, that could be achievable by 2015, was it? And if there's just any update on how you're thinking about that playing out.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Michael, this is Jeff, let me take the last part first. Actually the day we had talked back to the -- actually fall of 2010 when we had the Investor Day, we outlined our expectations to drive the business to at least 8% plus operating profit by 2014. And as I said, last fall and in February, our expectations haven't changed. Clearly, last year was a setback, given the environment. But as we announced last October, we took very strong actions with our #1 priority being margin expansions. So this year, based on what we gave in the guidance and what we've outlined in our plans, we expect to be at 5.5% to 6% operating profit this year. We also, as a reminder, will have next year approximately $200 million, which is roughly a full point restructuring benefit in addition to what we get there. And we will continue investing in innovation. We will continue to do the things that we need to do to drive mix and expand margins. But we reiterate, it was our expectations that we'd get to the 8% plus by 2014. Now shorter term, your question, I'll turn it over to Larry.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes. And just to add to Jeff said, Michael, in that guidance, we're not assuming a huge improvement in demand in the global industry when Jeff talks about that margin. And we believe that we have the visibility to get there based on the things that we can control. The question you asked on incremental margin, if you look at our business and the costs that we've taken out over the last several years, our cost of goods sold is highly variable in nature today. And if you look at our SG&A, it's, I would say, split between variable and fixed, so that should help you with your incremental question.", "Operator", "We'll move next to the side of Ken Zener.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "It's too bad the ITC ruling doesn't sync with any logical extension of what dumping damage means. And I'm interested if you guys have a better understanding of what damage to an industry means. But with the U.S. volume down as much as it is, it does stand in contrast to consumer recovery we're seeing in some other durable items, housing, nascent [ph], cars. Can you comment on the apparent disconnect and if in your opinion, how it might be related to price? I know you talked about the absence of elasticity, but it does seem surprising that the volume is not clicking up at all.", "Marc Bitzer", "Kenneth, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me just try to answer that. First of all, on the question as to why it's more -- of more instant [ph] recovering. I would argue without being too much [indiscernible], the rational factors when you look at housing affordability, mortgage rates, housing costs would speak in favor of a faster recovery of the demand, what stands in the way is still consumer confidence, which is still lagging behind. We do not expect a major recovery of consumer confidence until the end of the year. And that will be the center point in terms of when see the industry improving. So I think it's already in the back of consumer confidence, not necessarily the rational factors. They would clearly speak in favor of a faster recovery. The second point of your question, pricing versus demand. As Jeff mentioned before, we're basing our intention in all replacement markets, which historically has been and is now also confirmed is not elastic to pricing. It's just not -- I mean, if you're a replacement consumer, you buy and that is not necessarily driven by if there's a 10% discount or not.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "The only thing I'd add, Ken, is that again on the pricing question, I mean, if you look at our average pricing, all of those are still below where they were 3 years ago. So in a time where we had tremendous inflation, and to reinforce Marc's point, is the business that we are seeing is upgrading the mix. So again, I stick by what we said. I don't think pricing has had any impact on consumer demand in this market. On the first comment of the ITC, Marc really clearly laid out our position. I'd only reinforce 2 points. One is the Department of Commerce conclusively determined there is dumping taking place in this marketplace from those markets at a large magnitude, particularly for our type of industry. The ITC rule was determined whether that was cause of material damages to the industry, and in this case, Whirlpool. And it is unexplainable to us how that conclusion could have been reached and -- but we will not have the public opinion for probably another several weeks anyway. So until we see that, there's really nothing more we can say about it.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Understood. When you guys get that public opinion, obviously, I hope you continue to post it to your Investor Relation page. The ITC, it's -- you can get things from there, but it's complicated. And is there any just broad comments you could make? Because to us it's unexplainable. However, despite your very rational decisions, you have behavior that might undermine your rational decisions. I mean if there's any color you have to add, I think that would be useful. And has there been any Brazilian land development by competitors?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "I'm sorry what was the last?", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Brazilian land development by your competitors.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, we can't give a lot of color right now on this other than a couple of points. One, I think anybody who's followed -- follows trade is as shocked as we were about this decision. I think clearly the people who did the work and came to the conclusion there is dumping, it was crystal clear. So in the end, you have a group of folks who have their discussions and deliberations. And that's where they came out and I cannot add any color to that. I can only reiterate Marc's point that we don't accept that outcome based on what we know. And that we were going to continue every avenue possible on all fronts to ensure that illegal dumping in the United States that impacts American investment and jobs is not acceptable in this global trade -- under global trade law. So Larry, you want to talk?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "And I think you asked questions on developments of new manufacturing in Brazil from competitive perspective. And then there's -- from what we've seen so far, no. There has been no new developments from -- and I think you're referring to Koreans.", "Operator", "We'll go next to this line of Sam Darkatsh.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. First off, I thought, Mike, in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you were walking away from microwave and air conditioning units in Latin America. If true, could you help quantify the impact of that in the quarter on your units? And then also help reconcile -- the guidance for the year for Latin America units, does that include or exclude the walk-away business. If you could help put some color around that.", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, yes, I will, Sam. First of all, we haven't completely walked away. What we have done is on the lower-end, lower profitable segments of those categories, particularly microwaves, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, we've just elected not to sell. It actually, if you look at total units, had upwards of 6 points, if you will, on the total unit sales. So it was fairly significant, but it was a decision that we think makes a lot of sense. And as we look at our guidance for the marketplace, in total, we have included a total T9 as we call it in Latin America view. So it includes microwaves, it includes some air conditioners. It doesn't include some of the other items that we sell.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So we should expect then inferring from your words then that the industry growth closer to the high end of the range less whatever the impact would be, in this case 6 points for Whirlpool units for the year, is that how to look at that?", "Michael A. Todman", "No, actually, let me maybe give you some more specific. If you look at T3 units, in the first quarter, they were up around 20% in the industry. We were up well over that in T3. So if you expand it to the other ones, the industry was up about 11%. And what we said is, right now we've seen this stimulus, if you will, extended the tax holiday through the second quarter. And so that's the only visibility that we have. So we're just calling the industry now up to the high end of our range, 5% and it includes everything, okay? Now the T3, we expect to continue to be higher than that 5%.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "But the 2% to 5% is the T9?", "Michael A. Todman", "That's correct.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Last question, and I'll defer to others. There's been some chatter in the marketplace about Daewoo, specifically, coming up for bid and perhaps your potential interest in it. I understand that there's probably some sensitivities around talking about that specifically. But Jeff, could you talk about your appetite for acquisitions and where it might make sense going forward?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Sam. First of all, we don't comment on rumors. As Larry laid out our priority for the year in terms of our investments, M&A was not on the priority list. And we're very focused on -- we have some great investments in innovation that we're getting, we expect to get great returns on. Funding the business, funding the dividend and pension, paying off legal liabilities, those are our priorities for this year.", "Operator", "And we have time for one last question. For that, we'll go to the line of Josh Pollard.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "There was no change in your guidance post pending what seems like a pretty material piece of business with Suning in China. Is this a relationship that doesn't go into place until 2013? Or do you need to build facility to begin a material ramp? I'm just trying to understand why that isn't having more of an impact on your numbers?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Josh. First of all, in terms of the guidance, we're tracking very well through the first quarter after a very strong start. It's April, and so there was no -- we just felt confident in reinforcing the guidance that we have. The Suning relationship has been built over a very long period of time and it is actually driving significant revenue growth off of a very small base in China. So I don't expect -- it will have a material impact on our China business, but that not -- has not yet grown to a size where that's having a material impact on the total Whirlpool business.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So in other words, you guys already have a relationship with Suning. You...", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, absolutely.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "You went to preferential status. Does that increase your what you would expect to sell to them by 20%, 50%, double it?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "At least double.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And that's a double over 5 years? Or is that a double as soon as...", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, based on where we are now, this year or this year or next year.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. But it's not very significant to your overall business?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Not yet, but it will be.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And when I think about for promotions, we're moving a little closer towards the holidays. I wanted to understand how much you budgeted for promotions last year, how that compares to this year and sort of on a quarterly basis, how you guys think about spending those figures.", "Marc Bitzer", "Josh, it's Marc Bitzer. As you know, we don't give specifics on promotion guidelines several quarters out. I mean, the only comment I want to make, we have said as a key priority, price margin realization is very key. And we will stick within these guidelines, but we will never give specific guidelines on promotion spend per quarter.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. If that's the case, can I sneak one more in?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Sure, Josh.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I want to follow up on the previous question about your volume of 2% in Latin America. 20% was the industry on T3, you guys are much higher than that. T9 was up only 11%. I'm trying to understand the real impact on your business. Are you saying if you would have had all your normal volumes, your volumes would have been up 8%?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes. Josh, again, the T3 refrigerators, washers and cooking products, that is the predominant revenue source in our business. But over the last several years, microwaves and air con, as far as the T9, have grown very largely. But in short, it was a very cool season, so the air con business was down dramatically. And as Marc reiterated and Mike, our -- we had -- our priority was to -- is to expand margins, so we sold a much, much better mix and we didn't sell a lot of units that were low. So I mean, the fact of the matter is, I mean, the simple answer to your question is on the T3, which is the core part of our business, we were up substantial. The market was up 20%. We were up more than that. So the rest of this stuff was basically profitless units that weren't sold.", "So with that, we're going to conclude here. But again, I would just end, again we're very pleased with the progress we've made, thus far, in the year. There are some moving parts, but we feel like the actions we've put in place are going to allow us to deliver a very strong year of operating performance. So thank you for joining us today. We'll look forward to talking to you next time.", "Operator", "And this conclude today's program. Have a great day.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.", "Joseph Lovechio", "Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation.", "Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 34 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release from earlier today, we delivered a strong improvement in our Q2 operating results. We continue to deliver on the commitments that we outlined at the beginning of the year, and we're reaffirming our full year guidance. Overall, I believe we executed well during the quarter and the first half of the year, and our margin expansion initiatives remain on track. In total, these actions fully offset weaker than expected demand, unfavorable currency and material inflation during the quarter.", "Our North America and Latin America businesses continue to perform extremely well. In North America, our ongoing business operating profit more than doubled year-over-year. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are on track to realize the expected $200 million per year cost savings benefit this year. And we continue to see very good -- a very strong price/mix improvement during the quarter, which has been enabled by our innovation, which is winning in the marketplace; our strong global consumer brand portfolio, which is enabling us to mix up our mix; and our continued support of our brands through ramped up investments.", "Turning to Slide 6. Overall revenues for the quarter were up 3%, excluding the impact of currency and BEFIEX, driven by strong product price and mix. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $1.55 per share compared with $0.81 in the prior year, and our underlying free cash flow significantly improved year-over-year from ongoing business operations.", "On Slide 7, you can clearly see our continued positive trend of both price/mix and margin expansion. During the first half, we made very strong progress towards our full year margin target. And we expect to improve our margins to 6% to 7% during the second half of the year and reach our full year operating profit margins of between 5.5% and 6% in line with our original guidance.", "Turning to Slide 8. Globally, we now expect second half industry demand to improve versus first half levels. We have revised several of our regional forecasts on a full year basis. Our full year U.S. industry demand is now forecasted to be flat to down 2% for the year. In Latin America, the Brazilian tax holiday was extended through the end of August. And with this extension, combined with good underlying economic fundamentals throughout the region, we now expect demand growth to increase from our original guidance to the range of 5% to 7%.", "In Europe, we continue to see an industry decline for the year in the range of down 2% to down 5% for the full year. And of course, as you know, the European markets continue to face very challenging macroeconomic conditions, which are impacting consumer demand.", "We are managing our business accordingly with cost and previously announced price actions along with very disciplined inventory management in this weak demand environment. And finally, we now expect full year unit shipments in Asia to be flat to up 2%.", "Slide 9 shows our key business drivers for the year versus our original guidance. As I just outlined, demand was weak in the first half of the year and currencies were volatile and had a negative impact on operations. Raw material inflation was in line with our forecast, and we continue to expect a range of $300 million to $350 million for the year. However, if current raw material trends continue, we would expect this to move towards the lower end of the range.", "We continue to expect to fully offset all of these items with positive price/mix, driven by our cadence of innovation and improving productivities, which we fully expect in the second half of the year. As I mentioned, our restructuring costs and capacity asset reductions are on track, and we will realize those benefits as they ramp up in the second half of the year.", "So overall, throughout the first half, we're on track to deliver our EPS and free cash flow guidance, and we're reaffirming that guidance for the year.", "So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to talk about our North America operations.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance during the quarter.", "Starting on Slide 11. First of all, you see our revenues and margin for the region grew significantly during the quarter as margin expansion is due largely to our previously announced and fully implemented cost base price increases and an overall improved price/mix, which has been now a consistent trend for the past 4 quarters.", "In addition, our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are delivering benefits as expected for the region. And during the quarter, we saw a record working capital, driven by aggressive inventory management, which means we took down production volumes, which had a negative impact on profitability.", "Turning to Slide 12. You see net sales of $2.5 billion increase 4% from last year, driven by favorable product price and mix. Our ongoing business operating profit was $186 million, which more than doubled as compared to $76 million in 2011. Overall, ongoing business operating margin was up more than 4 points year-over-year.", "Turning to Slide 13, you can see just a few examples of our innovative products. The cooking products you see are just a couple of examples of how we are growing our premium cooking business. Earlier this year, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Cleveland and Tennessee to continue to provide the world's most innovative cooking products, including ranges, ovens and cooktops.", "Turning over to Slide 14. While today, we are providing our perspective in second quarter results. It remains important to highlight the significant opportunity while our businesses' underlying industry demand start to slowly improve. Today, demand is at recessionary low levels, and yet we were able to restore operating margins at 8%. And yet, we expect only relatively modest demand growth in the second half. However, we are beginning to see some early but consistent signs of housing recovery, which makes us increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery. And obviously, with operating margins now already at 8%, there is significant opportunity once demand returns to more normal levels.", "And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Marc. I'll begin with an overview of our international environment during the quarter on Slide 16. Overall, we have solid performance in our Latin America and Asia regions. We saw improved product price and mix across our international businesses as we continue to launch consumer-relevant innovations in every product category around the world.", "Europe remained challenging during the quarter with continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone. We took aggressive actions during the quarter. Our cost reduction initiatives for the region are on track, and when combined with previously announced cost-based price increases, are expected to deliver sequential margin improvements and a return to profitability in the second half and into 2013, although the demand environment remains uncertain.", "During the quarter, we saw volatile movements in the global currency markets, particularly in Brazil and India. We continued our disciplined approach to inventory management, and we expect to see some improvement in emerging market demand trends going forward.", "If you turn to Slide 17, you'll see our Latin America second quarter results. Sales were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 8% on slightly higher volumes.", "Operating profit for the quarter totaled $103 million compared to $166 million in the prior year. Favorable product price and mix was partially offset by unfavorable currency and lower monetization of tax credits.", "On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $101 million and approximately 9% of sales compared to $87 million and approximately 7% of sales in the prior year period.", "Turning to Slide 18. As we previously discussed, we have focused on higher margin products in Brazil. As you can see illustrated here, excluding a less profitable category, in this case microwave ovens, our T8 appliance units for our business in Brazil grew 7% versus last year. Our decision to shift the business has positively impacted price and mix and profit during the quarter.", "Turning to Slide 19. In the second quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 18% year-over-year to $692 million with unit shipments down 7% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region had an operating loss of $26 million, down from the $20 million profit in the prior year period. Favorable price/mix in the quarter was more than offset by unfavorable country mix, volatile currency and significant production takeout to adjust for market demand and reduce our inventory levels.", "Today, inventories are in good shape, and we do not expect that to be a headwind going forward as long as demand remains at current levels. We also continue to execute our restructuring plan, and we expect that our actions will allow us to return to profitability in the second half.", "Our second quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 20. Net sales decreased 7% during the quarter to $241 million, down from $257 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 6%. The region's operating profit of $14 million improved sequentially and was essentially flat to the prior year.", "Overall, favorable product price/mix and consumer preference for our new product launches, particularly in India, was offset by volatile currency and unfavorable material cost. In local currency, India achieved record sales and operating profit for the quarter, and this confirms that our consumer-relevant innovation is winning in the marketplace.", "Turning to Slide 21. You can see just a few examples of our international product launches during the quarter. These products show just a glimpse of how we are advancing our global brand portfolio in more than 130 markets around the world.", "Finally, we continue to see tremendous growth potential in emerging markets, where product penetration levels remain low as you can see on Slide 22. Despite the temporary slowdown, we expect to see a return to growth in these emerging markets as more consumers are able to purchase appliances and benefit from the quality and convenience they provide. The potential in developing countries is tremendous if we consider the population and economic growth trends combined with these low penetration levels.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by putting into context first half performance relative to our full year guidance.", "As you recall and shown on Slide 24,  we are guiding to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $6.50 to $7. For the first 6 months of the year, we have earned GAAP EPS of $2.60 per share, essentially the midpoint of annual guidance, and ongoing business operations EPS of just under $3 per share.", "As you know, we do not provide quarterly earnings guidance. It's important to note, however, that our first half earning results are ahead of the plan we established entering the year. These results are driven by our ongoing operating profit margin, which has essentially doubled from the second half 2011. Our run rate continues to support the full year guidance we've provided several months ago, which we are again reconfirming today. Our lower tax rate, which I will discuss in a moment, is offsetting the unfavorable currency impact on our business. Operationally, our EPS guidance for the year remains solid and unchanged.", "As you can see on Slide 25, we continue to expect 5.5% to 6% ongoing operating profit margin for the year, which translates into a 300-basis point improvement. With our first half results on plan and close to the low end of this range, we fully expect margins to continue improving during the second half of the year.", "Let me spend a minute on our year-over-year margin improvement. For the first half of the year, the drivers of our performance have been price/mix, which is up approximately 4 points and is currently tracking higher than original expectations. We continue to expect positive price/mix in the second half of the year. However, we will be comping against prior year price increases.", "Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, which continues to remain on plan. We expect benefits to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year.", "Material cost inflation was approximately $175 million in the first half. And given industry demand levels, we did take actions during the second quarter to reduce production to ensure inventories remained at appropriate levels. The production cuts negatively impacted our conversion productivity.", "As you can see on Slide 25, our second half margins are expected to be, as Jeff said, between 6% to 7%. This sequential improvement is expected to be realized by the combination of improving productivity, given a solid midyear inventory position, higher volume in the second half of the year, productivity program ramp up and lower material headwinds, continued price/mix improvements from recent price increases. And finally second half margins will also benefit from higher restructuring benefits, as well as seasonality of our portables business.", "Now turning to free cash flow on Page 26, and consistent with our expectations, we did have a cash outflow for the first half of the year of $540 million. It's important to note that current year cash flow includes the final installment of $275 million associated with the Brazilian collection dispute.", "We also note that adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved over last year's first half. Now we continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow between $100 million and $150 million for the year. With legacy legal liabilities and the majority of our restructuring cash outlays behind us after this year, we are very well positioned to generate significantly higher free cash flow in the future.", "Let me spend a couple of minutes on our second quarter results, which further solidified our full year guidance, as well as some general topics. But before I begin, as a general reminder, Slide 36 and 37 in the Appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations for both 2012 and '11. Included in this table are second quarter adjustments to drive our ongoing business operations and performance, removing the impact of restructuring expense, BEFIEX tax credits, as well as the impacts from benefit plan curtailment gain, the antitrust resolution, investment impairment and adjustment to normalize the second quarter tax rate, which I will discuss in a moment.", "Turning to the financial summary on Slide 27. Let me make a couple of observations. While reported net sales declined 5%, it's important to note that net sales from constant currencies and excluding BEFIEX credits were up more than 3%. Our ongoing business operations operating profit improved by over 40%, driven primarily by positive price/mix and cost and capacity reduction initiatives, a very solid performance given lower industry demand, unfavorable currencies and higher material cost.", "On Slide 28, I'd like to make a couple of comments. First, prior year GAAP results included the Brazilian collection dispute and antitrust settlement, benefits from energy tax credits, as well as significantly higher BEFIEX credits. These items are presented for your reference on Page 38.", "Second, regarding our 2012 tax rate, in the first quarter, we reported an effective GAAP tax rate of 27%; for the second quarter, it was 4% on a GAAP basis, which is lower than our full year expectations and driven by a timing of our tax planning. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 25%. For our ongoing business operations EPS, our second quarter tax rate is 22%. Now this reflects an adjustment to bring our first half tax rate to 25%.", "Slide 29 illustrates our cost and capacity reduction charges. The program remains on track, and there are no changes from previous guidance. We are on track to deliver $200 million in benefit in 2012 with an additional $200 million of benefit in 2013.", "Let me turn now to the monetization of BEFIEX tax credits, where we monetized $2 million in credits compared to $79 million last year as a result of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. As of June 30, $215 million credits remain. Given the most recent extension to August 31, we continue to expect to monetize $60 million to $80 million this year, unless the program will be extended for a third time. If the program would be extended to the end of 2012, we would expect to monetize $40 million to $50 million for the full year.", "One other item I'd like to note is on May 1, $350 million of 8% notes matured and were repaid. On June 1, we completed a 10-year debt offering of $300 million of 4.7% notes.", "Before I close on Slide 30, I want to review our short-term cash flow priorities, which remain unchanged funding the business, including capital expenditures and pension contribution; dividends, as I previously mentioned, funding the remaining legacy liabilities, which are largely behind us after this year; and debt repayment.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thanks, Larry. Let me sum up by saying that we are pleased with our execution of the strong actions to improve our operating margins for the first half of the year, and we are on track to achieve a record year of margin expansion throughout our global business. And I think it's important to point out that we're able to do this in a period where both in North America and Europe are at or near recession lows in terms of demand and Asia is showing -- showed the weakest negative demand growth we've seen in many, many years.", "But I think looking forward, more in line with our strategy, there are many positives that we're starting to feel better about. We are positive about what we're seeing in the U.S. with housing trends.  We're seeing a foundation beginning to form in that sector, which we think will benefit us over time. We do have significant future opportunities for our business in emerging economies such as China, India and the countries throughout Latin America.", "We continue to see improvements in price/mix driven by our leading global brand portfolio and best-in-class innovation in our product launches, and we do know that innovation sells in good markets and in difficult markets. We will accelerate and we are investing to accelerate our innovation in both existing core business and adjacent spaces to further accelerate revenue growth and increase shareholder value. Our ability to expand our operating margins and the conclusion of the legal -- the legacy liability payments position us very well for generating strong free cash flow in the second half of the year and going into 2013.", "So overall, we're positive about the progress we're making to continue to build our position as a strong global brand and consumer products company.", "With that, I'm going to end the formal remarks and open up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the side of David MacGregor.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I guess I'm struck by data that was out this week just indicating that Lowe's has lost quite a bit of market share year-over-year in the second quarter, and I'm just wondering how that might influence your North American business. And secondly, talk a little bit about how you become a little more retail agnostic, given the concerns about what may ultimately happen at Sears and your recent news -- good news at Home Depot, if you could just help us better understand that.", "Marc Bitzer", "David, it's Marc Bitzer. As you know, we're not typically commenting on specific retailer strategies or issues. And in particular also, I think you're referring to track end data, which is not the only data source in the industry. So I would -- let me just try to answer from a broader perspective. I mean, it's not driven by a particular Lowe's or Sears perspective. We always -- we try to have a very good distribution position of all our brands across the entire country. In that context, that's probably also our Home Depot expansion, where our addition of the local brand fits into. So yes, we're trying to have our brands appropriately represented at many or most outlets in the U.S. so kind of be probably less exposed to an individual up or down of an individual retailer.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, maybe we can continue that conversation offline. As well just in terms of the $200 million cost savings program you have going on, is there anyway to talk about how much of that actually made it to the bottom line or what the contribution to the bottom line was from the cost reductions in the quarter?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Are you talking about the restructuring, David?", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes, I am.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, for the quarter, from a benefit perspective, we had about 1%, which is about $46 million; for the first half, we're about $84 million. So we'll get another, let's call, $115 million plus in the second half. We'll be more weighted towards the second half of the year.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And David, on that, as Larry mentioned, we had very positive PMR. We had positive restructuring benefits. We had negative currency, and we had negative net productivity due to raw material increases and a significant reduction in production volumes as we kept inventories in line. What we think is different in the second half is we think the production adjustments are more or less very well balanced, and we expect productivity turn from a negative in the first half to a positive in the second half.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "So what you're saying, that you don't expect production curtailments to be significant to margins in the second half?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "No, we don't.", "Operator", "We'll move, our next question is from the side of Sam Darkatsh.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Talk about why you're taking your U.S. expectations down in the second half. I think the second quarter came in pretty much what you were expecting, Jeff, and you were talking about some encouraging signs you're seeing in the end markets. So why be more sober on the expectations in the second half?", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam, it's Marc. Let me try to answer that. Again, I think it's more a question of math and just about we took down the full year expectation to kind of -- well, the previous is that -- the previous guidance was 0 to slightly up but there's an emphasis on 0 more, and now we're seeing 0 to a minus 2. Again, that is basically more a question of math. If you would take a minus 2, that basically means the second half grows slightly less than 1 point. If you go to higher part of our range, 0 for full year, that would mean that the second half grew by 4.7%. And I think the truth will be somewhere in between. I also want to take the opportunity to emphasize more -- yes, we're still a little bit cautious about a strong dynamic growth in the second half, but we are more confident about the underlying long-term and midterm demand trends and particularly by the housing, the housing starts, rental market activity, which is the large of consistent signs which made us increasingly optimistic. So I think it's more a question of when as opposed to if.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And Sam, just -- again, if you look at the numbers and the normal seasonality, to Marc's point, so we're really forecasting the second half between 1% and 5% to get to that guidance, which is profoundly more positive than the first half.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And would you expect the second quarter share trends in the United States to continue also?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Sam, first quarter, we were up. Second quarter, we're marginally down. We're stable. As we bring out innovations, we're gaining shares. So overall, share trends aren't big concern right now.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "My second question, you're going to have prodigious free cash flow in the second half of this year and then considerably more in the out-years than you saw this year because of the absence of a lot of costs. Looking back over time, you've had only 3 dividend increases over the past 20 years. You haven't bought any stock back really over the last 4 or 5 years, as I recall. Do some of those type of cash flow uses begin to become much more appealing to you? And how should we look at that prospect over the next 6 to 12 months?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Sam, for this year, Larry outlined our 4 priorities, and we've been executing to them all year and will continue to do so. As we get out of 2012, and I'm not here to talk about forecasting 2013 or beyond, but I would go back to the same list where clearly we regularly, with our board, sit down and review cash allocation. And certainly, as we get these legal liabilities behind us and we're generating -- our run rate from operations is very strong and will improve with earnings growth and, certainly, return to shareholder would be something we'd evaluate.", "Operator", "Let me turn to the next question from the side of Ken Zener.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Two things. I want to focus on U.S. demand as it relates to new construction first. Can you talk about how the competitive dynamics might be or are different there versus the retail channel based on your distribution capacity? So I think you and GE are more focused there versus retail where other competitors easily service that.", "Marc Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, and once again coming back to the housing, when I refer to early signs of housing recovery,  we're still talking about very low levels. But I think what is encouraging to see is that now start significantly out paces completions, which just is already in the 6 to 8 months a better perspective. Inventory is coming down. And I don't think we should underestimate the dynamics of the rental market as a catalyst for the overall housing market. There's just a lot of positive signs. I think without getting too much specific, and as you may often know the market share data on this what we call the building channel are not very well documented. But I would just argue, we have a very strong position in that channel. And in particular, over the last 2 or 3 years, through the gains of some fairly large long-term contracts, I think we're certainly better positioned coming out of the recession than we were coming into the recession.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And Ken, your basic question is correct. There is a very different market share structure in that channel than there is the retail channel.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Can you talk about -- you talked about lower volume impacting margins, all else being equal. Was that -- -- excuse me if I missed it, was that in the order of, let's say, 150 basis points in terms of gross margin or how would you frame that?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "I'm sorry, Ken from the...", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "From the lower volume, how that impacted your margins, excluding cost and pricing, et cetera, what that absence will be in the second half or the headwind in the first half?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, I'd say versus our expectations for the year, I'd say we expected, if you did the math, that overall industry volume would be flattish in our original guidance. And now I'd say you'd probably see it down 0.5 point in the industry. So from a production perspective, I'd say that costing is about 0.5 point.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And they were referring to North America, is that correct?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Actually, globally. We had to take out a lot of production in Europe and also North America.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, yes, I would say it was most profound in Europe, secondly in North America.", "Operator", "We'll move next to the side of Michael Rehaut.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question, just on Europe, I was hoping to dig in a little bit there. The revenues -- I thought you said that you benefited from price/mix, but I thought the units and revenues declined both 7%. So I was a little confused there. And also -- I was wondering if you could also go into a little bit more detail in terms of the return to profitability in the back half, if that's more driven by just maybe the year-over-year declines not bad as -- this is a pretty low watermark for revenues or if there are -- maybe you can describe the timing of the restructuring benefits.", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, Michael, this is Mike Todman. First of all, just addressing the first point, we did have constant currency 7% decline in our sales, which was equal to our unit shipment. But our country mix is less favorable, if you will, or more geared towards those markets that were more negative, and so that impacted us overall in terms of our European performance. Secondly, what we did in order to respond to that and respond to the demand environment is we significantly reduced our production in order to get our inventories in line, and so that is not something that we expect to see reoccurring in the second half. And therefore, that negative should go away as we come through the second half, and that's why we feel pretty confident on returning to profitability.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And in addition, price/mix should continue to improve as it has been, and you will see it. And restructuring benefits will ramp up and then, of course, what Mike said, will show up in productivity.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Secondly, in North America, you've made great progress there, and the ability to execute the price increases have obviously been huge in driving that better performance. Are there any price increases scheduled for the back half of the year? How do you think about pricing, let's say, on a go-forward basis? I know you're not going to be giving -- you don't give guidance per se. But on a go forward, now that you've got profitability in this 7% to 8% range, is further -- maybe thinking about bigger picture, further expansion more purely going to be driven by just volume and mix? And also, how much within North America should we expect the restructuring benefits to apply down into the North American segment in 2013? So few parts to that question, I apologize, but...", "Marc Bitzer", "Mike, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me first try to address some of that. First of all, it's a pretty good point, as you highlighted, we are back to this 8%, which is a number which we communicated in the Investor Conference, and that's in a recessionary environments. So that's a good starting point. What I want to point out on the price increase, first in the past, first of all, I do believe we had a very, very strong execution in this one because it's not just in this price increase we managed our mix very well, which is typically something difficult to maintain once you go up with price increases. As you know, and we made that statement several times in the past, we simply cannot comment on any forward plans. We are, as a company, focused on the margin expansion and that's our course, and that's a course which we will stay on.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And Mike, I would add to that. We talked about our restructuring activities. We'll get $200 million of benefits to our P&L this year, and we fully expect another $200 million benefit to our P&L next year with the completion of these activities of which these will largely fall in North America and Europe. The second thing I would point out is that through our innovation, we continue to invest significant both capital and R&D. And we get -- on our innovation projects, we do get margin i.e. mix upgrades from that. So I guess the way I would put it is that if you look at demand, if you look at price/mix, if you look at restructuring, if you look at ongoing productivity, those are all the levers that we're focused on to drive and expand our operating margins both in North America and around the world. Some have a bigger impact during different periods of time, but we're very focused on -- we're not satisfied with today's margin levels. Anywhere in the world, we're very focused on expanding those margins.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "One last quick one, if I could, just the tax rate for 2013. How should we think about that, given some of the changes this year?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, I think, Michael, what we said before, we're -- from a guidance perspective, we'll provide that in -- when we release our fourth quarter earnings. But certainly from a normalized basis, mid-20s to high 20s will be the range that we'd be looking at, probably closer towards the mid-20s.", "Operator", "And we will take our final question, this one from the side of Joshua Pollard.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Let me start with Brazil. I'm trying to understand how much of your 1.7 points of margin improvement came from getting out of the microwave business, ultimately trying to split the organic versus inorganic changes in your margins there.", "Michael A. Todman", "Well, Josh, I won't split up specifically that. But clearly, getting out of unprofitable businesses has a positive impact to our overall margin. But having said that, we also had positive price/mix in the rest of our business in Latin America and our business grew. So really, all of those are contributing to the improvement in margin.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "As well as yield, as we talked about throughout -- really beginning last year at this time, and we have announced and implemented selective cost-based price increases almost throughout our entire range over the last 12 months. So that's showing up positive mix from innovation. And to Mike's point, the absence of selling -- a significant part of that microwave business is well over half is loss making, and  we've chosen not to participate in that.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes. I'm just wondering is it a big benefit? I can't tell if the 8.8 that you got -- could you say that again?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "It's material.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Immaterial or material?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "It is material.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. My second question is in what areas should we expect the $115 million of remaining productivity gains from your cost program to flow through? I mean, it seems like the areas where you guys are expecting the most improvement in the second half is in your Europe margins overall, but I'm also noticing that your SG&A is up almost -- is up 5% to 7% or almost $40 million year-on-year in the second quarter. Can you talk about what areas investors should expect to see the reductions from your cost program?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Josh, this is Larry. A couple of things from an SG&A perspective, we did guide at the beginning of the year that we would have a higher SG&A for the year. And a part of that has to do with the higher employee benefits, the other part has to do with just increased investments in advertising and consumer support. From a productivity perspective and the balance in the back half of the year, a couple of things to keep in mind is one is that the second half volume for us historically, and will be this year, is higher volume. And we just mentioned, for the second quarter, we took out a significant amount of production. So you don't have the same headwinds from a conversion perspective as you did in the first half. Our inventories are in very good shape, so we'll have higher volumes in the second half of the year. From a productivity perspective on some of the programs, our cost change programs ramp up throughout the year. We've got programs going within the distribution network. Material content is within cost change. So things like that are what kind of builds throughout the year. And then along with that, we have restructuring we said was more back end weighted. So those are some of the things that help us improve our productivity in the second half of the year.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And Josh, you'll see the lion's share of that in the gross margin.", "Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then if I can sneak one more in. Commodities at current levels, I'm not calling it guidance by any stretch of imagination, but how much of a benefit could you see in 2013? My simple math is you guys went from the high end of the range at the end of 1Q to the low end of the range at the end of 2Q. If you assume that $50 million, that you saved over a quarter, annualize that, could it be $200 million or is that thinking too big?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Josh, in February, we gave our guidance of $300 million, $350 million. At the end of April, we actually guided towards the higher end of the range because things were moving strongly in that direction. And we're reaffirming our guidance for the year now and said that if current trends continue, it could be towards the low end. So I mean, even within this period, there's quite a bit of volatility. It's just too early for us to give you any kind of outlook for 2013. There's a lot of moving parts as you very well know in raw materials. And as we get late in the year and that's -- or actually early next year is will be the earliest that we give guidance for 2013.", "Well, listen everybody, thank you for joining us today.

For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.", "Joseph Lovechio", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 41 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for joining us today. As you saw in our earning release from earlier this morning, our actions in 2012 have delivered a record year of margin expansion. If you recall, in October 2011, we outlined several business priorities and accompanying actions that we said we would execute throughout 2012 to improve our operating margins and lower our fixed cost. These included realizing cost-based pricing actions, an increased level of new product innovation driving enhanced mix, reducing our fixed cost structure and delivering ongoing cost productivity from our global operating programs. And as a result, this last quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin expansion and, for the full year, generates strong levels of underlying free cash flow. These actions and this momentum, combined with favorable trends that we see in U.S. housing and growth opportunities that we see in emerging markets, have created positive momentum as we have headed into 2013.", "Our full year results are summarized on Slide 6, and you'll see overall revenues were up approximately 3%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX, as our strong price and mix continued throughout the year. And in line with our previously increased guidance, diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved $5 per share to $7.05 for 2012 compared to $2.05 in the prior year.  Our underlying cash flow generation from ongoing business operations also improved significantly year-over-year by over $550 million.", "Turning to Slide 7 and 8, we highlight our business priorities for 2013 and how we expect them to impact our results. These priorities are well aligned with our long-term growth strategy and build upon the success and the foundation we've built in 2012.", "For the year, we expect our ongoing business performance and margins to continue to improve as we launch new product innovations, accelerate growth and higher-margin adjacent businesses, continue our expansion in emerging markets, realize additional benefits from our cost and capacity reduction initiatives and execute our ongoing cost productivity programs.", "We believe these positive drivers will more than offset the expected increases in material and oil-related costs. We also expect to see positive global demand, as we outlined on Slide 9. In the U.S., we expect demand to be up 2% to 3% for the year, as we are increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery, and we do continue to see very positive trends in U.S. housing.", "In Brazil and other Latin America countries, we continue to see strong underlying economic fundamentals, and we're forecasting demand growth in the region from 3% to 5% for the year.", "In Europe, we're forecasting a flat industry for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak within this still challenging economic environment.", "And finally, we expect a modest recovery and modest growth of 3% to 5% for Asia across the region for the full year.", "Finally, turning to Slide 10, we continue to execute these actions to expand our margins with enhanced price/mix through innovative products and our cost and capacity reductions. Combined, these actions, along with the revenue growth, we expect to deliver GAAP EPS in the range of $9.80 to $10.30 per share and overall positive free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million.", "In our ongoing business operational guidance for 2013 is $9.25 a share to $9.75 per share, and our cash flow from our ongoing operations is forecasted to be $950 million to $1 billion.", "So at this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our North America operations.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing North America's performance in the fourth quarter, starting with Slide 12.", "Our consistent and disciplined execution of the actions we laid out last year resulted in the fifth quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin improvement. And our operating margins exceeded 9% for the quarter. A continued investment in innovation and a strong market execution drove a significant part of the improvement. Cost productivity was also a positive driver as we more than offset material cost inflation in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to Slide 13. Net sales of $2.5 billion decreased 3% from last year as a weak economic environment continued in the U.S. amid uncertainty with government policies. Concerns over consumer reactions to the fiscal cliff loomed during the month of December, and retailers responded by maintaining low inventory levels, resulting in lower industry selling during the quarter.", "As we have previously stated, our priority has been and will be margin improvement. We have increased our balance of sale in the higher-priced segments across most products, driven by innovation as evidenced by our very strong positive mix.", "Ongoing business operating profit was $233 million, which more than doubled as compared to $106 million in 2011. Overall, ongoing business operating margin was up over 5 points year-over-year.", "In addition to a very strong price and mix improvement, the year-over-year progress was, to a lesser extent, driven by the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, as well as our ongoing cost productivity program.", "Turning to Slide 14. You can see just a few examples of our innovative products. The small domestic appliance you see here is just an example of how we're growing our adjacent businesses.", "Let me take a moment and talk briefly about North America in 2013 as shown on Slide 15. We will remain focused on actions driving margin expansion, including growing our high-end margin core and adjacent businesses, continuing to deliver cost and capacity reduction initiatives and realizing positive net cost productivity. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we expect the U.S. industry to increase 2% to 3% in 2013 as the market demand grows throughout the year. We believe that consumers will remain cautious in the early part of the year as fallout of fiscal cliff negotiations are understood and budget debates continue in Washington.", "As we continue the year, we'll remain optimistic that the home building recovery and remodeling will continue to strengthen its momentum and that consumers will gain confidence as federal government policies become clearer. Also, the normal replacement cycle of appliance continues, which is particularly important given the peak appliance industry years that occurred before the recession.", "Let me just close with some comments on the recent ruling by the ITC on our anti-dumping petition. Last week, the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC, confirmed an unanimous 6-0 vote that unlawful pricing by Samsung and LG caused injury to the U.S. domestic appliance industry. The positive vote was the ITC's final ruling in the anti-dumping investigation related to clothes washers from South Korea and Mexico. As a result of the vote, the U.S. government will impose trade remedies on the imports of the unlawfully traded washers. The decision is a great victory for the U.S. appliance industry and is an important stride towards enforcing laws that enable a balanced, competitive marketplace for U.S. manufacturers, employees and customers. It is not yet clear how the competitor will respond to this decision and therefore, it is difficult to fully gauge the commercial implications of this. However, we clearly said that in a level competitive playing field, we are very well positioned to win. With this in mind, this decision is clearly a net positive for Whirlpool.", "And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Marc.", "Turning to Slide 17. Overall, our international operations were led by strong performances in our Latin America and Asia regions, as well as a return to profitability in Europe. We delivered improved price and mix across all of our international business as we continue to launch consumer-relevant innovations in every product category around the world. Productivity also drove favorable results as our ongoing cost productivity programs more than offset material cost inflation and currency for the quarter.", "If you turn to Slide 18, you'll see our Latin America fourth quarter results. Sales, excluding currency and BEFIEX, increased 14% on higher volumes and improved mix. GAAP operating profit for the quarter totaled $134 million compared to $155 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower monetization of tax credits.", "On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $119 million compared to $96 million, a 24% improvement year-over-year. Improved price, mix and ongoing cost productivity programs more than offset the raw material inflation.", "Turning to Slide 19, we saw good market demand in Brazil and a share gain in our core 3 appliances, which are higher margin and contributed to our positive mix.", "I now want to highlight a few points regarding our Latin America region. On Slide 20, we compare a few economic indicators for 2 portions of our Latin American appliance business, Brazil and what we referred to as LAR International. As you can see, LAR International, which is made up of over 35 markets outside Brazil, is comparable to Brazil in size, GDP and number of households. Our appliance business in these markets is approximately 1/3 of the size of our appliance business in Brazil but has been growing over the past few years. Our Latin American international business continues to have a significant growth opportunity. In fact, we had record sales and operating profit in this portion of the business again this year. In summary, in addition to Brazil, we also have an opportunity for growth and strong margin contribution in many other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.", "Slide 21 highlights the growth potential in our Latin American region, given current penetration rates of appliances in Latin America compared to the United States.", "Now turning to the fourth quarter results of Europe, Middle East and Africa on Slide 22, we returned to profitability in the quarter, driven by the actions we outlined last quarter. The region had an operating profit of $8 million compared to a $32 million loss in the prior year period. Favorable price/mix, the benefits of cost and capacity reduction initiatives and ongoing cost productivity positively impacted results.", "Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 23. During the quarter, we gained market share and expanded our margins across the region despite weak consumer demand, material cost inflation and unfavorable currency. Net sales increased 1% during the quarter to $203 million, up from $200 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 4%. The region's operating profit was $7 million, up from $2 million in the prior year due to favorable price and mix and ongoing cost productivity.", "Slide 24 shows just a few examples of our new products in 2012. To continue to capitalize on the growth -- on the opportunities for growth, we expect to launch over 200 new products in our Latin America region alone in 2013.", "Our international priorities are outlined on Slide 25. In 2013, we expect to leverage new product launches and grow adjacent businesses, continue cost and capacity reduction initiatives and execute ongoing cost productivity programs. These actions, combined with stabilization in Europe and growth opportunities in emerging markets, have us well positioned to perform in 2013.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by making some comments on our fourth quarter results and then I'll transition to guidance for 2013.", "Beginning on Slide 27, you'll note that we continued to deliver on our margin expansion initiatives. For the quarter, we had approximately a 400-basis-point improvement. Ongoing operating profit margin increased to 6.5%, driven by price/mix, which is up approximately 4 points, and resulted from both cost base price increases as well as favorable mix.", "Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, which contributed about 1 point of year-over-year margin improvement. Material cost inflation was approximately $73 million. As expected, we saw cost productivity ramp up, more than offsetting our material headwinds, resulting in positive net cost productivity. Overall, our fourth quarter and full year margins were firmly on track with expectations.", "Now turning to free cash flow on Slide 28. We generated cash of $230 million compared to a free cash flow use of $55 million last year. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved by over $550 million compared to last year, largely driven by an improved margin structure.", "Now let me spend a couple of minutes on some general topics embedded in our fourth quarter results. Before I do that, as a general reminder, Slides 42 through 45 in the Appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations. As you can see, we have removed the impact of restructuring expense and BEFIEX tax credits, as well as the impacts from legal resolutions and an intangible impairment.", "Turning back to the financial summary on Slides 29 and 30, let me provide a couple of observations. It's important to note that net sales in constant currencies, excluding BEFIEX credits, were up approximately 2%. Monetization of BEFIEX tax credits were $15 million compared to $59 million last year. For the year, $37 million of credits were recognized and, at the end of the year, $184 million remain.", "Regarding interest and sundry expense, in the quarter, we recorded an expense of $17 million for antitrust resolutions. This is adjusted from ongoing business operations to provide better clarity of our underlying business results.", "Slide 31 illustrates expense associated with our cost and capacity reduction program. We continue to expect our total program expense to be approximately $500 million through 2013. The program is progressing very well, and we delivered $227 million of benefit in 2012 and expect an additional $175 million of benefit in 2013 for a total of $400 million, which is consistent with our previous guidance.", "As Jeff introduced earlier on the call, our 2013 guidance is shown on Slide 32. We expect to deliver annual GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $9.80 to $10.30 per share and annual ongoing business operations EPS of $9.25 to $9.75. Our 2013 free cash flow guidance is $600 million to $650 million.", "To provide further clarity and comparability between our GAAP guidance and our ongoing business operation guidance, we have included a table on Slide 33, which I'd like to provide some comments and perspective on.", "Consistent with 2012, we will continue to adjust GAAP EPS for both BEFIEX tax credits and restructuring expenses. As you recall, in October 2011, we announced the largest restructuring program in company history. Restructuring expense is expected to be $185 million or $1.75 per share this year. In 2013, we expect to monetize approximately $60 million to $70 million of BEFIEX tax credits.", "Lastly, recent legislation in the U.S. has extended the energy tax credit program. You'll note that our 2013 GAAP earnings guidance includes $120 million in energy credits. We will continue to exclude these from our ongoing business operations.", "Our 2013 ongoing tax rate guidance is 24% and 2013 GAAP tax rate guidance is 9%. And this primarily reflects the energy tax credits.", "On Slide 34, we highlight the main drivers of our expected year-over-year ongoing business operating performance improvement. During 2013, we expect 1 point of margin improvement from price/mix, largely driven from the mix impact of innovative new product launches and adjacent business growth; approximately 1 point of margin from our cost and capacity reduction program. We also expect to deliver approximately 0.5 point of margin expansion from our normal cost productivity, and this includes fully offsetting approximately $150 million to $200 million of year-over-year material cost headwinds. And finally, higher marketing and technology investments are expected to reduce margins by approximately 1 point during 2013.", "On Slide 35, you'll note we generated $230 million in free cash flow during 2012 and are guiding to $600 million to $650 million, largely driven by cash earnings. It is important to note that we now expect the bulk of our restructuring program cash outflow during 2013, as well as higher capital spending, which is expected to be $600 million to $650 million, compared to approximately $475 million in 2012. The underlying ongoing business operations free cash flow we are generating through operations takes into account short-lived cash requirements and continues to be close to $1 billion.", "Before I close, I want to discuss our short-term cash allocation priorities outlined on Slide 36, which include funding the business, including capital expenditures; debt maturities and pension contributions; return to shareholders; and M&A. We are planning to refinance our $500 million 5.5% long-term debt, which matures on March 1 in the public debt markets.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thanks, Larry. Well, let me summarize. I'll start with Slide 38.", "Overall, we were pleased with the performance and progress that we made in 2012. We delivered record margin expansion across our global business, which in turn generated very strong underlying free cash flow. These actions, as I mentioned, combined with what we see are positive trends in U.S. housing and our growth in emerging markets, do position us well coming into the year. Our actions have clearly produced the expected results, and we remain committed to delivering at least 8% operating margins by 2014.", "Turning to Slide 39, I am confident in the opportunities that we see to grow the business worldwide. And these opportunities, in summary, will come through: appliance growth in new and emerging markets; our stepped up in investment in the consumer-relevant innovations; our expansion into higher-margin, faster-growing adjacent businesses; and advancement of our overall global product leadership.", "So we continue to make great progress on our road map for growth with our great brands and great products. And more importantly, we're performing at levels that will continue to create value for our shareholders.", "So with that, I'm going to conclude our formal remarks and open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question, listening from the site of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Can you address the trends in 2013, Marc? And I think you were touching like why investors shouldn't be concerned about the North American GAAP volume that you guys are reporting for, say, AHAM 6, so negative 5 versus negative 2 in the fourth quarter. And talk about North American margins and your view on discounting in 2013. You guys said you'd be discounting, it's part of the landscape, but it's going to be disciplined. If you can expand on those 2 comments.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Ken, its Marc Bitzer. So let me try to break it out into 2 pieces, the volume, and I think you had a question about the Q4 2012 industry volume [indiscernible] then I come to discounting. First of all, on the Q4 volumes, I would say, overall, the full year industry volume in Q4 largely came within the range of what we've guided to, provided in the previous quarters. Slightly below. We always had 0 to minus 2. Full year industry was minus 2.3. That was largely driven by a weaker-than-expected December. As I mentioned before, the trade sale in December was pretty low. Everybody took inventory down. Probably, a lot had to do with the uncertainty coming out of Washington. But I would say, overall, at the very low end of our guidance. And the only -- if at all [indiscernible] December 1. On our 2013 guidance, Jeff indicated and I indicated it's a plus 2% to plus 3%, which we expect to build throughout the year. We expect some uncertainty in the market, certainly in the first quarter, depending on the whole fiscal cliff discussion. But the underlying trends remain robust. The housing trends is, I would say, in a very healthy shape. If you look at the housing starts, very positive trends, the completion are meant -- just a definition of time, about 6 to 8 months later. That is a strong momentum. I also referred to what is still a very important part of our business replacement cycle. You're basically cycling now against almost a peak of the appliance demand in 2004 and 2005, and that is also an underlying growth driver. So we're pretty confident behind this plus 2% to plus 3%.Now on your comments on the discounts. I was referring to our course has been and will be margin expansion. And as such, we kind of -- I mean, I can only comment on our Q4. We don't make forward comments on planned promotions on Q4. We'll stay the course. We participated when there was value creation, and we did not participate when there was no value creation for us. And that is the course you will see.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And then my second question, some of the recent analysis that we've done in terms of modeling forward demand, if AHAM 6 is around 36 million units in 2012, we kind of forecasted a rate of 42 million units in 2015. And what surprised us is starts were to be normalizing towards 1.5 million units. Approximately half of that growth of 3 million units would have -- would come from new construction. And I believe you guys have roughly a 40% share there; GE, 45%. So if our analysis, what I described, is correct, could you kind of describe the operating leverage that you're going to see and why this wouldn't result in meaningful growth for Whirlpool North America above the industry shipments?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes. Ken, this is Larry. A couple of things. Certainly, during this time period, the recessionary time period, we've taken down our fixed cost structure significantly. We're very well positioned as volume comes back from a leverage perspective. So on an incremental margin perspective, you're probably thinking about -- if you think about 90% of our cost of goods sold approximately is variable and 40% is SG&A, we'd have a nice volume leverage as volume comes back. And as Marc indicated, certainly, the housing completions and existing home sales are a stimulus for us, combined with the increased share we've had over the last couple of years.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess just wondering if I -- one more question. On the marketing, technology and product innovations that we see in 2013, the 100 basis points, is that a normalized rate of investment that we should think about, that needs to be met by positives such as price/mix, cost and productivity?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, again, as we outlined, we are stepping up investments in -- beginning with our new product introductions. So our -- both capital and technology investments because we're getting paid for these in the marketplace. Innovation sells, and that's -- that's our view of how to grow faster and win in the marketplace, is through product innovation, not through price cutting. So that's one. Two, brand investment. With new products, you need to, through all the different mediums, communicate to consumers. And we're at a level where we're going to increase that substantially. And our systems investment is really to help us drive productivity through our global operations. So it's not -- we have a lot of levers that will offset that increased investment, but it's a combination of continued PMR; getting paid for innovation; the restructuring, which we're completely on track to delivery; and we're very optimistic we're going to have positive net productivity. So we're balancing all those, expanding our margins, growing our business. If the market is better, we'll do better.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question, listening from the site of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question I had was on the productivity and material cost guidance for the upcoming year. Little surprised with the expectation for that $150 million to $250 million headwind in the materials, given right now, at least both steel and oil are tracking down year-over-year as we end the year. So I was wondering if you could give commentary around that? And also, the productivity side, if that offset is being driven more by volume leverage? If that's what's included as part of that productivity? Or if there are incremental actions, more like kind of cost actions, that also help that productivity offset?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Michael. This is Jeff. Our guidance of $150 million to $250 million, it is still more inflation of raw materials, lower than we've had obviously the last 2 years. But if you look at our main drivers of raw materials are steel, resins, base metals, strategic components and so on, and I'd add currency because we've had a currency impact on this as well. So we feel pretty good about our position going in the year. Resins are much higher and have a material impact, as well as some of the strategic components and currency. So this is a balance. We think it's a fair snapshot for where we are right here. It is a lot of inflation given the global environment, but we're -- we've been pretty accurate in tracking these things over the last couple of years. As it relates to productivity, the lion's share -- we have very little volume built into our cost productivity because even last year, we're -- we had dampened production levels as we both dealt with market demand, a negative situation in some key regions, as well as managing very tightly our inventory. So there is a very small amount of volume built into that. It is largely through our cost programs; lean manufacturing; product redesign process and a supply chain optimization that we're very confident in our ability to drive productivity, which will offset this and contribute to our margins.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So if the cost productivity doesn't include volume leverage, is that just a source of upside to margins relative to your guidance?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "As I said, if we have better demand, it'll affect us both in the top line, and it'll affect us on the productivity level. And if we have higher demand than what we're showing, we'll do better.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right. And then just a clarification on 4Q results. I think it was referred to before that your shipments were down 5% versus negative 2% in the quarter for the AHAM 6. Is that correct? And how are you thinking about your shipments versus the industry for 2013?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Michael, it's Marc Bitzer. And again, what is correct from these numbers are year-over-year volume and market share has been down. However, if you compare it to Q3, we basically had an essentially market share with Q3. And given that Q4 is typically a quarter where you have higher promotion because of the holiday period, and given our policy to expand margin as the out course, I actually feel pretty comfortable that it's a steady market share coming out of Q3 and Q4. And also, if you peel back the onion, we actually have pretty good share gains in the higher-end segments where we have a lot of innovation, and we feel very good about it. And as usual, we can't give a market share forecast for next year, that is driven by a number of factors, but we will stay our overall course here.", "Operator", "Next to the site of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Two primary questions. One, the last time that the energy tax credit program was in effect, whether this is related or unrelated, your inventories swelled. And I'm noticing that you have a very large productivity expectation for 2013. What should we expect inventories to do by year end? And how much of your productivity, that you're factoring in, comes from trying to maximize these credits from a production standpoint?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Sam, this is Larry. A couple of things to keep in consideration. We are not building inventory for energy tax credits. These appliances, these high-efficiency appliances, have very quick -- have very low days of inventory. They're some of the fastest-selling products in the marketplace. Our productivity is based on what we normally do in each and every year to generate productivity. And year-end inventories, I would say I would expect our year-end inventories to be right around where they're at this time next year as where they ended up in December.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And my next question, you mentioned 1 point of price/mix expected for '13. I think you might have said mostly mix. If we were to go around by region, how would that differ regionally, that 1 point?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "We expect to see positive price/mix everywhere, Sam. Think of it this way. There's really 3 drivers, again, this is as of where we are today. We've got some good carryover coming over from last year from actions we took throughout the year. We clearly are seeing positive mix with better margins virtually everywhere, and that should continue because we continue to -- or we're ramping up our launches, we're ramping up our investment, so we expect that piece to continue. And in our high-inflation or high-devaluation markets, we've already announced, such as Brazil and India and a few others, new price increases this year to cope for the kind of inflation we're seeing in this market. So it's a combination of all. But we expect positive price/mix everywhere.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And as a follow-up, Jeff, I know last year you were real demonstrative, and still remain so, that price and margin expansion will supersede market share. Should we then read your comments today you are every bit as resolute going forward? Or is market share going to be a bit more of an important factor for you going forward than it was last year?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Sam, our primary objective is create value. There's been a number of questions about market share. We had some, what I would describe as marginal market share losses, primarily around the area where we had significant, large, appropriate cost-based price increases last year. Everybody's got their own objectives, and I can't speak for others. I would just say that it is not abnormal for us to lose some market share during those periods of time. I would say that we have gained market share where we've wanted, which is in higher-value, innovation-driven areas. We're not in the business to chase market share based on price. We try to earn it with customers every day, and I guess I'm -- we're very pleased with what we're doing in earning our market share in areas that create value.", "Operator", "Next to the site of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Two things. First of all, in terms of the environment, obviously, you're focus in '12 works, being more focused on margin and a little bit less focused on share, but certainly aware of share. I'm just interested in how 4Q played out. And as you're having discussions with your customers and in the channel in 2013, if you feel like that stance of the environment is going to be different? 2012 is a year obviously where it was much less promotional, and that helped. How do you feel, or what do you see within what retailers are wanting to do competitively in 2013 in that area?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Eric, it probably varies a little bit but not a lot around the world. This -- and I'll take the U.S. for example. This industry got into a lot of trouble when there was a recovery in early 2010, a lot of it by stimulus-driven things off of a low base. And we had very fast volume recovery. And then it stopped. And then a very negative reaction in terms of aggressive promotions and price discounting at levels never seen before in this industry. And there was tremendous value destroyed at every level. Manufacture, retail, et cetera. And the background is it didn't change demand at all. And so as we said 2 years ago, we're in the appropriate level of promotion that makes sense with the business, to offer values in the marketplace and so on. But the kind of stuff we saw earlier, I don't see us -- there's no economic value to doing that. It does not attract demand. We're still in a largely replacement market. Even with housing coming back, that's a new construction market. I would say the weakest part of the market in between is the pure discretionary. So it isn't like we're in an environment where people are coming to the marketplace because they see a discount or a price promotion. They're coming to the marketplace because they need a new product. And so we're -- we kind of see a -- the focus you will see from us is largely built around letting consumers know about our new products. And I think that's the way to attract customers in the marketplace in this kind of environment.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay. Secondly, the volume expectation for '13, up 2% to 3% in North America, is a material improvement for what we saw in '12. Housing seems robust in '12 and seems robust in '13. What's different in '13 that allows the category to perform much better with what looks to be a similar new housing environment?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Eric, it's Marc. Yes, with plus 2% to 3%, it seems different than this year. In the grander scheme of things, it's still on a very low absolute level and we're still far, far away from the peak levels where we -- which we experienced in 2006, 2007. Again, as I said before, I think despite the uncertainty which was driven a little bit around consumer and trade confidence towards the end of the year, which will have some spillover off into Q1, there's a couple of underlying drivers which are just healthy and strong. One is the housing. Keep also this one in mind, we are in the housing completion side, not necessarily in the housing starts side. The housing completions in 2012 are still very low, below 600. By the starts now come right into the market. I mean, many people expect housing starts next year to be between 950, 970. So you add -- you took maybe 6 months or 8 months completion. You can do the math. I mean, it's still various momentums building the market and the housing side. And if you further zoom out, our business is not only driven by the new housing. Existing homes is still the #1 driver for appliance sales. Inventories are low. We're probably more supply constrained right now. We expect the inventories -- or supply coming back into the market, and that gives us a healthy confidence in existing home sales. And the third element, which is really maybe one of the most important one, and particular that it is still in a replacement market, we are cycling against the peak demand levels of 2002 to 2005. So you add your typical 10 years, \"life of an appliance\" in there, you are entering now some pretty healthy replacement cycles. So you put all of these 3 factors together, that has us lead a very strong momentum in the market. Now it maybe dampened in the short term by some consumer confidence issues, but it doesn't structurally change our view on a slow but very steady recovery of industry demand.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then one follow-up. You spoke earlier of the incremental marketing, technology, product investment, the 1-point margin hit in '13. Could you just explain a little bit better? It seemed like you've been make investments in these areas in the past. Is there a reason or a little bit better color for why it's such a material step up in '13, which seem to be a reasonable level of investment in the past?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, Eric, I would say we have had reasonable levels. But number one, we've never had as many new products to come in the marketplace. And so as I said earlier, I think letting consumers know about a lot of this innovation is a value-creating activity. So we have higher capital and higher brand and market launch expense, which I see is a very good investment. The systems investment, which is not trivial, is to further help us on the productivity side. So we line all these up against returns. Okay? And so if we don't see the returns coming, we'll scale them back. But we think these are healthy investments for the business. They will accelerate our revenue growth in the right areas, therefore, margins. And this gets us at a level where we think is commensurate with the kind of things we bring in the marketplace.", "Operator", "Time for one more question. We'll take that final questions from the site of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Just back to the whole discussion with operating leverage for a second. Can you just update us on where your capacity utilization rates are in North America and Latin America?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "David, we've had this discussion before. It's really hard to give you an exact number there. I would say -- let's take North America for example. We resized the North America capacity to be profitable at 2011, 2012 demand levels. And in many cases, that's running 1 or maximum 2 shifts, 5 days a week. Okay? So on that basis, there's a capacity utilization. But the reality, and I think probably the relevant question here, is if we see an uptick in demand, or a significant change in demand, can we respond to it profitably? And the answer is absolutely yes. We've ran some of these facilities back in 2006 and '07 24/7. And so we have substantial upside capacity without any major investment or -- probably the biggest constraint to upside is just getting the rest of the supply chain ready for it, which we work on all the time. So I have -- the way I look at capacity utilization today is we're very profitable at today's levels and we can go up. In Latin America, there, as we've had nice growth for a number of years, we have had some capacity constraint issues that we continue to address through very targeted and focused investments. So it's something we -- I mean, we're -- our asset utilization and the management of assets and capital is something that's on everyday here. And so, basically, that's where we are.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. On Latin America, Mike made the observation that you were looking to grow in the non-Brazilian markets. Is that largely distribution? Can you do that with the brands you have now? Is it organic? Or do you have to make acquisitions?", "Michael A. Todman", "No, David. It is largely through distribution. Our brands, we market both the Whirlpool brand and KitchenAid brand in those markets, and the fact of the matter is they're very well received. We've started to increase our investment in new product innovations in those markets and we're starting to see it take. So we feel pretty good that just through investment and more distribution, we can significantly increase our share.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Final question, just you talk a lot about the innovation and the growth that comes along with that, which is very encouraging, but you're also exiting some underperforming business as well, as I understand, or at least some underperforming SKUs. Can you just talk about the exiting underperforming SKUs as a drag on revenue growth next year? Is it a couple of points? Is it less than that?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "No, David. We've got -- we made an awful lot of progress in 2012. I mean, basically, we want to sell products for a profit. And if it doesn't hit that criteria, we either fix it, change it or quit selling it. And so yes, the lion's share of the marginal market share loss that we had is -- probably would fall under the categories of unprofitable businesses to sell it. And but our view is not to quit selling, it's to get better products, get better costs, that sort of thing. So it's kind of an ongoing assessment and cleansing process. But fundamentally, we are -- we believe great products sell. And if they truly are great products, we will get paid for them. And so revenue growth without profit is not a big interest to us.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Sounds like we -- I was the last question. You got a couple of minutes to go to the hour. Let me just ask you if you'd consider a share split?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "David, anything like that or a return to shareholder or anything else is something that we would -- we ongoing have discussions and dialogues with our board. And if anything like that would happen, it'd be a board decision.", "So listen, everyone, thank you for joining us today. We really appreciate your questions on the call and we look forward to updating you the next time we get together. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's program.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.", "Joseph Lovechio", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operation. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 31, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our earnings release from earlier this morning, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations as we continue to expand our margins and improve our operating results. We are on track to deliver our operating profit margin, EPS and free cash flow guidance for 2013, primarily due to the strong execution of our business priorities. We've outlined these priorities over the last several quarters and they remain unchanged. We expect to realize cost-based pricing actions. We continue to introduce mix-enhancing new product innovation and products. We continue to reduce our fixed cost structure. And we're delivering on ongoing cost productivity programs. The first quarter results marked the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin expansions, and we expect continued margin expansion, higher revenue growth and higher cash generation as we progress throughout the year.", "If you turn to Slide 6, you can see our first quarter results are summarized there. As expected, excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX, our revenues were essentially flat versus the first quarter of last year. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved $0.56 per share or 40% to $1.97 compared to the $1.41 last year. And first quarter cash flow usage improved from last year, and we are on track to meet our full year guidance as cash generation ramps up during the second half of the year.", "Turning to Slide 7. You can see our global industry demand assumptions, which we believe are -- continue to be -- will be positive for the full year. Overall, our outlook remains unchanged as we expect to see moderately higher growth going forward due to the strength of U.S. housing and improving demand trends internationally. In North America, we expect industry demand to be up 2% to 3% as we continue to see the positive trends in housing, and we see this becoming even more structurally strong during the second half of this year. For Brazil and other Latin American countries, we're forecasting industry demand growth ranging from 3% to 5%. In Europe, we still expect a flat industry for the full year as weak economic environment continues across the Eurozone. And finally, we're forecasting moderate growth of 3% to 5% in Asian regions.", "At this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review in more detail our North America operations.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin on Slide 9 by reviewing North America's performance in the first quarter, starting with the top line. First of all, if you recall, in December of last year, U.S. retailers' concern over consumer reaction to a fiscal cliff maintained very low inventory levels. On this first quarter 2013, retailers increased their inventory levels, particularly driven by addition of brands in their stores. The result was that industry sell-in was quite a bit better than sell-through for the quarter. Industry sell-through for the quarter was actually in line with our expectations and our full year industry guidance of plus 2% to plus 3%.", "As expected, our market share was down versus last year as we comped against our highest market share quarter of last year. Sequentially, however, compared to Q4, our market share was up.", "Out of U.S., we saw continued industry demand softness in Canada and Mexico, and as a result, our net sales of $2.2 billion for North America were essentially flat from last year. We do expect, however, higher revenue growth as we progress throughout the year. As we have previously stated, our priority has been and will remain margin expansion. Our operating margins were 9.7% for the quarter, and operating profit was $218 million as compared to $151 million in 2012. Overall, our operating margins expanded by 3 points year-over-year. Strong market execution and innovative consumer products continue to drive increase in price and mix, and the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiative was also positive driver in the first quarter. The consistent and disciplined execution of our actions resulted in a sixth quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin improvement.", "Turning to Slide 10. You can see just a few examples of our innovative products: the Whirlpool Gold refrigerator, the new Jenn-Air Accolade ventilation system and the Maytag Maxima XL front-load steam washer.", "Let me just take a moment to talk about our expectation for the rest of the year as shown on Slide 11. Q1 was in line with our expectations, and we expect revenue growth to build throughout the year. And with regard to the industry demand as we continue the year, we remain optimistic about the continued strength in U.S. housing and the consumers' regained confidence as federal government policies become clearer. And also, the normal replacement cycle of appliance continues, which is particularly important given the peak appliance industry years that occurred well before the recession. With regard to our business priorities, we remain focused on action, driving margin expansion, including investing innovative new products, continuing to deliver cost and capacity reduction initiatives, realizing positive net cost productivity and growing beyond our core product categories.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of international operations.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Marc. Turning to Slide 13. Overall, our international operations were led by another strong performance in our Latin America region as margins continue to expand. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa region was negatively impacted by the continued weak environment across the Eurozone. In Asia, we gained market share and drove favorable product price and mix, which was offset by unfavorable currency, a weaker industry and higher material costs.", "If you turn to Slide 14, you'll see our Latin America first quarter results. Sales, excluding currency and BEFIEX, increased 2% on improved pricing and mix but lower volumes. As you recall, Q1 last year was the first full quarter of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. Beginning in February of this year, the IPI tax holiday changed, making Q1 the toughest industry comp. We expect industry demand to grow from here.", "GAAP operating profit for the quarter totaled $130 million compared to $121 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher monetization of tax credits, but on an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter, which totaled $114 million, was equal to the prior year. Improved product price and mix offsetting higher material costs and unfavorable currency continue to drive margin expansion again this quarter as our ongoing business operating margin increased 0.5 point to 9.6%.", "Our first quarter results of Europe, Middle East and Africa on Slide 15 reflect the very challenging market environment in the Eurozone. First quarter sales decreased 3% year-over-year to $668 million. Foreign currency did not have a significant impact on net sales compared to last year. The region had an operating loss of $8 million compared to a $4 million profit in the prior year period. Weak demand and country mix, as well as higher material costs, more than offset benefits from cost and capacity reduction initiatives. Also note that Q1 is historically our lowest volume quarter of the year. Given the current economic conditions, we continue to evaluate demand and assess additional cost reduction actions required to adjust for demand.", "Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 16. Net sales decreased 8% during the quarter to $187 million, down from $202 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 4% as we saw weaker industry demand, particularly in India. The region's operating profit was $3 million, down from $9 million in the prior year. Market share gains and favorable product price and mix from new product innovation were more than offset by weaker industry demand, unfavorable currency and higher material cost.", "Slide 17 shows a few examples of our international product leadership in the first quarter and how we continue to capitalize on the opportunities for growth. We've highlighted the Whirlpool brand Stainwasher in India, Brazil brand's Ative! dishwasher and an induction oven in Europe for the Whirlpool and Bauknecht brands.", "On Slide 18, in 2013, we expect improving demand trends in emerging markets throughout the year. Latin America is expected to ramp throughout the year due to the strong underlying fundamentals in the region. For Asia, we see current strengthening in China and India improving throughout the year. And we continue to focus on our business priorities, which are leveraging new product launches and growing beyond our core businesses, continuing cost and capacity reduction initiatives and executing ongoing cost productivity programs.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results are consistent with expectations entering the year and have us on plan to deliver our annual guidance, which we are reconfirming today. On Slide 20, you can see we expect to deliver annual GAAP EPS in the range of $9.80 to $10.30 per share and annual ongoing business operations of $9.25 to $9.75 per share. Our 2013 free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million.  Slides 31 through 39 in the Appendix provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations for both 2013 and 2012.", "Turning back to Slide 21. You will note that we continued to deliver on our margin expansion initiatives for the first quarter, driving a 130 basis point improvement in operating profit margin. Ongoing operating profit margin increased to 6.6% during the quarter, driven by price mix, which was up 1.5 points, and we continue to expect to realize approximately 1 point for the year. Our cost and capacity reduction program contributed another point, consistent with our full year guidance. As expected, net cost productivity was slightly negative as material cost inflation was $46 million during the quarter.", "Our cost productivity is on track to ramp up throughout the year, fully offsetting approximately $150 million to $200 million of year-over-year material cost inflation, and is expected to deliver a positive 0.5 point of margin for 2013.", "In addition, as planned, we increased our marketing technology and product investments during the quarter, reducing margins by less than 1 point. Overall, our first quarter margins were firmly on track with expectations and consistent with our expected full year improvement.", "Moving to the financial summary on Slide 22. As expected, reported net sales were $4.2 billion compared to $4.3 billion last year. Excluding the impact of both foreign currency and BEFIEX, sales were flat to the prior year. As Jeff, Mike and Marc mentioned, we expect revenue growth to progress throughout the year. Monetization of BEFIEX tax credits were $16 million compared to $7 million last year. As of March 31, $177 million in BEFIEX tax credits remain.", "Turning to Slide 23. The income tax benefit in this quarter primarily relates to the recognition of $84 million for the U.S. energy tax credit program related to 2012 and Q1 2013 production. As we noted previously, our 2013 full year GAAP earnings guidance includes $120 million of expected benefit from the U.S. energy tax credits. Our full year 2013 ongoing tax rate assumption remains 24%, and our GAAP tax rate assumption adjusted primarily for energy tax credits remains 9% for the year.", "The graph on Slide 24 illustrates expenses associated with our cost and capacity reduction program. We continue to expect our program expense to be approximately $185 million this year, and the program remains on track to deliver $175 million of benefit in 2013.", "On Slide 25, you see our cash flow priorities remain funding the business, including capital expenditures, debt maturities and pension contributions, return to shareholders and M&A. This month, we raised our annual dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share, and we continue to evaluate M&A opportunities and share repurchases. During the quarter, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB, marking solid progress toward returning our credit ratings to prerecession levels. We will continue to balance funding all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Turning to Slide 27. I would summarize by saying that we are on track to deliver our operating margins, our EPS and free cash flow goals for 2013. We will continue to invest in innovative consumer solutions for the home. We do expect higher revenue growth with the continued strength we're seeing in U.S. housing and improving demand trends internationally. And we do remain focused on delivering at least 8% operating profit margins during 2014.", "Finally, turning to Slide 28, I would just say that we are confident in the opportunities that we have for revenue growth and cash generation as we progress throughout the year. These revenue growth opportunities will come through new and emerging markets; our consumer-relevant innovations, which are going very well; our expansion into higher margin, faster growing adjacent businesses, which are growing at good rates; and the advancement of our overall global product leadership position. We have been, and we expect to continue, to perform at levels that will create more value for our shareholders.", "So with this, I'll stop our formal remarks and then open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And with that, we'll take our first question from the line of Sam Darkatsh.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. First off, I apologize if this was in the prepared remarks and I missed it, was there market share commentary around Latin America and Europe? I missed it if there was.", "Michael A. Todman", "Sam, this is Mike. No, I didn't make market share commentary, but in Latin America actually, our market share was stable so we maintained. And in Europe actually, we saw a slight increase in our market share.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then my primary question, you said that you're expecting sales growth to build as the year progresses in North America and Latin America. Could you decompose that a bit into units versus price mix as the year progresses? And then the follow-up to that would be, how do you see share, market share playing out in the United States, particularly if industry pricing gets a little bit more challenging?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Sam, this is Jeff. Let me maybe take that at a global level. First of all, we had -- our Q1 revenues were basically flat when you take out foreign currency. And we've been -- the big currency devaluations happened in March and early April of last year, so we kind of anniversary-ed those things. And given today's currency levels, that should not be a drag on revenues. The second thing I would say is if you step back and look at the global appliance business at a global level, largely speaking, Q1 was probably marginally slightly better or slightly worse than it's been in the last 6 to 9 months, meaning there's been no real material change in the global market. The individual markets, there's been a lot of change, some up, some down. So we're kind of tracking at the rate we've been. The activities we've been putting in place have been expanding margins, and we continue to ramp up investments in new product innovation. So our comments are that with revenues, in essence, being flat in the first quarter, we do expect revenue growth to begin to ramp up as we go out through the year. If you look at our demand forecast, you can see that, largely speaking, we still expect it to be positive. And I think you will see our new product innovations working well in the marketplace. So that's why we're sitting here today feeling good about our revenue growth opportunities. Specifically, North America, I'll let Marc speak to that.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Hey, Sam, it's Marc Bitzer. And I made an earlier comment about the revenue growth, which we're expecting. And first of all, as you know, we are not giving revenue or price mix guidance by region, certainly not. So let me try to be vague within the guardrails. First of all, on revenue growth, I wouldn't say I expect it if we don't see trends supporting that and if we don't have a strong degree of confidence that revenue growth will materialize, and we're very confident. Obviously, in particular as you compare year-over-year revenue numbers and also as you keep in mind, we're cycling through several price increases, mix changes, the baseline of comparisons change. And as such, the price-volume equation, by definition, will change. That's just a reflection of baseline and what we're doing about this one. I think the important thing, and that's what's probably implicit in your question, is based on the past industry trends, we have not changed our view on promotional policy. We feel, based on what happened in the first quarter, that our view has been confirmed as evidenced by these operating margins. I'd also said that we remain committed to our strong margins and margin expansion and we -- and that has also been evident in Q4 and Q1. We're playing now with more and more levers. In the past year, we played strongly in the price margins, now it's price margin and cost, and we're increasing -- also, we'll have volume opportunities and that ultimately will support our margin expansion.", "Michael A. Todman", "Sam, let me give you a little bit of color on Latin America. If we just remember, and I had this in the prepared remarks, the first quarter was the toughest comp quarter for Latin America. And so in general, the industry is down because it was up so high last year because of the IPI tax -- the first quarter of the IPI tax introduction and then the change in IPI tax. But our expectation is that the demand environment in Brazil, in fact, is going to grow. And we're already seeing that in April as we begin to comp over slightly lower numbers from last year and we see positive trends in the economic environment.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "One other comment, Sam, this is Larry, if you look at the guidance we provided throughout the year, which everybody is reiterating today, if you look at just the industry guidance by itself would indicate 2.5% approximately improvement in unit volume, which would translate into at least that amount of sales for the year, to answer your question.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. If I could sneak one more in here real quick. Marc, you mentioned that U.S. POS was less than that of the sell-in. Do you anticipate a bit of a correction or a softer Q2 as a result of that versus what we saw in Q1 for the industry?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Let me first -- Sam, it's Marc again -- first reexplain what I mentioned about Q1. As we entered the first quarter, the industry -- or the trade inventory levels were low. I would say unusually low and that was largely driven by the uncertainty, which was around the fiscal cliff and everything else in December. As the quarter progressed, I would say both consumer and trade confidence, particularly trade confidence, increased and inventory levels went up, coupled -- or I would say particularly also driven there. As you know, there have been some retail landscape changes and there were some new brands and floors, which always drives some initial load inventory. That's just the nature of whenever you have new flooring. That was an unusual Q1 effect. The underlying sell-through data, which, as you know, there is no solid source available, but we have a pretty good sense about this one, is, I would say, almost spot on what we had in mind for our full year guidance. I also see that pretty stable to maybe slightly increasing as the year progresses, and for Q2, it feels stable right now. I mean compared to the Q1 trends, not stable in absolute terms.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from the line of Eric Bosshard.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Curious for you to speak a little bit more. You clearly are committed to making great progress on margins. I'm interested in how you're thinking about market share relative to that. I know you've talked in the past of some decisions you've made on market share relative to margin. But interested in how you're thinking your commitment to that. And then also, within the market share performance, if you're seeing changes at any different piece of the market at the high end relative to the low end within your performance and if you have different strategies or thoughts about defending or pursuing market share across the portfolio, specifically talking about North America.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Eric, again, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, just to provide facts, as I indicated already, our Q1 market share was year-over-year down and sequentially slightly up, which pretty much confirms our current trends and the decisions which we've taken in Q4. And obviously, I can't give a quarterly guidance on market share, but let me try to maybe put it more in generic terms. The way how we look at market share is there's a certain portion -- the biggest portion of our market share, which I call it everyday earned in the trade's local grade products. As you can imagine, we're exceptionally committed to grade and innovative products to earn that every day, and we will work incredibly hard to never let that go. There's another portion of the market, which is, call it, promotion market share, which sometimes is a little bit like quicksand and you need to make a decision, a, how big is that. In the past couple of years, we said we don't believe that promotion markets were big. And two, what return on investment do I get, i.e., how much does it cost me to buy that market share in simple terms. I'm simplifying. And that is where we have not changed our view on this one. But don't confuse that with us not being committed to drive our market shares with great products and innovative products. We remain exceptionally committed and will remain so.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And Eric, I would just add to that. I mean, we are investing in what we think is sustainable market share, which is new product innovation. And where we brought out really great new product innovation, we are actually gaining market share. To Marc's point, we do not believe -- if you look at the elements that construct demand in the marketplace, it's primarily replacement. We're now seeing a really nice growth factor in new construction. We're starting to see the pickup from existing home sales. But the pure, pure discretionary is still very, very weak, and given that environment, we don't think what I'd call uneconomical promotions drives any more demand. So that's the same position we've had for some time now and it's the position we have today.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "I guess, just a follow-up. I totally understand your comment that uneconomical promotions don't drive demand, but they may influence market share. And so what I'm curious, as you have seen LG and Samsung go into Depot and Lowe's, how that is impacting your market share there and how you're seeing the landscape change. I know you've also won market share at Home Depot with the Whirlpool brand. But my follow-up is, how you're seeing that market share position evolve as those new players have arrived?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Again, Eric -- again, I can't really speak about competitors, but if you look at the last couple of years, when there were these heavy promotions, we would lose some share and a month or 2 months later we'd be right back to where we are. So we think it's transitory, and I haven't seen any change in the environment today.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Denise Chai.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I had a question on your -- on the growth in the North American contractor channel that you saw in the first quarter just year-on-year and also quarter-on-quarter. And then my second question is about how you see the raw material price outlook and really how that factors into your thinking on price and margins going forward.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Denise, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me first take the question on the North American contract channel. Yes, it's correct, we've seen strong, robust and sustained growth in contract channels in the first quarter. I would also like to refer back to some comments that we made in Q3 and Q4. The size of the contract channel is still off a very low base. So it does not yet weigh as big as it would have done 4, 5 years ago. But again, I would say growth, and without giving you specific numbers, strong double-digit growth and we've not seen that for sustained periods, and we do expect that even to grow further as the year progresses.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Denise, regarding raw materials cost, clearly, the last couple of weeks there's been some change in sentiment certainly reported and in some prices of pure commodities. For the year, we don't see a material change. We've guided early on in February $150 million to $200 million for the year. I would say that if current trends hold, we're probably heading towards the lower end of that range as opposed to higher. And we still have some big materials like resins and -- that are significantly higher on a year-over-year basis. And the other thing, we have some very high inflationary markets like India and Brazil where they're not reflecting the global commodity trends that you're talking about. But overall, we're comfortable, we have a significant portion of our business hedged. We will benefit if these current prices hold of reducing that range, which will just help our net productivity.", "Operator", "We'll move next to the line of Michael Rehaut.", "William Wong", "It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. Regarding your 2014 outlook in terms of the operating margin getting back to about at least 8% operating margins, you guys are looking at maybe about 7%, looking at the mid-point of the range this year. What are the main drivers of getting back to that 8% plus in 2014?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, for the full year of 2014, we're clearly not giving forecast yet. But the 8-plus percent is what we've been indicating really for the last 3 years of what -- the way we're going to drive our business to rebuild healthy margins, invest in the things that will drive growth. And so we've been executing now to that -- those plans and with great detail for some time. If you just look at the margin progression the last 5 quarters and the drivers of it, you kind of see all the pieces. Fundamentally, we have 4 big levers that we're driving -- or 3 that we're driving and 1 that is external, first is demand. We do think demand is going to improve. We don't think it's going to -- we believe it's improving gradually, but that's a profound change from what we've seen the previous 4 years where the North America market is still 25% below where it was in 2007, European market's about 20% down and so on. So having even a little growth is going to be highly leverageable in our business. The second thing has been price mix. We made great progress in price mix last year through both cost base price actions and very positive mix from our new product innovation. That's moderating this year as we expected, but we still expect certainly the mix portion of that to be very important this year and going forward. The third is our restructuring plans, which we're fully on track to delivering, and we've indicated this year it will contribute $175 million and there may be a tail to that with some more benefits even next year. And then lastly is our cost productivity. Despite weak volumes, we've been in a highly inflationary materials market. And so even this year we're talking about commodities going down, they're still up for the full year. And so a moderation of that will help us drive higher net productivity. In the combination of those 4 things that we're managing in every part of the world, everywhere and plus the 5 -- last 5 quarters of track record, we believe we're going to continue to grow our margins sequentially and head into next year, and when it's time, we'll give you those plans. But we've guided early on to between 6.8% and 7.2%. So yes, 7% is the mid-point. It could be on the high end, it could be on the low end, it's too early to tell, but that was the basis for our guidance this year.", "William Wong", "Okay, great. And a question regarding Europe. Last year, you guys made about $4 million on higher revenue and this year -- or this quarter you lost about $8 million. You talked a little bit about maybe potential further restructuring going forward. Question, like how much of that restructuring that was previously announced was actually executed thus far? And then in terms of profitability in Europe, how should we think about just the remainder of the year? Do you expect to be profitable in the region going for the next couple of quarters?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, let me take that question. First of all, if you think about how Europe went over the course of last year, what we saw was a reduction in demand over the course of the year. And so that had an impact on our total profitability. We've executed the bulk of the restructuring actions, but as you know, in Europe, it takes a little bit longer to begin to get those benefits. But we are getting the restructuring benefits that we committed to, and we expect to get that throughout the course of this year. The other thing to remember is even though you quoted the year-over-year, if we look at just sequentially, the first quarter is always our lowest quarter of volume seasonally in Europe. So it's about 20% lower than it is in the fourth quarter. So those are just kind of the macro. We do expect that as we go throughout the course of this year that, yes, we will drive this business to profitability. And we will continue to assess the demand environment, and if necessary, we will take action on our fixed cost. But that's something that we'll observe over the course of the year.", "William Wong", "Great. And then just last question, if I could. Regarding the sequential improvement in margins in North America from 9.3% in 4Q to 9.7%, could you help us maybe in terms of what were the main drivers? Was it price mix, cost and capacity reductions? Maybe just give us a little bit more color on that, that would be great.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "It's Marc Bitzer again. First of all, typically, what you see in Q4 to Q1 sequentially in North America is maybe less amplified as you would see, for example, compared to Europe, which Mike just referred to. What we took the gap in North America between Q4 and Q1 is 2 effects. You have a little bit less profitability coming from small domestic business, which is a healthy business for us, and you have the opposite effect because typically Q4 is a little bit more promotion intense period. As a net result of all this one, you typically would expect Q4 to Q1 a small drop, i.e. the Q1 has a slightly lower operating margin than Q4. And this year was different, and that is a good achievement and that gives us all the confidence for this year.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Will, just one other thing to add to what Marc said, just realize that there's almost a -- there's almost 20% lower volume between Q4 and Q1, and that's really typical across the company, as well as North America, and margins improved.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of David MacGregor.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "On the North American business, you mentioned that Canada and Mexico were off. I wonder if you could just say what U.S. grew if you exclude Canada and Mexico.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "David, it's Marc Bitzer. I mean, first of all, you probably have seen the industry shipment data, which are 5.5% up for Q1. Again, keep in mind these are sell-in data, which are slightly elevated due to the inventory moves. Again, it's difficult to quantify publicly what we think the sell-through is, but it's obviously a few points below that, but again supporting our full year assumption. Mexico, in particular in Q1, had a very soft industry, double digit down.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. We've kind of carved this thing up. I'd like to maybe talk about the use of cash. My recollection is that you still have a share repurchase authorization remaining from many years ago. Can you just remind us if that's correct and what the amount of the authorization is and what your inclination would be to be active here in the very near term in terms of share repurchase activity?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, David, this is Larry. As I said in my prepared remarks, the uses of cash, funding the business, debt maturities, pension contribution, M&A, return to shareholders. We did increase the dividend pretty much in line with our historical payout ratio. We are evaluating both M&A and share repurchase. We have $350 million remaining on our authorization. And again, as I mentioned, we're continuing to evaluate both M&A, as well as share repurchase as we move forward.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Maybe we could talk about the M&A opportunity a bit as well. And I guess, Jeff, if you could talk a little bit about your priorities or how you're thinking about M&A opportunity and -- maybe from a valuation standpoint or geographic standpoint or -- and how can you execute acquisitions at this point in a way that doesn't disappoint the investment community?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, I guess, that would be the starting point, David, is -- well, first of all, as I've said, we're always looking at opportunities throughout the world in different parts of our business. We have strict criteria that we follow when evaluating them. There've been a number of acquisitions over the last couple of years that we've looked at and decided didn't meet our criteria. But top of the list of that criteria is creating value for our shareholders. So the simple answer is if we don't see a clear path to doing that, we won't do it. And again, the things that have worked well for us, very well in the past are what I call plug-and-plays into some of our regions, our core regions. We continue to invest in certain emerging markets where we can scale up. We continue to look at opportunities in our expanded -- extend and expand categories. But the fact that we haven't done any means that we haven't done anything that really meets our criteria.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Would that criteria include being accretive in the first year?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "David, it depends. I can't answer that because it just depends on the opportunity but...", "Larry M. Venturelli", "I think we're looking at the value creation, value creation versus [indiscernible].", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Right. I'm just thinking about catalysts in the story. And then, could you just maybe talk about Eastern Europe and particularly Russia? Just what is the opportunity there for Whirlpool and where would that stand in terms of your list of emerging market priorities.", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, David, Russia historically and continues to be a pretty volatile market. It's a market that's driven on basically one area, which is oil. And so our investments in Russia have been limited. We don't see it as a huge growth opportunity because some years it will be a boom and other years it will be a bust. And so what we're looking at is really investing in those businesses where we think we can get sustainable growth. And we don't see Russia -- we think there's opportunity, but not for huge investment.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "And as ugly as Europe is right now, is it fair to say that at least it would be a consideration for you if there was an opportunity to play a consolidating role in Europe?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Right. Yes, Dave, look, we've got many things we can and are doing in our current business in Europe to improve value creation and returns to our shareholders. Europe remains a very fragmented market and consolidation is something that can and likely will happen someday. But the question is  someday and I don't know when that will be.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from the line of Ken Zener.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Jeff, Larry, I'm going to go back to AHAM versus your North American shipments because it's the fundamental question today given that your margins sequentially are higher in North America, which is, I think, outstanding. However, we had LG report last night. They're up 19% international, led by U.S. sell-in to Lowe's, part of that product shift. How clearly can you express to investors that you're not losing share, which is the fundamental pressure on the stock today despite the excellent operating leverage sequentially that you delivered?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Let's be clear, first of all, AHAM, we're not talking North America, we are talking the U.S. AHAM was up roughly 5.8, and we think sell-through was about 2 to 3, okay? You talked about the competitor number up 19%. Please remember, they entered a major distribution channel during the quarter, which involves -- that has nothing to do with sellout and has everything to do with sell-in. You also probably note in that release their margins in this category went down 2 points. So, I guess, I wouldn't make a plus 19 trade-off for minus 2 points of margin. It wouldn't be value creating for our shareholders. So our view is that we're going to earn good business every day. We are investing significantly in new innovations we're bringing to marketplace. We've got great examples where we are gaining share with this innovation. And we feel fine about where we are in market share today. To Marc's point, there's business you got to earn every day and there's business that's transaction oriented, and we do both. And the business that you earn every day we do very well in. And the transaction, if it's a good transaction, we do it. But candidly, as I've said in the past, we could gain 2 to 3 points of market share in 90 days in the U.S. market, if we want to pursue certain types of business. Today, that type of business just isn't value creating.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Jeff, that was very good and clear. I do appreciate it. Second question is, our forecast, if the AHAM was -- again, North America was 36 million units '12. We forecast roughly 42 million in 2015, of which half of the growth comes from housing, normalizing the 1.5 million starts. Can you give investors a little more comfort that your market share, which I believe is roughly 40% nationally, as well as 40% new construction, that, that growth is predicated upon structural issues like your distribution channel, a, and comment on the profitability of that business relative to the segment in general?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Hey, Kenneth, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, on your 2015 industry forecast, which I wouldn't confirm but I'm not disagreeing with, first of all, rightfully, you point out the 2 fundamental driver in the long-term industry demand are ongoing replacement cycle and the structural recovery in the housing/construction. You obviously also noted that all the growth, which was in housing permits, is still, and we made that point earlier, 6 to 9 months away from housing completions and when you typically get the appliance shipment. You get the appliance shipment pretty much on 2 days before the keys are handed over. So you were always at the tail end, but also means in 2013 you will still only see a certain portion of the underlying momentum being built in that channel. But again, the momentum is building strongly. Now as you look at the market share and that is -- I will say the nice thing about this channel in particular, and you asked earlier about certain other brands, that channel is a very, how should I phrase it, very captive channel that you have to earn contracts over many years. These contracts are awarded, they're signed, and it's a very difficult channel to manage and serve in the right way. It takes years of building a capability of contracts. And today, that market is, I would say, largely 2 players and the third one a little bit smaller of a branch you mentioned before are basically not having access to that channel. So we are very confident that we're in a very strong position to participate in that growth of a market in a, I would say, almost disproportionate manner.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And Ken, I would add to that. I mean, there is an infrastructure cost to be in that channel, a supply chain cost, service cost, coverage cost. And we're still early in the game, I think, in the housing recovery. And that infrastructure cost is highly leverageable. It's fixed. And so as that channel grows, it's not only very leverageable from a fixed cost base, but it's a great mix channel for us because the power of our brand portfolio, we give builders packaged options which they offer to consumers, and we see great mix upgrade opportunities throughout our portfolio of brands. So it's a great channel as it's getting healthy. It was an investment on our part when it was down to the levels it were with the fixed cost that we had, but it was an investment we decided to make, and we're going to benefit from the upside of that.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "And we'll see some very strong industry growth in the future as that part of the business comes back.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "I think that was our last question we had on the line. We appreciate everyone joining us today. We look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's program. Have a great day.

For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.", "Joseph Lovechio", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Presidents Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operation as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation.", "Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 29, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for joining us today. As you saw in our earnings release from earlier this morning, our second quarter results reflect strong revenue growth in every region around the world. And as I've outlined in the last several quarters, we continue to manage all the drivers that impact our margins and that once again had significant margin expansion during the quarter. These results mark the sixth consecutive quarter of the year-over-year ongoing business operations margin expansion.", "Given the strong underlying trends that we see in our business, we are raising our full year ongoing business operation EPS outlook to $9.50 to $10 per share, up $0.25 from our previous guidance; and our free cash flow to between $650 million and $700 million, up $50 million from our previous guidance.", "Our second quarter results are summarized on Slide 6. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX, our revenues were up approximately 6% versus last year. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved 53%, up $0.82 to $2.37 compared to $1.55 last year. And as we continue to drive higher revenue growth and expand margins, our expectations for cash generation are firmly on track.", "All of our actions regarding our use of cash are aligned with our previously committed priorities, which are funding -- appropriately funding the business, particularly focused on new product innovation, which we're doing, refinancing our long-term debt. We did increase our dividend in April by 25%. And recently, during the second quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program.", "Turning to Slide 7, you'll see our industry assumptions have changed within the regions as compared to our previous outlook. In North America, we're increasing our industry demand assumption to be up 6% to 8% for the year as we continue to see very positive trends in U.S. housing, as well as pickup in really all segments of the market from a demand perspective. In Europe, we expect now to see flat to minus 2% industry demand for the full year as weak demand environment continues across the Eurozone. And for Brazil and other Latin American countries, we are forecasting a lower but still positive industry growth for the year. Now we see it ranging from 1 -- up 1% to 3%. And finally, we're forecasting the industry to be flat from the prior year in our Asia regions. But in total, given these changes, our overall global industry demand assumption has increased for the year.", "One last note before we get into our regional and financial results. During the second quarter, we've realigned our senior leadership structure here at Whirlpool. Marc Bitzer now has responsibility for our developed markets, which are North America and Europe, while Mike Todman's focus is on accelerating our growth in emerging markets of Latin America and Asia. These changes reflect the similar nature of the opportunities that we see in different parts of the world, and we are providing the appropriate leadership focus to realize these opportunities.", "So at this point in time, I'd like to turn over to Marc for his review of North America and European operations.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 9 by reviewing North America's performance in the second quarter. Starting with the top line, net sales of $2.6 billion for North America were up 5% for the quarter, driven by higher volumes. Ongoing business operating margins were 10.1% for the quarter, with operating profit of $262 million compared to $186 million in 2012.", "Higher sales, ongoing cost productivity and cost and capacity reduction benefits continued to be positive drivers in the second quarter, offsetting higher material cost. Overall, our ongoing business operating margins expanded by 2.5 points year-over-year. The consistent and disciplined execution of our actions resulted in the seventh quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin improvement. And we continue to be pleased with our structural improvements in margin and the market's response to our innovative new products.", "We are comfortable with our structural market share in channels and products that clearly create value as we were able to grow our sales and expand our margins in this quarter. As in the previous quarter, we did not aggressively participate in non-value-creating promotions.", "Now let me take a moment to talk about our expectations for the rest of the year, as shown on Slide 10. As Jeff indicated earlier, we are increasing our full year industry guidance to up 6% to 8%. Positive trends in U.S. housing continue, including both new construction and existing home sales. In addition, we see demand for replacement purchases, as well as improving consumer confidence.", "Therefore, we expect continued growth as we progress throughout the year, and we continue to invest in innovative new products. We are seeing the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, as well as our ongoing cost productivity programs. And we're focused on growing beyond our core business.", "I will now talk to the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, as shown on Slide 11. As you can see, our results continue to reflect a very challenging market environment in the Eurozone. However, our second quarter sales increased 6% year-over-year to $731 million, driven by higher volumes, and our operating profit improved by $21 million. Higher sales, benefit from cost and capacity reduction initiatives and ongoing cost productivity more than offset higher material cost and foreign currency. Operating margins improved 310 basis points compared to the prior year period. And we will continue to evaluate and take all actions necessary to ensure a profitable position in Europe despite the weak market demand.", "Turning to Slide 12, you can see just a few examples of our leading innovative products in these 2 regions. The Whirlpool brand 6th Sense induction oven, KitchenAid brand's Pro Line Series 16-cup food processor and the top-rated Maytag Maxima front-loader.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for the review of our Latin America and Asia operations.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Marc. If you turn to Slide 14, you'll see our Latin America second quarter results. Sales, excluding currency and BEFIEX, increased approximately 8% on higher volumes. GAAP operating profit for the quarter totaled $135 million compared to $103 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $111 million, up 10% over the prior year. Higher sales and ongoing cost productivity more than offset higher material cost and foreign currency. We continue to drive margin expansion as our ongoing business operating margin increased 0.5 point to 9.3%.", "On Slide 15, we saw a slowdown in the industry, particularly at the end of June with the unrest in Brazil, so we have slightly lowered our full year industry demand assumption for the region. However, July demand seems to have returned to normal levels. Despite this volatile external environment, we continue to gain market share and expect our business to outperform, resulting in continued strong revenue and earnings growth. We continue to leverage innovative new product launches, execute ongoing cost productivity programs and grow beyond our core businesses.", "Our second quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 16. Net sales increased during the quarter to $246 million, up from $241 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 4% on higher volumes. The region's operating profit was $14 million, flat from the prior year, with higher sales mainly due to market share gains and ongoing cost productivity, offset by raw material cost and foreign currency.", "Slide 17 shows a few examples of how we continue to capitalize on the opportunities for growth with product leadership in Latin America and Asia. For this quarter, we've highlighted the Brastemp brand Ative! Smart Cook range, the Whirlpool Agitronic washing machine and the Whirlpool Ares Combo washer and dryer.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. Our first half results with higher sales and higher margins have us tracking ahead of internal expectations, and as a result, we are raising our full year guidance today. The company continues to manage well through short-term volatility in demand and currencies across the world. Importantly, the underlying fundamentals of the business remain very strong.", "Turning to Slide 19, you can see we now expect to deliver annual GAAP EPS in the range of $10.05 to $10.55 per share and annual ongoing business operations EPS of $9.50 to $10 per share. Our 2013 free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million.", "Before I move on, as a reminder, Slides 29 through 36 in the appendix provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations for 2013 and 2012.", "On Slide 20, you will note that we continue to drive our margin expansion actions for the first half, driving a 180 basis point improvement in ongoing business operating profit margin.", "Price/mix was positive for the first half of the year, and we expect to realize 0.5 point for the full year. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives contributed 1 point, consistent with our full year guidance. Net cost productivity was positive for the first half as our actions more than offset first half material cost inflation of approximately $75 million.", "Cost productivity is on track to ramp up throughout the year as we continue to deliver higher volumes, fully offsetting $150 million to $200 million of year-over-year material cost inflation. We expect net cost productivity to deliver up to 1 point in margin for 2013. Our increases in marketing, technology and product investments are expected to reduce margins by approximately 1 point for the full year.", "As we manage all of these margin expansion drivers, we continue to expect to deliver an ongoing business operating profit margin toward the high end of our previous guidance of 6.8% to 7.2%. The combination of revenue growth and margin expansion will lead to a strong second half performance.", "Moving to the financial summary on Slide 21, overall, our second quarter revenues increased across all regions, driven by higher volumes. Reported net sales were $4.7 billion compared to $4.5 billion last year. Excluding the impact of both currency and BEFIEX, sales were up approximately 6% compared to the prior year. We expect profitable revenue growth to continue throughout the year with increasing demand. Second quarter ongoing business operating profit increased over 50% to $335 million, up from $222 million in the prior year, driven by higher sales, ongoing cost productivity with volume leverage and cost and capacity reductions more than offsetting higher material cost and an unfavorable currency.", "The graph on Slide 23 illustrates expenses associated with the cost and capacity reduction program. The program continues to do very well. For the full year, we still expect our program expense to be approximately $185 million, and the program remains on track to deliver $175 million of benefit this year. We remain firmly on track to deliver the full $400 million in benefits we previously communicated through 2013.", "On Slide 24, you can see that our actions are aligned with our cash priorities. We continue to fund the business, which includes capital expenditures. We refinanced our long-term debt and are contributing to our pension. We are returning to shareholders, as evidenced by the 25% increase in our annual dividend announced in April. Now given the strong underlying trends in our business, we recently resumed our share repurchase program and have $320 million remaining under our existing board authorization.", "Given our free cash flow outlook and strong balance sheet, we are growing our investment capacity, and we'll continue balancing funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thanks, Larry. Let me be brief in the summary. Turning to Slide 26, we're very pleased with where we are at mid-year. For the quarter, we grew both unit revenues -- units and revenues in every region around the world, and we have strong momentum throughout the business operation. Our margin expansion actions continue to drive strong benefits. We continue to invest in consumer-relevant innovation for our leading global brands. And as you saw, we increased our full year EPS and free cash flow guidance. We also, again, increased our dividend by 25% in April, and as Larry mentioned, we have now reinitiated our share repurchase program.", "Going forward, we'll continue to take strong actions to do 3 things: one, grow our business; secondly, continue expanding our margins; and third, actions that create value for our shareholders as we deliver on our roadmap for both growth and value creation.", "So with that, I'd like to stop and open this up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the site of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Two primary questions. I'll make them brief. First, it would appear, at least in the second quarter, Jeff, that your price/mix, specifically in North America and Latin America, was down a few percentage points. Could you talk about that specifically in terms of how much was price and how much was mix? And then in the second half, it looks like you're expecting price/mix to be up about 0.5 point, which suggests that it's going to sequentially improve pretty meaningfully. Could you talk about that, if you could? And then I have a quick follow-up.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Sam, I would be happy to. In some of the early parts, I think there's some confusion out there on that. Let's first -- I'll have Larry talk about it globally and then have Marc and Mike specifically talk about LAR. We're very pleased with where we are at price/mix.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, Sam. This is Larry. Let me talk about the margin improvement in the company. So both -- we had both revenue and margin expansion in Q2, very important. If you look at the drivers at the margin for the profit improvement, we were up 2 points, restructuring was about 1 point, productivity was about 2 points, and that was offset by about 0.5 point of material cost inflation. Price/mix at the margin held up very well globally.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "North America?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Yes. Sam, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, let me start. We've demonstrated over the past 7 quarters that we balance price, mix and volume in a very value-creating way, and we will continue to do so. When I looked at some of the reports this morning, and to echo what Jeff was saying, we have to structurally differentiate between ASVs, which is based on the ticket value, and the price/mix impact on margins. Now ASVs are impacted by a number of factors such as industry mix, how much we're growing our non-core business, et cetera. But that is different from the impact of price/mix on margins. And actually, the impact of price/mix on margins is way, way lower than what was reported this morning in some of the reports. So otherwise we could not have lifted our operating margins by 2.5 points. So again, the price/mix impact on the margin side is significantly less as would be implied by the ASVs.", "Michael A. Todman", "And Sam, this is Mike Todman. For Latin America, we actually -- it's very similar, if you will, to North America in that the ASV change is very different from the price/mix impact on margins. And so we actually gained share in every category, but we gained share in some of the lower ASV categories more than some of the others. And so that had an impact on the ASV. However, we actually had a year-over-year increase in our price/mix on the margin. So again, just distinguishing between the 2.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Let me again -- because I think this was a big point of understanding that's important. We're pleased with where we are on price/mix as it impacts the margin. We got to distinguish between ASVs and price/mix. They are 2 different things. For the quarter, we had about a minus 0.5 point price/mix as we define it, and we feel good about our forecast for the year, being up 0.5 point. I'd only add color on 2 other points in our -- parts of the world like Brazil and India are high inflationary areas. We've already announced second half price increases, so we'll benefit from that. And I think the general theme of growing mix through innovative new product launches continues. So hopefully, that clears that up.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "My follow-up question -- it was helpful. I noticed -- this might be a nuance that doesn't really matter, but I noticed that you didn't change the expectation for U.S. energy tax credits for the year, yet you did take the U.S. industry expectations and theoretically, your own also higher. How -- why is that?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, Sam, I think we said for the program to be about $120 million for the year. Obviously, we took into consideration with that the production that would generate that. That category continues to do well, so I'd say we're still in that range. It could potentially be a little bit higher, but at this point in time, I wouldn't raise it above that. But it could be a little bit higher than that, I think.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "It's always depends on where we are at the year end, production for the balance of the year and year-end inventories is what I'd say.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "All right. So theoretically, the incremental sales volumes that you'd be selling would largely be coming out of inventory as opposed to incremental production?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, we always deplete inventory in the second half of the year, so yes. And again, it's not -- again, it will be based on what we produce by year end.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "And just one other comment on that, Sam. The realization is that those credits are tax assets on the balance sheet. They are noncash this year.", "Operator", "We'll move next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I wonder -- let's see if I can get you to talk a little about Brazil. There's obviously been a lot going on down there. You have the civil unrest that was disruptive to June. If you could talk a little bit about whether we're free and clear of that now and business has normalized. You've got the Mabe bankruptcy. You took your Latin American industry guidance down, but presumably, your share goes up as you pick up listings from that event. And then you've got the renewed stimulus down there, which you can talk a little bit, the impacts of those 3. And with respect to the stimulus, does that hurt you next by driving volumes to the Consul brand as opposed to Brastemp [ph]? Can you just talk about those moving parts and give us a sense of how Brazil plays in the second half for Whirlpool? I'd appreciate it.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Sure, sure. Well, David, as you mentioned, there was a little bit of unrest, the unrest in Brazil, that had an impact. But primarily, that's been June. You saw it. In the first several weeks of July, we've actually seen a return to more normal industry demand environment. Actually, I would say, first, just to kind of step back, we feel very good about both the medium- and long-term prospects in Brazil because we think the fundamentals are right, and frankly, the penetration levels are still low. In terms of the impact of then some of the other items that you talked about, the stimulus, we've yet to see what impact that that's going to have. Obviously, we assume that it will be positive, and it is likely to be more in the Consul brand than Brastemp. But we also know that a lot of consumers, even in that range, want to be able to go buy and afford the Brastemp brand, so we do expect some positive out of that. In terms of our ability to pick up market share, we've shown in the second quarter that we were able to, with some of the problems in Mabe. And we expect that trend to continue throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to launch some new innovative products into the marketplace. So we're feeling pretty good about our position in Brazil and our ability to grow that business.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "So when you talk about the stimulus, you sound relatively tentative. You're saying you haven't really seen much evidence of that yet. You revised your industry guidance to 1% to 3%. Do you not have any of the stimulus in that 1% to 3% for '13 Latin America?", "Michael A. Todman", "No, at this point, we don't because just as in some of the other stimuluses, it's difficult to predict what the impact is going to be on the total industry. So our perspective is right now, we've revised it down just based on the activity that just happened. And at this juncture, we feel good about where we've got it.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then do you have any growth in your Latin American listings from the Mabe developments in your guidance?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, we have. We have seen some pickup in both listings. And as you can see, we've also seen some pickup in the market share.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then just to be clear, the upwards revision to your earnings guidance, $9.50 to $10. Does that include any of the share repurchase activity that you anticipate?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, David. This is Larry. The increase in our guidance is entirely operationally driven. What we did include in there was the repurchase activity we had in the second quarter, which was about $30 million. So that is what's included within the guidance revision. So again, very largely driven by the revision in industry assumptions and growth, higher end of our margin, and then we are offsetting some unfavorable currency also.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, last question. Just Canada and Mexico within the North American numbers, is there any way you can give us some sense of the delta there sequentially?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "David, it's Marc Bitzer. As you know, we're not breaking down kind of Canada and Mexico. I mean, just what I will try to make as an overall comment is right now, Mexico and Canada follow slightly different market dynamics than U.S. The Mexican market is still down, actually, surprisingly, to a large extent, which obviously impacts us because we report Mexico in the North American region. Canada market's holding up but does not yet show the positive momentum of U.S.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "So can you compare that 8.2% growth in U.S. and North America to AHAM 6 and just give us what the apples-to-apples comparison would be?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "David, there's too much other elements it will include because, first of all, you know that T6 will also have a lot of business between what we call T6 and T-12, the non-core business in Mexico and Canada. We typically don't break it down.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes, I think people are just trying to make some sense this morning of what the read-through will be from AHAM 6 to that number.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Now what I can tell you is our overall market share and also market share in T6, I mean, as we said before, we're actually structurally comfortable with our structure and market share position. So if you look at kind of the everyday market share, we're very comfortable. I will be lying if I will tell you that our market share did not drop a little bit over promotion periods, but we're not overly nervous about it. The market share dipped for 2 or 3 weeks. That was exactly around July 4. We did not see this will be any value creating if we would participate in that, and now it's bouncing back.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Two questions. First of all, a little bit of color on the full year guidance. You obviously had a great first half and adding the repurchase, and it looks like you've increased your productivity assumption from the good progress you're making there and the upside in U.S. volumes. And then the increased guide of $0.25, I'm just wondering if you can give a little color on the puts and takes beyond the $0.25 for what looks like is shaking up to be a very good year.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, sure. I mean, there are really 3 components. We do the math on our industry assumptions. From last time to this time, we would say that we would expect growth in the industry and certainly, our growth to be 1% higher than we originally expected. The second piece of that is if you've seen, our first half margin is very strong. We normally have a seasonality build, and we would expect to show a higher revenue growth in the second half of the year with a higher margin in the second half. And so we're guiding now towards the higher end of that range. And then partially offsetting that, quite frankly, is the unfavorable currency that we've seen. We had -- for instance, we had $25 million or $0.25 a share of currency hit year-over-year in the second quarter. So we've incorporated that in. And as I mentioned before, we have initiated a share repurchase. And the only thing we put into the guidance has been what we repurchased so far, which is $30 million, but largely driven by the strength in the operational performance of the business through the first half. So we've earned about 45% of our annual earnings, which is very consistent with what we would expect the company to earn based on the guidance in the first half relative to the second half.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then secondly, I'd love the ASV dynamic, I would love to just understand a little bit more if this was a change from what we've seen for the last 4, 6 quarters, especially in North America. And my question is, is this something that should be sustained? Is this something that we're going to see continue? And then related to that, why is this a different dynamic than what we've seen previously?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Eric, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me just refer to the ASV dynamic as they happened so far. And obviously, we can't comment on future ASV trends. What you see right now, first of all, there's an industry part. As the industry has been showing much more growth momentum than we saw before, the different segments in the industry picked up at different paces. And if you would drill down the details of the T6, and if you even go through certain price segments, there have been quite a bit of different dynamics across the different price segments. And then that's basically just floating through our system. In addition, in our what we call the non-core business, it's a fairly significant portion of our business, and we're driving there higher growth than in the other businesses. That typically comes to higher -- lower ASVs, I'm sorry, but higher margin. So you see also that dynamical flowing through here. So to what extent that extends in the future, we don't know and we can't comment on this one. But I want to reiterate what we said before. We're laser sharply focused on price/mix impact on the margins. We've managed it very well so far in combination with volume, and we will not change the course here.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "And just again, just to build on what Marc said, I mean, the focus here is on growth, which we showed in the first half, and margin expansion at the same time. So hopefully, that answers your question.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "The only other comment I'll make, Eric, is, I mean, again, we've fully anniversaried all of our last-year price increases. So there's been no new like-for-like price increases so far this year. So the real dynamic is mix. Mix, I think, as the market expands, you're going to see growth at every price point. And that can shift a little one way, a little bit another. It's -- we think this is not abnormal. And then a quarter like this quarter, where you had all the last 3 weeks of June shipments for those who promoted 50% off over 4th of July and things like that, that distorted things a little bit. Again, as Marc said, as we have in other activity, normal promotional activities, we were very stable, share and mix through probably middle of June fell off with all these import shipments. And then July, it's quickly rebounded back. So I think it's pretty much consistent with what we've been seeing.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "So your reduction and your full year price/mix guidance, if I'm interpreting it right, is just reflective of what happened in June. That's not a \"go forward, things are different\" type of guidance?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "It's 0.5 point on $19 billion business. So I mean, could it go 3/10 one way or -- yes. It could move -- I mean, last year was so -- we had such positive. We're up 4.5 points [ph] price/mix for the full year, in a year where we took significant price increases around the world. In the developed markets this year, we've not taken price increases. In the inflationary markets, we have taken price increases. So the mix dynamic I don't think is changing at all.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, and the other important thing to build off what Jeff said is with the volume growth, we start to see the leverage, which is also very positive.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "The other side of this is with a little volume growth in North America, you start to see the power of all the productivity and the lowering of our fixed cost that were taking place over the last 2 years and so on. So the productivity lever is delivering very strong.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, and the only thing I'd mention on the top line, keep in mind that there's 1 point to 1.5 points of negative currency in the top line when you're looking at the ASVs.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the site of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question I had was about Europe. Marc, with your expanded responsibilities for that region, obviously, it's been an area where you guys have done a lot of work to get back to profitability, and the region remains very challenging. Is there anything that we should expect in terms of how you're going to approach that region in terms of -- I know you kind of said earlier you continue to look and fix the cost structure. Is that something that we should be expecting in terms of additional actions over the next 2, 3, 4 quarters, to get that back to, perhaps, a mid-single-digit operating margin? And is that kind of your goal over the next year or 2?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Mike, it's Marc. Let me first start from the tail end of your question. As you know, we don't give a regional guidance on a quarter-by-quarter base, but we do expect Europe to come to breakeven. We can't tell you exactly which quarter, but, I mean, that's, of course, our, I would say, short-term objective, that we get Europe as quick as possible to breakeven or above. Overall, I would say the European marketplace is still very challenging. What impacts us in particular is that our exposure is particular strong in countries which are now impacted the most, and that just hurts us right now. Having said that, we are all convinced that even in the current environment, you can make money in Europe, okay? And that's what we are focused on. When it comes to how we deal with that, it's, I would say, by and large, not too dissimilar with what we've been trying to do in North America the last couple of years. We have to address the fixed cost. If the market demand is not there and probably will not rebound in the short term, we will address fixed cost. We have announced actions already previously. We announced some additional actions to calculate unit [ph] fixed cost. And as I said earlier, we continue to evaluate all actions necessary and possible to address the fixed cost. That's just one part. And of course, we will also manage the price/mix situation very carefully in a value-creating manner. So long story short, despite the market environment, it is our firm expectation to bring Europe back to breakeven as quickly as possible and above breakeven.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Appreciate that. And Larry, a question for you on the share buyback. We noticed that year-to-date, you guys have issued about $60 million worth of shares. I assume through different employee option and other types of programs, and then you repurchased $30 million. How do you think about the share repurchase relative to your overall account? Is this going to be something more to just combat creep, or would you expect, of course, on an opportunistic basis, maybe to get back to the share count that you had in 2012, plus or minus?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, I think with the current authorization, Michael, mathematically, right now, you'd probably get back to the dilution. So the way we look at this, we're generating much more cash in the second half of the year. And along with other priorities, we'll continue the repurchase program. And then we'll update everyone quarterly as far as where we're at against that.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "When you mean get back to where you were against the dilution, do you mean, like, in the fourth quarter, you're at roughly $80 million, so maybe something back in that neighborhood?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, I think we had about 2.3 million shares of dilution versus a year ago. And again, if you do the math on the $350 million, you will probably be able to get back there. But I'm not going to give an update on when we'll exhaust that authorization, but we will give you an update each quarter.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great, I appreciate it. And one last one, if I could. Going back to the North America, the promotional activity, which you guys have appropriately tried to stay out of and been able to hold onto your margin, can you give us a sense of -- any more color around that in terms of -- if that's something that maybe is going to -- do you have any sense if this is going to continue in the back half of the year and what the drivers are of that?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Mike, it's Marc Bitzer. And obviously I can only comment on the promotions which happened. I cannot and will not give comment on future promotion. First of all, stepping back, just so you know, there's always been promotion in this industry, so there's nothing new about it. The 4th of July promotion environment was actually as we expected, and we early on decided to not participate in a very aggressive manner. I think if you look back at July 4, it's been very evident there have been 2 players who've been very aggressive. That didn't completely surprise us. We decided to not participate because it simply does not create value. So our strategy in promotions have not changed at all, and obviously, I cannot comment on what other competitors will be doing. I mean, we have evaluated in the past how aggressively we going there, and we will probably do that also going forward.", "Operator", "Next to Denise Chai from Bank of America.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just want to know, when we think about your North America pricing, was there -- was the fact that maybe you were making more sales to homebuilders possibly a contributor to the ASV pressure and actually, how much of your sales went to this channel compared to the first quarter of last year.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Denise, it's Marc Bitzer. It's actually a very good question. The homebuilder has a pretty big impact on the ASVs, and if you would go in the homebuilders, there's even big differences across the different builders in terms of who sells more to the premium segment and who is more the mass segment. Yes, that has an impact on the ASV, among many other factors. So for example, if you have an industry growth which is stronger on mass top-loaders or even in dishwashers, you typically see an ASV impact. So there's a lot of factors floating through here. However, and I want to repeat what I said before, even the segments which I just mentioned, they are margin attractive. So homebuilders segment for us is margin attractive despite maybe a different ASV.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, got it. Also, you mentioned that you are now contributing to your pension. So can you give us, perhaps, a sense of the run rate or maybe how long you think it will take to close the gap there?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Pension is the question?", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "In the U.S., we have about -- at year end, we had a $1.4 billion net liability. So your question is a good question. We are contributing, I believe, $138 million this year, but there's -- another thing you have to also factor in is that interest rates, as you know, have increased. They're probably up close to 80 basis points from when we closed at year end. So if you would expect that rates would maintain at these levels, that would probably be -- it could be a $300 million to $400 million benefit on our net liability. And I'd say going forward, right now, given the current pension legislation, that $138 million is a good estimate going forward.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And just one last thing. You mentioned that you're putting up prices in Latin America and Asia due to inflation there. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, we've announced the price increases in both regions of 3% to 5% for the second half of the year.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And then that is as an average. I mean, we evaluate this every month, every quarter based on inflation and currency movement.", "Operator", "The next is Ken Zener.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "What a big inflection in U.S. demand. So that's the big picture, I think. People are obviously very focused on AHAM versus your units. I think it would, for the broad investment community, to the extent you guys could create an index, let's say, make it 100 at some point in time and just give us an up or down, I think that would be constructive for you guys in terms of getting rid of some of the noise. That's one suggestion I would have. Second, when your AHAM guidance is 6 to 8, in the first quarter, there was a difference between AHAM and demand. Can you give us your view of what that means for demand in both the quarter as well as for the year, or is there a lot of load-in?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. So what you're highlighting is a point which we referred to, I think, in the Q1 earnings call, which was about the inventory build of the retailers. And yes, we did see in Q1, we saw a slight impact of inventory build in the overall AHAM number. It's, of course, difficult to quantify it exactly, but it was probably to the tune of 1 point to 1.5 points of our overall market growth. There has also been, in the period leading up to July 4, some inventory build, which is normal as retailers load for their big promotion. So on a year-to-date base, I would say the 2 factors combined are in the ballpark of about 1 point. So it has an impact. We have a pretty good handle on it, and we factored all these inventory moves into our full year guidance.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And Ken, I would just add to your point. There's a lot of news coming from different sources about the marketplace. I think your first comment is right that the headline is, is we are seeing, we think, sustainable, profound demand recovery in the U.S. marketplace. Over the last 1.5 years, we've talked about being down 28% from the peak, that we were much lower, under the curve, 30-year growth curve, and never above it. And that someday, this market would recover, particularly housing becoming solid, on a solid foundation and growing, and that we might see double-digit demand growth sometime in the next 3 years. Well, it started sooner than we thought. It is recovering. We think it's sustainable, and we think it's a multiyear recovery. So to your point, that's the big picture. I guess to be candid, all the other stuff for us is -- there's a lot of information. Some retailers get their view what's going on to people covering our stock. There's industry shipment data coming every month, and so there's a lot of short-term reactions on these things. But at the end of the day, we give our guidance for the year, not for the quarter, and this is the clearest picture we see of the year. And we'll continue to update you on what I would call the fundamentals, but we're not going to get into the nitty-gritty market share by product, et cetera, et cetera. Given that it changes, we'll tell you the trends. But again, I would just maybe try to put that all together. We're very positive about demand. We're very positive about our ability to grow in this improving demand market while expanding margins. That is what we think is the value-creating way to do it. And for us, the rest of it is just noise.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "That's good because I think the -- to the extent there's load-in [ph], I mean, if market share -- there'll be some variance there, but it does get to the fact of 6% to 8%, it looks like 9%, 9.5% volume North America, 3, 4Q on average, is what's required to get to the low end of your 6%, if that's your volume. And it does relate to the margin question to the extent that -- certainly, it's a surprise to see the negative price/mix, but you're discounting what we see -- and putting in that 50 basis point range and not necessarily the 300 price/mix, which gets to the question of how we really should think about the profitability of your business. Because if I do 9% growth 3, 4Q, we see effectively, very similar volume, 3Q from 4Q -- excuse me, 3Q from 2Q, and then a big spike in 4Q. I mean, is it reasonable to think about quarter-over-quarter volumes driving your operating leverage in that 15% leverage?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, yes. Ken, let me answer it this way. I mean, Ken, we've had 5 years of mostly negative volatility, and we now had 2 quarters of positive upside on demand. You're absolutely right, though. I mean, if Q3 is the same as Q2 or is it accelerating, I don't know. But it could be higher. And as I said before, if the demand is higher, we'll do more. And we are -- but the fundamental proposition is really 3 things. One, higher demand is clearly developing. Two, certainly, for most of our businesses, but certainly, our North America business, more demand volume on a very lean fixed cost base is very good leverage, which you saw on the productivity level in the second quarter. And third, that our price/mix is going to continue to be very good due to our investment in new product innovations. So your basic thinking, I don't argue with at all. For 5 years, it's been hard to forecast it. And so we're just giving you what I call a sound baseline that we based our earnings on.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. Just in addition, echoing what Jeff was saying is, I think, in a lot of discussion, we need to differentiate between structural demand drivers, the structural market position versus promotion and noise, and I would call really promotion noise. We are -- and of course, we're not giving a 2014 guidance, but we're very bullish on the structural demand drivers in North America that is housing, that is replacement, that is consumer confidence. And I've seen the housing starts in June. Yes, they were a little bit positive, but that has not changed at all our view, our very bullish view on the structural demand drivers in North America. Second, our structural market position, in particular, in the contract channel and several of the high end segment is a very good one. So for example, we see very strong growth in our Jenn-Air and KitchenAid business, and we're very bullish about it. In that context, sometimes, the year-round promotion is a little bit overblown, frankly. It does not impact the structural drivers or position. We will always make [indiscernible] if we participate or not.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Excellent. And I guess if I can ask my next question around cash flow, if we just say the 4% to 5% of sales, which will be roughly $1 billion at $20 billion in rev, my understanding is when you talked about buybacks today, and the net benefit of that, it was discussed earlier, but my understanding is roughly 30% of your business cash is coming in the U.S. pre-pension, which obviously reduces the overall amount available for dividends and buybacks. So can you address the bulk of this cash, how you're thinking about the deployment of it, joint venture, buying a company and more -- where you can't be so specific, talk about a pipeline, if you will? Because this is potentially is a major driver of earnings that is not in people's estimates.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, Ken, it's Larry. I think we've kind of laid down our cash priorities, and return to shareholder is certainly one of those. M&A, we said before, is another one of them. Those are things that we consider. And certainly, that and funding the business are the things that we look at as we deploy cash for the company. As far as cash generating, you are right. At the end of last year, we had a little under 30% of our cash in the U.S., and what's outside the U.S., we look for tax-effective ways to bring that back. So I would say our balance sheet is in good shape. Our forecast of free cash flow is in good shape, and we'll update you as we go along as far as how we're deploying that.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Okay. Well, thank you. Listen, everyone. Again, just to sum up, we're pleased so far through midpoint of this year. We look forward to deliver a record year of operating results and look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "This concludes today's program. Have a great day.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.", "Joseph Lovechio", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Presidents Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 33, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our earnings release from earlier this morning, our third quarter results reflect record earnings for our company. We continue to execute on the plans that we laid out to you at the beginning of the year, and we're managing well all the drivers which drive revenue growth and margin expansion. In addition, our -- we continue to accelerate the pace of our innovative new products in support of our industry-leading brands, and in turn, these are driving increased consumer demand and revenue growth. As a result, this marks the seventh straight quarter in a row of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin expansions for us.", "Given the strong underlying trends that we see in our business today, we are raising our full year ongoing business operation EPS outlook to $9.90 to $10.10 per share and increasing our free cash flow forecast to between $690 million and $710 million of cash.", "Our third quarter results are summarized on Slide 6. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX, our sales were up over 5% versus last year, led by strong growth in our North America business. Diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved by $0.92 or 51% and came in at $2.72 compared to $1.80 last year. As we continue to drive higher revenue growth and expand margins, our expectations for cash are firmly on track for the year, and we're effectively deploying that cash in line with our previously communicated priorities.", "Turning to Slide 7, you will see our current full year industry assumptions by region as compared to our previous forecast. In North America, we are increasing our industry demand assumption to approximately 9% for the year as we continue to see positive trends in U.S. housing, the normal replacement cycle of appliances and a return of discretionary purchases to the market. In Europe, we now expect a flat industry for the full year, as the region remains weak but appears to be stabilizing. And for Latin America, we saw inflation and currency changes impact consumer demand in Q3. But we're now seeing a pickup in demand, and we expect that positive trend to continue during the fourth quarter. So for the full year, our industry forecast is now expected to be a positive 1%. And finally, we're now forecasting the industry demand in Asia to be down 2% for the full year, primarily driven by industry demand weakness in India, somewhat offset by our strength in China. In total, given these changes, our overall global industry demand expectations has increased slightly for the year.", "So at this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 9 by reviewing North America's performance in the third quarter, starting with the top line. Net sales of $2.6 billion for North America were up 8%, driven by higher volumes, particularly in the U.S. where core appliance revenue was up approximately 10% compared to the prior year. Strength in the U.S. was partially offset by industry weakness in Mexico and currency impact in Canada. Ongoing business operating margins were 11% for the quarter with ongoing business operating profit of $289 million, an all-time quarterly record, compared to $227 million in 2012. Higher sales, ongoing cost productivity and cost and capacity reduction benefits continue to be positive drivers in the third quarter, more than offsetting higher material cost. Overall, ongoing business operating margins expanded by 1.7 points year-over-year. Consistent and disciplined execution of our action resulted in the eighth quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operating margin improvement.", "Now let me take a moment to talk about our expectations for the rest of the year, as shown in Slide 10. Given current trends, we expect the strong momentum to continue in the fourth quarter. And as Jeff indicated earlier, we are increasing our full year industry guidance to approximately 9%. Positive trends in the U.S. housing continue, including both new constructions and existing home sales. In addition, we see increased demand for replacement purchases, as well as discretionary purchases, driven by improving consumer confidence. We continue to invest in innovative new products. We are seeing the benefits of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, as well as our ongoing cost productivity programs. And we remain focused in growing beyond our core business.", "Turning to Slide 11, you can see a couple of examples of our leading innovative products in the North America region, with the industry's first induction double-oven freestanding range and KitchenAid brand's new 5-speed Diamond blenders.", "I will now talk to the third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, as shown in Slide 13. As discussed in our last earnings call, our first milestone for Europe was to bring the operations back to breakeven, and this is what we achieved during Q3. Our breakeven results for the quarter reflect a weak but stabilizing market environment in the Eurozone. Sales were $778 million, compared to $702 million in the prior year. Excluding currency, sales increased 5% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes. Operating profit improved by $36 million, and operating margins improved 520 basis points compared to the prior year period. Higher sales, ongoing cost productivity and benefits from cost and capacity reduction initiatives more than offset higher material costs. And we will continue to evaluate and take all actions necessary to ensure this positive trend in operating margin growth continues.", "Turning to Slide 14, you can see a couple of examples of our leading innovative products in this region with the Bauknecht UltimateCare washer and the Bauknecht dishwasher with PowerClean+.", "And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Marc. If you turn to Slide 16, you'll see our Latin America third quarter results, which highlight our sixth conservative quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin expansion. Sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency translation and BEFIEX, sales were down less than 1% to the previous year, as temporary reduction in global compressor sales was partially offset by growth in core appliances through increased market share. GAAP operating profit for the quarter totaled $133 million, compared to $118 million in the prior year.", "On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $104 million, 9.4% of sales, compared to $105 million or 8.8% of sales in the prior year. Ongoing cost productivity offset higher material costs and foreign currency.", "Now let me take a couple of minutes to talk about the region in general on Slide 17. The temporary reduction in global compressor sales stemmed from onetime events, including an unplanned port closure that delayed shipments, as well as some isolated trade customer inventory adjustments. The appliance industry in Brazil was flat for the quarter, given the negative impact from currency changes and inflation on the consumer. At this point, given other environmental issues, we do not expect the government loan subsidy program in Brazil to have a relevant impact for appliances. However, we are now seeing a pickup in demand and expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. So for the full year industry growth forecast, we expect a positive 1%. It is also important to note that we had strong appliance growth through increased market share as our innovative new product launches win with consumers. So we expect our business in this region to outperform the industry, resulting in strong revenue and earnings growth going forward. We continue to be very positive about the long-term trend in Brazil, given the low penetration rate of appliances, the emerging middle class and strong underlying economic fundamentals.", "Slide 18 shows how we continue to capitalize on the opportunity for growth with product leadership in Latin America. For this quarter, we've highlighted the Consul Bem Estar refrigerators.", "Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 20. Net sales during the quarter were $197 million, compared to $201 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 2%. Operating profit of $7 million was approximately 4% of sales, flat from the prior year, as growth in China, favorable price and mix, as well as ongoing cost productivity was offset by industry weakness in India, increased raw material cost and foreign currency. One last note on our Asia region. We were pleased to announce our intent to become majority shareholder of Hefei Sanyo and accelerate our growth in the emerging Chinese market. The regulatory approval process remains on track, and as we previously stated, we expect the transaction to close by the end of 2014. Slide 21 shows a couple of examples of our product leadership in Asia. For this quarter, we've highlighted 2 refrigerators: the Whirlpool Neo iChill and the Whirlpool Beijing Opera.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Overall, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to remain strong, as evidenced by another quarter of bulk sales growth and margin expansion. We continue to manage effectively through short-term volatility in demand and unfavorable currencies across the globe. Given our strong operating results for the first 3 quarters, we are again raising our full year guidance today.", "Turning to Slide 23, you can see we now expect to deliver annual GAAP EPS in the range of $10.45 to $10.65 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $9.90 to $10.10 per share. We are also raising our expectations for 2013 free cash flow to be in the range of $690 million to $710 million.", "Before I move on, as a general reminder, Slides 33 to 41 in the appendix provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations for 2013 and 2012 and reported GAAP cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.", "On Slide 24, you will note that we continue to execute our margin expansion actions. In both the third quarter and year-to-date, we drove a 170 basis point improvement in ongoing business operating profit margin. Price mix is on track, and we continue to expect to realize 0.5 points for the full year. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives contributed 1 point, consistent with our full year guidance. Net cost productivity was positive year-to-date as our actions more than offset material cost inflation of approximately $120 million to the first 9 months of the year. For the full year, productivity will more than offset approximately $180 million to $200 million of material cost inflation. We expect net cost productivity to deliver approximately 0.5 points in margin for 2013.", "Increases in marketing, technology and product investments are expected to reduce margins by approximately 0.5 points for the full year. As we manage all these margin drivers, we expect to deliver an ongoing business operating margin of greater than 7%, and we remain on track for our 8% margin target in 2014.", "Moving to the financial summary on Slide 25. Reported net sales were $4.7 billion, compared to $4.5 billion [ph] last year. Excluding the impact of both foreign currency and BEFIEX, sales were up over 5% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by strong growth in North America. Third quarter ongoing business operating profit increased 34% to $353 million, up from $262 million in the prior year, driven by higher sales, ongoing cost productivity and the benefit from cost and capacity reductions, more than offsetting higher material cost and unfavorable currency.", "The graph on Slide 27 illustrates expenses associated with our cost and capacity reduction program. The program results continue to be strong. For the full year, we still expect our program expense to be approximately $185 million, and we will deliver $175 million of operating profit benefit. We remain firmly on track to deliver the full $400 million in benefits we announced when the plan was initiated.", "On Slide 28, you see that our actions to deploy cash this year are aligned with our previously communicated priorities, which include funding the business for growth, including capital expenditures, refinancing our long-term debt maturities and contributing to our pension. We are also returning to our shareholders through an increased dividend. And since resuming our share repurchase program earlier this year, we have repurchased $140 million of company stock, leaving $210 million in funds remaining under our existing board authorization. Also, as Mike mentioned, we are on track to acquire a 51% majority stake in China's Hefei Sanyo at the end of 2014.", "Finally, in regards to next year's company outlook and consistent with prior years' practice, we will provide guidance for 2014 during our next conference call in late January, early February. However, we do anticipate continued earnings improvement, driven by both revenue growth and margin expansion. And given our cash flow generating capability and strong balance sheet, we will continue balancing funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thanks, Larry. Let me summarize on Slide 30. As we've said, both year-to-date and for the quarter, we're pleased with the progress that we're making in our results. And as we indicated, we have raised our guidance for 2013. Looking ahead, although we're not providing, today, any 2014 guidance, I did want to make clear the trends that we're seeing in the business. Overall, globally, although varied by market, we are seeing demand trends improving. We're very positive about our robust pipeline of new innovative products, and we expect it to have a positive impact on our customers and drive further revenue growth. We are seeing material costs, although still increasing, seeing the rate of that increase stabilizing. And we fully expect the current trends that we see in our business and our positive momentum to carry over through the fourth quarter and into next year. We also expect to get through the currency fluctuation impacts that we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year. So as a result, we are generating very strong underlying cash and growing our investment capacity to deliver upon our cash priorities.", "Finally, I would turn to Slide 31 and just say this is a slide we first introduced to investors in the fall of 2010 and say that we remain very confident in our opportunities to grow our business, expand our margins and generate strong free cash flow. We are executing on our long-term growth strategy to remain focused on delivering our shareholder value creation targets.", "So with that, I'd like to open the line up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Tom Mahoney", "This is Tom Mahoney on for Eric this morning. A question on the North America guidance for the fourth quarter. It looks like you're implying industry shipments up in the 10% range, which is pretty similar to what the industry did in the third quarter. What are you seeing in the market that gives you confidence in that forecast relative to the softer September shipment number we saw?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Tom, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me try to answer it and break it up in pieces. First of all, I mean, the overall industry, again, August, the industry was up 15%. September was \"only\" up 6%, but the entire Q3 was strong at 10.4%. And basically, what we're saying, we see the current momentum continuing into Q4. Let me make a couple of comments on some noise, which was out there towards the end of the quarter, beginning of October. First of all, and we made this point earlier, I would be extremely cautious looking at weekly industry shipment data. Depending on where certain shipments fall into, that can make a big difference. For example, we know at least one big retailer who took Black Friday shipments in August as compared to September last year, and that makes a big difference. More importantly, to keep in mind that the data you sometimes see is shipment data. That is not sell-through data. If you would look at the sell-through data, and we have about 70% of our retailers participating, we saw a small decline towards the end of September, October. By the same token, the early indicators of last week are somewhere between strong and extremely strong. That's why I'm saying be careful about weekly shipment data. And we saw a small blip, but it's completely normalized, and that gives us a lot of confidence about the Q4 industry shipments.", "Tom Mahoney", "Great. And then what is the driver if you guys outperformed AHAM 6 on your unit shipments in the third quarter? What is the driver of that, and what has changed relative to the first half where you underperformed? And specifically, what areas in North America are you gaining share?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Tom, it's again Marc Bitzer. Repeating a comment which we made at other earnings call, you're comparing T6 industry shipments with our overall unit shipments as we publish it. So there's a lot of things in units outside T6. There's also other products, like kitchen and small domestic appliances, which had a very strong Q3. So overall unit shipments, which we publish, are a lot of elements, way more than the just pure T6 where we look at the industry data -- or T7. Having said that, if you would just focus on the T7 and T6, I would say our market share is overall slightly stable and slightly down on a year-over-year basis. So it's not that we're kind of picking up huge market share, but we're pretty stable, which is a reflection of strong product launches, which we had. That's a positive. At the same time, we continue to stand firm on our promotional policy, which also means during the July promotion period, we lost a little bit of share, and picked it up back in August, September.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "My first question, on North America, the improvement that you continue to see there is solid. And with an 11% margin this quarter, you're kind of getting back to the 11% type of margin that you did mid-cycle last cycle. And so my question is kind of twofold. One, do you remain confident? During the last quarter, you saw a little bit of blip up in promotional activity, and I think during the past cycle that pricing was a little bit more of an issue. Any update in terms of promotional activities as you've seen them year-to-date relative to your expectations? And I think, bigger picture, do you see any structural changes in the industry, particularly in the competitive makeup of North America, the competitive marketplace, that would or would not support margins in North America being higher this cycle than previous cycle?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Mike, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me try to answer your question, which obviously has several pieces in there. Let me first make a comment on your word of mid-cycle. Mid-cycle implies that it's a normal cycle up and down. And I would like to remind ourselves, last year, same period, we already were trending towards operating margin of 7% or 8% in a bad industry environment. So what I would see right now is, to some extent, driven by industry, but to a much larger extent, driven by the actions which we took out on cost productivity, pricing, capacity reduction, et cetera. So we're kind of starting, if you want to say, for this industry cycle, on a much, much stronger base than, I would say and would argue compared to previous periods. So that's a big difference, which also means the industry volume is only one part of our strong margins, but not the only one. To your question about promotional activities, yes, we did see a slightly increased promotional activity by certain competitors who went pretty long on Black -- not Black Friday, on July 4th. We saw normal activities, what I would call, or as-expected activities around Labor Day. It's difficult to forecast what happens around Black Friday. And as you know, we don't comment on our future promotion plans. But I would argue, and we made the same comment in the Q2 earnings call, Q3 shows we stand firm behind our promotion policy, which means we will participate, but we will not participate when there is no value creation for either us or the trade partner.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "And Michael, this is Larry. One other thing, and just speaking in general for the company, when you talk about last cycle, our fixed cost structure is much different now than it was back then. So what you've seen in the last couple of quarters is the fact that we've seen revenue improvement volume increase on a much smaller fixed cost structure. So what you're actually seeing is just the power of the leverage.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "No, great, I appreciate that. And I guess, just flipping to the top line as my second question. You referred throughout the presentation, or here and there, and certainly, it's a big part of your longer-term strategy in terms of expanding adjacent revenue streams, growing beyond the core. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of, with the growth that you're seeing this year, the volume growth either globally or even by region would be more helpful, what you estimate that might have contributed to your results this year. And how do you think of that adjacent -- those adjacent streams -- of the 5% to 7% revenue growth, is that another -- is that a 1% to 2% driver, or how do you think about that? So kind of bigger picture, but also if you could provide any granularity on how it helped in 2013.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Mike, I can give you directionally what we're doing there. There's a lot of different pieces of our extend businesses. And again, extend businesses are businesses that we're able to create revenues off of because of our strong core. And the expand businesses are, let's say, new or expanded spaces that we can apply our brands and operating execution to. And so it's a wide variety portfolio, but it's very tied to those 2 things. And I would say, with the exception of global compressors, they're all growing. And as I had indicated before, we would expect them to grow at about twice the rate of our global core appliance business, if you will. I would say, this year, they're probably -- they're growing much faster than our global core appliance business. And they have very attractive margins that improve with that growth. So it's meaningful. In total, it's over 25 -- or over 20% of our total revenues. It's growing at a faster rate. There's many different examples we could use, but -- and it varies a little bit around the world. But particularly in Latin America and North America, we have a very strong portfolio of these business activities that are working very well right now.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I guess, just to pick up on Michael's question on the North America margins, if you take a look at where you were prior to Maytag, I mean, he was talking about 11% as mid-cycle. I remember quite a few quarters where you were putting up 12% kind of numbers and even, I'd say, 1 or 2 where you were pulling up a 13% handle. If you take kind of the capacity utilization numbers you've shared with us in the past and you take the contribution margin numbers you've shared with us in the past and you extrapolate that, it's pretty easy to get to kind of mid-teens margins for North America at full capacity. So why are we wrong to think about that as -- and I realize you can't control when you get to full capacity. That's a cyclical phenomenon. But why are we wrong to think about mid-cycle -- or peak margins as being mid-teens numbers?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "David, let me maybe take the macro view of that, and then I'd ask Marc to add his comments. First of all, I'd go back a little bit back to Marc's comment. I'm not sure that we could compare this to past cycles because the downturn was unlike any cycle we've ever seen. And so -- but on the demand, we're bullish in North America, and let's be clear, particularly in the United States. And that is because, from peak to trough, we're down 28%. The market is up 8% to 9% so far this year. So we still have a long way to go in terms of the drivers of demand. The housing market is moving in the right direction, we're very bullish on that. We think we'll see, over time, an acceleration in the replacement cycle based on the installed base. We expect to see -- and then very positively have seen the return of discretionary purchasers. So I think we're, as we've said before, at the beginning of a 3- or 5-year up cycle in demand. So your comment about increased production demand on capacity, it should be a positive productivity driver for us. The other thing, though, that I want to just make sure is clear with everyone on the call is it's a little bit comparing apples to oranges. The Whirlpool North America business today is the North America business 10 years ago. Post-Maytag, our portfolio mix changed dramatically. Now of course, we didn't -- it was not obvious to people because of the incredible downturn we saw in demand. But today, our brand -- our sale of products is significantly weighted toward own brands versus, in the past, a very high preponderance of OEM. That's a plus mix factor for us. We had elements of extend and expand. We now have businesses of extend and expand. And I don't want to miss out on what I think is the most important, is our rate of innovation, and the kings of innovation, is stronger than it's ever been. It's not even comparable to 10 years ago. So our portfolio is different today than it was a decade ago. So we're not going to give you a margin number. I would just say that we're committed to value creation. We're committed to both growth and margin expansion, and I think we have the tools to do that.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "David, it's Marc. Just to add a few comments on this one. First of all, just to echo what Jeff was saying, if you come back to this word of mid-cycle. If you look at the industry demand, I would strongly argue we're way, way earlier than mid-cycle, probably in the early innings of an industry recovery. And if you would look at typical demand cycles, even at the current growth rates, the industry is still below long-term trends. So we're far away from even remotely being at a mid-cycle in industry demand. So with this demand side, yes, I would say we're very bullish. Your question about the margin expectation, of course, we can't specify the exact margin forecast. To your point, it's driven by a number of factors. Capacity utilization or fixed cost leverage, because there's more than just factory capacity, is a big driver. And from that perspective, we are probably in a better shape than we ever have been, post-Maytag. The other parameters are materials. We can expect this leverage of commodity to cycle over and up, but right now, we see moderate materials. So that's the good news. But then you also have pricing, promotional activity versus volume, and as you can imagine, even with healthier margins, we are driving for -- harder for revenue growth. And that is an everyday decision, which we will continue to evaluate as we go into the respective quarters. But there's a couple of fundamental drivers which are part of this, but we also got to remind ourselves we're living in a competitive environment.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Great. Well, that was a great answer. Maybe I should've asked why we shouldn't expect high-teens margins. On Brazil, I wonder if you could just dig a little further into that. You put up a great volume number, despite the fact it sounds like your compressor units were down year-over-year. Can you just maybe break out for us how much of this might have been just acquired listings from sort of lost share by Mabe versus the innovation and the new product development? And then maybe you could just give us a feel for what non-Brazil versus Brazil look like.", "Michael A. Todman", "David, it's Mike Todman. First of all, let me just say, at the margin, the impact on price mix was positive for the quarter. So I think it's important to note -- to differentiate between ASVs and margin on price mix. And at the margin, we had -- actually, it was very strong, and we had good improvement. With respect to the overall ASVs and sales, I commented in the script on -- specifically on compressor sales, and we think we see those as just onetime temporary issues. We also did gain share in some categories that have lower price points. And so the fact of the matter is that did depress, if you will, our overall ASV, but those categories have very positive margins. So we actually felt -- we felt really good about the margins there. Outside of Brazil, we've got some markets that are very strong for us and where we had good growth. But then we've got markets like Argentina and Venezuela, where the demand was depressed. So overall, I'd say it was about stable. It was even if you take those 2 things in consideration.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Can you remind us what the percentage breakdown is between Brazil, non-Brazil and in Broco?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "The percentage of Brazil, non-Brazil, I believe probably around 60% of compressors would be Brazil.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "But in appliances?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "No, the Brazil appliance business...", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Was about $1.5 billion in total.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Just last question, if I could quickly. If you could talk about the Chinese acquisition and, I guess, the growth strategy once the deal closes? What's the 24-month to-do list look like? And how capital-intensive will that be?", "Michael A. Todman", "David, it's a little bit premature to talk about that. We're going through the regulatory approval process. Once we get through that process, we'll then provide a lot more color in terms of what we expect. I'll just -- suffice it to say, we're expecting some very positive contributions from the business and at very reasonable investment levels.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just want to ask some more questions on Latin America. We've been seeing some very positive data points from the big retailers in Brazil. So could you explain a bit about why you don't expect the subsidy program to have a relevant impact for appliances?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes. Denise, it's Mike Todman. Right now, we have not seen a huge demand increase from that. What we have seen is -- and the overall Brazil market in the quarter was actually flat. So there's just the -- that's just distribution changes between different retailers. We have picked up a lot of share, so actually, we saw significant share growth in Brazil for the quarter. And we are now seeing some more positive consumer demand. So we're seeing, in the fourth quarter, pretty strong demand coming through, but we don't think that, that's just the appliance program. We think it's the overall consumer sentiment, you've seen that currency rates now stabilized, and it's those kind of things in the environment.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great, okay. And in Latin America, I believe you used to say that your market share was about 40%. Could you update us on that?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, we gained about 5 points of share, so we were up in the quarter to about 45%.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Wow, okay. And just lastly, so -- I mean, you lowered your Latin America industry volume guidance, but your volumes have been so strong. So I mean, could you comment a little bit more on the competitive environment and just where your share's been coming from, and also on the pricing environment, please?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes. Well, I think you know, the competitive environment, we have one competitor who declared bankruptcy, and that's certainly been an opportunity for us. We continue to launch new products and new innovations into the marketplace, and so that's had a very positive impact for us. In fact, actually, we've taken price increases in the marketplace because of the currency and high inflation to be able to cover that. So that's been a positive as well. So overall, we feel pretty good about where this market is and where it's going.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Jeff, Marc, Larry. 11%. The last time you did that was 1Q '04. Can you talk about, in North America, how the seasonality of the business impacts margins to help give us a reference point for the current level of margins, kind of on a sequential basis?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. And first of all, let me add a general comment. I would say the North America margin seasonality is probably less compared to Latin America or Europe. I mean, you just have much more seasonal blips. And so I would say in general terms, the seasonality in our North America business is fairly limited. There's a couple of pluses and minuses. But take, for example, Q4. Yes, you have a fairly long holiday period which -- that you have lower margin. On the other hand, you have other businesses around kitchen and small domestic, which are more attractive, so it's pretty much a balance act. Typically, our Q3 and Q4 are slightly more profitable than the first 2 quarters, but only to a lesser extent. So in general terms, I wouldn't look at, right now, Q3 and Q4 season numbers. I would rather call them run rates.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. The 9%, you're pretty much that range for 4Q. Obviously, you talked about people's perhaps misinterpretation of volatile weekly data vis-\u00e0-vis shipments, vis-\u00e0-vis POS, so I appreciate that. Could you give us a little more granularity around the contractor versus the replacement splits that you guys are seeing out there in North America?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Ken, again, it's Marc Bitzer. I mean, obviously, we don't break down the forecast in terms of contract versus retail. But let me just...", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Or just the quarter.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Let me -- just for Q3, the business which we call contract, i.e., these are the national, large national builders and also some of the small builders, has been very strong. We're talking about in the ballpark of 40% to 60% up. So this industry is growing exceptionally strong. I know there's been a lot of press reports about housing slowing down. We don't see that.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. When we think about your 4Q, can you just give us a sense for where -- how much inventory -- and it varies by some of the channels, obviously, but how much visibility you have into your forward activity? So if there are 2 weeks, I know retailers might have 2 weeks, some retailers don't have large inventory. Builders, you have larger visibility because you bring your product in at the very end. But could you give us a sense how much insight you have? Or do you focus more on the inventory levels that are there or more on the POS? How should we think about that?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Again, Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. I mean, as much as we look about POS, we strongly look at inventory data from our retailers. And we typically have 70%, 80% of our retailers give us our -- their inventory data, so we have a pretty good visibility on this one. And yes, you're correct, it's a wide range. Some retailers, they don't hold inventory. Some other ones have 7% or 8% inventory. I would say the overall inventory level, with some pluses and minuses end of Q3, were balanced, i.e., there has not been significant inventory build. And we have also a little bit of inventory build towards the end of August. By the end of September, that's pretty much balanced out.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Now the margin gains that we did see, could you kind of help us think about -- I think, Larry, you kind of talked about a 20% general EBIT operating leverage in the business. I assume that's tied to volume. Can you tell us if that's correct, a? And then b, the improvement, how much of that is price mix, and how should we think about that?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, I think -- again, I think the incremental margins in general are right around what you had said, around 20%. What we saw in Q3 was about 0.5 point positive price mix. The cost and capacity reduction program contributed about 1 point. We were able to offset -- more than offset material cost and delivered about 0.5 points of productivity. And then marketing technology and product investments was approximately about 0.5 points. So we ended the quarter at about 7% to 8% [ph] profit margin. And the numbers I gave you is pretty much how we see the full year shaping up.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then my last question, do appreciate it, what are you going to do with all this cash you're generating? I mean, you've highlighted this Hefei [indiscernible] absorbed 500 and change of capital at some point at the end of 2014. Given the generation of cash, more of it abroad than domestic, how do you guys look to deploy that capital? And what vehicles would you have to bring it back to the U.S., where you could pursue more share repurchase programs?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, I guess, I think we've been pretty consistent about usages of cash, and we're doing everything we spoke about earlier. So we increased the dividend this year. We did begin repurchasing stock. Mike talked about the Hefei Sanyo acquisition. And in addition to that, we continue to fund the business. So those are really the levers that we continue to look at over time as the company generates cash, and we look at all of them. So that would be how we would utilize cash going forward. As far as cash and cash location, we look for tax-efficient ways to bring cash back in to deploy cash. And certainly, in this case -- and if we have a great opportunity on an international opportunity in China that's going to be very value-creating for the company, and so what you've seen us is deploy cash, and we will deploy cash into China.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Two thrusts of my questions. First off, I noticed that the marketing and technology R&D costs are now less of a headwind by about 0.5 points on the margin for the year. What's the reasoning behind that? It seems -- I mean, superficially, at least from externally, it looks like you had a little bit more raw material inflation, and you're maybe offsetting it with less R&D and marketing costs. Am I looking at that wrong?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Sam, this is Larry. I think probably what you're seeing is, as Jeff talked about earlier, industry guidance went up, so our sales forecast is up a bit. So we're getting a little bit more leverage on the dollars.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So the absolute level of spending has not changed there. Is that accurate?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "That's correct. We're still spending incremental dollars this year over last year, so yes, that's true.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, good. Next question, and this is even more fine-tuning around Latin America, can you quantify the compressor negative impact -- or what compressors were down in the quarter and -- both on a sales and possibly an EBIT line for us? Then I've got a couple of quick follow-ups in Latin America, also.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Sam, this is Larry again. Let me do it this way because there are some nuances in Latin America when you look at ASVs. So within sales, you have a mix -- as you know, you have a mix of appliances and compressors. And our reported units are only appliances. We do not report units of compressors. So if you were to do an apples-to-apples comparison and added the units to the compressors in sales, along with appliances, our ASVs were actually up. That's pretty much what I can provide you with.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So your ASVs were up. But can you help us with respect to what compressors were down and whether that's going to be a bleed-over into Q4?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "They were down -- again, Mike mentioned temporary reduction. So they were down in the double digits, and we do expect that to recover.", "Michael A. Todman", "Sam, just to add to that, I would say that what we expect is growth when you look at our total our business in the fourth quarter.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then BEFIEX remaining, and I noticed the run rate in Q4 is only $5 million. What do you expect the run rate for '14? And then also, for your industry growth expectation in Latin America of 1% for the year, can you remind us what that implies for fourth quarter industry shipments?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "A couple of questions. Let's handle BEFIEX first. We expect to end the year with around $90 million of credits, as we've talked before. About $50 million of that is related to legal fees, which we will not collect for several years. So really, you're talking a very small amount that would be monetized in 2014, around $40 million. That was your question in regards to BEFIEX. And what was your other question?", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Your 1% growth in Latin America for the year -- for the industry growth. What does that mean for Q4 specifically for the industry?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "You're probably talking up mid-single digits.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Up mid-single digits?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes.", "Operator", "And I'd now like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, listen, everyone. Again, we're pleased with the progress that we've made. Appreciate you participating on this call, and we'll look forward to updating you in late January.

Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation first quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Presidents, Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports, as well as in the appendix of the presentation.", "Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 35 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us here today. As you saw in our earnings release from earlier this morning, we are very pleased with the progress that we made in the first quarter. Despite some challenging global markets and foreign currency impacts, we were able to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth and our ninth consecutive quarter of expanded margins, which in total resulted in a record first quarter operating profit.", "We have been able to do that while at the same time we're increasing our investments in our business to continue this profitable growth trend going forward. Overall, we're firmly on track and remain confident in delivering our operating profit margin guidance, our earnings per share, and our free cash flow guidance for 2014.", "If you turn to Slide 6, I'll summarize our financial results, starting with, excluding the impact of foreign currency, our revenues were up 6% versus last year. Our ongoing business earnings per diluted share were up approximately 12% to $2.20 compared to $1.97 last year.", "Next I'll turn to Slide 7, where our regional industry demand assumptions or forecasts that we gave you earlier have not changed. For North America, specifically in the U.S., despite a challenging first part of the quarter, we remain confident in our industry demand assumption of 5% to 7% demand growth for the year, as we expect growth in U.S. housing for the full year, increased demand related to the replacement cycle of appliances, and significant improvement in discretionary demand that we're currently seeing improving.", "In Europe, we continue to expect flat to up 2% industry for the full year as the region has stabilized and now is beginning to recover. And for Latin America for the full year, we expect a flat industry, which is unchanged. And finally, our Asia forecast remains flat to up 3%, but varies significantly across the region.", "So in total, we do continue to expect positive global demand for the full year. Overall, we remain confident in the underlying drivers of our business and our focus on multiple paths to drive profitable growth. Our confidence in these areas has allowed us to significantly increase our investments in parts of our business, continue our profitable growth trend, as well as enhancing our returns to shareholders, as demonstrated by our recently announced 20% dividend increase and the new $500 million share repurchase authorization.", "So at this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer. Marc?", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 9 by reviewing North America's performance in the first quarter. Starting with the top line, in spite of flat industry driven mainly by the extreme weather in January and February, our unit volumes were up approximately 4% as we gained market share in the quarter. Net sales of $2.3 billion for North America were also up compared to the prior year period and up 5% excluding currency. We saw gross margins expand by 60 basis points in the quarter due to higher sales and ongoing productivity, more than offsetting higher material costs and unfavorable currency. We also increased our investments for our brand marketing and support of new product launches to drive continued growth.", "Our ongoing business operating margins were up approximately 10% for the quarter and a record first quarter ongoing business operating profit of $228 million compared to $218 million in the first quarter of 2013. The consistent and disciplined execution of our actions resulted in the fourth quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operating margin improvement.", "Now let me take a moment to talk about our expectations for 2014 as shown on Slide 10. While extreme weather created a temporary softness in U.S. appliance demand in January and February of this year, we've already seen a significant increase in March [indiscernible] industry up almost 9% and we continue to see positive trends in April. Additionally, we remain optimistic about both new construction and existing home sales, and we see increased demand from normal replacement purchases as well as discretionary purchases driven by improving consumer confidence. So we remain confident in our 2014 industry guidance of up 5% to 7% for the year, and in addition we expect positive net cost productivity for our business.", "We continue our focus on launching innovative new products, especially in the second and third quarters of this year. During this quarter, we also have a few examples of how we're driving growth beyond our core business, with our EveryDrop Water Filter and the expansion of our Greenville, Ohio plant to increase our capacity for small domestic appliances, just to name a few.", "Turning to Slide 11, you can see an example of our increased investments in marketing, technology and products, as we highlight a new phase of dependability for our Maytag brand with a massive TV and print ad campaign. On this page, you see our durable, reliable and powerful Maytag knobs and handles as well as a couple of [indiscernible] marketing pieces for our Maytag laundry and dishwasher products.", "I will now talk to our first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 13. Sales were $720 million compared to $668 million in the prior year. Excluding currency, sales increased approximately 4% for year driven by higher volumes from share gains and growth in our small domestic appliance business. The cost and capacity reduction initiative we put in place last year combined with ongoing productivity helped to deliver another quarter of positive operating profit. The operating profit of $7 million improved by $15 million compared to the prior year period and the operating margins improved 220 basis points.", "Now turning to Slide 14, while the market environment in the Eurozone remained somewhat soft, we are seeing some recovery and expect normal seasonality as we progress throughout the year. We expect positive operating profits and margin expansion driven by continued benefit from our ongoing cost productivity programs and our previously announced restructuring initiatives, and we continue to focus on our innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core.", "Turning to Slide 15, we're highlighting a new line of gas cooktops with glass surfaces and these cooktops have multiple design to complement a variety of kitchen styles, high power, high efficiency burners to reduce cooking times, and twin and full-coverage grids that allow maximum flexibility for our consumers.", "And now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks Marc. If you turn to Slide 17, you'll see our Latin America results. In the first quarter, the industry was up 10% while our unit volume grew over 15% as we continue to gain share. Sales for the quarter were $1.2 billion. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, net sales increased approximately 11% compared to the previous year, primarily driven by the higher volume.", "GAAP operating profit totaled $123 million compared to $130 million in the prior year period. Our ongoing business operating profit for the quarter totaled $109 million compared to $114 million in the prior year period. Favorable price and mix including price increases and ongoing cost productivity were offset by higher material cost and foreign currency.", "Turning to Slide 18 for our expectations of the region. As previously discussed, we expect the second quarter appliance industry can be down due to the World Cup, and given the government elections in Brazil and uncertain impact of inflation on consumer sentiment, we have kept our industry assumption flat for the year. We expect to continue outperforming the industry and growing our revenue, given our strong market position and current competitive environment.", "We recently announced the price increase for the second half to help offset negative currency impacts and significant levels of inflation. Our innovative new product launches are winning with consumers and we will continue growing beyond our core business. We remain confident in our Latin America business, and in particular expect improved performance in the second half of this year as we expect to realize the recent price increase benefits and the World Cup and tough currency comps will be behind us.", "Slide 19 shows how we continue to capitalize on the opportunities for growth in Brazil. Consumers in Brazil love their soccer and love their beer as well, particularly ice cold beer. The Consul brand is already a leader in refrigeration in the Latin America market, so we are excited to introduce a home beer cooler with a professional cooling system.", "Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 21. Net sales during the quarter were $166 million compared to $187 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 4%. Operating profit of $5 million improved by $2 million and operating margins improved 120 basis points compared to the prior year period. Favorable price and mix, including cost based price increases, as well as ongoing cost productivity offset lower unit volumes from a lower industry, increased raw material cost and foreign currency.", "Turning to Slide 22, despite challenging market environment, our margin expansion continues as our innovative products drive market share and improved mix and our ongoing productivity actions reduce costs. Additionally, we are on track to become the majority shareholder of Hefei Sanyo to accelerate our growth in the emerging Chinese market. We were pleased to see that Hefei Sanyo recently reported full year 2013 sales of approximately 860 million in U.S. dollars and increase of 33% compared to the prior year and operating income of approximately 60 million over 7% of sales. The transaction remains subject to approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, certain other regulatory approvals required by the relevant Chinese authorities and other formalities. We continue to expect the transaction to close anytime between the end of the second quarter and the end of 2014.", "Slide 23 shows an example of our product leadership in Asia this quarter where we highlighted the Whirlpool Icemagic refrigerator with best in class ice-making and bottle cooling, a Powercool zone to help consumers keep food safe during power outages common in India, and innovative storage solutions for our consumers' medicines and spices.", "Now I would like to turn it over to Larry.", "Larry Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results and are on pace to deliver a record annual performance which we communicated last quarter, as shown on Slide 25. We expect to deliver annual GAAP EPS in the range of $11.05 to $11.55 per share, and annual ongoing business EPS of $12 to $12.50. Our expectations for free cash flow remain at approximately $700 million. Overall, the underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong as evidenced by our continued sales growth and margin expansion as well as a strong balance sheet.", "As I speak to the financial results on slides 26 to 28, you will see how we continue to expand our ongoing business operating margin in the first quarter and expect to deliver another balanced approach towards margin expansion resulting in an 8 plus percent margin for the full year 2014. Price mix was up 0.5 point and we continue to expect to realize a 0.5 to 1 point of margin driven by our cost base price increases, innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core business. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives contributed another 0.5 point, consistent with our full year guidance.", "For the quarter, our cost productivity more than offset material cost inflation of $52 million to deliver a positive 0.25 point of margin expansion. Our ongoing cost productivity for the year is on track to fully offset approximately $150 million to $200 million of material cost inflation, and is expected to deliver a positive 0.5 point of margin.", "As planned and previously communicated, our increased marketing technology and product investments primarily reduced margins by 0.75 points during the quarter, and we expect to have a negative 0.5 point to 1 full point of margin impact for the year. Overall, our first quarter margins were on track with expectations and consistent with our expected full year improvement.", "In summary, for the first quarter, ongoing business operating profit increased driven by higher sales, positive price mix, ongoing cost productivity and the benefit from the cost and capacity reductions, more than offsetting higher material cost, currency and investments in marketing, technology and products.", "As we said back in January, we expect a stronger second half as productivity ramps up, Latin America price increases take effect, and World Cup and tough first half currency comparisons are behind us. Our continued margin improvements, combined with positive revenue growth enable us to deliver double-digit improvement in ongoing business earnings per share.", "The graph on Slide 29 illustrates expenses associated with our cost and capacity reduction initiative. The actions we have been taking over the past couple of years and into 2014 represent a generational change to our footprint in cost structure. As mentioned last quarter, we took additional cost and capacity reduction actions to address the soft but recovering European market and to continue to expand our margins. For the year, we continue to expect approximately $100 million of charges and $80 million of ongoing benefits.", "As we continue to improve margins and grow revenues, our plans to deploy the cash generated from our business are solid, as shown on Slide 30. We will fund the business for growth including capital expenditures between $625 million and $675 million. Last week, our Board approved the 20% increase in the quarterly dividend to $3 per share on an annual basis. Our Board also approved the new $500 million share repurchase authorization. Finally as Mike mentioned, we are on track with our acquisition of majority stake in China's Hefei Sanyo. The proceeds from our recent bond offering will be used to pay off $600 million of maturing debt during Q2 and Q3 that was for the acquisition of Hefei Sanyo.", "In summary, given our profitable growth trends, increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we will balance funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thanks Larry. Let me turn to Slide 32, where I'll summarize. Again, we continue to grow our revenue and expand our margins. With our innovative solutions for consumers, we are winning the marketplace and we are well-positioned to capitalize on positive global demand trends. As Larry and Mike mentioned, the Hefei Sanyo acquisition is progressing and provides an opportunity for transformational growth for us in China.", "We also continue to make investments and see very good growth in our beyond the core businesses are expand and extend, and in total as a result, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver a record year of performance in 2014, but equally important is our ability to continue to build upon this revenue growth, margin and earnings momentum to deliver medium and long-term shareholder value.", "Finally, I turn to Slide 33 which is our roadmap for growth and value creation, and I would just say we are very confident that we're executing in line with our long-term growth strategy. We are appropriately investing in our business and enhancing returns to our shareholders. As I said previously, as we achieve our 8% plus operating margin target and close the Hefei Sanyo transaction, we will provide updates to our shareholder value creation targets at the appropriate time later in the year. In the meantime, we'll continue to execute this strategy to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "So with that, I will conclude our formal remarks and we'll open this up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "I wonder if we could just talk about Latin America for a moment, I'm just trying to understand some of the moving parts here. You say the volumes were up about 15% against the 10% industry number, which is looks like you're holding your share gains down there, which is great to see. Revenue excluding FX up about 11%. But you say as well in your slide that the price increases are offsetting inflation and currency. Is it possible that price increases were achieved became the 4% difference between those numbers shy of FX?", "Michael A. Todman", "David, let me answer that. We took a price increase earlier on in the year at the beginning of the year, and now we were just executing a second price increase. So what we're expecting is the combination of all these price increases will offset all of the currency impact. But we're also looking to offset inflation, and inflation in the environment has been high. And so the price increase will offset both of those.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Your competitor earlier this morning talked about a 15% revenue growth in Latin America and said it was attributable almost entirely to price mix not volume. Can you help us understand the discrepancy?", "Larry Venturelli", "David, this is Larry. I think again what you're seeing is a little bit similar to what we saw in the quarter last year is, you got to remember on the unit side that we just have appliance units in there, we have a compressor and an appliance business. So what you're essentially seeing is the fact, if we were to combine both units from compressors and appliances and then calculate the ASVs on there, you would see the combined businesses being very positive. So it's just the abnormality we have as we're just reporting appliance units and not compressor units.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "David, this is Jeff. I just want to add one last point. I think you know there are three pieces of our Latin America business, Brazil appliance, the appliance market outside, 32 markets outside of Brazil, and our global compressor business, and of that it was under different conditions and Brazil appliance business is going very strong, very well, a large nation with countries like Argentina and Venezuela, et cetera, has been very unpredictable, and the global compressor business particularly because of China has been I would say weak in the first quarter but we're starting to see recovery as we go forward. So it's a number of these things but the biggest part, Brazil, we had a very good quarter.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Thank you for that detail. Could I just ask you to elaborate a little further on your observation as April has been good in the United States?", "Marc Bitzer", "David, it's Marc Bitzer, and let me expand the April comment more into the first quarter or so, not forward but backwards. As you well know, January and February was impacted very strongly by weather and quite still a lot of trade inventory moves. We've seen in March a very strong demand by way of both sell-in and sell-out, and we pretty much see almost the same level of strong momentum in marketplace throughout April, both sell-in and sell-out, which gives us a lot of confidence.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "And can you speak to the builder business as part of that or is it retail, I mean just could you distinguish between those two elements?", "Marc Bitzer", "No, I mean, David, first of all, it's both, but be also clear we saw \u2013 if you go back further in time, Q3, Q4, we saw exceptional strong momentum in builder business that by definition came down a little bit in January and February because of the momentum and you just could not complete certain houses and never \u2013 you know our appliances come in pretty much last, so you saw a little bit of dip on this one, but our builder business also in Q1 and the builder market from what we see has been up in solid single digits to high single digits.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "First question I had was on North American margins, a little bit up year-over-year but down sequentially, and I think in the past couple of years, I guess from a seasonality standpoint, sometimes it's up sequentially 4Q to 1Q, sometimes it's down, so I was wondering if you could highlight if there were any drivers on a sequential basis that took you down from the 11% that you did in the back half of '13 and also in 4Q itself down to a little under 10%, if those are kind of temporary, if you would expect to kind of get back to that 11% run rate that you did in the second half of last year?", "Marc Bitzer", "Michael, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, to make a long story short, we see the same strength for our margin in Q1 as we saw in Q4. Typically, what you expect between Q4 and Q1 is a slight dip in margins that comes largely from the seasonality of certain product types. It's less when you would for example see in Europe or other markets, but there is a small dip what you historically see.", "The other thing which I want to highlight or point towards also, and I made reference about it in the script, our margins in Q1 year-over-year, the gross margin is up 60 basis points, and you see that also that is offset largely by the brand investments. Most brand investments are also up sequentially even versus Q4 because we simply ramped up this massive Maytag campaign. So long story short, I mean our margin momentum I would say continues that strength.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And I would just add and again we're not going to dwell. The only surprise we saw at all in the first quarter what we talked about in January and February. We went from an industry which was running high single digit to low double digit in the last six months of last year to January February combined was like negative 5, and as soon as we got out of the challenging weather conditions in half the country, we went right back to the run rate industry demand before. So that was really the only difference. Our decision to invest more in new products and brand investment is very consistent with our strategy. We didn't stop any of those because of Jan-Feb shortfalls in volume because these were more long-lasting and these will fuel further revenue growth for us.", "Larry Venturelli", "Michael, it's Larry. Just keep in mind, when you look at volumes in North America Q4 to Q1, volumes are 20% to 25% lower in Q1. So you're just not getting the same leverage.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks for that help. And also on Latin America, just trying to get arms around the timing of the price increase, if that's something that you expect to go into effect in 2Q or is that more of a second half event, and as the flowing through of inflation and currency continues to impact that business, certainly on a year-over-year it was a solid, still solid result, but in terms of 2Q itself, given the timing of the price increase, et cetera, some of the cost, would you expect margins to dip a little bit in that quarter and then rebound in the back half of the year, just trying to get a sense of the timing?", "Michael A. Todman", "Michael, it's Mike. The price increase has already been announced and it will go into effect throughout the second quarter. So we'll likely see the real benefits of that price increase in the second half of the year. In terms of, and we stated, our experience has been this World Cup means that we're going to have lower demand in the second quarter, and so as you pointed out, yes, we do expect margins to be slightly lower but we expect a very strong second half as we both recover on the volume slide as well as the full impact of the price increases.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Great, appreciate it, thanks.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So just want to follow-up on your North America SG&A, you mentioned the Maytag campaign, so will we see that kind of spend continuing in the coming quarters or was that really a drag on SG&A in the first quarter because it's a small quarter and also it was weather impacted?", "Marc Bitzer", "Denise, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, also let me elaborate on SG&A and that is consistent with what we said earlier. If you look \u2013 if you will break down our SG&A into two components, one, call it infrastructure which is basically the [indiscernible] fixed cost [indiscernible] revenue generation which is [indiscernible] by investments, we held in North America our infrastructure expense as flat for the last two or three years and we will not change that going forward. So we will have a strong \u2013 we had a strong focus on maintaining that fixed cost for that.", "So the thing which we basically did is we dialled up our brand investments and [indiscernible] Maytag launch, we also have significant amount of product launches in Q2 and Q3 of a magnitude which we probably haven't seen in a long time, and that will be supportive by rev gen.", "Now having said that, let me get back to Larry's point, we have these brand investments, of course on a low volume base, you lose just some of the leverage, and that's by definition, but I mean with the revenues growing Q2 and Q3, that will probably somewhat change [indiscernible].", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Denise. So what you expect is \u2013 no, this wasn't a one quarter, this was kind of the rate we're spending. We had a very low demand quarter. As a percent of sales, it will likely decrease with the same dollar spend.", "Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, got it. And then, were there any kind of direct one-off costs from weather disruptions given the factory closures and the fact that you couldn't even ship out of that ladder for over a week, were those material?", "Marc Bitzer", "Denise, again it's Marc. First of all, that may be specific to [indiscernible]. We were not only impacted by consumers, but keep in mind we have a majority of factors up north. So, we have a lot of production in Ohio. Yes, indeed, it was very hard to get trucks out of Ohio which had a temporary impact on our logistic cost and [indiscernible] supply chain will always cost you something. It's not a huge [indiscernible] but it involves a one-time impact probably around $10 million to $20 million.", "Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you. Just one last one, you gave us the North America gross margin. Can you give us some sense of the other regions please?", "Larry Venturelli", "What was your question?", "Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Gross margins in other regions besides North America?", "Larry Venturelli", "I mean I think what you saw across the regions, as Marc just mentioned, international margin is also up. So what you're seeing is the benefit from the price mix improvement in the international businesses that have been able to offset a lot of the material cost inflation and FX that we have. So I would say globally very consistent to what Marc talked about in the North America picture.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "So, no good deed goes unpunished. You beat AHAM but [took out] (ph) margins. So I just want us to walk through what I think you already said. Marc, you just said $10 million to $20 million hit from weather, is that correct?", "Marc Bitzer", "Yes, that's what we said.", "Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Would that be considered \u2013 hopefully one time, but that would be a sequential benefit, right, to whatever the run rate is?", "Larry Venturelli", "That would be correct.", "Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Now the $10 million to $20 million hit that you just described, does that represent more of a margin drag if you will or the cause for lack of margin expansion, is that greater than the SG&A investments that you just described, given your 60 basis point improvement in gross margin, just trying to get a sense of magnitude here?", "Marc Bitzer", "Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. Obviously you can do the math. If SG&A went up 0.5 points, on the revenue base you can do the math. So by definition, it's even the ballpark is much likely less and [indiscernible] logistics cost is slightly less. I mean logistics cost technically flows into our gross margins. So that is not showing up in the fixed cost, that is in the variable cost.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Ken, this is Jeff. If you start back, take a global look and go down the key drivers of our business, volume was a little bit weaker than we expected, largely due to the U.S. that we talked about. We know, we've seen that [indiscernible]. So that's \u2013 we don't see any other big changes around the world. Price mix, we were up I think 0.5 point, we've guided for the year to 0.5 point to 1 point, and with some of the cost based price increases that are kicking in, we still feel very good about that.", "Next one, productivity. As always, our productivity ramps up throughout the year. That will be especially true this year where we had a weak demand in the first quarter or so, that's a negative productivity, so a return to normal demand plus our normal ramp up during the year productivity will be a big lever. Restructuring benefits, those will flow and we got them in the first quarter and those will flow throughout the year.", "The offset is increased brand and product investment, but in total, the walk if you will from last year to this year, we remain confident in delivering our 8 plus percent margin for the whole year. So by definition, yes, our run rate will increase.", "Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thank you. If we look at the \u2013 well, let me ask about your cash flow because I think we're getting to the point now that investors are getting more focused on that, as you are, with the pending Hefei acquisition as well as the announced share buyback, now you guys did some buybacks last year but it was mostly for share options if you will, could you comment on how much of that $500 million is dedicated to net share repurchases, A, and then B, given that you talked about Hefei on the call here and you did mention China in relation to your compression being kind of weak, could you just start giving us a context so investors have some context when you guys do acquire the company for what is happening in China and we can start getting used to your language for that region? Thank you.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Ken, this is Jeff. I go back to use of cash, investing in the business which we're doing at an interest rate, paying down debt [indiscernible] et cetera were very predictable on drag, return to shareholder, as we did last year we both increased the dividend and have an authorization for $500 million, and we have the very important M&A in Hefei Sanyo. So, we're very much executing to what we've been communicating is our plan. Last year we purchased $350 million which was by the way our authorization. We don't have any defined time period for the current authorization. We typically fund out of free cash flow generation.", "Your question on dilution at today's stock price would probably run around 1 million shares a year dilution. So I mean clearly that's, if done today it would be a net reduction but again that we've done over some period of time, and we really can't give you, as we said in the very beginning I guess last July, that as soon as we close, because this is a publicly traded company, in China we cannot disclose non-public information of Hefei Sanyo.", "So, we will not be able to give you all the details of the impact it has on us. I mean you do have the end of the year data point which is clear and shortly after we close or whatever is appropriate, we'll go through in great detail both the impact on earnings standpoint on an ongoing basis, our expectations of growth in earnings and cash.", "Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Right, I understand that. I guess just trying to keep the commentary constrained to your current business, you did highlight compressor, when you're talking about Latin America, different business, and you did highlight compressor had some weakness in China, related to China, that's the\u2026", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Ken, the Chinese market and depends on which product category, but first quarter was weak. There's different data but it was double-digit declines. We don't think that's a forever thing there it's going through, there has been some slowdowns in China. We were comping over a really big previous year of growth. It looks like it's starting to level out. So, yes, China was \u2013 which affected both our compressor business and our appliance business, and Hefei Sanyo has not reported their first quarter yet, so there's nothing we can really say about that.", "Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "I understand. I was just [indiscernible]. And then if you would \u2013 I'll follow-up with you guys offline. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Two more broad questions if I might. First about Europe, a few years ago, Jeff, you mentioned that I think you needed about 6% operating margin in order to earn your cost of capital. That was prior to I believe all your restructuring efforts. What margin do you now need to earn your cost of capital in Europe and can you achieve that without further material restructuring and/or industry consolidation at this point?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, Sam, that's correct. I think I said 5.5% to 6% given our asset base and so on is where we needed to be. We absolutely believe we can get there and now are starting to show the path to get there, and it's a combination of what I call self-help, what we're doing from a fixed cost reduction in that which is support by the restructuring that we're doing, and by the way getting the benefits for, our ongoing productivity, our investment product innovation, and I think you're starting to see the accelerated growth that we're getting, and absolutely, a stable or modestly growing market will certainly accelerate that. So, we are on track for that. I think we're going to make a very large step forward this year quarter by quarter and every asset that we have has to be able to earn us return and Europe is no different.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "So to paraphrase then, the 6% or so, 5.5% or 6% is still the necessary bogie and you don't need anything dramatic to happen incremental to prior \u2013 to previously announced actions then?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, what I've said is that we will take the appropriate cost and capacity and investment decisions needed to do that, and we have, we've announced a number of them. On the go \u2013 I can't tell you go forward what we need to do, but I will say go forward we will get to 5.55 to 6% or hopefully better.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Got you. Second question, your U.S. market share, at least domestic market share, was quite good this quarter. You did have an easy comparison on a year-on-year basis. At least directionally, I won't hold you to specificity, but directionally how should we think about your U.S. market share over the next few quarters? Knowing the comps get harder and you're not going to be matching a whole lot of promotional activity but you do have some new products coming and you have a builder mix that's favorable. So how should we directionally think about your market share trends over the next few quarters in the U.S.?", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam, it's Marc. First of all, pleased to hear the compliment on Q1 markets. I wouldn't call last year's baseline easy in any case, and as you know, we really don't give quarterly guidance on market share. Having said that, our market share is both sequentially and year-over-year up, that is correct. It was not done through promotions or by [indiscernible] activities, what you've seen in gross margin. This basically tells you the product launches, this innovation without overly aggressiveness on promotion, we get to steady good run rate in market share and we're comfortable with current levels.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Last question, just real quick. The BEFIEX, I think if my math holds, you will not be recognizing anymore BEFIEX credits this year and are we done or what's the status on that program?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Based on what we know today, we did monetize 14 million in the first quarter and right now we would not anticipate anything if it stays for the rest of the year.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "What's left to be \u2013 what's still unrecognized?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "There's $53 million left there tied into legal or large that will be settled over the next few years.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Very good. Thank you, all.", "Operator", "We'll take our final question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "On the U.S. market share showed us for some further detail, it seems like the Maytag and the bigger than normal year of the product launches are still in front of you. So talk a little bit about what allowed the share progress in the first quarter, and if I'm correct, there is incremental new product coming to market that should sustain or perhaps expand the market share benefit in 2Q and beyond?", "Marc Bitzer", "Eric, it's Marc Bitzer again. I mean what we saw in Q1 in particular are still carryovers of largest product launches [indiscernible] particularly top loader line just called [fusion] (ph) and where we're going to help the market share gains. Our cooking products are running extremely well. It's exceptionally strong category, and we said it's also carrying over in Q1. And on top of that you had just the Q1 industry just from the overall industry, and that's impacted by Q4 promotions, and as we said last year, we are not participating that much in aggressive promotions. So you see we expect all of this met [indiscernible] for Q1 lift. But at the same time, you're correct. There is a significant amount of product launches ahead of us in Q2 and Q3 that were based on initial trade partner reactions very confident about.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "A follow-on on that, if you could give a little bit of color of Maytag which has been around for a while but it seems like you're more excited about the new product efforts and attraction and the response from the trade, can you just frame a little bit of strategically what you're doing with Maytag in terms of channel or price point or position and then also the magnitude of the uptake you're seeing from the channel on these new products?", "Marc Bitzer", "Eric, it's Marc again. I think to really get into detail, it's probably more subject to a [one point] (ph) investor conference to really show you the entire Maytag value creation strategy. But to basically make it short, I mean the Maytag as a brand still stands for exceptional quality and reliability. I think it's fair to say that the last decade probably and before the Maytag brand [indiscernible] all the product deserves, but this is what we're changing, okay. We have a complete new product line which I think fully represent what the Maytag brand and consumer mind stands for and that is accompanied by a very big brand we launched with both TV and ad.", "To be also clear, we started the TV and ad campaign, the products themselves will be launched end of May or early June. So you don't yet see that in the market. But of course we already introduced it to the trade and there is a lot of additional flooring which we will get from this.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Okay, well, if there's no more question, I would just like to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next time.

Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Presidents, Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports, as well as on Slide 2 and in the appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 39 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our earnings release from earlier today, overall, our results were largely in line with our expectations. As we\u2019ve managed through a challenging short-term global demand environment. Our second quarter ongoing business earnings per share were up 11% versus last year, and these results were primarily driven by record profits in our North America business. Overall, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong. we received global demand trends improving, and we expect second half earnings to ramp up due to a variety of reasons.", "If you turn to our financials on Slide 6, excluding the impact of foreign currencies, our revenues were up about 1% versus last year. Our ongoing business earnings per diluted share increased by 25%, or up approximately 11% to $2.62 compared to $2.33 last year.", "Turning to Slide 7, and factoring in the first half actual performance for industry demand, we have revised our regional industry demand assumptions. Globally, we expect second half industry demand levels to improve versus first half. For North America, and specifically the U.S., we have revised our industry demand assumption to be up about approximately 5% per year.", "We did have a slow start for the year in January and February, but March \u2013 since March, March through June, we\u2019ve had very strong growth over 6%. So this adjustment really just reflects the slow start, which we saw in January and February.", "In Europe, we see about the same. we continue to expect flat to up 2% industry for the full year as a region continues its recovery. For Latin America, we are revising our industry assumption to flat to minus 3% for the full year. Again primarily due to the short-term impact that we expected and saw from this year\u2019s World Cup and some uncertainties around government elections in Brazil. And finally our Asia industry forecast is flat for the full year, with China being down for the year and India being up. Again overall we remain very confident in the underlining fundamentals of our business and have multiple opportunities to achieve profitable growth.", "Today our business performance has put us in a very strong position as a company. This has allowed us to enhance our returns to shareholders as we announced in April dividend increase and $500 million share repurchase authorization. We have significantly increased our brand and product investments and we will see acceleration in new product introductions in the second half of the year.", "But at the same time we are significantly improving our global operating platform. And this has demonstrated by our recently announced agreements to purchase majority stakes in Indesit Europe and Hefei Sanyo in China. This will allows us to significantly increase the scale and size of our operations in both of these important markets in the world. So on total we are very well positioned we are on track for a record year of operating performance. And we are setting up a platform for future growth and very strong value creation.", "So at this point in time we will get into regional details and I\u2019d liked to turn it over to Marc Bitzer.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Let me begin on slide 9 by reviewing North America\u2019s record performance in the second quarter. Starting with the top line, net sales of $2.7 billion for North America were up 3% compared to the prior year period and up 4% excluding currency.", "So operating margins expand by 60 base points in the quarter due to unit volume growth in US major appliances and the benefit of ongoing cost productivity along this cost and capacity reductions. More of an offsetting unfavorable currency and higher material cost, we also increased our investments for our brand marketing and support of new product launches that drives continued growth.", "Our ongoing business operating margins were 10.6% for the quarter, the record second quarter, ongoing business operating profit $285 million compared to $262 million in the second quarters of 2013. The consistent and disciplined execution of our actions resulted in the fifth quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement.", "Now let me take a moment to talk about our expectations for 2014 as shown on slide 10, overall we were pleased with our record operating profit in the first half. US appliance demand has rebounded from a slow winter start as March through June T7 industries up 6.6% compared to the prior year. However we are adjusting our full year industry forecast to approximately 5% which is the lower end of our previous guidance range as we don\u2019t expect benefit to fully make up from a slow start with 7% growth level. Macro economic indicators point to a strong second half as we are seeing the lowest unemployment rates in September 2008.", "New housing starts and existing home sales are improving and live in ranges of our expectations for the year. And finally we believe strong replacement demand will continue as consumers replace older appliances for our innovative energy efficient product. In addition we expect positive net cost productivity from our ongoing programs to accelerate in the back half of the year. And in the second half of the year we are excited to launch many innovative new products in almost every four business product category. We are also driving growth beyond our core business as shown by our recent announcement that Procter & Gamble to introduce a revolutionary at-home clothing care system called Swash. And our expansive fleet of launches within the KitchenAid small appliance business.", "Turning to slide 11, you can see an example of our new Maytag dishwasher that is part of our new Maytag brand design that follows our successful Maytag Man brand campaign. Maytag dishwashers are our quietest dishwasher ever with strengths to handle tough loads. It also features in the industry exclusive stainless steel silverware basket and a tiered upper rack to hold large plate and taller items.", "I will now talk to the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on slide 13. Sales were $746 million, compared to $731 million in the prior year, excluding currency, sales decreased approximately 3% year-over-year.", "The cost and capacity-reduction initiatives, which will put in place combined with ongoing productivity programs and improved product mix, have delivered another quarter of positive operating profit. Operating profit of $2 million improved by $8 million compared to the prior year period and operating margins improved 110 basis points.", "Now turning to slide 14, our market environment in the Eurozone remains somewhat soft and expect \u2013 and we are seeing some recovery and expect normal seasonality as we progress throughout the year. We expect positive operating profit and margin expansion driven by continued benefits from our ongoing cost productivity programs, and our previously announced restructuring initiatives. And we continue to focus on our innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core, specifically with the growth we\u2019ve seen in the KitchenAid small appliances categories within Europe, Middle East and Africa.", "Turning to Slide 15, as Jeff mentioned, we were extremely pleased to sign the binding agreements to become majority shareholder of Indesit. We are trying a 66.8% voting stake in Indesit from Merloni family for \u20ac11 per share. To date, we have acquired 4.9% of voting shares of Indesit. Value of this transaction is \u20ac758 million, or approximately $1 billion.", "In addition to the share price, Whirlpool would assume indebtedness of Indesit front loading, and we intend to pay for this acquisition with cash on hand together with private, domestic and international public debt financing. And we expect judicial and the regulatory approvals by the end of 2014. Once the transaction is closed, we will launch a mandatory tender offer in accordance with Italian law to acquire additional shares.", "Slide 16 highlights our opportunity to create significantly more efficient and value creating appliance business in Europe. With a tremendous strategic fit for complementary country positions, products, brands and distribution, and with efficiencies in R&D, capital spending and value chain costs, as well as operational scale, which increased volume and more effectively, integrating our product platforms.", "Now given our proven track record of generating value with our acquisitions with high confidence and our ability to execute this transaction successfully, and we expect to more than double our presence in the world\u2019s largest appliance market and create value for our shareholders. Once we complete the integration for the reason that I previously described, we expect our combined European business to EBIT margin of 7% to 8% and free cash flow generation of 6% to 7%, which will make Europe a significant contributor to the overall financial results of Whirlpool Corporation. And we expect it will take about three years to fully achieve its benefit.", "Following the closing of a transaction, we will provide investors with our detailed plans on how we intend to create this profitable growth and shareholder value with recent important acquisition in Europe. And now, I would like to turn it over to Mike.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Marc. If you turn to slide 19, you will see our Latin America results. As expected our second quarter results were primarily impacted by lower demand as consumers focused on ground goods purchases during the World Cup. Sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, despite industry volumes being down approximately 17%, our net sales excluding currency and BEFIEX decreased approximately 4% compared to the previous year.", "We continue to gain share both year-over-year and sequentially as we benefited from our compelling brands and the beginning of new product introductions. We also benefited from previously announced price increases for which the benefits will accelerate and increase in the second half of this year. Our ongoing business operating profit for the quarter totaled $87 million compared to $111 million in the prior year period.", "Improved product price and mix was more than offset by lower unit volumes, higher material cost, and foreign currency. GAAP operating profit totaled $87 million compared to $135 million in the prior year period which included $24 million of BEFIEX tax credits.", "Turning to slide 20, for our expectations of the region and given the continuation of the World Cup in July and the government elections in Brazil, we are now lowering our industry assumption to flat to down 3% for the year. However, we continue to believe that the macroeconomic indicators in Brazil point a long-term healthy demand growth as unemployment is at historically low levels below 5%. Real wages are growing, inflation is within the target range, and debt as a percent of income is primarily driven by increased investments in housing.", "All of these signs are positive for appliance industry growth. We also expect to continue outperforming the industry and growing our revenue given our strong market position and current competitive environment. Our recently announced price increases will impact the second half by helping to offset negative currency impacts and significant levels of inflation experienced throughout the year. And we are launching over 100 new models in the second half across all product lines and with exciting innovation.", "In summary, we do expect the strong second half performance in our Latin America business due to the already discussed price increase benefits, the launch of exciting new products and the tough currency comparisons being behind us.", "Our second quarter results in the Asia region are shown on slide 23. Overall market demand will soft, but improved versus the first quarter as the Chinese economy continues to grow at a more moderate pace. In addition to the overall slow down in China, our business was down significantly. Our trade customers began reducing their Whirlpool inventory in anticipation of the integration with Hefei Sanyo and the expected delivery of new product lines. This resulted in a sales decline of over 80% for the second quarter compared to prior year period and therefore had a significant impact on margins and production.", "We expect that after the transaction closes, we will return to far more positive revenue growth as we launched our new integrated product lines. The short-term trade actions are having a significant impact on our current business due to reduced shipments and production volumes as indicated in our adjusted guidance.", "Post-approval, we are confident this acquisition will put us in a very strong position as we entered 2015.", "Net sales during the quarter were $211 million, compared to $246 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 9%. GAAP operating profit of $4 million, compared to $14 million in the prior year, and operating margins declined 370 basis points, compared to the prior year period. The benefits of cost based price increases in ongoing cost productivity were more than offset by the trade adjustments of volume in China, higher material costs, and foreign currency.", "Turning to slide 24, we continue to execute ongoing productivity actions and cost based price increases across the region to offset inflation and currency and to execute new product launches. We are also on track to become the majority shareholder of Hefei Sanyo to accelerate our growth in the emerging Chinese market.", "As shown on slide 25, and as previously announced, we are in the process of acquiring a 51% stake in Hefei Sanyo for approximately $547 million. Hefei Sanyo\u2019s expanded distribution, competitive products, and complementary manufacturing combined with a proven management team and significant capacity to enable growth will provide us with an outstanding platform for growth in China.", "As you can see on slide 26, the approval process in line with our expectations, and we have received the majority of the required approvals for this transaction over the past 12 months. The transaction remains subject to the Chinese securities regulatory commission approvals, tax clearances, and payment approvals as well as share registration at closing. We continue to expect the transaction to close by the end of this year, or possibly by the end of the third year.", "Investment, integration, and transition cost, which began in the second quarter, will have a negative impact to earnings and cash during 2014. However, once combined, we expect this transaction will be meaningfully accretive in 2015, which would be the first year post-integration.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Larry.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we are on pace to deliver another record year of ongoing business operating performance as shown on slide 29. We are adjusting our full-year guidance to reflect the impact of investment and integration cost related to the pending acquisitions of both Hefei Sanyo and Indesit.", "As Mike mentioned, our trade customers in China are reducing their inventories and anticipation of our integration with Hefei Sanyo, which is impacting both our GAAP and ongoing EPS guidance by approximately $0.50 per share. And the pending acquisition of Indesit in Europe is impacting our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.25 per share, as we incur additional investment expenses in 2014.", "Our guidance for annual GAAP diluted EPS is now in the range of $10.30 to $10.80 per share, and annual ongoing business diluted EPS is now $11.50 to $12 per share, which represents a 15% to 20% improvement versus a year ago. Our expectations for 2014 free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million now reflect the impact of these two adjustments.", "Overall, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain very strong as we continue to invest in our business and bring innovative products to our consumers across the globe. As I speak to the financial results on slides 30 to 32, you will see how we continued to expand our ongoing business operating margin in the first half, and expect to deliver another balanced approach towards margin expansion, resulting in an 8% plus margin for the full year.", "For the first half, price mix was up 0.5 point, and we continue to expect to realize 0.5 to 1 point of margin, driven by our cost based pricing increases, innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core business. Our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives contributed another 0.5 point consistent with our full year guidance.", "For the first half, our cost productivity more than offset material cost inflation of $100 million to deliver a positive quarter point of margin expansion. Our ongoing cost productivity for the year is on track to more than offset approximately $150 million to $200 million of year-over-year material cost inflation, and expected to deliver a positive 0.5 point of margin through 2014.", "As planned and previously communicated, our increased marketing technology and product investments, primarily reduced margins by a 1 point during the first half. And we expect them to have a negative 0.5 to 1 point of margin impact for the year. Overall, our fist half margins were firmly on track with expectations and consistent with our expected full year improvement.", "For the second quarter, ongoing business operating profit benefited from improved product price and mix, ongoing cost productivity and the benefits from cost and capacity reductions, lower volumes, largely attributable for the short-term impact from the World Cup in Brazil, higher material cost, unfavorable currency and investments in marketing, technology and products, negatively impacted results.", "We continue to expect a stronger second half as we introduced a significant number of new products, productivity ramps up, Latin America price increases fully take effect and tougher first half currency comparisons are behind us. We believe our expected margin improvements combined with positive revenue growth will enable us to deliver strong double-digit improvement in ongoing business earnings per share during the second half.", "Graph on Slide 33 illustrates expenses associated with our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives. The actions we have been taking over the past couple of years, and into 2014, represented generational change to our footprint in cost structure. The additional cost and capacity-reduction actions we took early in year, which we addressed this out by recovering European market and continued to expand our margins.", "For the first half, we incurred approximately $63 million of charges, and for the full year, we expect approximately $100 million of charges and $80 million of ongoing benefits. As we continue to improve margins and grow revenues, our plans to deploy the cash generated from our business are solid, as shown on Slide 34.", "We are funding the business for growth and significant product introductions in the second half, including capital expenditures between $625 million and $675 million for the year. We\u2019ve recently increased our quarterly dividend on the company\u2019s common stock and authorizing the share repurchase program.", "Finally, as previously mentioned we are on track with our acquisition, majority stake in China\u2019s Hefei Sanyo and have recently announced our intention to purchase the majority stake in Italy\u2019s Indesit. In summary, given our profitable growth trends increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we will balance funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Thanks, Larry. I\u2019ll summarize our expectations for this year on Slide 36. As we mentioned, we are expecting to significantly ramp up our second half earnings, based on what we\u2019re seeing our improvement in global demand trends, our continued investments in our brands and new products will support a very strong lineup of new innovative product introductions during the second half. We are achieving higher prize mix, which should continue an accelerated rate in the second half, and finally, the normal higher seasonality of productivity, we fully expect to happen.", "Additionally, as I mentioned in the previous remarks, the Hefei Sanyo acquisition provides us a true transformation on growth opportunity in China. We will more than buyback to our size in this very important emerging market. And the Indesit acquisition in Europe provides a various significant opportunity to position our European business for competitiveness, leading the growth and ongoing value creation; both of these transactions are on track to close by the end of the year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver another record year of operating performance in 2014.", "Further out, I would like to turn to slide 37, which really highlights how we\u2019re creating multiple paths to profitable growth. First, I would remind that our North America region, we believe we are still in the early stages of the replacement cycle, as well as a multi-year housing rebound, and as we mentioned in the last call, we\u2019re beginning to see improvements in discretionary demand.", "So we see several years ahead of us with good industry demand growth. Secondly, our pending acquisition of Indesit in Europe is a very important part of a comprehensive strategy and provides us to improve our competitive position in Europe, and very importantly, create a consistent and meaningful source of value creation for our shareholders.", "And again, Hefei in China establishes a broad platform for growth in China\u2019s emerging market, which still has world levels of appliance penetration, as we will 10x our distribution throughout that country. We also have very good opportunities to increase appliance penetration and continue to gain market share throughout the Latin American regions, given our strong brands, our proven gains of innovation and overall cost leadership.", "In addition, as we continue to expand globally, we have opportunities to fully leverage our fixed cost structure, and ongoing cost productivity programs to ensure our competitive position and continuing to improve our margins. We have a strong cadence of bringing innovative products to consumers and leveraging the best brands in the appliance industry around the world.", "We are driving both revenue and margin world by also extending and expanding beyond our core appliance business, where such products that you\u2019ll see on KitchenAid small appliances line, which will now sell in the many, many markets around the world and also, our water business where we\u2019re growing in all parts of the world.", "So in total, we believe these multiple paths to profitable growth provide us with great opportunity to achieve our value creating objectives and we will ensure that we continue to deliver strong value creation for our shareholders.", "So with that, I\u2019d like to end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. good morning, everyone.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Hi, Mike.", "Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "First question I had was actually, and obviously a lot of activity in China and Europe, but I wanted to focus on your biggest region, the North American market, and specifically, just get a little bit of incremental color if possible on the trends during the quarter, as you mentioned, volumes improved in the second quarter and maybe perhaps not enough to maintain the overall shipment guidance. But if you could go into a little bit more detail in terms of the competitive market, if you view from a competitive standpoint, if incentives or discounts in the industry are stable, how you\u2019re seeing some of the different end market drivers, new construction versus repair a model, any kind of interesting trends from both the end market perspective, and the pricing and discounting perspective.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. Thanks for the questions, it\u2019s obviously, 10 questions embedded in one question. So let me try to give you \u2013 split it up in both industry and then our own performance in this quarter. First of all, on the industry, if you just look at the second quarter, the U.S., the market actually has grown 5.8% in T7, which basically the exact in the range of what we earlier indicated 5% to 7%, and the reason why that\u2019s exact from the range is because the underlying macroeconomic indicated are exactly what we have them, i.e., if you look at housing starts, we continue to see above $1 million, existing home sales (indiscernible) new number we always said it\u2019s slightly above $5 million, it is slightly above $5 million and unemployment rates are favorable, or getting better.", "So I would say from a fundamental growth drivers from a market, nothing has changed, the only difference on a full year perspective is just kind of the last six or eight weeks that we have in Q1, I don\u2019t think the markets are strong enough to just mathematically make it up for rest of the year.", "But the underlying run rate of the industry, we still see in the original 5% to 7% range, and that\u2019s an important factor and everything, which we see today on current trends are exactly confirming that direction. You ask about the overall promotional environment, I would say same comments as I made the last earnings call, by and large unchanged, there\u2019s always promotions in the market, we participate when we can create value for our brands and our shareholders. And if we don\u2019t see, we don\u2019t participate.", "So we don\u2019t see a radical change in the second quarter, based on promotional activities. If you now come a little bit more to our own performance in the second quarter in the units and I also saw in the earlier analyst reports, I think there may be some confusion out there. Yes, it is true, that for Whirlpool North America, we published 0.6% volume decline.", "However, it is very important that we made that point earlier, these units encompass way more when these T7 industry shipments, which typical people compared to. In these units, (indiscernible) 6% it\u2019s the T7, it\u2019s the additional major domestic, which we call T12, it also includes Mexico, it also includes Canada, and it also includes more domestic appliances.", "If you would just go down to the T7, which we don\u2019t think we don\u2019t typically publish, but we have roughly a mid single-digit unit growth, which would indicate that we\u2019re pretty much held our market share by and large. And that is despite, and that is an important despite, us having availability issue on our laundry products, which is our biggest category. But it is also important to note these availability issues are behind us they were Q2 events and they are behind us and we are fully back on track.", "Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "That\u2019s a great answer. I appreciate all the detail, just as quick second question for Larry, if I could, the guidance coming down about $0.50 on an operating basis, fully attributable to the China trade inventory issues, but additionally, your industry outlook for several regions was notched down a little bit. So I was wondering if there was anything in the overall view that\u2019s kind of offsetting a look for a little bit of reduced volume if that\u2019s from the margin side or corporate expense or any of the other line items?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "", "Yes, Michael we mostly took down our industry guidance assumptions in North America, Latin America and you\u2019ve seen the Asia adjustment reflected in our guidance, I think the thing to point out is that if you look at countries like Latin America, where we are gaining share and we are benefiting from price increases that is largely enabled us to offset the industry guidance change.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Michael this is Jeff, I would add to give the industry assumptions for demand are marginal. And they really reflect what\u2019s already happened in the first six months. So, on a go forward basis we feel actually pretty good about run rates for demand and on top of what we can do in the second half. So we see a actually improving demand revenue growth environment for the second half.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "", "I just add Michael, if you look at the half point sales run rate we mentioned a few things, Marc mentioned January, Feb weather had a lot of currency in the first half, World Cup availability, China customer inventory reductions, if we strip that all away, our half one run rate is in the mid single-digit. And that certainly supports what we would expect in the second half of the year.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Okay, next question.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead your line is open.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, okay, thank you for taking my question. So just in terms of the laundry supply issues that you had in North America, can you kind of quantify how big that was?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Hey, Denise its Marc, we are not going to go into the specifics of quantifying it. However it has been material, I mean, laundry is overall biggest category and majors and we basically in preparation for a major product launch which we have in Q3, we had to some what limit the production capacity as we go through this massive shift on the assembly line and the tools. So for temporary that was a about six week issue, but six weeks of laundry (indiscernible) availability have material impacts, I would just directly say its clearly above $10 million, clearly.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, got it. And then in \u2013 term can you talk a little bit more about the pricing increase that you are putting through this quarter, and what you are seeing for orders after the World Cup?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, Denise, it\u2019s Mike Todman. We had already talked about in our first quarter earnings call that we had executed that price increase. And what we said is that it would step up over the course of the rest of the year. And so what we are expecting is to see, significant step up in the third quarter and as we go into the second half for that price increase. And to date, July was still relatively soft is because of the World Cup; but what we are seeing is a pick-up in orders and inline with what our expectations.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great, thanks. Excuse me, and just lastly in terms of the Indesit acquisition can we get some kind of little bit more detail in terms of your high level thoughts there you mentioned seeing, you mentioned that a 7% to 8% operating margin might be possible in three years, what needs to happen, what do we need to see for that to happen. And what would be the casings of that kind of improvement presented from qualitative; you can into a little bit there. And also you are expecting $80 million of ongoing benefits in 2014 from restructuring, so far we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot. So is that still $80 million for the full-year of 2014?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Denise, this is Jeff, let me answer the last question first. Yes, we actually are seeing some of them Denise, in terms of the improvement of Europe, but they do accelerate in the second half and we will deliver at least $80 million worth of benefits on a full-year basis. As it relates to Indesit in Europe, and first of all, if you just take your public data that\u2019s combined companies are over $7 billion odd company. So we certainly gives us a competitive scale to accomplish a lot of things not similar to some of our past large scale acquisitions in terms of benefits.", "In terms of the timing, I would start with and again just based on public data and certainly our business in improving. They indicated through their guidance that their business is improving. So there is a baseline that we believe we can build off of and without getting into all the details it would be really optimizing the opportunities we see of a much larger scale business across the value chain. So and again in terms of timing it\u2019s premature for us to talk about that, but Marc comments of 7% to 8% EBIT company is clearly within our expectations and it does take sometime to ramp up. You ought to think of a ramp up as opposed to waiting three years because we certainly wouldn\u2019t plan to wait for three years.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay, and let me just slip one more in here. There was a pretty meaningful increase in inventory, could you talk about what was driving that was it timing or something else. And in terms of U.S. retail inventory levels of appliances, would you say that that correction is done because I think you were saying that all year long you had seen sell through exceed sell in.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Denise, this is Larry. Our inventories as planned they are up year-over-year, we have significant number of new product launches in the second half of the year and due to that we did increase levels of inventory now. We will bring that level down throughout the balance of the year as we normally do, but we did plan for higher inventory.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "And Denise its Marc. To your question about U.S. retail inventories, I would say buy and large our sell through of our products during Q2 exceeded the sell in on our products which basically tells you that \u2013 you probably had a slight inventory burn in our branded products in the second quarter.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay, can you see if that\u2019s done yet, any sense because it\u2019s been going on for quarter while now?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "", "Well, the market is \u2013 consumer market is good, our brands were in high demand. So I think that I can\u2019t predict by retailer, but I think in total we expect to have good demand.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, thank you so much.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And we will take our next question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "", "Good morning gentlemen.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Hi, ken.", "Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "So busy quarter here, just we saw some pretty index for you guys (indiscernible) I would just reiterate the usefulness given you guys comments about the market and investors perception. Second, related to the U.S. market given the implied back half volume that you\u2019re talking about for the industry, which you\u2019ve already been doing. Given that it\u2019s a tougher comp in terms of the growth rates last year. What kind of \u2013 from a growth rate perspective given their higher growth rates, what gives you confidence of visibility into that? I mean is it the shipment; is it the declining inventory that you are seeing domestically?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "", "Hey Ken, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. First of all, I\u2019m commenting the second half against the background of industry assumption; back half is 5% to 7% consistent with what I said earlier. And the confidence which we have on our own volume growth in that environment is a) we have a massive amount of new product launches in particular laundry, but also KitchenAid and small domestic appliances throughout the entire third quarter and then laundry in the fourth quarter, so there is a large number of product launch is coming.", "In addition, we know at least in our products trade inventories are low, and we see that as a business right now progresses, we have pretty strong shipments. So that gives us all the confidence for back half and of course we have a pretty firm indication of what we should expect around from the promotion period in Q3 and Q4. So put it all together we are very confident behind our plan.", "Michael A. Todman", "", "Ken, the market data March through June is up 6.5%, July looks good. So we feel pretty confident with it as Marc said.", "Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "", "Good. And I guess Marc, you made the comment on or Larry is the $10 million related to the laundry. I\u2019m assuming that is that EBIT or is that sales $10 million?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "", "Hey, Ken it\u2019s Marc. I said significantly above $10 million and it is EBIT.", "Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "", "Right, $10 million will be $0.09, okay, so that was good. Now moving on to another thing, such a risk quarter here, the $0.50 ahead in China or related at trade inventory. If tax affects that $50 million I mean again towards $40 million EBIT, my recollection was you guys had north of $200 million of sales. Could you correspond the high EBIT impact relative to the $200 million and why that was \u2013 I guess a surprise to you guys if that wasn\u2019t in guidance already?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "", "Well, original guidance was profitability in China, and as Mike mentioned in his script, sales are down significantly. So it will be \u2013 our base China business which was a loss.", "Michael A. Todman", "", "Yeah, and Ken, as Mike explained that the wildcard in the whole China situation is the timing of the approvals. They set many levels of approvals, we got through most of them very quickly in fact quicker than what we thought on our internal plan. But, we still have that \u2013 as Mike talked the equivalent of the SEC approval as well as the tax and all that. In fact \u2013 as though, our trade partners now believe that ultimately this is going to work out and they are preparing to do business with the new entity and the fact that they are preparing basically they didn\u2019t buy from us. And so we are basically \u2013 until we get this all combined, we\u2019re basically not selling anything in China. And I think we have new lines ready to go and so on and so forth, but again we just need to get this done. We are optimistic we will get it done soon, but there is a transition cost, it was not forecastable simply because the variable of approval.", "Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "", "Okay, as it sounds \u2013 it seems like the EBIT relative to the sales of $200 million-ish, would imply a very high incremental EBIT versus\u2026", "Michael A. Todman", "", "Well, basically you have all fixed cost and the under absorption, not all was cash, because some of it\u2019s burdening stuff, but yeah, our whole fixed cost structure which we are now reducing very aggressively, but the fact as we\u2019re on, let\u2019s call on the small existing Whirlpool business, we basically don\u2019t sell anything.", "Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Yes, we\u2019ve taken a beat in there. Well, I hope the guidance impact this year is a function of the upside when you choose to give guidance for that acquisition.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Well, and as Mike said and I think you\u2019re still on the one chart, I mean it will be earnings and cash negative this year, as we absorb all these transition expenses and we do expect the approval this year, but we expect it to be a nice contributor to our overall operations beginning next year.", "Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Very good, the next point, Europe, Marc, really we appreciate the 7% to 8% margin in guidance directionally in year three and my calculation that\u2019s roughly 450 in EPS, compared to roughly $0.60 today from Europe. so it\u2019s obviously, very meaningful. Could you address if any, the volume assumptions that would underlie that, or is that simply consolidation of the functions like distribution and overlay in production areas?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Hey, Ken. First of all, let me come back to process where we are, we signed, but we have not completed and there\u2019s several approvals that what we have to go through. I would just argue, please bear with us until we close the transaction, and then we will show you all the details about baseline assumption, synergies, restructuring, industry forecast, breakdown and everything including cash flows by year. It is just premature and inappropriate given the state of a process where we are to go into these details.", "Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Understood. Thank you very much, gentlemen.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Thank you.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Ken.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thanks, Ken.", "", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.", "Good morning everyone.", "Michael A. Todman", "Good morning.", "Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.", "First question I had is on the small appliances in North America. can you discuss what percentage that is of revenues now, and quantify, and give us some numbers around what kind of growth you saw year-over-year in that business?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "It\u2019s Marc and first of all, we don\u2019t break down what we have FDA revenues for the rest of our business. However, let me just make a broader comments, we have on small domestic appliances, if you look the last three or four years, we had a really, really strong growth trajectory, very strong, clearly above market average and clearly above rest of the company. We have this year in North America a little bit of setback, which is related to two specific trade partners, who kind of took inventory down, there were some challenges, which I would say is not reflective of the overall long-term growth trend, and it\u2019s also not reflective of what we see for example, in Europe, they are small domestic a third growing heavily. Having said that, we have maybe, one of the largest product launches ever in Q3 in small domestic appliances, that\u2019s why I\u2019m very confident, we very quickly get back on the growth trajectory, but it was somewhat a negative for us in Q2.", "Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.", "All right. and then just one other question with the Maytag has been another \u2013 was a topic conversation in the last conference call and it sounds like a fairly large product launch coming for 3Q, directionally what should we expect for North American operating margins that there\u2019s still going to be a lot of SG&A loaded into there, if you could give us some guidance I\u2019d appreciate it?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Yes. It\u2019s Marc Bitzer, again. First of all, in the product launches, the ones which I referred to earlier are multi-brand product launches that were basically, particularly on top-loaders, which is a bulk of our laundry business, where we have a number of launches pretty much from September this year until Q1 next year, almost the entire top-loader line. So that is obviously a big and significant and impact to all our brands.", "In addition, we had a number of dishwasher launches, which also continued to progress and some of our product categories, so that is just giving the side of our laundry business is massive and impact of our North America business. As you probably also know, we don\u2019t give margin guidance by region and by quarter. I would just generally say that we have the North America 11 consecutive quarters on year-over-year market expansion and I don\u2019t intend to break that spring.", "Michael A. Todman", "", "And the only thing I\u2019d add to Marc, if you look at our 0.5 margin and what we\u2019re guiding to for the full year, we do expect second half to have a nice margin increase and we would expect that in all three of our largest regions around the world.", "Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.", "", "Great, thanks for taking my question.", "Michael A. Todman", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "David S. MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research LLC", "", "Yes. good morning, everyone.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Good morning, David.", "Michael A. Todman", "", "Good morning, David.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Good morning.", "David S. MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research LLC", "", "Jeff, congratulations on this, it\u2019s a nice job there.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Thanks, David.", "David S. MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research LLC", "I guess I wanted to give Mike to talk a little bit about Latin America. and so far, the discussion is seemed to have been focusing around the impact of the World Cup, and not as much perhaps on the macro developments down there. and so is it safe to assume that your view on the weakness down there is largely associated with the World Cup and now that\u2019s behind us, we should begin reverting back to a more normal market condition, or is there bigger macro condition down there that really is at play?", "Michael A. Todman", "No, David as I said in the script, we think that the underlying macro environment is actually pretty good. When you look at on unemployment rates, they were down, real wages are up above 3%, inflation is kind of in that band, it\u2019s around 6%. So we\u2019re actually feeling pretty good about the macroenvironment. there are some things, the World Cup was won. there are some elections going on. so you never know what short-term impacts those are going to have. but largely, we think, we\u2019re going to get back to, certainly a better growth environment and scenario, and if you think about it, in the first quarter, the market was up 10%, and that was down 17% for the second quarter. so what we\u2019re expecting is the market to rebound, and certainly be flat to positive as we go forward.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "", "And David, I would add, as we\u2019ve talked in the past, there\u2019s really three pieces of our Latin America business, as Brazil appliances, there is the appliance business is in all the other 30 market surrounding Brazil and there is our global compressor business. And in fact matter is our Brazil appliance business has been even in this environment, performing extraordinarily well. There was clearly a volume head in Q2, which we fully expected, but even with that, our appliance business performed very well. The real weaknesses have been more international, which I mean, Argentina, Venezuela, et cetera, et cetera, perhaps Colombia is really a strong market in that group.", "Although we\u2019re now seeing that improve, and the other part was global compressors, which where we have the big presence in China and with a very, very double-digit decline in the first half of the year in refrigeration that impacted that. so all the pieces were coming back, but I think the one misconception is that our Brazil appliance business is weak and it is not, the market was weak, but our business was very strong.", "David S. MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then Jeff, if I can get just you to talk about sort of the discussion that\u2019s in the public forum right now, concerning General Electric\u2019s appliance business and the possible sale of that business, your largest competitor in the builder channel, maybe you could talk about sort of the competitive strength of the competitor vulnerabilities of your builder channel business versus a change of ownership in that business. how does that influence your overall North American competitive situation?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "David, I mean I only know what I read about, as you do. So I can't really comment specifically on that situation. I can\u2019t comment on our business is we feel very good about our position in the builder channel itself, we\u2019ve made significant inroads over the last five or six years. And those inroad and start with the fact that we got an outstanding brand portfolio.", "We can meet the needs of virtually all price levels of the marketplace which is a huge advantage. So that supported by again that can, we hit even during the downturn. We invested heavily in new product innovation. And then thirdly, we built that market has specific system requirements from ordering, delivering, servicing et cetera, et cetera. And we built up our capabilities which were massive investments over a long period of time. And so we have those capabilities. As does the competitor you talked about. So anyway we\u2019re growing, we\u2019re winning new customers, it\u2019s a market that\u2019s going to continue to grow for sometime. And I don\u2019t see any change in the trend that we currently have.", "David S. MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research LLC", "", "Thanks, very much guys.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And will take our next question from Megan McGrath, MKM Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Megan McGrath \u2013 MKM Partners", "Good morning,", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Good morning.", "Megan McGrath \u2013 MKM Partners", "Most of my questions have been answered. But just a couple of quick follow-ups. In Europe does the pending Indesit acquisition put any of your recent, I mean its cost saving initiatives on hold, until you get that completed.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Hi Megan its Marc Bitzer. No we already announced restructuring initiatives up fully on track and will be implemented and executed. So that is not impacted by Indesit.", "Megan McGrath \u2013 MKM Partners", "Okay, great. And then just one final follow up on Latin America you\u2019ve talked about rising prices to offset higher inflation it looks like that didn\u2019t occur in the second quarter was that more of just a timing issue or was the inflation more aggressive than you had initially anticipated.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Yes, Megan, what we said actually at the end of the first quarter. We had already announced these price increases and that they would scale in if you will over the course of the year. And so what we are expecting is to benefit more from the price increases in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And as we\u2019ve go throughout the year, but it\u2019s the same price increase that we took its how we introduced in our real life.", "Megan McGrath \u2013 MKM Partners", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Good morning, Jeff, Marc, Mike, Larry, how are you?", "Michael A. Todman", "", "Good, thank you.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Most of my questions also have been asked and answered. But to also follow-up question. First regarding Larry the $0.50 item the trade inventory transition how much is that impact that $0.50 is in the back half of the year versus was already recognized in the second quarter.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "", "$15 million in Q2 the balance would be in the back half.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "And should we I guess Mike assume that this is a permanent impairment of your legacy Chinese business I mean at some I don\u2019t imagine that business is coming back even after the Hefei deal is consummated.", "Michael A. Todman", "", "No, what we are expecting is to actually resume and grow from the business. And we \u2013 as we introduced new model lines, we\u2019re certainly expecting not only to recover, but to grow as we expand distribution into all the distribution outlet. So no it would not be permanent.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "So what was the reasoning behind the huge take down at retail I\u2019m confused. Well, if you think about it Hefei Sanyo is about (indiscernible). And so what the trade knows is that there would be new model lines coming in, there is probably some new terms and so what they are basically doing is kind of protecting at this point if you will there their inventory, they are marking sure that they don\u2019t have too much as they know these new lines are going to be introduced. And so it\u2019s kind of a one-time adjustment, but they will re-buy as we move forward and as the \u2013 and from the new combined entity as the transaction is closed.", "Michael A. Todman", "Okay, as I guess what was surprising about is that wouldn\u2019t have been flushed out within the due diligence process that that type of scale response would be a possibility.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Sam, this is Jeff as I said before the variable is the timing approval, so that was \u2013 that is a variable and we saw this in the second quarter which was bigger and more than we previously thought, but the fact now is it\u2019s still dependent upon the approval, so that was hard to forecast it.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Understood. Last question, the acquisitions that you are making the two of them plus I\u2019m guessing the future restructuring that\u2019s going to occur in order to integrate, does that free cash flow usage preclude any share repurchase activity this year or next.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "No.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "So we might expect share repurchase activity in the back half of the year once if you generate their free cash?", "Michael A. Todman", "What I would say Sam is we do intend to repurchase shares in the future and we continue to balance the various aspects of capital allocation we have, but our intention would be in the future, yes we would be repurchasing stock.", "", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, thank you both. Thank you all, appreciated.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Thanks, two things. First of all on the \u2013 your performance versus the AM, I appreciate the distinction that it\u2019s a bit of apples versus oranges, could you just flush out a little further in 1Q I think your units were up meaningfully more than the industry number 4 versus 1 and then that reversed obviously this quarter from triple points ahead that\u2019s 6 or 7 points behind. You just explain a little more would change some markedly between 1Q and 2Q in that apples versus oranges comparison?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Hey, Eric this is Marc Bitzer again, just coming back to my earlier comments I said that in Q2 if you look at the AMT-7 shipments that were mid single-digits, so I didn\u2019t say we are down, we actually were up mid single-digit, so which also means the rest of \u2013 difference to the overall unit shipments came from Canada small domestic and some other businesses, on the means on our AM shipments we are pretty much held market share year-over-year directly. In Q1 we picked up market share year-over-year and now we held market share.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "I guess, sorry to make my question clear, the non T7 it looks like the performance was much weaker in 2Q than it was in 1Q that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out what was different in 2Q versus 1Q?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "I think the biggest difference you would see I mean year-over-year is Canada and small domestic appliances.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "And is that \u2013 can find the 2Q or is that ongoing, how should we think about that?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "I mean as I mentioned earlier we are very confident in our small domestic appliance business for the back half of the year, it\u2019s just back different number product launches.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "And again the AM market sluggish and it has been impacted by currency therefore having significant price increases and that\u2019s got to settle its way through.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Okay, and then the second question, Jeff, in Europe the 7% to 8% margin target three years out is I think more than you\u2019ve made in the past. I\u2019m just curious as you look at both the market and the new business or platform you will be operating there. What\u2019s different on either side of that that would allow this to make margins that you haven\u2019t achieved in the past?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Well, first of all we have achieved those in the past, that\u2019s been albeit a while. Second of all there is \u2013 I think if you look at the one or two companies they have big scale these are not new levels for the industry and Marc you might want to comment on kind of the parameters.", "Marc R. Bitzer", "", "I mean, Eric to the earlier comment, I mean obviously we will give you all the details post-closing and many of you will understand the assumptions about scale, synergies, restructuring and baseline assumption. But I really want to refer back to Jeff\u2019s earlier comment. We made 7% plus margins in the 90s, we made 6% plus margin in 2000 and with a lower scale position. To Jeff\u2019s earlier point there are players in Europe, who make 8% or 9% operating margin on sustained base. So these are not of the normal margins, but obviously the key will be for you to understand post-closure of the ingredients and how we come up with that plan.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "", "Okay, with that, we\u2019re going to conclude the call here.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Chris Conley.", "Chris Conley", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Vice Chairman, Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 2 and in the appendix of this presentation. Also note that disclosure on the expectations and financial impacts of our acquisitions of majority interest in Indesit and Hefei Sanyo is currently limited due to the timing of the closing of these transactions. Both Hefei Sanyo and Indesit are publicly traded companies with independent reporting requirements and regulations, and it is not yet appropriate for us to fully discuss their financial or operational results.", "Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 37 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered a good quarter -- another good quarter of results with revenue growth, margin expansion and record earnings. Our ongoing business earnings per share were up 12% year-over-year. These results were mainly driven by revenue growth, ongoing cost productivity and the benefits of our cost and capacity initiatives. We continued our investments in our brands and our products, and we're delivering a very strong cadence of new products, which will help our business in the fourth quarter and continue into next year. In addition, we are very pleased to have closed our acquisitions by acquiring a majority interest of Indesit in Europe and Hefei Sanyo in China. Both of these acquisitions represent transformational opportunities to create value for our company.", "Overall, we are on track to deliver record operating profit and earnings per share this year, along with strong free cash flow. And based on the momentum we've had year-to-date, we remain confident in the performance of our business, and we've created multiple opportunities to drive profitable growth and value creation.", "To fully communicate our comprehensive strategy for growth and review our long-term value creation opportunities, we are hosting an Investors Day meeting on December 17 in Chicago. Here, we expect to share our specific plans for both our new acquisitions as well as our overall expectations for our future business performance.", "Now I'll turn to Slide 6 and talk briefly about the third quarter. As you can see, our revenues were up 4% versus last year excluding currency impact, and our ongoing business earnings per share increased by 32% -- or I'm sorry, $0.32 to a record level of $3.04, up 12% versus last year.", "On Slide 7, we've listed an update of our regional industry demand assumptions. Overall, not a lot of change. North America continues -- we continue to expect 5%-plus growth in the U.S. market. That's about where we've run year-to-date through September. In Europe, we continue to expect the industry to be flat to up 2% for the full year as the region has spotty recovery across the different markets. We are revising downward our Latin America full year assumption to minus 4% to 5% for the full year. This really reflects the weak regional demand that we've already seen year-to-date, although we have seen some modest improvement in the last couple of months. And finally, our Asia industry forecast remains flat for the year, with China being modestly down and India up.", "Our business performance has put us in a very strong position, which has enabled us to both strengthen returns to shareholders via higher dividends and share repurchase and, at the same time, enabled us to invest in value-creating acquisitions. So in total, we are on track for a record year of ongoing business operating performance, and we continue -- and we're continuing to build a great global platform for future growth and value creation.", "With that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer. Marc?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 9 by reviewing North America's performance in the third quarter, starting with the top line. Net sales of $2.8 billion for North America were up 6.3% compared to the prior year and up 6.9% excluding currency. The consistent and disciplined execution of our actions resulted in 6 consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue growth. Our ongoing business operating margins were at 10.9% for the quarter with a record operating profit of $304 million compared to $289 million from the third quarter of 2013. Operating margins were relatively flat in the quarter, as ongoing cost productivity and higher unit volumes were offset by the unfavorable impact of product transitions, higher material costs and unfavorable currency.", "Now let me take a moment to talk about our expectations for the full year 2014, as shown on Slide 10. Overall, we're pleased with our record operating profit on a year-to-date basis. U.S. appliance demand continued to strengthen in the third quarter. And while we have experienced additional monthly and quarterly fluctuations, we expect the full year industry to remain at its current year-to-date growth rate levels of up 5%. We continue to see improvements in employment and consumer confidence, which bodes well for all aspects of demand in the U.S. In addition, we expect positive net cost productivity from our ongoing programs to continue accelerating in the fourth quarter. We're excited to launch many innovative new products in almost every core business product category.", "In the second half of this year, we have product line transitions in top mount refrigerators, freezers, top-load laundry and dishwashers, which represent a significant portion of our overall U.S. core business. As expected and planned, these product line transitions have unfavorable short-term impacts on product mix and margins, as existing product lines were transitioned out to create space for the new product. As the new products become available to consumers who demand very innovative new features in energy efficiency, we expect revenues and margins to improve and working capital to return to more normalized levels.", "Turning to Slide 11. You can see an example of our product leadership in the laundry category. The revolutionary new Whirlpool Cabrio washers and dryers have a fresh design, increased capacity and intelligence that make clothing care easier than never. And we're proud to bring the newest innovation dryer technology to the U.S. market this quarter. Our new Whirlpool HybridCare clothes dryer with ventless Hybrid Heat Pump technology, an industry first in the U.S, is designed to regenerate energy during the drying cycle to reduce energy consumption while providing dryer speed and performance flexibility.", "I will now talk to our third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, as shown on Slide 13. Sales were $785 million compared to $778 million in the prior year. Excluding currency, sales increased 1.2% year-over-year. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, combined with ongoing productivity programs and higher unit volumes, have offset unfavorable product price and mix and currency to deliver another quarter of expanded operating profit. Operating profit was $9 million, and operating margins improved 110 basis points.", "Now turning to Slide 14. While the market environment in the Eurozone remains soft, we continue to see slow recovery and expect normal seasonality for the fourth quarter. We expect positive operating profit and margin expansion, driven by continued benefits from our ongoing cost productivity programs and our previously announced restructuring initiatives. We continue to focus on our innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core.", "As Jeff mentioned, we were extremely pleased to close the transactions to become majority owner of Indesit. Turning to Slide 15. You can see that we have completed several of the key steps required in the acquisition process. To date, we have acquired a 60.4% stake in Indesit, which represents 66.8% of the voting stock. At this time, court approval and the European Commission's antitrust approval have been received. And in accordance with accounting law, we have filed our notice to initiate a mandatory tender offer for remainder of Indesit's outstanding shares with intention to delist the company between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015.", "As Chris mentioned in the beginning of this call, our disclosures are limited at this time because Indesit is currently a publicly held company and is not yet fully owned subsidiary of Whirlpool. Additionally, Indesit has not yet disclosed their third quarter financials, so any disclosure on our part would not be appropriate. For 2014, the impact of our majority interest on earnings in our ongoing business is negligible, as part of these earnings will be partially offset by purchase price accounting adjustments. And based on Indesit's historical cash flow patterns, we believe the cash flow impact in 2014 will be moderately positive.", "After delisting and integration, we continue to expect these transactions will be meaningful and accretive on an ongoing basis starting in 2015. We expect efficiency in R&D, capital spending and value chain costs as well as operational scale with increased volume and the ability to more effectively integrate our product platforms across a larger European market position.", "This acquisition represents a substantial change to our position in Europe and, combined with existing cost and capacity reduction initiatives, creates a path to earnings growth and long-term shareholder value creation that is independent of market recovery. We plan to share more details on these expected benefits during our Investor Day in December.", "Turning to Slide 16, you can see just one example of our innovative product development capabilities in Europe. The Bauknecht dishwasher with PowerDry 3D airflow delivers optimum drying performance with minimal energy consumption and spotless drying.", "And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike.", "Michael A. Todman", "Thanks, Marc. If you turn to Slide 18, you'll see our Latin America results. During the quarter, our Latin America region delivered record ongoing operating profit while operating in a challenging external environment due to the end of the World Cup, currency fluctuation and uncertainty around the recent government elections.", "Sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion. Despite industry volumes being down approximately 8%, our net sales, excluding currency and BEFIEX, increased approximately 3% compared to the previous year. We are benefiting from previously announced cost-base price increases, which have accelerated in the second half of the year; new product introductions; and improved mix in our appliance business.", "As we look at profit for the region, our ongoing business operating profit for the quarter totaled a record $118 million compared to $104 million in the prior year period. Improved product price and mix and new product introductions more than offset lower appliance demand and higher material cost. GAAP operating profit totaled $118 million compared to $133 million in the prior year period, which included $29 million of BEFIEX tax credits.", "Turning to Slide 19 for our expectations of the region. Our full year industry assumption has been revised to down 4% to 5% for the year, reflecting lower short-term, although steadily improving, demand. We continue to believe that the macroeconomic indicators in Brazil point to long-term healthy demand growth, as unemployment is at historically low levels, real wages are growing, inflation is within the target range, debt as a percent of income is primarily driven by increased investments in housing and as appliance penetration levels increase. All of these signs are positive for appliance industry growth. In fact, the third quarter became progressively stronger as Brazil's industry demand improved from down 13% in July to down 7% in September.", "We also expect to continue outperforming the industry and grow our revenue, given our strong market position, industry-leading brands and strong cadence of new product introduction. The effect of our recently announced cost-base price increases, along with new product introductions, improved mix and continued productivity, will continue to help offset negative currency impacts and significant levels of inflation experienced throughout the year as we continue to grow beyond our core and launch new models across all product lines with exciting innovation.", "Turning to Slide 20. We are highlighting growth beyond our core appliances with the first all-in-one beverage platform for our Latin American consumers, in which we deliver a completely new business model, including B.Blend as the first countertop appliance that can deliver hot, cold and carbonated beverages. And in partnership with Bevyz, B.Blend uses a capsule-squeezing system to create automatic beverage dispensing and has 24 capsule options of beverages.", "Now turning to our third quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 22. And to fully understand these results, it's important to note that there are 2 very different drivers: one, our India business delivered strong results with another quarter of revenue growth and margin expansion; and two, yet we continue to experience our short-term issues in our China business related to the acquisition of Hefei Sanyo. In addition to the overall market slowdown in China, our business was significantly down. Similar to our comments in the second quarter, our trade customers continued to stock and sell well-known Hefei Sanyo-branded appliances but cut back on orders of our Whirlpool-branded products until the closure of the acquisition. These trade customers were anticipating new product lines, and as a result of our integration with Hefei Sanyo and in order to avoid excess inventory, they postponed ordering Whirlpool products. As a result, our sales declined significantly in the quarter, impacting margins and production volumes, which contributed to the 20% revenue decline and $8 million operating loss in Asia for the third quarter. Now that the acquisition is closed, we expect to return to far more positive revenue growth as we launch our new integrated product lines that leverage the combined technology of both Whirlpool and Hefei Sanyo, and we will begin launching these new products in November. With the transition issues largely behind us, we are confident that this acquisition will put us in a very strong position as we enter 2015.", "Turning to Slide 23. We continue to execute ongoing productivity actions and implement previously announced cost-base price increases across the region to offset inflation in currency and to execute new product launches. Lastly, we are prepared for a successful integration, as we have become the majority shareholder of Hefei Sanyo and will leverage the combined company to accelerate our growth in the emerging Chinese market.", "As shown on Slide 24, we have received all of the approvals and completed all of the steps required to acquire a 51% stake in Hefei Sanyo. We have acquired Hefei Sanyo's expanded distribution of over 30,000 distribution points, competitive products and significant capacity in a complementary low-cost manufacturing base. Combined with a proven management team that has consistently delivered growth and results that, on average, deliver 7% to 8% operating profit margins, we have created an outstanding platform of -- for growth in China.", "As we move forward with the integration process, transition costs will be behind us, and we will focus on driving sales growth and cost synergies to deliver profitable growth and reinvest in our business. At a very high level, our combined China business with this acquisition would be over $1 billion in sales, and our earnings accretion would be approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share compared to a 2014 baseline. That accretion is based purely on the recovery of our base China sales, added together with our portion of Hefei Sanyo's 2013 operating performance. Therefore, once integrated, we expect this transaction will be meaningfully accretive to 2015 and beyond.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 27. Our full year ongoing business EPS guidance remains in the range of $11.50 to $12, which represents a 15% to 20% improvement versus a year ago. The business is performing very well, and we continue to navigate effectively through global volatility in demand, currencies and material costs.", "Given the accelerated pace we have been on to close both the acquisitions, we are increasing acquisition-related costs during the fourth quarter and are adjusting GAAP guidance to a range of $9.40 to $9.90 per share. This change reflects incremental investment expenses and purchase price accounting adjustments related to the acquisitions as well as additional restructuring charges primarily related to integration activities. These charges will enable us to accelerate the benefits of the acquisition. A reconciliation of these adjustments to GAAP EPS can be found in the appendix on Slide 44.", "It's important to note that all changes to our original guidance have been related to upfront costs to acquire both Hefei and Indesit. Our base business continues to perform in line with our original guidance for the year. Our expectations for 2014 free cash flow of $650 million to $700 million have increased from previous guidance due to our strong underlying operating performance and expected incremental cash flow from the recently acquired companies.", "As I speak to the financial results on Slides 28 through 30, you'll see how we continued to expand our ongoing business operating margin in the first 9 months of this year and expect to deliver another balanced approach towards margin expansion.", "Year-to-date, price/mix is up by 0.5 point, and we expect to realize 0.5 point of margin for the year, driven by our previously announced cost-base price increases, innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core business. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives contributed another 0.5 point, consistent with our full year guidance.", "For the first 9 months of 2014, our cost productivity more than offset material cost inflation of approximately $140 million to deliver a positive 0.25 point of margin expansion. And our cost productivity for the year is on track to more than offset approximately $150 million to $200 million of year-over-year material cost inflation and is expected to deliver a positive 0.5 point of margin for 2014.", "Our planned increases in marketing, technology, product investments and the impact of currency reduced margins by 0.75 point year-to-date, which is in line with the full year guidance. Given the combined impact from initially consolidating the acquisitions and required purchase accounting adjustments, we expect that acquisition margins in the near term will be slightly dilutive by about 0.5 point.", "More importantly, as we integrate the businesses and realize synergies, we expect the impact of both businesses to be accretive to our margins. As a result, we are expecting full year operating margins of approximately 7.5%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we are firmly on track with our previous guidance of 8% margins.", "Ongoing business operating profit for the third quarter reflects revenue growth, ongoing cost productivity and the benefits of cost and capacity reduction initiatives. Lower volumes largely attributable to demand softness in Brazil and China, higher material costs and unfavorable currency negatively impacted results.", "As a note, third quarter gross margins were down about 1 point versus the prior year on a GAAP basis. This drop was driven primarily by unfavorable currency and nonrecurring BEFIEX tax credits from last year. We continue to expect a strong finish to the year with our new product launches, a ramp-up in productivity and Latin America price increases taking full effect. We believe our expected operating margin improvements, combined with positive revenue growth, will enable us to deliver strong double-digit improvement in ongoing business earnings per share during the fourth quarter.", "As we turn to Slide 31, we have a few updates on liquidity. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our credit ratings were reaffirmed post acquisitions. We recently renegotiated and increased our credit facilities. We will fund our acquisitions with approximately $500 million in cash and $1.5 billion in debt. During 2016, we expect to return to preacquisition debt metrics.", "As we continue to improve margins and grow revenues, our plans to deploy the cash generated from our business are solid, as shown on Slide 32. We are funding the business for growth and significant product introductions. Earlier this year, our board increased quarterly dividends on the company's common stock and authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program. As referenced, since resuming our share repurchase program in 2013, we have repurchased approximately $375 million in stock. Finally, as previously mentioned, we are spending approximately $2 billion to fund the acquisitions of Hefei Sanyo and Indesit.", "In summary, given our profitable growth trends, increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we continue to balance funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "Let me take just a few minutes to walk you through our cash flow assumptions and a brief update on restructuring. We historically use cash in the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half. This year is no different. In the fourth quarter, we expect to generate cash through strong cash earnings and working capital improvements.", "As for restructuring, we have incurred approximately $100 million for charges year-to-date. For the full year 2014, we expect approximately $150 million of charges and $80 million of ongoing benefits. This reflects an increase of $50 million in charges from our previously -- previous guidance, largely associated with our acquisitions of majority interests in Hefei Sanyo and Indesit.", "We expect to update our forward view of these items and share details of our long-term value creation strategy, as Jeff mentioned, with you at our Investor Day on December 17 in Chicago. Due to the expected demand for the event, our Investor Day will be webcast for those investors and analysts who are not able to attend in person. Those webcast details will be provided in early December.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Thanks, Larry. I'll turn to Slide 34, where I'll summarize our expectations for the year. Again, we delivered another quarter of revenue growth, margin expansion that resulted in record earnings. We are continuing to invest in our brands and have a very strong lineup of innovative products coming to market in the fourth quarter and into 2015, so we feel we're very well positioned to capitalize on improving global demand trends. And as I mentioned, our acquisitions provide us with a truly transformational growth opportunity to create significant value through successful integration.", "So overall, we remain confident in our ability to deliver a full year record year of operating performance in 2014 with our operating margins in line with our stated goal of 8%, excluding the impact of acquisitions. I would point out our 8% goal is a milestone. It's not a destination for us.", "And if you turn to Slide 35, this frames our comprehensive strategy for growth that we've now created, where we believe we can grow our revenues, expand our margins and create significant shareholder value. We are growing geographically through our acquisitions in Europe and China as well as expanding our emerging markets exposure in those markets where we see appliance growth opportunities and favorable demographics. Our North America region is poised for multiple years of growth through a strong replacement cycle, continued improvements in housing and improving discretionary demand. And from a product and brand perspective, we have a very strong cadence of innovative products coming to the market which will benefit customers around the world. We believe these investments will deliver both revenue growth and margin expansion.", "And finally, we have opportunities to fully leverage our global fixed cost structure and drive ongoing cost productivity around the world. This will ensure our competitive position and continue to help improve our margins. So we believe that these multiple paths for profitable growth, geographical expansion, brand and product innovation and cost structure improvements provide us with an outstanding opportunity to achieve our next level of performance, and in doing so, we'll deliver strong value creation for our shareholders. So we do look forward to sharing in more detail these plans at our Investor Day in December.", "With that, I'd like to end our formal remarks, and we'll now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "So Latin America did far better than I think most people expected, in line with kind of what you were talking about. Look, you guys talked about so much good news. I'm going to try to pick a hole in North America margins here. The lower incremental margins year-over-year, is that attributable -- I mean, the Maytag, obviously, 11%, nearly 11%, it's a very good margin, but in terms of incremental, did that have any particular drags that are related to product introductions, marketing or anything that you'd like to call out versus the longer-term 15% incremental EBIT?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Okay. Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, thanks on picking on North America. But apart from that, as you highlight, first of all, 11% operating margins in a historic context, and also, when you look at our competitive results, it's nothing I'm going to apologize for. Having said that, at the same time, and we alluded in the script a little bit, I think there's always a couple of items in there in every quarter, but I think what was -- which was particular strong was the amount of product transitions. And to put that in context, product transitions are a part of our life. We typically transition, every year, about 20% to 30% of our products. If you know that in this quarter, we transitioned the entire top mount refrigerators, the entire freezers, the entire top loader line, you know this is well, well beyond normal. Transition costs in both sides of the equation: the cost in manufacturing efficiency because you're ramping down, ramping up; but even more so, it costs you basically on pricing because you basically -- you have to discount the end of a line to create new space. So if there was one factor to highlight, I think it's the unusual amount of product transitions in Q3, which also is, by and large, behind us. There's some carryover in Q4, but it's, by and large, behind us.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Good. And I guess, is there a way for you to quantify a normal product transition in terms of drag so we can understand the impact on the third quarter?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Ken, let me just maybe rephrase the answer like different. First of all, it has been unusually high, and it had a material impact. Having said that, let me ask the other way around -- or answer the other way around. The 11%, in our view, does not mark at all a ceiling of our North America margins.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. I do appreciate your comments on the Hefei Sanyo. I think it's the first time you've talked about the earnings accretion. So the $0.80 to $0.90 that was discussed off of -- on your business, when it's fully integrated, I believe that -- and if you could clarify, I believe that it counts for roughly $0.50 of drag in 2014. So the guidance for Hefei Sanyo would be in the $0.30 to $0.40 range if that's true. And then second, because you now own it, can -- how should we think about the fourth quarter sales impact? You talked about a big drag in the third quarter and purchase accounting that's getting pushed below the line. How should we think about the operational EBIT that you're kind of guiding to?", "Michael A. Todman", "Okay. Well, Ken, first of all, I think your math is right. It was about $0.50 of drag. And then all we've done is add the $0.30 to $0.40 based on their performance this year, okay? So that really doesn't speak to what our expectations are moving forward. In terms of sales improvement in the fourth quarter, clearly, we expect to see a good increase in sales as we begin to floor the new product lines throughout distribution. I'm not going to give a specific guidance on the EBIT number. But yes, you're right, there will be a PPA adjustment, but all of that is factored into kind of our overall view and outlook.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Ken, this is Jeff. And again, we'd like to be more -- we just closed Friday on Hefei and basically about 10 days ago on Indesit. We obviously know the business, we've modeled the businesses, so on and so forth. But I would just say there's a lot of moving parts at this point in time that -- everywhere from their run rates, our run rates and so on. They -- both businesses continue to perform in line with what they've seen, which are both publicly -- public information. There's just accounting activities that will be impacted. So our overall guidance at this point, as it relates to the fourth quarter, is largely negligible on the earnings side. It could be a little up, could be a little down. We don't really know right now. We do think, on the cash side, it will be marginally up. So I wouldn't worry so much about the fourth quarter. I think we'll get all that behind us. And then when we talk about next year, we can talk about how these pieces really -- what I would call the expanded Whirlpool will look like by region.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And if I could just ask one more. Brazil, the outperformance given, I believe, investors' baseline, can you guys talk about having a record EBIT there? And I know that there were some doubters. Can you discuss why that was so strong? I mean, is it just that the pricing you were able to get really offset, obviously, cost-base inflation or currency inflation? But why are the margins -- was there something really unique in the quarter? Because it was a very strong performance, obviously, given the volume there. Just a little more clarity since that was one of the main concerns for investors.", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, thanks. There wasn't, Ken, just to answer your question, anything particularly unique. We had -- we have 3 factors. One was the cost-base price increases, which I think I commented in the second quarter would begin to take full effect as we went throughout the year. Second is we've had and continued to have new products that we're introducing into the marketplace, and those products are -- that we introduced generally have a higher ASP and a higher margin associated with them. And then thirdly, that's also driven mix. So it's really all those 3 factors that have -- that drove the performance of Latin America.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, and Ken, I would just add, but it's pretty much in line with what we expected and we talked about in our Q2 call, that we were taking strong actions to offset inflation to deal with currency devaluation and so on. But to Mike's point, the other part was we've been investing very strongly in our product innovation and product leadership there. So a lot of these new products really have helped the mix, along with the price increase, and help us more than offset this down market.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I guess I wanted to ask you just about the noncore business you like to talk about in the adjacencies business and just how that's setting up for the fourth quarter. I know it's a seasonal business. Fourth quarter is very important. How's your offering versus last year? Can you talk about any gains in listings? And how do you quantify that for us?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, David, this is Jeff. Let me just talk globally. I mean, we've got, I mean, a number of things that are reflected in really regions around the world. But if I take our KitchenAid small and domestic appliance business globally, it's growing very nicely. I think you've seen a lot of the new product innovation, new launches that are going on right now. They're on a limited basis on distribution. But that business is going strong, going well. Our water business worldwide is good, very good in many parts of the world. Water/beverage, you saw the new B.Blend introduction in Brazil, which is a world's first beverage product, but that's just now starting up. So as I look at these businesses around the world, all continue to improve. We have some businesses growing double digit, some just starting up. You've probably seen our new SWASH launch here in -- starting in the United States that really started in September and started shipments in October. So we've got a combination of big businesses growing high single or double digits and a lot of new seeds that are just taking hold and beginning to grow. But in total, these businesses represent a little over 20% of our business. And as I've said before, they have significantly higher margins than what we call, if you will, our traditional core. So there -- I think we'll have a good fourth quarter.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Good. A question on Latin America, just to follow up on the previous discussion. It seems like volumes are getting better, according to Michael's comments. And I guess the question is, in a scenario where volumes recover, can you continue to maintain the pricing? Or does competitive forces begin to erode that?", "Michael A. Todman", "Well, David, I won't comment specifically on that. I think what we've done is executed our plan. But what we're seeing in the market is what we expected. It's still a little volatile, but we're performing the way we expect with new products. And we're comfortable kind of where we are in terms of our execution of the prices.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, David, we talked about Brazil, but I'd say all of Latin America and, I'd say, other emerging markets like Russia, Turkey, India, et cetera, where we have a lot of dynamics going on at all times. We have rapid demand changes, rapid currency changes, high levels at times of inflation and so on and so forth. And what we feel good in our business is we've got very experienced leaders in each and every one of these markets. There's no one way to manage through this. You have to try to stay ahead of the change curve, and so far we've been doing a pretty good job at that this year. So Brazil, we're going to have -- despite the environment, we're going to have a record year in Brazil. The rest of Latin America, we were off to a slow start in the beginning, but we're tracking very well throughout Latin America. So it's not just one thing. It's managing all this volatility together. And fortunately, we have the size and scope of the business that we can lead these changes in the marketplace, and that's what we've been doing.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just want to ask first on guidance. You said that, in the fourth quarter, given the acquisitions, the impact from acquisitions could be up or it could be down. Does your guidance, which you've maintained at $11.50 to $12, include any impact from acquisitions?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "What we said, Denise, was the current ongoing guidance, we said that the acquisitions would be neutral to the earnings. And that's just obviously due to the fact that we haven't had the businesses for the full quarter. We haven't begun integrating the businesses, where we have some purchase accounting that we're factoring into the business, and then we're absorbing a little bit more interest. So net-net, essentially, it'll be neutral.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of your -- the raise in your free cash flow guidance, how much of that can we attribute to Indesit?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "I would say the acquisitions in total -- and I would just take into consideration the fact that we have some higher acquisition-related costs, we're doing a little bit more restructuring. But in general, I'd say around in that $100 million range, combined acquisitions.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. But that's -- okay. So in the slides, you said that Indesit was going to be a -- it would contribute positively to free cash flow.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "And we are. I'm saying combine the -- the combined businesses will contribute -- the acquired businesses will contribute about approximately $100 million.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, okay. Got it. Could you talk a little bit about the change in working capital you saw this quarter? Was it really just related to new product transitions? Or was there something seasonal or perhaps related...", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Yes, I'd say our working capital year-over-year is up marginally, I think $35 million, $40 million on a year-over-year basis. Historically, what we do, you see, just due to seasonality of our business, working capital will come down in the fourth quarter. We'd estimate that to probably in the range of $700 million, and we'll generate essentially the remainder of the cash through cash earnings.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee.", "James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "First question I had is on raw materials. Can you comment on what specific commodities caused the cost pressure this quarter? And am I reading the guidance correctly, that you expect some of that to abate in 4Q?", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Yes, yes, Jay, we've got a couple of things. One, in the currency markets, we've had raw material increases across the board all year. But -- and that would be Latin America and India and places like that. But as we highlighted before, we were particularly negatively impacted in some regional markets, and the -- but probably the biggest single one is steel in the U.S., which is higher than we expected, and everything else is pretty much as we expected. In terms of reductions, there's clearly been a big change in the external environment over the last 30 days, whether it be oil or input costs or base metals or so on, and we'll have to see what happens. I mean, we don't have a new forecast for the year, but clearly, the external environment, from just a pure raw materials cost, appears to be turning downward, which, if that holds, that ought to translate into lower material costs.", "James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And then the second question I had was, looking at promotion, you guys said that you transitioned to the new lines. Looked like it was a drag on gross margin this quarter. That should be done with. How much are you thinking about increasing promotions or adding some SG&A to really push for the holiday season and push some of these new brands? And are you expecting the spend for that to be up on a year-over-year basis, assuming that you've got more product launches, et cetera? But on an apples-to-apples basis, do you expect the spend is going to be up for the promotional activities going into the holiday season?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Jay, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me try to answer this one. As we indicated in earlier calls, we will not give forward-looking statements on promotional pricing strategies. However, let me just comment on Q3. And our past behavior in Q3, I want to underline, is consistent with our past behaviors in promotion. And I think we've got to differentiate between promotions on one side and product transitions on the other side. Promotions, we always said we will participate when we see a value-creation opportunity for us and the consumer, and that policy hasn't changed in Q3. What is different in Q3 is the unusual high amount of product transitions. And when you -- whenever you do product transitions, it's kind of a closeout, but you just -- you need to put certain investments in market in order to free up the space. And that has been higher than normal -- I mean, higher than a normal quarter in a normal year, but that is largely behind us.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question on -- just wanted to circle back to Latin America with the good performance there, the strong performance there. Just trying to get a sense for the ongoing timing with the cost-base price increases against currency and inflation. And given how currency has moved throughout the last 2, 3 months, just wanted to get a sense to your best estimate on the current level of profitability here, a little bit over 10%. Given where currency and perhaps also inflation has moved during the quarter, is this number sustainable near term? Or would there be additional actions required to allow this level to be maintained?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, I think, Michael, probably the best way to answer that question is kind of go back to the beginning of the year. When we saw what the environment was, we took appropriate actions. And I talked earlier in the year that we took some cost-base price increases. Actually, I think we took 2 price increases. But it's more than that. We're kind of looking at what's going on in the environment all the time. We're launching new products all the time. We're looking at how best we can manage our mix and improve our mix during the course of time. So I do think we are at margin levels that we can sustain. I mean, so that -- and I think we just do what we need to do in terms of what we execute in the market. There's nothing that we've seen that's unexpected, so we're basically operating in an environment that we expect and executing what we need to, to deliver at these operating margin levels.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So in other words, Mike, given what we've seen over the last month or 2, you wouldn't expect to see an incremental negative impact on margins, all else equal?", "Michael A. Todman", "Well, I don't expect to see that, no.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "The only thing I would add, Michael, is the price increases were taken throughout the third quarter, and there will be additional benefit in the fourth quarter.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's helpful, Larry. And I guess just a second question. Going back to North America for a moment, I know there's been a few questions around that potential impact of the product transitions, and I guess we're not going to get necessarily a quantifiable answer. But just looking forward, certainly, it appears that you're saying that there would be some type of drag that would alleviate in the 4Q. And if you can't necessarily break that out from a numerical aspect, I was just thinking about longer term in this business, I think in general, perhaps you've talked about an incremental margin of 20%, 25% on a consolidated basis, and certainly that would apply to North America. Is that still the right way to think about this business as you grow it going forward?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Michael, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me try to take a shot at your question. First of all, no, we're not going to quantify by expense transitions and what it means for Q4. But again, keep in mind there's 2 aspects to this one. We had, in Q3, inefficiencies on both the cost side and the pricing side. Going forward, first of all, that's going to be absent, largely. Second of all, of course, as we -- when we introduce a product like the new top-load washer, which we believe is absolutely industry leading, we also expect higher sales and higher margin realization, otherwise we wouldn't introduce new products. So we feel extremely confident about these new products that we're introducing. So that, on its own, should help us on posting even stronger margins going forward.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Megan McGrath of MKM Partners LLC.", "Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Just wanted to switch to Asia a little bit. Your inventory reduction issues are happening at the same time where there's some concern over slowing growth. So do you have any sense, excluding the inventory pull-down, what the overall market for appliances is doing in China right now?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, the overall market in appliances was slightly down year-to-date, Megan, 1% to 2%. So it's not significant. And we expect that the market will be somewhere in that range through the course of the year.", "Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And then when I think about this, I know you'll give us more detail in mid-December, but if I think about that business moving forward, you just closed the acquisition, should we expect that you'll see a little bit more of that inventory pull-down this quarter? Or do you think that's pretty much 100% done?", "Michael A. Todman", "I think, Megan, that, that's pretty much done. As I mentioned, we are launching new products in the Whirlpool brand starting in November. So we've got to get those products floored. We've got to get the inventory out there. So I'm expecting to see some improvement as we move forward from now.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Tom Mahoney with Cleveland Research.", "Tom Mahoney", "Tom on for Eric Bosshard today. I wanted to know that, as you look at Latin America and the units down there, it sounded like the market was maybe a little better than your unit shipments down there. What were the moving pieces within that in the quarter?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, Tom, we did lose a little bit of market share in the quarter, not unexpected. We expected it. Year-to-date, our share is flat, and we expect that we'll begin to recover that over the course of the remainder of the year. So we're actually feeling pretty good about where we're positioned.", "Tom Mahoney", "Okay. And then you talked about September -- or kind of exiting the third quarter down 7% year-over-year. What are you expecting for growth as you move kind of through 4Q and into 2015?", "Michael A. Todman", "Well, I'm not -- I won't give 2015 at this point, but we are expecting the market still to be down in the fourth quarter. And that still achieves the guidance that we get.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Given that the China market's still a little bit on the soft side, could you comment please on your global compressor business and how that performed during the quarter?", "Michael A. Todman", "Yes, Denise. Our global compressor business, actually, our revenues were up in the third quarter despite the soft market. But if you remember, we're comping against a quarter where last year there was a port closure. So I would say, overall, if you normalize, the compressor sales are slightly down in total from an industry perspective.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, okay. Just 2 more quick questions. Could you please give us the gross margin by region? And then just looking at your corporate cost line, so far this year, it's kind of been running at $47 million, $48 million a quarter. This quarter, it was only $36 million. Is this lower level sustainable? Or was there something one-off?", "Larry M. Venturelli", "I think we provide the operating profit by region. Well, the Q will be out later today, and I think you'll have that, Denise, so you can have -- take a look at that. And then your question was on corporate -- the corporate line?", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes.", "Larry M. Venturelli", "Figure a couple hundred million dollars of what we call corporate administrative costs, and then you'll have $150 million in restructuring that goes into that line item.", "Operator", "And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks.", "Jeff M. Fettig", "Well, listen, being no more questions, again, we appreciate your interest in this call. Again, we're really -- we're pleased so far with the performance we've delivered this year, and we look forward to updating you on our longer-term view of our business, as we mentioned, on December 17.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Chris Conley. Please go ahead.", "Chris Conley", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation first quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Vice Chairman, Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our Web site at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports, as well as on Slide 1 and in the appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 41 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. In the press release this morning, we reported strong revenue growth in our earnings performance for the first quarter. To-date, our integration activities in Europe and China are on track, and we continue to see substantial value creation opportunities in these regions through synergies and growth.", "During the quarter, we did see significant movements in global currencies and a very negative demand environment in Brazil. But our larger global operating platform helped to offset most of these issues, and we deployed a series of new actions, which are expected to deliver margin expansion in the second half of the year. We will review these actions in detail during our regional reviews.", "Turning to Slide 5, in the quarter you can see we delivered strong revenue growth. Excluding the impact of currency, our revenues were up 23% on a year-over-year basis. As expected, our free cash flow was lower compared to last year, primarily due to seasonal working capital requirements related to our acquisitions.", "Our ongoing business EPS came in at $2.14 a share, compared to $2.20 last year. Again, primarily due to the negative impact of currency devaluations and lower demand in Brazil. As a result, we are revising our 2015 earnings guidance, which we show on Slide 6. Our revised GAAP to EPS is down $9 to $10 per share. Our ongoing business operations EPS is down $12 to $13 a share, and free cash flow is approximately $700 million positive for the full year.", "On Slide 7, you can see the combined impact of these environmental changes that had on our business, and is expected to be approximately $2 per share. Within this environment, we expect our first half results to deliver earnings per share that are approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. And as a result, the new actions implemented or in the process of being implemented, we expect to deliver margin run rates in the second half consistent with our prior expectations for the year, which represents a substantial level of margin expansion from where that is today.", "As shown on Slide 8, we feel good about the progress we're making in our long-term growth strategy, which remains on track. We continue to see multiple opportunities for both growth and margin expansion over the medium and long-term, falling under three prime categories; the first is our geographical expansion, again our integration plans are fully on track and already producing positive results. Additionally, while emerging market is currently slow or weak, we still remain very confident. There's a tremendous mid to long-term opportunity in these emerging markets, and this along with what we see as recovering demand in both the U.S. and in many European markets.", "The second area we're focused on is product and brand innovation. We continue to accelerate our investments in the relevant technologies and innovative products, which benefit our end customers. This will ensure our future growth rate and margin expansion.", "And third, and very importantly, we will continue to leverage and right-size our fixed cost structure with volume growth, which will lead to further margin expansion. So in summary our strategy remains on track. We will continue to deliver results, and enable us to overcome short-term environmental challenges as we are seeing today.", "Turning to Slide 9, you can see that our business priorities for 2015 are fully in line with these growth and margin opportunities, and remain largely unchanged for the year. Our integration and activities in Europe and China will continue, and are on track. We have taken additional cost-based pricing, and very strong cost productivity actions around the globe. We do except our investments in new products and growth beyond the core to continue to drive both revenue growth, and margin expansion. And as a result, we expect to expand operating margins significantly during the second half of the year.", "So at this point in time, I'll move on to our regional details, and I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Let me begin on Slide 11 by reviewing North America's performance in the first quarter, starting with the top line. Net sales of $2.3 billion for North America were up slightly compared to the prior year period, and up 2.1% excluding currency. This is now the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.", "Our first quarter ongoing business operating profit was $230 million, compared to $228 million in the first quarter of 2014. In summary, in an essentially flat market we delivered strong margins in the first quarter, which confirms that our product transition and availability issues are largely behind us.", "Turning to Slide 12, our expectations for North America in 2015 remain unchanged. With major product transitions now largely behind us, we expect to leverage with launches and drive margin expansion. From a broader U.S. market perspective, we believe the industry is on track for a multiyear recovery, as evidenced by a recent increase in the existing home sales.", "In the first quarter, the industry was up 1%, and we expect the full year industry to be up around 4%. 2015 did start out a little soft industry-wide, largely driven by destocking at several major retailers, a somewhat slow start to the housing markets, and what we believe to be a delay, not a reduction in the ramp up of consumer spending.", "In Canada, specifically, where we have a significant currency issue we do expect that our recently announced cost-based price increases will help offset the margin impact of currency devaluation. As we speak, we are launching a new commercially inspired suite of KitchenAid appliances.", "On Slide 13, you can see our award-winning five-door refrigerator that features storage for easy access for family favorites, five customizable temperature zones, and a platinum interior option.", "I will now talk to the first quarter result for our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, as shown in Slide 15. Sales were $1.3 billion, compared to $0.7 billion in the prior year. While a significant portion of its growth was driven by the integration, it is important to note that we had underlying growth in both the legacy Whirlpool and Indesit businesses. Ongoing operating profit was $35 million, with ongoing operating margin at 2.7% compared to $7 million, and 1% in the first quarter 2014.", "During the first quarter, positive volume, ongoing cost productivity, price mix, and accelerated integration activities more than offset the significant unfavorable impact of currency and lower demand in Russia, delivering another quarter of expanded operating profit and margin.", "As we look towards the full year 2015 on Slide 16, our integration activities remain firmly on track, and we continue to drive margin improvement in the region. For 2015, we expect the continuation of the Eurozone recovery, and industry to be flat to up 2% for the year. Demand continues to be strong in Western Europe, which is more than offsetting weaknesses we're seeing in Eastern Europe, most prominently in Russia, and the Ukraine. We have announced cost-based price increase in both Eastern European countries to offset the impacts of currency, and we are well positioned for growth and demand return.", "In summary, we remain focused on accelerating integration activities, ongoing cost productivity programs, and growth throughout new product launches, both within and beyond the core.", "On Slide 17, you can see our all-in-one countertop cook processor as an example of innovation outside of our core appliance categories. It is designed to simplify the lives of our consumers, functionality to prepare entire meals, and featuring six automatic cooking modes that guide consumers step-by-step for recipes for delicious culinary preparations.", "Now, I would like to turn it over to Mike.", "Mike Todman", "Thanks, Marc. Let me begin with our Latin America results on Slide 19. Sales for the quarter were $899 million, down 24% from a very strong baseline in the same prior year period, primarily due to unfavorable currency and reduced demand in Brazil. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were down 11% from the prior year period. Our ongoing business operating profit for the quarter totaled $59 million, or 6.6% of sales, compared to $109 million and 9.2% in the prior year period, driven largely by the factors mentioned earlier.", "On Slide 20, we want to provide additional detail on the macroeconomic picture in Brazil. Throughout the first quarter, the demand environment in Brazil weakened rapidly. Inflation, unemployment, and consumer confidence had a significant impact on demand, which was down 16% in the first quarter. While these macro changes are significant, it appears that the economic crisis has been initiated by the political crisis in the country, which is having a strong impact on consumer sentiment in the short-term. We continue to believe that Brazil's long-term attractiveness remains intact.", "As shown on Slide 21, if you look at the last 14 years of GDP, Brazil has shown a strong capacity to rebound from downturns, and we believe that the country as a whole has a positive long-term outlook.", "On Slide 22, we have taken strong and decisive actions to offset this rapid demand decline and currency impacts. We have executed and announced new cost-based price increases that become effective early in the second quarter. Additionally, we deployed strong actions to reduce our fixed cost, which included a significant workforce reduction, and production shutdowns to control our inventory levels.", "It is important to note that while we have taken these strong actions we will not see their full impact until the second half of 2015, at which time we expect to deliver operating margins in line with our prior expectations. We have adjusted our 2015 industry guidance for Latin America to down 10% to 12%. In summary, we expect to expand margins in the second half, similar to our prior expectations, while we continue to operate in a more challenging environment in Brazil.", "Turning to Slide 23, we launched a new Brastemp laundry product with an easy visibility glass lid in multiple color options that is designed for top performance in cleaning, bedding, and larger items.", "Now, turning to our first quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 25; net sales of $378 million more than doubled from the prior period, primarily due to the integration. Consistent with our expectations we are on track with the integration process and have delivered ongoing operating profit of $26 million compared to $5 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 6.9%, up significantly compared to the prior year period, behind continued strength in India, and our expanded China growth platform.", "Turning to Slide 26, we continue to see favorable macro trends in India, and relatively neutral macro trends in China. Our industry guidance for Asia, as a whole, is up 1% to 3%. In summary, for 2015, we expect significant growth from our integration activities, continued strength in India, and as a result, strong margins from our larger growth platform.", "On Slide 27, you can see our new entry-level refrigeration product for India. It features rapid cooling, and ice making technology, which has been well received by consumers. Now I would like to turn it over to Larry.", "Larry Venturelli", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. Let me start with our first quarter results on Slides 29 and 30, and then I'll discuss guidance for the year. As Jeff mentioned, we had record net sales and ongoing operating profit during the quarter. Our revenues were $4.8 billion, compared to $4.4 billion last year, an 11% increase. The business performed well, given the rapid changes in global currencies and a weak demand environment in Brazil.", "Currencies, which have weakened double digits versus the dollar year-over-year impacted our revenues by over $500 million, EBIT margins by just under 2 points, and earnings by approximately $0.85 per share. Despite significant currency headwinds, and a weaker-than-expected demand environment, the company delivered solid ongoing earnings of $2.14 per share, down slightly from the $2.20 last year.", "The diversification of our regional profit contribution, and the combination of positive price and mix, cost and capacity reductions, productivity, and benefits from our acquisitions offset most of the headwinds we've discussed. You'll note that interest and sundry increased $30 million compared to the prior year, and this is primarily due to fluctuations in currency. Additionally, as shown on Slide 30, on a GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the first quarter was lower than our full year guidance, however the ongoing rate was 24%, and we expect our full year tax rate to between 22% and 25% for both GAAP and ongoing earnings.", "Turning to Slide 31, relative to the guidance we provided in our last earnings call, we are revising ongoing business EPS guidance to $12 to $13. This will represent a 10% improvement in earnings compared to last year. Our expectations for 2015 free cash flow are now approximately $700 million.", "On Slide 32, let me make some additional comments regarding the challenging macroeconomic environment, and actions we have taken to mitigate the impact. Our revenues year-over-year will be reduced by approximately $2.5 billion due to currency, and we are now expecting a $500 million year-over-year impact to EBIT, which is $150 million higher than our previous guidance. This includes transactional currency of approximately $330 million, which impacts our margins, and translational currency of $170 million. Additionally, we expect approximately a $100 million impact due to the recent weakened demand environment in Brazil.", "Combined, these two factors lower our current earnings by approximately $2 per share, from our previous guidance. We view this earnings reduction as concentrated in the first half of this year. We expect to fully offset these headwinds, and return to the second half run rates we previously expected.", "As Mike and Marc discussed, we have taken further accelerated actions through cost-based pricing, cost productivity, and integration synergies to mitigate these impacts. When combined with the actions we've previously communicated, we now expect to deliver $700 million in EBIT improvement on a year-over-year basis to offset these headwinds, and deliver 10% earnings improvement. We have demonstrated over the past few years that we can offset significant cost headwinds, and improve our margins in earnings.", "On Slide 33, let me make some additional comments regarding regional operating margins and our earnings expectations. Given the fact that significant volatility in currency and demand have an immediate impact on our results, and the cost and pricing actions we're taking billed throughout the year, we would expect first half margins and earnings to be relatively flat with the prior year. We do expect strong second half margins and earnings, given the normal earning seasonality of our business and the benefits from actions we have taken.", "As we previously discussed, the normal seasonality in our industry and demand environment drives a ramp up of both volume and productivity as we progress throughout the year. So, the second half is typically more positive than the first half.", "In North America and Europe, we expect second half demand growth and the continued price mix benefit from prior year product transitions and our new product launches. Previously announced price increases as well as a ramp up in acquisition integration of synergies in Europe will also improve second half results. Both of these regions remain on track.", "For Latin America with recently announced price increases, fixed cost reductions, second half product launches, and actions to lower inventories to current demand levels behind us, we expect to restore margins to our prior expectations in the second half. We expect that Brazil's demand weakness and currency impact to result in lower margin expectations for the region on a full year basis. Asia is on track, and we expect continued integration progress from our acquisitions in China as well as continued strong performance from India. In summary, we expect margins to accelerate in the second half as our previously announced cost-based pricing, ongoing cost productivity, and price mix benefits ramp up to more than offset the negative currency impact.", "On Slide 34, you can see additional detail, and how we intend to deliver ongoing business EBIT margin expansion with a very balanced approach.", "On Slide 35, you can see an update on the progress of our integration activities in Europe and Asia. We incurred 33 million in restructuring expense, and $30 million in benefit during the first quarter, which was consistent with our expectations.", "For the full year, our acquisition and restructuring activities are on track, but we expect 300 million in expense, and 175 million in benefits consistent with our earlier guidance. Benefits will be more weighted towards the second half of the year. As we continue to grow revenues and improve margins, we have solid priorities to deploy the cash generated from our business as shown on Slide 36.", "Recently, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend by 20%, reflecting our confidence in the continued strength of our ongoing business. In summary, given our profitable growth trends, increased investment capacity, and strong balance sheet, we continue to balance funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thanks, Larry. Let me sum up by saying we certainly are addressing the short-term challenges we see throughout our business. But as I mentioned earlier, the priorities that we have for the business have not changed. We're focused on successfully integrating our European and Asia acquisitions, which are on track.", "Additionally, we do expect revenue margin growth from our innovating new product launches that are in the market today. I feel good that we deployed very specific actions to address the current challenges, and position us well to expand margins in the second half of the year.", "Our long-term growth strategy certainly remains on track, and we're making great progress towards this as we do continue to see multiple pass to profitable growth throughout our business. And we certainly haven't changed our mid to longer term value creation expectations. Overall, these growth plans do provide us with an outstanding opportunity to continue delivering significant shareholder value.", "So with that, I'd like to conclude our formal remarks and open this up to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "David MacGregor", "Yes, good morning everyone.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning, David.", "Larry Venturelli", "Good morning, David.", "David MacGregor", "I guess just to talk about Latin America for a second; that will certainly be a focal point today, but I wanted to see if you could address to the extent you can, the discrepancy between your competitors that announced 2% organic growth in Latin America this quarter, and your negative 11. And I realize you are up against a pretty tough call from a year ago, but can you help us understand that? Maybe was Embraco a factor there or maybe to the extent you can add some color, it would be helpful.", "Mike Todman", "Yes, David, it's Mike Todman. I'll talk about our business in Latin America and what we saw in the marketplace. And we saw a market that it was dramatically down, and significantly from where we thought it was going to be when we entered the year. And what we saw was that volatility, and really throughout the first quarter.", "So what did we do? We took immediate action to lower our production levels to make sure that we were producing in line with kind of where the market demand was. What we also saw was that some of the trade partners had too much inventory, and so started to de-stock, so that had an impact on overall volumes. So I could only comment on kind of where our volume was, and what the impacts were. And those were largely the significant impacts for us.", "Jeff Fettig", "David, this is Jeff. I would add to that. As we've talked in the past, we subdivide our Latin America business into four elements. Our global compressor business, which I would say is on track. Obviously currency translation affects everything, but in terms of the fundamental business, it's on track. What we call our LAR [[ph] international appliance business, all of our appliance business in the 30 some odd countries outside of Brazil is off to a good start. Our extended expand categories within Brazil continue to grow very rapidly.", "So the heart of our challenges really has to do with the core appliance business in Brazil. And there the issues -- Mike explained it very clearly, the market was down over 20%. We certainly have the currency, the valuation of almost over 40%, and then we still have the issue with inflation, which is relatively high in that country.", "So I think we understand the dynamics of our business very well. A big part of our business is the core appliance business. That's what's under pressure right now. I feel good about the actions we're taking to get it. At least the margins stabilized. Demand is going to be whatever demand is. And we think that's a nearer term problem, but will be with us most of the year.", "David MacGregor", "Okay. Just a follow-up question would be with respect to the guidance of down 10 to 12 for the industry for the year, in the second quarter the comps starts to get decidedly easier here just as you're up against the World Cup from a year ago and then the Presidential Election in the second half. It just seems like you go from a very difficult comp situation 1Q to a much easier comp situation, hesitant to use the word \"Easier,\" but easier nonetheless over the balance of the year. And you took your guidance down substantially. Do you expect that still those procedure [ph] comps still have kind of a 10% challenge as the year goes on, or how does the cadence play out?", "Mike Todman", "Yes. David, it's Mike again. What we're seeing right now is still lower demand, even starting in the second quarter. So we expect demand even though those comps are a little bit easier to continue to be down in the second quarter. And then we see a relative improvement, although still negative, but down in the third and the fourth quarter. And that's exactly what we're experiencing. Remember, a lot of these comps and demand is based on consumer sentiment. And as we said, there are some issues in Brazil in the overall political environment, which are impacting, which won't necessarily resolve just in the short-term. So that's how we have come to the 12%. We still see second quarter being challenging, and slight improvement in the third and fourth quarter.", "David MacGregor", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we can take our next question from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners LLC. Please go ahead.", "Megan McGrath", "Good morning. Thanks. Obviously a lot of questions; just one of the moving parts here, could you just give us a sense for when we're watching things going forward as to when you lowered your guidance, what date you took the FX at? Things are moving pretty quickly, so just so we can sort of track going forward. Was it this week? Was it last week at the end of the quarter?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes. Megan, obviously the currency has moved a lot. So we're using recent rates that we're seeing in the currency markets around the world. As we did during the last call, and as we've seen currencies move, we've taken actions to improve our business in specific areas like price increases and cost reduction because of the fact that currencies are relatively immediate. The benefits that we get from these actions will build over time, but essentially to answer your question, we used very -- the rates we're using are very consistent with what we've seen over the last -- in the very near term.", "Megan McGrath", "Okay, great. And then a follow-up on your guidance, could you give us an update on what you're assuming from commodities? Because we have seen still [ph] prices also continue to decline.", "Larry Venturelli", "Yes, I would say, Megan this is Larry. I would say, our guidance last time was about $50 million of deflation. We're seeing -- probably at current rates we're probably closer to 100 million, but I would say currencies especially in some of the emerging markets around the world obviously are having a negative impact and reducing the benefits of that. But certainly what we're seeing trend-wise material costs have been favorable. I would expect that the benefit from that will be more back-half weighted than first-half weighted.", "Jeff Fettig", "Megan, I would just add to that. You talked about the moving parts, if you really step back and look at our global business; we spoke the two negatives which are globally currency, but really a handful of currencies in particular. The Euro, the Reais, the Canadian dollar, and the Ruble are probably our four most impacted currencies. And they have moved significantly. In the other, we talked about demand, and the only place where we're largely different in demand that we thought is Brazil. Those are the two negatives.", "On the positive side, we feel really good about the rate of integration that's going on to-date. That's very positive. The new product transitions that we had some challenges with in the last couple quarters is behind us, and now we actually have the benefits of having those in the marketplace. And for the full year, our ability both through our cost productivity, our synergies, and our integration benefits, our cost position will improve radically as we go throughout the year.", "So as we look at it, it's really have we adjusted the business to the current range of currencies and demand, and I think the actions we've taken to-date are putting in place in the second quarter we have, and that's why we feel good about our ability to get our margin run rates at an accelerated level in the second half of the year.", "Megan McGrath", "Great, thank you. I'll let others get on. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we can take our next question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Good morning, Jeff, Larry, Marc, Mike. How are you?", "Jeff Fettig", "Hi, Sam.", "Larry Venturelli", "Hi, Sam.", "Sam Darkatsh", "A couple of quick questions; raising prices in Latin America in the face of demand deterioration, obviously there is some benefit to how appliances are sold from a pricing standpoint in the country, but how concerned are you about elasticity as demand perhaps making things more challenging for the consumer down there? That would be my first question.", "Mike Todman", "Okay, Sam. It's Mike. The reality is we've raised prices every time we need to, based on the inflation and the environment. And right now we're focused on expanding our margins, getting our margins back to the level that they need to be. The fact of the matter is there is a level of demand that stays [ph] there, and we're relatively confident in the demand outlook that we've given in that. Having our price increase won't have a material impact on that.", "Jeff Fettig", "Sam, I would add to that. If you look at our price increases, they're at or below the overall level of inflation, one. Two, we're taking just as harder [ph] actions on the cost productivity side, so ensuring that our business is competitive every day. And then the third thing is we don't believe in selling products at a loss, and so restoring the margins is critical in -- I think all the things going on in Brazil recently politically, et cetera has shaken consumer confidence. That has more of an impact than absolute pricing levels, particularly when you consider virtually everything in Brazil is bought on installments, and it's a cost per month. Therefore that's usually not the factor.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Next question, and I recognize this is patently unfair, because your visibility four months ago is going to be different than now, and I'm going to be asking you a question about four years from now, but regarding your 2018 expectations, you are expecting second half 2015 stabilization. Should we reset the base year lower now, and then assumes similar growth rates from there, or is that $22 to $24 goal still hold without making it a stretch goal?", "Jeff Fettig", "Sam, the way I'd answer that, everything we talked about at our Investor Day in our strategy remains intact. We have a different environment in a couple of dimensions right now. We do view this as -- certainly, we've been through ups and downs in Brazil demand before. And we think -- we still believe over the mid to long-term we're going to like the grow rate in Brazil. Currencies you adjust and we are adjusting very rapidly. So as you said, may be it wasn't clear enough, but there's nothing that has happened to date that would cause us or give us pause as to the targets that we outlined for investors, last December.", "Sam Darkatsh", "And final question, Larry, if you could help. Do you have the breakdown of the organic units' growth, or you change year-on-year in Euro and Asia?", "Larry Venturelli", "As Marc I think mentioned, our units, both the acquisition was up in units, and the base business is up in units. And then I think in the [indiscernible] side we're up slightly.", "Sam Darkatsh", "So, in line with the industry in both counts?", "Jeff Fettig", "At least in line or better.", "Larry Venturelli", "I would say Europe was better, China the same, yes.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Okay, thank you.", "Larry Venturelli", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "You can take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, thank you. Could we get some more color on the $100 million benefit from raw materials? What commodities do you see benefiting you the most? And is it your expectation that you'll be able to keep all of this benefit, or that it will be partly computed [ph] away?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, Denise. I think the whole basket of commodities are -- have been stable to lower, whether it's -- again, it depends by market because, and again I don't want to get into complexity here, but currency outside U.S. dollar denominated is -- does have a negative impact. So for example, globally in U.S. dollars we've seen commodity prices go down. That does not mean they go down in local currencies. In fact, in Brazil, we have again that 40% evaluation we have a huge increase in local currencies, but at a macro level, globally steel is a little bit lower year-over-year, hydrocarbons are lower, therefore you see plastic prices, and although we hedge all the pure commodities, the commodity trend has being going down.", "We are probably above that trend right now because of hedges, but over time it just smoothes it out. So a $100 million plus or minus is not a lot in the global business. I would just say this is the first time in absolute dollars that we might actually have lower raw material costs in over a decade. But on the other hand, we have a lot more than that in currency impacts as it relates to materials. So I don't see it as a big game changer either way, other than it won't be a drag against our productivity numbers this year.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, got it. And just a follow-on on that; can you give an update then on the North American competitive situation? I'm just wondering if the strong dollar would be encouraging more discounting by your foreign competitors. But I guess from what you are saying, but U.S. -- in local currency commodity cost has also gone up.", "Marc Bitzer", "Denise, it's Marc, and I'm trying to answer your question. First of all, on the cost base in North America. On the cost base in North America, yes it is true. We're starting to see raw material tailwinds. As you may recall, Q4 and we said that that would be the last quarter where we had headwinds, and now kind of it's slightly turned. So we have some modest benefit in the raw material, which we expect to build, and that added with cost productivity actions helps us improving our cost situation.", "I presume your second question was relatively more to a promotion environment. As you know we're kind of -- we're a little bit somewhat concerned about the heightened level of promoting in Q4. I will take Q1 was what I would describe more back to normal levels.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, got it. Thank you. And just last one, you reduced your CapEx guidance. Are there any projects getting pushed out to 2016, or what's changed there?", "Larry Venturelli", "No, you shouldn't think that any changes -- I mean, just again, on currency in U.S. dollars we're going to have lower CapEx with the same projects.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.", "Ken Zener", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Larry Venturelli", "Good morning, Ken.", "Marc Bitzer", "Good morning, Ken.", "Ken Zener", "Might have more than two questions for you; so when you guys talk about the first half '15, I believe you were talking about flat EBIT. Can you attribute how much of that would be to Brazil? If it's most of it, and then what is that 10% unit decline in Brazil relative to where you were kind of before in volume imply for LATAM margins sequentially. I think this -\u2013 the strength you're talking about in the second half specifically is related to LATAM. You guys had previously a 9% to 11% margin range. So I'm just trying to make sure we're all on the same page for 2Q sequential, which seems to be nine to 11 on the back-half.", "Larry Venturelli", "Yes, Ken, let me try to answer this a little bit differently. I think I understand what your question is, it's more half one versus half two related. We said we'd be relatively flat in the first half of the year, and we did a little under $5.00 a share in the first half of last year, so that'd imply we do over a $7.50 in the second half of this year. There's probably about five factors that you need to take into consideration, first just the normal seasonality in the business. Historically, results are high -- we have higher volume in margins in the second half than we do the first half. If you would go back and look at the last three years, that's probably about $1.50 a share.", "We talk a lot about the acquisition synergies, those will be higher in the back half of the year. That will give you in order of magnitude probably $0.50. Net cost productivity, combination of the cost take out, material cost trends we're seeing will be better in the second half as I mention, and could get a dollar out of that. And then the enacted price increases and improved mix will be more weighted towards the second half based on actions we've taken. There will be a slight offset to that. When we just do the year-over-year currency, impact will be higher in the second half than it was in the first half. That's just that the business is larger, has higher volume in the second half. But that's really the bridge that gets you between the first half and the second half.", "Jeff Fettig", "And Ken, this is Jeff. I would add, you talk about Latin America, I mean the challenges that we saw in Q1, which is currency, which is lower demand, and I would add inflation that's been persistent. Also causes us to reduce our production schedules which will continue on into the second quarter. So you should expect the one part of the region in the world that's negative in terms of EBIT year-over-year, -- in Q1 it is Latin America, and in Q2 it will be Latin America. Everywhere else it is either modestly improving or improving a lot. And so what we're really seeing is that those trends that you saw in Q1 will be similar in Q2. But in Q3 onward, we expect our margins to albeit at a lower revenue level will expand significantly in Latin America. You'll see continued improvement with more cost productivity in North America -- well, in all parts of the world. And in the markets where we have, which are Europe and China, where we have integration activities, those too will ramp up. Q2 is going to look a lot like Q1, and you ought to see an acceleration because of those factors in Q3 and Q4.", "Ken Zener", "So I do, Larry, and Jeff, I do appreciate the details. I'm just still trying to I guess hone you in on that sequential margin. Because when you guys talk about a strong second half in LATAM last quarter you guys provided regional EBIT guidance which was very useful. And if you could update that I think everybody would appreciate that, but it seems\u2026", "Larry Venturelli", "I would say the goals that we talked -- Because we're not going to give quarterly guidance on regional EBIT, but I would say this though, the goals we articulate haven't changed. The one that has been the delayed is Latin America. And you saw we were at 6.6%, so we went down before we go back up, but in terms of where we want to get to, that has not changed. I would say everything else we expect to be tacking to those goals in second half of the year.", "Ken Zener", "Right, okay. Taking a different perspective, and given the majority of the regions are doing well as LATAM. Other companies have elected to use their balance sheet, so you guys have a free cash flow that you're talking about should improve overtime. Can you talk about your willingness to use your balance sheet to perhaps offset some of these currency headwinds, whether it be by buybacks, or what some of the constraints might be and you're thinking that way, whereas many other companies have elected to do that.", "Larry Venturelli", "Yes, Ken, look I think Mike mentioned the several actions that we've taken in Latin America to get our run rates back on track in the second half of the year, again, this is timing between half one and half two. We've \u2013- as a company if you look over the last several years, we continue to fund the business through capital spending. That's averaged 3.5% a year. We do have a targeted debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately one to one and a half times. You have to remember today is the highest debt to EBITDA that we've had over the last several years, and that's primarily due to the acquisitions that we took on last year, and we fully expect to be back to pre-acquisition metrics by the end of 2016. That has not changed.", "We've also over the last several years repurchased over a billion dollars of stock. We've provided a dividend in the range of 25% to 30% of our earnings annually. I just mentioned, we just increased that, and then opportunistically we've taken advantage of M&A. I think all those actions combined have been reflected in the company's stock price. So we're deploying the operational actions that we can do to return the business and Latin America back to the margins that we previously expected. We will from time-to-time repurchase stock as well as balance the other opportunities we have. So our capital allocation decisions haven't changed. I think we're doing a very well-balanced approach to it.", "Ken Zener", "Thank you.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We can take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.", "Eric Bosshard", "Thank you. The Europe margin performance in the quarter and the outlook through the year, it sounds like the incremental cost saves and synergies you're talking about, it sounds like you're affirming the 175 million, same number that you've been at, and so the two questions, one, how do you think about the progress of Europe margins 1Q relative to 4Q and how the margins should behave through the year. And then secondly, as you're generating cost saves, your confidence in netting those cost saves to the bottom line as we work our way through the year.", "Marc Bitzer", "And Eric, it's Marc. Let me try to answer your question. First of all, the previous full year margin which we gave as a guidance from regional perspective was 4% to 5% for Europe, and 2.7% in Q1. So to answer it in short, we're fully confident that we are within that margin range. You've got to bear in mind, first of all in Europe, the seasonality in Europe is probably stronger than in other regions. So the Q1 is typically -- and if you go back the last ten years I think nine of ten years it's by far the lowest margin quarter.", "Two, as we previously indicated, a lot of the integration synergy is build throughout the year, so things which we -- and actions which we either took over or announced in Q1 that starts to build in terms of synergies throughout the year. So take the normal seasonality, add the typical synergy build up throughout the year, we're very confident that we are exactly within that margin range.", "Eric Bosshard", "And then within that, the second part of the question, the experience and -- again, I understand you're on the business for six months or so now, but the confidence that you have in netting the saves to the bottom line, I'll ask differently, how is the competitive environment there, the pricing environment, how do you feel and what are you observing within that? Is that any different now that you've combined the two businesses?", "Larry Venturelli", "Eric, on that point, I mean keep in mind the synergies are unique to us. So it's not industry-wide cost benefits. These are unique to us. So yes, we have a high degree of confidence that we can take them to the bottom line.", "Jeff Fettig", "And we've been pleased with the market, combined market or performances, they're running at or above the market in terms of volume. Our price mix is stable, and so we fully expect them to follow the bottom line.", "Eric Bosshard", "All right. And then if I could just follow-up on Latin America; two questions there. One what were your units in Brazil down relative to the market that sounds like was down 16 to 20 is the -- is the first question, and secondly, the inventory situation in Brazil, yours and the channel, did you exit the first quarterback at normal or is that progress expected to be made in 2Q?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, answer to the first question, Eric; we were slightly down more than the industry so we did loose a little bit of market share in the first quarter. But we felt a bit about where we were in the run rates. And the answer to the second quarter is we expect some continued inventory reduction in the second quarter. We think we will be more normalized as we get through the second quarter going into the second half.", "Eric Bosshard", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Michael Rehaut", "Thanks, good morning. First question, I was hoping to go back to Slide 32, where you quantify on a full year basis the currency and Brazil demand and the actions taken, and I wanted to try and look at that slide, if possible, thinking about it through just the incremental change from today versus three months ago when you gave your guidance originally. And so I believe you said earlier, Larry, that there is an incremental 150 negative impact between today and three months ago from the currency. I'd presume that Brazil demand environment worsening that 100 million is also fully incremental. And if you could just confirm that, and then on actions taken as you list the different categories there, what is just purely incremental versus three months ago? I know you talked a lot about cost-based price actions, but if you could kind of walk through the different buckets there?", "Larry Venturelli", "Yes. Michael, versus February when providing guidance, we made a $2 adjustment; $1.50 of that is strictly due to currency, primarily the Real and the Euro. And the balance is related to the Brazil economic environment. If you would go back and look at our expectations for the year from a price mix perspective, last time we said I believe we get about a point of price mix, now we are seeing a point to point and a half. We take that additional pricing since the last call in Brazil, Canada, and Eastern Europe. So that explains that. Cost and capacity reduction essentially remains unchanged from what we said for a full year basis. Ongoing cost productivity, material costs, we are seeing benefits from material costs versus last year about a point. But remember, we are taking out a lot of production to meet demand. So we are still saying we will get at least a point there.", "Marketing and technology is essentially the same. And the big mover, as I mentioned before was currency. Now we are seeing -- I think we said 1 to 1.5 times last time, and now we are seeing 1.5 to 2 times.", "Michael Rehaut", "So I guess taking it in another way, with essentially your expectation that second half is unchanged from previous expectation, does that effectively -- in kind of reference to an earlier question, if you expect all these actions to come in fully, and get you back to your prior 2H '15 expectations, it would seem then that excluding any incremental, again, currency or demand type shocks that would kind of get you back on track for those longer term expectations, is that fair to say?", "Larry Venturelli", "That's fair to say, especially the action we have taken in the first quarter and what we are doing here in the second quarter positions us well to get back on the run rates for the second half of the year than we expected originally.", "Michael Rehaut", "Okay. And just lastly on this topic, it seems like most of the offsetting actions are the additional pricing initiatives, but there is also little bit of cost out in Brazil as well. To offset that impact, is it really kind of like two-thirds additional cost-based pricing and one-third cost reductions, or how to think about that mix?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, Michael, I would say we are pushing hard on both, but I mean the bigger factor is price. But I would say we are redoubling our efforts on cost productivity in places like -- well, really everywhere, but particularly places like Brazil, including significant structural changes. We are not going to wait for the demand environment to get better, although we believe it will. We are reducing fixed costs, headcount, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, very, very aggressively, because we learned from being in the Brazilian market for 70 years that the faster you adjust to the new environment, the better position you are even in recovery, and that's what we are doing.", "Michael Rehaut", "All right. And just to make sure also the acquisition, synergies and the acquisition contributions expected this year, that has not changed at all, in other words there is no acceleration in any of those synergies or benefits?", "Marc Bitzer", "Hey, Michael, it's Marc. Let me try to answer this for the European part of the acquisition. The acquisition as I said before is firmly on track. Actually if you would peel back and look in Euro-denominated synergies, we're even ahead of our original scheduling timeline. But of course because of Euro/dollar translation you lose some of that, okay. Net-net even dollars are synergies and synergy expectations are fully on track. It's a complicated and complex undertaking, but we are fully in control and on track.", "Larry Venturelli", "And Michael, I would say that in Asia, this China integration we're fully on track with the expectations that we gave at the beginning of the year.", "Michael Rehaut", "Great, thank you.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thank you.", "Larry Venturelli", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.", "Jay McCanless", "Good morning, everyone. First question I had, when you look at the $12 to $13 on ongoing EPS guidance, can you discuss what type of interest rate environment you factored into that guidance, and also what type of currency impact you factored into it?", "Larry Venturelli", "Yes, Jay, from an interest rate perspective, we are largely -- our portfolio right now is fixed. We have a small maturity in May. So I would say that what you're seeing from our run rate in Q1 should be fairly close and indicative of what you will see for the full year. As I mentioned before, from a currency perspective, the way we set our guidance is recent rates that we've experienced in the key markets; Euro, Real, Canadian dollar, Russian currency. So hopefully that answers your question.", "Jay McCanless", "Okay. The second question I had, if you exclude the one-time gain from the curtailment, it looks like SG&A deleveraged by about 100 bips year-over-year, is that how we should expect deleverage going forward to the rest of the year?", "Larry Venturelli", "Yes. We did have a curtailment gain, first one that was not in our ongoing results, and that is in our GAAP results. The majority of that would have hit in the gross margin line. But from an SG&A perspective, apples-to-apples, if you adjust out pension settlements, acquisition-related transition expenses, this year and last year we were really around 9.8% run rate compared to what we're reporting today about 10.3.", "Jay McCanless", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Larry Venturelli", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Q&A session. I'll now turn the program back over to Mr. Jeff Fettig for closing remarks.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, again, thank you all for joining today. We appreciate your questions, and we look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you again.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Chris Conley. Please go ahead, sir.", "Chris Conley", "Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Vice Chairmen, Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from those statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on slide one and in the appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to slide two, we want to remind you, that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 37, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. In our press release this morning, we reported record revenue and ongoing earnings for the second quarter. As expected, the global economic environment continue to be challenging with currency volatility and weak emerging market demand, primarily in three core countries for us in emerging markets. First in Brazil, we saw a decline in demand of about 12%, Russia was down about 25% and China was down about 3%. At the same time, our integration activities in Europe and Asia are progressing well, and we will continue to accelerate these integrations as we move into the second part of the year.", "As we outlined in April, we\u2019ve deployed actions to deliver second half margin expansion and those plans are on track to deliver record revenue and ongoing earnings performance for the year. Our ability to deliver these results in this environment reflects the strength and focus of our execution and the benefits of our expanded global operating platform.", "I\u2019ll now turn to Slide 5 to briefly review the financials. You\u2019ll see here that we had strong revenue growth year-over-year in the quarter. Excluding the impact of currency, our revenues were up 25% versus last year. Our ongoing business earnings per diluted share were a second quarter record at $2.70, compared to $2.62 last year and this was primarily driven by strong earnings growth in Europe and Asia. Our free cash flow was slightly higher compared to last year, primarily due to the stronger \u2013 strong working capital management, partially offset by the impact of our acquisitions.", "On Slide 6ix, you see that we\u2019re reaffirming our ongoing business EPS guidance with ongoing EPS forecast for the year of $12 to $13 a share and we expect to generate approximately $700 million of free cash flow. Turing to Slide 7, you can see that our business properties, which we\u2019ve shared previously for the year, are unchanged, and we believe that are fully aligned where we see growth and margin opportunities.", "There\u2019s three core areas where we\u2019re driving opportunities for the year. Certainly, our integration activities in Europe and China, as I mentioned, are on track and we expect to accelerate those integrations in the second half. We have deployed cost-based pricing and inflationary and currency markets and we continue to focus on cost productivity programs around the globe. Combined, we believe these will expand our margins in the second half of the year. We do also expect our investments in new products and growth beyond our core business \u2013 our core appliance business to continue to drive both revenue growth and margin expansion.", "Finally, I just reference Slide 8, where we outline what we\u2019ve showed you before, our long-term growth strategy, which we believe remains on track. We continue to leverage multiple opportunities for growth in our market expansion, which fall under three main pillars: geographical expansion, product and brand innovation, and leveraging our right-size fixed cost structure. So in summary, we are making good progress so far this year, and we expect to deliver record sales and ongoing earnings in 2015.", "So, with this, I will turn over to Marc Bitzer.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Let me begin on Slide 10 by reviewing North America\u2019s performance in the second quarter, starting with the top line. Net sales of $2.7 billion for North America were up slightly compared to the prior-year period and nearly 1.5% excluding currency. Our second quarter ongoing business operating profit was a record $290 million, or 10.8% of sales, compared to $285 million in the second quarter of 2014.", "We continue to expand our operating margins behind the strong ongoing cost productivity and fixed cost leverage. While we\u2019re pleased with our second quarter margins, we did experience a few challenges. One, Canadian currency continued to be unfavorable with roughly 14% year-over-year devaluation and we have already executed cost base price increase to offset that impact.", "Two, due to very strong demand for our newly launched products, including our new KitchenAid line, we experienced some short-term capacity constraints. We have made several investments to improve our capacity for these new products and expect to meet demand in the second half. Three, we also adjusted our production levels to appropriately match inventory risk demand. These challenges had an unfavorable impact of approximately $40 million on our second quarter margins. As you might recall on our fourth quarter conference call, we provided operating margin expectations of 10.5% to 11.5%. After a strong first half, we are already at the lower end of that range.", "And turning to Slide 11, we layout our second half actions to continue improving margins. We believe the industry is on track to grow by 4%, consistent with our expectations for multi-year recovery. If our new products fully floored, we expect to continue leveraging consumer demands to drive improved price mix and volume growth in the second half. And our previously announced Canadian cost-based pricing actions are designed to offset the impact of currency. And we will also continue to deploy a strong cost productivity plans. We expect these actions combined with our normal seasonal improvement to deliver growth and margin improvement in the second half of 2015, consistent with our prior expectations. And on Slide 12, we highlight our new suite of black stainless steel KitchenAid appliances. These products are designed to bring professional-style appliances, without a commercial stainless steel look, and has been exceptionally well received in the U.S.", "I would now share the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, as shown on Slide 14. Sales were $1.3 billion, compared to $0.7 billion in the prior year, driven by the integration and continued recovery in Western European demand. Ongoing operating profit was the second quarter record of $56 million with ongoing operating margins of 4.2%, compared to $2 million and 0.2% in the second quarter 2014. During the second quarter, positive volume, ongoing cost productivity and the planned acceleration of integration activities more than offset the unfavorable impact of currency and lower demand in Eastern Europe, delivering yet another quarter of significantly expanded operating profit and margin.", "On Slide 15, as we look towards the full-year 2015, we expect our integration activities to continue building in the back half. For 2015, we expect the industry to be up 0% to 2%, although it is currently trending at a higher-end of the range as Western European demand recovery is more than offsetting the weakness in Eastern Europe, most prominently in Russia and in Ukraine. The benefits from previously announced cost-based price increases are designed to offset the impact of currency.", "And in summary, we remain focused on accelerating integration activities, ongoing cost productivity programs and growth from new product launches, both within and beyond the core. And on Slide 16, as an example of product leadership in the region, you can see our new Whirlpool branded refrigerator that is designed to optimize food preservation by reducing freezer burn by up to 50%.", "And now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mike.", "Mike Todman", "Thanks, Marc. Let me begin with our Latin America results on Slide 18. Compared to what we shared on our first quarter call, the macro environment in Brazil has weakened further and currency has remained significantly devalued. As a result, sales for the quarter were $854 million, down approximately 22% from the same period of prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 1% from the prior year period.", "Our ongoing business operating profit for the quarter totaled $36 million or 4.2% of sales compared to $87 million and 8% in the prior year period. These results included an unfavorable operating profit impact of $25 million due to currency and another $10 million due to reduced production levels. These impacts were partially offset by previously announced cost-based pricing, the benefits of cost and capacity reduction initiatives, and strong results in our appliance business outside of Brazil.", "On Slide 19, we layout our actions to improve margins and return to run rates more reflective of our expectations. We now expect 2015 industry for Latin America to be down approximately 15%, reflecting the further deterioration in Brazil. As mentioned earlier, currency continues to be a challenge for us, as we expect the reais to U.S. dollar exchange rate to be between $3 and $3.25. As discussed on our previous call, we have executed strong and decisive actions to offset the impact of the demand decline and currency devaluation. These actions include previously announced cost-based pricing, new product launches and fixed cost reductions.", "And in the weaker demand environment, we are taking additional actions targeting fixed cost reduction to improve margins. Additionally, in the first half, we rebalanced production levels to match reduced demand, and we will continue to monitor and adjust if needed for the remainder of the year. It is important to note that we expect to see the impact of all these actions beginning in the second half of 2015, at which time we expect to deliver improved operating margins compared to the first half. As we implement these actions, we expect margins to strengthen in the third quarter and then to grow significantly in the fourth quarter.", "While we will likely be lower than our long-term margin expectations for Latin America, we believe we have the right actions to address the operating environment and improve the trajectory of the margin profile. Turning to Slide 20 as a demonstration of our global leadership in the laundry category, we launched a Whirlpool laundry product with the smart load system that reduces water consumption, in addition to delivering best-in-class capacity and superior washing results.", "Now turning to our second quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 22. Net sales were $381 million in comparison to $211 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by the impact of the integration. We have delivered a second quarter record ongoing profit of $31 million, compared to $4 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 8.1%, up significantly compared to the prior year period, behind the record performance in India and the expanded benefits of integration activities in our expanded China business.", "Turning to Slide 23, we continue to see favorable macro trends in India and negative macro trends in China. Our industry guidance for Asia as a whole is flat. In summary, for 2015, we expect continued growth from our integration activities, strength in India, and as a result continued strong margin performance in the second half from our larger growth platform. On Slide 24, you can see our Diqua front-load washing machine with a five-inch interactive display and a sensor that reduces vibration and noise. This product is an example of how we continue to leverage products from the integration to accelerate our growth in China.", "Now, I would like to turn it over to Larry.", "Larry Venturelli", "Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Let me start with our second quarter results on Slides 26 and 27. As Jeff mentioned, we have record net sales and ongoing operating profit during the quarter. Our revenues were $5.2 billion compared to $4.7 billion last year, an increase of over 11%. Currencies impacted our revenues by nearly $650 million, EBIT margins by 1.75 points and net earnings by approximately $1 per share. The diversification of our regional profit contribution, cost and capacity reductions, ongoing cost productivity, and benefits from our acquisitions, more than offset the headwinds we\u2019ve discussed. And as expected, the company delivered record ongoing earnings of $2.70 per share up from the $2.62 reported last year.", "Allow me to make a few more detail points on our financial results. First, SG&A as a percentage of sales on a GAAP basis increased by one 1 point, approximately half of this increase is due to acquisition related costs with the remainder primarily associated with the deleveraging effect of a weaker demand environment in Brazil. We do expect the SG&A margins to return to prior year levels, as we realized integration synergies, additional fixed cost reductions and higher volumes in the second half. Additionally, the interest in sundry line improved year-over-year, driven by a gain from a business investment in Brazil, which had no impact on ongoing earnings.", "Finally as shown on Slide 27, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 32% and year-to-date is approximately 20%. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate to be between 22% to 25% for both GAAP and ongoing earnings. On Slide 28, we reaffirm our guidance for ongoing business earnings of $12 to $13 per share here, as well as our expectations of approximately $700 million for free cash flow.", "Turning to Slide 29, let me make some additional comments, regarding expected earnings per share drivers for the second half as compared to the first half of 2015. We expect strong second half earnings, given the seasonal ramp up in demand of our business and the benefits from actions we have already taken. In North America and Europe, we expect demand growth to continue, in addition to the price mix benefit from prior product transitions and our new product launches.", "In the second half, we expect our previously announced price increases will be in full effect in Canada, Brazil and Russia. As a result, we expect $1 in earnings per share from price mix and another $1.50 from normal volume seasonality in the second half. And additional $0.50 in earnings per share improvement is expected from ongoing cost productivity and positive raw material trends. Our acquisition integrations are firmly on track in Europe and Asia and we expect an additional $0.50 in the second half as those synergies continue to ramp up throughout the year. Finally, we expect currency to drive a negative $0.75 in earnings per share impact, primarily due to the translation effect of higher seasonal volume in the second half.", "In summary, we expect earnings per share to accelerate in the second half, as our previously announced cost-based price actions, ongoing cost productivity, acquisition synergies and price mix benefits ramp up to more than offset the negative currency impact. And as a result, we expect to deliver between $7.16 to $8.16 per share in the second half from an EPS perspective.", "On Slide 30, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and integration activities in both Europe and Asia. We incurred $90 million in restructuring expense and $65 million in benefits during the first half, which was consistent with our expectations. For the full year, consistent with prior guidance, we expect $300 million in expense and $175 million in benefits. And as previously discussed, these benefits are more weighted towards the second half of the year. As we continue to grow revenues and improve margins, we have solid priorities to deploy the cash generated from our business as shown on Slide 31.", "In the second quarter, we continued our balanced approach to cash allocation. In addition, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% and $0.90 per share and repurchased $50 million of stock through our share buyback program. We also signed an agreement to purchase the American Dryer Corporation, which closed in early July. In summary, given our profitable growth trends, increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we continue to balance funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thanks, Larry. Well, just to sum up our priorities, as you\u2019ve heard throughout the call, have remained focused on the successful integrations in both Europe and Asia and we have very strong operational plans to deliver the expanded margins we\u2019ve discussed for the year. These actions do include cost-based pricing and \u2013 already communicated the key markets as well as cost productivity programs.", "Overall, we expect these actions to move us towards the run rates more representative of what we outlined in our long-term planning. Our strategy is progressing well and we continue to execute many actions on the three paths I described earlier, in terms of providing opportunities for both revenue growth and margin expansion. And we continue to believe that these plans provide us with an outstanding opportunity to not only have another record year this year, but also to deliver significant shareholder returns.", "So, with that, I\u2019m going to close our formal remarks and I would like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Megan McGrath [MKM Partners]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Megan McGrath", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to start on North America \u2013 pardon me. First on the demand environment, it does look as if you may have underperformed the overall market a little bit in the quarter, I know that there are some differences between your numbers and AHAM, but was that part do you think of the inventory adjustment or was there sort of more aggressive pricing happening in the quarter that you decided not to participate in?", "Marc Bitzer", "Good morning, Megan, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. I\u2019m going to take your questions. First of all, let me just reiterate what I said in the couple of previous calls also. First off all, our reported unit shipments versus a T6 market share what you typically see were not fully comparable. We sell more of just T6 major appliances. We also report non-T6 major appliances as well as Canada and Mexico units. We\u2019ve also have extended \u2013 expand business made of many products, like small domestic appliances.", "So, obviously, you should focus on revenue growth and margins. And as you know, we delivered strong margins and we did deliver growth in Q2. Admittedly, that growth lacked industry and it\u2019s important to keep a few issues and I will get to your question in mind with regard to our second quarter unit performance. One, we completed one of our larger product transitions in the middle of the quarter with a rollout of a KitchenAid suite of kitchen products, which is a side note. The last time we did that was 10 years ago. So, this is a very significant product launch. Because we have been transitioned in large product lines for much of the past few quarters, we haven\u2019t yet seen the full capability of our new product lines in the market.", "Obviously, going forward, we expect that the healthy growth from these new products in the markets. Second, during the quarter, we saw stronger than expected demand for our recently launched new products, while our production capacity is still ramping up. We\u2019ve made investments to improve our capacity, and we also expect to see marked improvements in the third quarter and fourth quarter as a result.", "And thirdly, yes, during the quarter, we did see some moderately aggressive promotional activities from a few competitors, which we choose not to participate in. As an example, we saw validate strong promotions in front-load laundry, where we sustained dumping by certain imports or top-mount refrigerator and we\u2019ve seen promotions in spite of cost increases due to the energy efficiency investments. So, whenever there is a promotional activity in the market, we evaluate whether or not, we can create value for our shareholders and rank [ph] by participating. When we see value, we participate. When we don\u2019t see value, we do not participate.", "Megan McGrath", "Great, thanks for that. And I just wanted to clarify. You mentioned in your opening remarks, a $40 million negative impact, was that just from the inventory adjustment or was that all three things that you mentioned, the Canada, the product transition and the inventory adjustment?", "Marc Bitzer", "Megan, it\u2019s Marc again. It\u2019s all three things combined.", "Megan McGrath", "All three things, okay.", "Marc Bitzer", "So, and of course that is a rough estimate, but that gives you a sense in terms of probably what our potential in Q2 was.", "Megan McGrath", "And can you give us any sort of breakdown of what was the biggest impact of that 40?", "Marc Bitzer", "No, I mean, we took it \u2013 first of all, the 40 is already a rough estimate. So, it\u2019s kind of difficult to really break it down to components. But the inventory adjustment was a big part. Back to you other question, Megan, just trying to bring our working capital levels in line before we saw as a top-line growth from the first half of the year.", "Megan McGrath", "Great, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from David MacGregor [Longbow Research]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "David MacGregor", "Yeah. Congratulations on some of this progress. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about Latin America and specifically you\u2019ve referenced pricing initiatives aimed at offsetting FX. Can you talk about your level of confidence in the Latin American price increases for holding and what\u2019s obviously difficult macro-environment? And then secondly, if you could just maybe provide a little bit of color on your non-Brazilian Latin American business, you said it was doing better, if you can maybe give us a little more elaboration that would be helpful? Thanks.", "Mike Todman", "Yes, David, it\u2019s Mike Todman. With respect to the price increase in Brazil, in fact, we held as well as holding our market share. So we had sequentially flat market share and the pricing has held and that\u2019s what\u2019s allowed us frankly to offset the huge currency impact, as well as the demand \u2013 the market demand environment, but pricing is absolutely held. In terms of the business outside of Latin America, actually we saw a growth of around 12% in that business. So that business continues to perform very well and we saw a significant as well improvement double-digit in operating profit from that business. So, we feel very good about that in the markets outside of Latin America.", "Jeff Fettig", "David, this is Jeff. I just add to that, in Brazil in particular, when we say \u2013 there is really three impacts. There is obviously the demand environment, which is negative. We have the devaluation year-over-year of about over 40%, so you have the translation impact. And when we talk about pricing offsetting currency, it\u2019s really offsetting the inflation consequences of the currency in the Whirlpool market. Well, we will not offset translation currency.", "David MacGregor", "Okay, thanks. And then if I could squeeze one more in. And just if you could comment on raw material deflation and you know your competitor adjusted their guidance for the year, any thoughts on how you\u2019re tracking versus that $100 million target, is it possible that you might have ultimately outperformed that number in the second half?", "Larry Venturelli", "Yeah, David, it\u2019s Larry. As we stated in our prepared remarks, we do expect a higher second half contribution of about $0.50 per share versus the first half from net productivity, which would include materials versus our first half performance. During our last call, we did say that materials would be approximately $100 million lower this year and you know I\u2019d say if current commodity rates hold, it could be better than that. We\u2019ll see how the rates continue to evolve, but we\u2019re confident in $100 million and we are \u2013 if rates continue to improve, we should potentially have some upside. I would mention that, it\u2019s important to remind \u2013 remember that we are experiencing headwinds in currency, which in currency outside of the U.S. and from when you\u2019re purchasing U.S. denominated current commodities.", "David MacGregor", "Okay. And if you are to revise the raw material guidance, would that also imply that you\u2019d be revising your cost synergy guidance on Indesit, given that a large portion of the early stages in the synergies are raw material related?", "Marc Bitzer", "David, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer, I can take it. No, in a nutshell, we wouldn\u2019t because, when in the particular \u2013 Indesit in particularly applies what Larry just outlined. You still have a large amount of purchases in U.S. dollar denominated. So, even while you may see increase in tailwind from a raw material side, it\u2019s pretty much eaten up by currency a bit, because you buy still in the U.S. dollars.", "David MacGregor", "Got it, thanks very much.", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Denise Chai [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, thank you. Just going back to Latin America, could you talk about how Brazil performed during the quarter? I mean even just over the course of the quarter, do they continue to deteriorate, and how are you looking at the back half? And could you be a little bit more specific in terms of where you expect second half margins to come in?", "Mike Todman", "Yeah. Denise, it\u2019s Mike Todman. During the quarter, what we saw was just a continued deterioration of the overall market environment. So and as you all know, it\u2019s kind of the political crisis that\u2019s been led to an economic environment and challenging environment. And, the fact of the matter is, what we\u2019ve said is, we\u2019ve adjusted our outlook for the year to now minus 15%, which implies that the second half will be slightly worse, if you will than the first half. The first half was about minus 14%. So, we continue to see a fairly challenging environment.", "What we\u2019ve done is obviously adjust our business to that particular market demand environment. And so, the actions that we\u2019ve taken, including the cost-based price increases, which we\u2019ve already announced, but we\u2019ve taken some significant fixed-cost reductions and are taking more just to make sure that we can improve the margins. I\u2019m not going to give you an exact margin number for the second half, but we do expect for it to improve significantly, substantially over the first half.", "Jeff Fettig", "Denise, I would \u2013 it\u2019s Jeff. I would add that I mean clear of the two variables are \u2013 right now are demanding currency and they moved quite radically. Our assumption, we\u2019ve kind of laid down is that it\u2019s pretty much stays the same as where we see it today. But if you accept that, I would just say as I said in my comments, we expect over time our Latin American business to deliver double-digit operating profits. We clearly didn\u2019t with all this in the first half. We won\u2019t get there in the second half, but we will be \u2013 if those assumptions stay the same, we will have significant improvement from what we see in Q1 and Q2.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, got it. Thank you. And then, just in North America \u2013 sorry, you have the $40 million negative impact in the second quarter. Will there be anymore of that to come in the third quarter from Canada\u2019s upon transition et cetera?", "Marc Bitzer", "Hey, Denise, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. I would say, on the capacity constraints, we\u2019re slowly working our way out and again that\u2019s just normal ramp up as we launched brand new product line. And capacity in this case not only our own production capacity, it\u2019s also applied capacities. So that\u2019s been a normal ramp-up coupled with strong demand. So, I would say it\u2019s largely behind us. The inventory adjustment is completely behind us. And the Canadian currency unfortunately not actually \u2013 this week it got worse. So, I think it would \u2013 it\u2019s a mix bag, but I would still characterize the majority of issues are behind us.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, got it. And just really fast, the value of the strong promotions that you saw in the second quarter, have those continued as well?", "Marc Bitzer", "First of all, Denise, you\u2019ve got to bear in mind that there\u2019s certain promotion of [indiscernible] throughout the year, and obviously July 4 is a key element. So, right now, we\u2019re kind of end of July or mid July, there\u2019s no active big promotion out there. And it\u2019s too early to speculate on what might be happening on Labor Day or on Black Friday. But what I would like to emphasize is the promotions were not across all categories. With our certain categories, it is just our choice when to participate or not to participate.", "Denise Chai", "Understood, thank you.", "Marc Bitzer", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Zener [KeyBanc Capital Markets]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Ken Zener", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning, Ken.", "Mike Todman", "Good morning, Ken.", "Ken Zener", "I might have more than two questions. So, if we look at Brazil LatAm, Jeff, I think \u2013 and Mike, please jump in. 1Q was down 20, the mark was down 15. You said LatAm net overall you now expect to be down 15 versus 10 to 12. But your comments seem to be that Brazil is getting weaker, but with all that decline, your 10 to 12, down to 15. Is that all Brazil and what does that mean about the second half comp? Is it seems like you have kind of stabilized in May. So, did it get worse since May and how much was attributable to Brazil versus other markets? First question.", "Jeff Fettig", "When we refer to the market data, Ken, we\u2019re only talking about Brazil. And I don\u2019t know that it got worse, it\u2019s just been consistently bad kind of since the first quarter and it\u2019s still bad. We thought \u2013 when we talked in April that it might not be as bad in the second quarter given we\u2019re comping against a weak prior year World Cup driven type of thing, but it just stayed double-digit negative. And so, our view is \u2013 given the environment there right now is that we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to change that in the very near-term.", "Ken Zener", "Okay. And again respectfully, but it seems like it got worse from where you had kind of talked about and I think Mike you alluded to the margins being second half better than first half. It\u2019s specifically they are being a big ramp in 4Q versus 3Q, where I think before the baseline was kind of at the back half would it be 9% to 10% margin? Could you give a little granularity there to the extent your pricing in the quarter was very strong at 2015 price mix versus your down volume 2014, so what\u2019s causing that I guess delay in that margin expansion that what Mike referred to a significant in 4Q versus 3Q in the second half versus first half?", "Larry Venturelli", "Hey, Ken. I think \u2013 it\u2019s Larry. I think what\u2019s important to remember is Brazil has had to take out a lot of production in the second quarter to meet that demand. So while we are \u2013 well Mike is absolutely right. We are getting the price mix of some very strong price mix. You have two things happen. One is productivity from taking inventories down and with the lower sales base right now, you\u2019re not getting as much leverage on SG&A.", "We expect that actions we\u2019ve taken, the right-size inventories are largely behind us now. The price increases we\u2019re taking are now in full effect, which should continue into the second half of the year. And then I think the combination of those in the fixed cost reductions we\u2019re taking, the exit rate for Latin America will exit at a nice strong margin.", "Jeff Fettig", "And there is also the normal \u2013 even there depressed demand levels are still the normal seasonality. Q4 is going to be a much higher volume, although lower, much higher volume than Q3 as Q3 is traditionally one of the weakest seasonal demands.", "Ken Zener", "Okay. And then how much does currency plays into not only in terms of how it translates, but in terms of how you\u2019re bringing right inventory to be then priced in. It sounds like you gave a currency of 3 to 3.25 for the reais, which would be I think it was kind of just above 3 when you guys reported in April. So you kind of had another 4% or 5% deterioration there, it seems in that currency, does that play into that delay of EBIT?", "Jeff Fettig", "Well. You know actually, I mean it\u2019s been all over the management I think even in April, it\u2019s 335.", "Mike Todman", "335.", "Jeff Fettig", "So, we again, we got two critical assumptions on the Latin America, and Brazil forecast. And, that\u2019s currency levels, which we\u2019re just saying that we\u2019re basing our \u2013 of our discussion around where our planning is that it\u2019s going to be between 3% and 3.25%, and it\u2019s kind of right in the middle now. And the demand will remain basically negative by about 15% for the full year. Now, those can change, but that\u2019s what we base things on. And, that \u2013 and, based on that environment, we know our pricing actions and our cost actions, taking into count those negatives will improve as we go throughout the year.", "Ken Zener", "Okay. And, I guess this last one for North America. Mark, you referred to seasonality being stronger in the second half versus the first half. Just looking at them out, I mean there is a lot of different variance, but it generally seems like you\u2019re on the order of 100 basis points higher than the second half, because that volume leverage. Would that be a fair characterization? Thank you.", "Mark Todman", "Yes, Ken, it\u2019s Mark. So, first of all, on the margins particularly, as you recall, we gave a guidance or expectation of 10.5% to 11.5% full year. We finished Q2 with 10.8%. We still firmly believe that we\u2019re in that range on a full-year base, which also tell us in the back half clearly margins, on the average or to the high-end of that range. Back to your point, [indiscernible] versus certain amount of volume leverage in part of Q3, there is also certain seasonality, in particular, of a small domestic, which lifts typically out Q4. So, it\u2019s a combination of both volume leverage and the seasonality of certain products.", "Ken Zener", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll move to [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to inquire, what was the organic volume growth in EMEA and the Asian businesses? And your margin performance was a lot better than we were expecting. Now, I was just wondering to ask you, how much in the back half, can we see further expansion?", "Marc Bitzer", "Bob, it\u2019s Marc. I maybe start with the Europe piece. So, I\u2019m glad to hear that the margins meet your expectation, but it didn\u2019t meet our expectation very exactly in the range of what we guided towards. On a full year basis, we guided European margins 4% to 5%. We finished Q2 with 4.2%, which is encouraging that we\u2019re already in Q2 in that range. We do see a further margin expansion and probably more to the high end of that range and that is largely coming from a build of synergies and restructuring activity. There is some top line growth. On your question about the top line growth, I understand, obviously, in particular, when you look at revenues, it\u2019s a little bit confusing that\u2019s exchange rate. In local currency, i.e., in euro, we had a very healthy growth, pretty much across all base business despite our now much stronger exposure in Eastern Europe.", "Mike Todman", "Okay. And Bob, let me just talk about China. We had a strong growth in China. I think it was slightly over 80%. If you look at both businesses combined in fact, we picked up market share. But, it\u2019s a lower demand environment in China than we had originally thought it was going to be. So, we\u2019re on a minus 3% or so market. So, that obviously, impacted the total volume, but the growth was about in line with what we thought it was going to be. In terms of our margins, we were at 8.1% margins for Asia and we guided at the beginning of the year to be between 7% and 8%. So, we\u2019re already at kind of top end of that range and that\u2019s what we expect.", "Jeff Fettig", "And there is some seasonality in emerging markets in Asia as well. Second quarter \u2013 first and second quarter were good, third quarter is usually weak and then fourth quarter it recovered. So, there is some seasonality effort. To Mike\u2019s point, we\u2019re pretty much in track in the way we want to be.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That\u2019s good and I just want to get a little clarification on your North American volume outlook for 4% growth. I was just hoping, you could slice a little bit, is the benefit by your implied guidance would point towards mid single-digit unit volume growth. And is that a function of working through the inventory destocking or is that a sign of better organic demand and sustained consumer spending on appliances. And if you get that, if the second piece of that\u2019s right, it is better consumer demand, would you expect to see firmer pricing. Thanks a lot and good luck.", "Marc Bitzer", "Bob, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer, again, let me just comment on the volume outlook. As you may recall, the very beginning of the year we guide towards 4% to 6% than we kind of \u2013 a little bit more [indiscernible] that\u2019s what we technically still have today. And that\u2019s all based on Q1 being a little bit softer, Q2 actually being in a reasonably healthy shape, and if you basically do the math that would imply a back half volume growth in the market of 4% to 5% just to get to the math.", "I would see \u2013 I would say, first of all, we have seen as of the second quarter pretty sustained healthy sell-in and also increasing sell-out trends. So from today\u2019s perspective, we absolutely firm behind this one, and we\u2019re also firm behind our \u2013 what we said long-term positive prospect and the growth in the U.S. markets.", "Jeff Fettig", "Just to add to Marc\u2019s comments, if you just look at last three months AHAM, would have probably been \u2013 we\u2019ve been averaging about 4.5% growth.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right. And just if I could speak one, if you capture that kind of growth, do you think you\u2019re going to get a pricing boost as well?", "Jeff Fettig", "No. Bob, we can\u2019t really comment about what we think others are going to do. We know what we\u2019re doing. We said very clearly, we think we\u2019ll amp up our growth rate with the full availability of our new products, and that we fully expect to expand margins.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Sam Darkatsh [Raymond James and Associates]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Good morning, Jeff, Larry, Mike, Marc. How are you?", "Jeff Fettig", "Very good, Sam.", "Mike Todman", "Very good.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Two questions if I could. One a clarification question, Larry. On Slide 42, I think you\u2019re mentioning interest in sundry expense of $100 million for the year. I think that was $150 million targeted last quarter, what\u2019s the reasoning behind that variance?", "Larry Venturelli", "The interest in sundry and the GAAP, if you look at the GAAP financials, that Sam I believe, the favorable delta is the one-time gain, this in GAAP results, this on a business gain in Brazil investment \u2013 business investment in Brazil. That\u2019s in GAAP, but not in ongoing results, okay. It\u2019s just in GAAP. Visibly, we have right now on an ongoing basis for interest in sundry, you\u2019re probably looking at about $130 million for the year.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Make sure I\u2019m understanding that because the non-GAAP and GAAP gets a little confusing for me. So, back half of the year, what should interest in sundry be then on average?", "Larry Venturelli", "Yeah, $52 million in the first half and figure is going to be $130 million for the full-year and then you got your second half.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Got you. Thank you. And then, the other question and if I \u2013 and if you mentioned this, Mike I apologize. In Latin America, I think you were trying to stabilize or rationalize retailer inventories in the quarter. Where are you in that process, where are retail inventories? Have they stabilized? And would you imagine that sell-it and sell-through look like each other in the second half?", "Mike Todman", "You know, well, Right now, we did make the adjustments that I talked about in terms of overall demand. We think we\u2019re about where they need to be, but it does all depends now on demand going forward. So, we made all the adjustments that we thought. We think the inventories are more in line, but all depending on demand in the second half, we\u2019ll see. But right now, we\u2019re comfortable with where we are.", "Jeff Fettig", "And we\u2019re comfortable with where we are and assuming that the market is down by 15%, but we\u2019re comfortable. If it changes radically either direction and obviously we\u2019ll adjust.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Very helpful, thank you gentlemen, I appreciate it.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you.", "Mike Todman", "Thanks, Sam.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we\u2019ll move to Michael Rehaut [JPMorgan Securities]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Michael Rehaut", "Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, everyone. First question, just going back to the capacity constraints in the quarter in North America with the product transitions. Do you have any sense of what that might have impacted the top line volume in that segment?", "Marc Bitzer", "Okay. Mike, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer again. I would say on a total revenue base but it\u2019s just rough estimate, it\u2019s a low single-digit percentages, but very low. It\u2019s up 2% or 3% in that ballpark. And that\u2019s just because A, KitchenAid suite launch, it\u2019s a fairly complex and taking it\u2019s an entire kitchen set of products across multiple factories, and you just need to get them all ready to ship it. And two, we\u2019re still in the tail-end, but now have a very tail-end of this huge laundering refrigeration change. But as we know, we\u2019re pretty much started Q3 last year, now we\u2019re at the tail end and we have huge demands against certain products like Mimix where we\u2019re just still ramping up our production capacity. And the...", "Michael Rehaut", "Okay. So that 2% to 3% you\u2019re referring, that\u2019s the impact on the North American segment.", "Marc Bitzer", "That\u2019s on the North American. And again that\u2019s roughly \u2013 that\u2019s a rough indication.", "Jeff Fettig", "And the mix \u2013 margin mix on that kind of product is substantially higher than the line average.", "Michael Rehaut", "That\u2019s helpful. Also can you just describe quickly the acquisition you mentioned at the end of the prepared remarks, I believe you said the American Dryer Corporation closed in July?", "Marc Bitzer", "Yes and Michael, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. Again, the American Dryer Corporation is active in the professional commercial laundry segments. It used to be a supplier of our, so we know them for many years and it\u2019s what we would describe as a nice tuck-in acquisition in our non-core business. The reason why we like commercial laundry, it\u2019s inherently \u2013 it\u2019s a healthy margin business, cash accretive; it fits perfectly in our \u2013 grow beyond and then expand beyond the core business, so it\u2019s a nice tug-on. We didn\u2019t reveal or communicate because we have an agreement with the seller any purchase price. Obviously, it\u2019s only a fraction of previous acquisition, so it\u2019s a much smaller one and then we now stopped our integration activities.", "Michael Rehaut", "And just a sense of rough size of revenue and when you say healthy margins below or above the line average in North America?", "Marc Bitzer", "We should be don\u2019t get into the details, but American Dryer Corporation is kind of \u2013 I think it\u2019s a largely published, it\u2019s a $40 million, $50 million revenue business. It\u2019s not a huge one, that\u2019s why we call it a tug-in acquisition.", "Michael Rehaut", "Perfect. One quick last one if I could, just the Asia margins. I think you referred to continued expectations for continued healthy margins in the back half and you\u2019ve already done pretty well in the first half. Does that imply margins in the back half similar to the first half or should it drift higher perhaps with the acceleration of integration benefits.", "Marc Bitzer", "No, I think, Michael, you can expect \u2013 there\u2019ll be plus or minus within the range that we gave 7% to 8%, so similar, we don\u2019t see any expansion. And as Jeff mentioned, there\u2019s seasonal business in Asia and third quarter is generally the lowest quarter in terms of volumes and sales and then in the fourth quarter it kind of ramps backup. So the margins will be kind of commensurate with that.", "Michael Rehaut", "Perfect, thanks for your help.", "Marc Bitzer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we\u2019ll move to Eric Bosshard [Cleveland Research Company]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Eric Bosshard", "Two things, first of all in North America, I understand the difference between that AHAM and your units, so curious on how you view your market share performance in the second quarter and also what your expectation is in the second half of the year?", "Marc Bitzer", "Eric, its Marc Bitzer. I mentioned before, our top line revenue even though growing, admittedly lack industry demands, which also implies our market share just in Q2, is slightly down year-over-year. That\u2019s the fact. Okay. It is, if you read in between my lines from my previous comment, it\u2019s not across all products. This is certain categories where we saw high promotional activities or where we ran into some capacity constraints. So, is that our expectation going forward? No, it\u2019s not. But we will also, you know we basically add value principles as we\u2019ve done in the past.", "Eric Bosshard", "Okay. And then the, just to clarify a little bit, the KitchenAid, you\u2019re missing 2% to 3% of revenue, is a pretty material number, what was that, what you expected, was there something that was different than expected that didn\u2019t allow you to come through with the capacity? I would just love to understand that? A little bit more especially considering that you also were taking extended downtime, it sounded like elsewhere in the business to balance inventories? Can you just help explain that a little bit?", "Marc Bitzer", "Yeah. Eric, it\u2019s Marc again. With 2% to 3% applied to KitchenAid and the capacity constraints on the laundry transition in particular. So, it\u2019s \u2013 and a little bit to refrigeration, but it\u2019s largely laundry, a little bit of front-door bottom mount and the kitchen. So, it\u2019s all three businesses. So, it\u2019s not KitchenAid on its own. Particularly, the laundry one that is very frankly, it\u2019s much stronger demand coupled with a shift of inventory back into the top loader and that\u2019s where we\u2019re just ramping up in terms of overall capacity.", "On the KitchenAid, to some extent that\u2019s you could say as expected, because you know, the kitchen suite, you don\u2019t launch every year. As I mentioned before, we \u2013 the last KitchenAid suite was launched 10 years ago. So, this is a pretty complex undertaking, the flooring and retailer. So, it\u2019s just, we knew it would drag a little bit for one quarter or two quarters and that\u2019s just what it is. The good news is the reception [indiscernible] very, very strong.", "Eric Bosshard", "Okay. Your participation and promotions in the back half of the year is the discipline similar to 2Q, such that you could still like the industry, is that how we should be thinking about you strategically?", "Marc Bitzer", "Eric, as you know, we typically don\u2019t comment on forward promotions et cetera, but, I think we \u2013 you see in the last three years to four years that we had a very good discipline around how we manage our margins, how we expand our margins and how we drive certain promotions and you should expect that going forward.", "Jeff Fettig", "Eric, I just \u2013 I mean, we feel pretty good, pretty confident about our ability to win share through our new product innovations by creating demand for them as opposed to buying share, and that\u2019s a discipline. Every quarter, it may go up or down, but we think there\u2019s a value creating way to do it, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re doing it.", "Eric Bosshard", "And then secondly, in terms of Europe, the margin progress there has been impressive. And I know that there are announcements that come out over there about your capacity efforts there. I\u2019m just wondering, if you could give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019ve accomplished to date and what else is coming here in 2015? It sounds like there is an expectation, there is more synergy benefit there, but if you could expand a little bit on what you\u2019re doing with the Indesit and what\u2019s your core capacity in Europe?", "Marc Bitzer", "Eric, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer again. So, first of all, yes, the Indesit acquisition in Europe is a fairly complex and frankly, of a challenging task. But so far, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean it\u2019s very, very well on track. It\u2019s almost like a clock work, which was not [indiscernible]. In terms of the major restructuring announcements, so far in the press and in our filings, we basically had referred to three ones, one was kind of a high level SG&A, which is largely a leadership team; two, what we call the Italian industrial plan, which is a significant undertaking across our Italian factories, in terms of capacity rationalization; and three, was a relocation of an R&D center, and goes up in R&D center in Germany.", "So, these were the three ones which we announced. Throughout the first half, there are obviously, big elements and big blocks, but we\u2019re well on track and we signed these agreements already. In a broader scheme of things, we\u2019re exactly consistent with the framework which we\u2019ve made at the beginning of the year about the full-year restructuring expenses and benefits to expect that.", "So, I would say, yes, it\u2019s fully on track, but it also tells you, just by the fact that we just signed some of these agreements now. You obviously, don\u2019t yet see the benefits in the first half and you will only see a fraction of it in third quarter, but now it\u2019s starts building every quarter, because we know it signs. It\u2019s now needs to be implemented and that just takes a certain time.", "Eric Bosshard", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll move to Jay McCanless [Sterne, Agee and Leach]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Jay McCanless", "Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on North America, could you give us some color about what you\u2019re expecting for the back half of the year in terms of currency translation effects, or is that \u2013 and how much of that would you guys contemplate with the recent move, higher in both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar?", "Marc Bitzer", "Jay, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer again. As you pointed out, obviously, for North America, it\u2019s the peso and the Canadian dollar. The peso has weakened, yes, but keep in mind, we have a certain element of natural hedge because we also produce in Mexico. So, when the peso moves, it hurts us on the top line, it does not necessarily hurt us on the bottom line. So, margin-wise, causes less concerns. Top-line, of course, they will always hurt you, okay. And that\u2019s also embedded in already our Q2 numbers.", "Canadian dollars were different, because we [indiscernible] from the U.S., where year-over-year, we have a dramatic change, it\u2019s fully impacting margin. We had now a number of cost base price increases in Canada, which we implemented. But as you can tell also, right now, Canadian dollar went down, weakened to $1.29, which is an average deterioration versus Q2. So, yes, that impact will be with us throughout the back half, both on top line, which is fairly significant on the North America level, but also on the bottom line, as we are catching up on the cost base price increases.", "Jeff Fettig", "But there will be a drag at today\u2019s level in the second half.", "Jay McCanless", "Okay. But it \u2013 but that potential drag you think is already captured in the guidance that you provided?", "Marc Bitzer", "Yes, it should be....", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, it\u2019s embedded in the guidance....", "Marc Bitzer", "And it should be less assuming the currency range that we have forecasted remains there, as our pricing catches up with that.", "Jay McCanless", "Got it, okay. And then, just I missed some of the comments you made about SG&A. Did you \u2013 I would assume that SG&A should deleverage in the back half of the year. Did you guys give specific targets for that?", "Jeff Fettig", "We said we will return to prior year levels for the full year. So yes, you\u2019re right, we will have leverage.", "Jay McCanless", "Great, thank you.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you. Yes, we have one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll take that question from David MacGregor [Longbow Research]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "David MacGregor", "Yes, thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk a little bit about your North American builder channel business, and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of demand conditions in growth and to the extent, which your share their maybe be improving? And then secondly, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about share repurchase program, you\u2019re active in the quarter. Is it your intent at this point to maintain a fairly regular cadence or are you trying to purchase a little more opportunistically? Thank you.", "Marc Bitzer", "So, David, you just sneaked in two questions, I\u2019ll take the first one. So, first one, the North American builder two components the demand and I know there has been some noise about the demand. We continued to see strong sustained demand on U.S. housing. I wouldn\u2019t see any sign, which makes us change our opinion compared to what we\u2019ve said several quarters ago. To put back clearly housing starts, we still expect $1.1 million for this year and next year you can probably put it somewhere between $1.3 million, $1.4 million in the ballpark. So, we see sustained or even stronger demand, driven by household formation and increased consumer confidence.", "David MacGregor", "Okay, Marc. Could you remind us just what that represents as a percentage of your North American business?", "Marc R. Bitzer", "Yes again, it\u2019s careful \u2013 I\u2019m careful about dotting down number, because you have two parts of the bill-to-business you have a direct bill-to-business, which we do have a national contracts and then of course you have a lot of small bill-to-business which typically flews for Home Depot and Lowes. So, you have two components, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 but it\u2019s a healthy component of our North American business.", "So having said that in that channel, as you know, we made over last three years or four years, I would say substantial market share improvements and we are certainly from direct bill-to-business where we know the contracts that are stable to slightly increasing. So, we\u2019re very satisfied and very bullish going forward in the North American bill-to-business.", "Jeff Fettig", "Share repurchase from capital allocation David, we\u2019re going to continue to apply same methodology we have over the last several years as far as funding the business. We do have a debt-to-cap ratio, which we stated one to one and a half times, we\u2019re at well above that with the acquisitions. We have repurchased over $1 billion of stock over the last several years. We\u2019ve recently increased the dividend and as we shown again we have opportunistically take advantage of M&A. So, we\u2019re not going to give you a target or what we will be repurchasing, but we\u2019ll balance all of those elements going forward.", "David MacGregor", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thank you, David, and thank you everyone. We look forward to talking to you in October. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you.

MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Thomas McNally Mahoney - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded.", "For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Chris Conley.", "Chris Conley - Senior Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation fourth quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports, as well as on slide one and in the appendix of this presentation.", "Turning to slide two, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think these adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation, beginning on slide 36, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record revenue, ongoing profit, and earnings per share for full year 2015. Overall our integration activities in Europe and Asia progressed well and as planned, we delivered significant integration benefits both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our ability to deliver these record results, despite significant volatility in the global economic environment, does demonstrate the strength of our execution and the benefits of our larger global operating platform.", "If you turn to slide five, I will review the 2015 financial results. Where you see that we delivered strong revenue growth for the year, our revenues were up 5% versus last year, and 18% excluding currency impact. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $12.38 per share, and as we expected, we delivered $620 million in free cash flow.", "Turning to slide six, you can see our 2016 priorities in what we expect to be another record year. We do believe that the challenges we successfully managed in 2015 will carry over into 2016. And by that, we mean, we expect that emerging markets will continue to be weak or decline, but we do see that largely offset by growth in our developed markets. We also anticipate that the strong dollar era that we're experiencing will continue into this year. So within this environment, our focus in 2016 is to continue to grow revenues and we see great opportunities to expand our operating margins.", "We plan to invest to grow globally in both our core appliance business and adjacent businesses. We will deliver significant new product innovation to the market. And we continue to expect to deliver very strong cost productivity.", "So turning to slide seven where we show our guidance for 2016, we expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $14 to $14.75 a share which represents 15%-plus growth versus last year. We also expect free cash flow generation of between $700 million to $800 million, which is a substantial improvement versus the prior year. And while 2015 was a year where we faced several challenges, I think we were able to demonstrate our ability to create value for our shareholders through strong operational execution in this environment. And our current guidance reflects our expectation that this level of execution will continue as we do expect to deliver another year of record results in 2016.", "So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide nine, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America has not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our expectations as we grew revenues and substantially expanded margins in the fourth quarter. We grew our revenues 6.2% excluding currency and expanded operating margin to 12.4%, an all-time record. As expected, with our recently launched products fully available and nearly fully floored, the investments we made to drive growth in our U.S. business delivered sequential (05:07) market share improvement in the fourth quarter.", "In addition to leverage from this revenue growth, our very strong operating margins in the fourth quarter were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and favorable mix from our new product introductions, which more than offset nearly $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico.", "Turning to slide 10, we outline our 2016 operation priorities for the North America region. Our expectation is that the industry will continue to show strong 5% annual growth behind improved housing trends and consumer sentiment. And we expect to grow our revenues at or above industry levels. We also expect to continue accelerating growth of our new products to capitalize on this increased consumer demand and to drive improved price, mix and revenue growth. Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvement and remain focused on growing outside the core. We anticipate that these actions will more than offset a point of margin impact from negative currency, based on today's rate for the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. We expect to deliver operating margins between 11.5% and 12.5%, which is fully in line with our long-term goals and another improvement over prior year.", "I will now share the fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, as shown on slide 11. Sales were $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. Excluding currencies, sales were up 8.1%. Ongoing operating profit was $88 million compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. During the fourth quarter, strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity mostly offset $45 million in unfavorable currency impacts, as well as the impact of a significant industry decline in Russia.", "Last year, we saw an unusually strong fourth quarter in Russia, as trading consumers bought heavily ahead of devaluation. As planned and expected, we also invested in marketing technology and products this quarter. For the full year, we delivered 4.5% operating margin, which is fully consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year, in spite of $160 million in currency impacts and weaker demand in Eastern Europe.", "On slide 12, as we look towards the full year 2016, our priorities remain unchanged, with a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity, and growth from new products, both within and beyond the core. We expect industry to be approximately flat to 2%, primarily driven by continued strong demand in Western Europe. Based on today's rate, weakness in the ruble and euro will continue, but we plan to more than offset over a point of margin impact from currency through ongoing cost productivity and acquisition synergies. Overall, we expect operating margins to be between 7% and 8% for the year, which is another substantial year-over-year improvement and very consistent with, and even ahead of, our long-term goals.", "Now we'll discuss our Latin America results on slide 13. Sales for the quarter were $845 million. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales decreased 8%. Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $58 million, or nearly 7% of sales, which represents a substantial improvement in operating margin versus the prior two quarters. These margin levels are a clear indication that we have readjusted our business for today's operating environment through already deployed price, mix actions, and cost and capacity reductions.", "On slide 14, we summarize our priorities in Latin America. We expect demand through continued volatility and are fully prepared to deploy further actions if necessary. We will continue to invest in new products, grow our business out of Brazil core appliances, and are well positioned to capitalize on growth in Brazil when demand does return. We expect industry decline of 10% and, based on today's rates, a half a point of margin impact from currency, primarily in the first half of the year. For growth in our non-Brazil operations, the benefits of previously announced cost based price increases, implemented reduction of fixed costs, and improved mix from our new products, we expect to mitigate both currency and demand impact.", "Based on our expectations of demand down 10% and the Brazilian real at current spot rates, and with the benefit of our offsetting actions for 2016, we expect operating margins between 6.5% and 7.5%, despite lower revenue due to the currency and emerging market demand.", "Now we turn to our fourth quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on slide 15. Net sales were $312 million, in comparison to $282 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 15%. Our fourth quarter ongoing operating profit was $11 million compared to $17 million in the prior-year period. Ongoing operating margins were 3.6%, driven by record margins in India and integration benefits in China that were offset by weak demand and increased product and marketing investments. While these investments in China temporarily reduced our margins in the fourth quarter, we expect them to lead to strong growth in margins in the future.", "Turning to slide 16, we share our 2016 priorities for Asia operations. We will continue to focus on distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation is for flat industry growth in the region. For additional clarity about our assumptions, we are forecasting a 5% industry growth in India and a 2% to 3% industry decline in China. Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8%, driven by our larger growth platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipeline.", "Slide 17, we summarize our regional margin goals. We expect 2016 to be another year of record performance, and see opportunities for strong margin expansions in all regions.", "And now I'd like to turn it over to Larry.", "Larry M. Venturelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we had a solid year of performance. You may recall that we entered the year with significant currency headwinds and weakened emerging market demand. Given these challenges, our first half ongoing earnings of approximately $4.85 per share were flat with 2014. However, based on the actions we took throughout the year, we were able to deliver second half ongoing earnings of $7.55 per share, which is up 15% from last year's results. Our second half earnings momentum and our fourth quarter run rate entering 2016 are solid.", "Turning to our fourth quarter results on slide 19 and 20, revenues were $5.6 billion, currency had $700 million top line impact, but excluding currency, sales were up 4%. We achieved all-time record ongoing earnings of $4.10 per share driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs as well as price mix from new product introductions and previously announced cost-based price actions. You'll note from the slide that SG&A as a percent of sales on a GAAP basis decreased approximately 1.5 points. While we did make incrementally higher marketing investments this year to support our product introductions, those were more than offset by acquisition synergies and a planned reduction in acquisition related cost.", "Our effective tax rate for the year was under 21%. This represents approximately a $0.20 improvement versus our prior full year guidance. In summary, we are pleased with the results for the quarter.", "Now turning to 2016, we expect another record year. We will continue to be impacted by currency and emerging market demand. However, we are confident in the actions we are taking to offset these headwinds and deliver 15%-plus earnings per share growth in 2016.", "First on slide 21, you can see that we absorbed nearly $6 from the combination of emerging market demand weakness and currency devaluation in 2015. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, our operational focus and additional actions deployed during the year drove record revenue and earnings performance despite these challenges.", "Now turning to slide 22, we share the 2016 assumptions for emerging market demand and currency headwinds included in our guidance. As Jeff mentioned, based on current exchange rates, we expect currency devaluation to continue although at a reduced level compared to the prior year. Accordingly, we anticipate a negative impact of approximately $1 billion in sales and $2.50 in earnings per share from currency headwinds. Additionally, we are anticipating continued demand weakness in most emerging markets, as a result we will offset $0.50 in earnings per share impact from that. It's important to note that these emerging market countries now represent 15% of our global sales.", "Finally, on slides 23 and 25, we summarize key actions that we expect will offset the impact from currency and emerging market demand. We expect another very strong year in total cost productivity given material trends, fixed cost reductions taken in Brazil, and our normal productivity programs. Our acquisition synergies, tighter cost and capacity reduction activities will ramp up during 2016. We expect solid demand trends in developed markets combined with positive impact from previous and new product launches and growth in adjacent businesses. And our previously announced cost based price increases in Canada, Brazil, and Russia are in full effect.", "On slide 24, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. We incurred $200 million in restructuring expense and delivered $200 million in benefits this year consistent with previous communications. For 2016, we expect $250 million in expense and continue to expect $175 million in benefits.", "On slide 26, we highlight the cadence of half one versus half two earnings drivers we just addressed. First, given historical seasonality, volume is stronger in the second half of the year. In addition, we should have lower currency headwinds in the back half of the year based on current rates. Traditionally, we see much stronger seasonality in our cost productivity programs in second half of the year and our acquisition synergies will ramp up throughout the year. As a result, we would expect full-year earnings seasonality to approximate 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half.", "On slide 27, our 2016 guidance is to deliver record ongoing earnings of $14 to 14.75 per share, a 15% increase year-over-year. We are forecasting approximately $700 million to $800 million of free cash flow which includes planned cash outlays of up to $200 million in restructuring related to the acquisitions, $150 million related to our previously announced product warranty cost in Europe, and capital spending of between $700 million to $750 million.", "Our priorities for cash deployment have not changed as shown on slide 28. We did repurchase $155 million of stock during the fourth quarter and have $225 million remaining on our existing authorization. We expect to complete our current share repurchase authorization this year.", "Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Larry. I'd now like to take a moment to update you on our long-range goals that we first outlined at our December 2014 Investor Day conference. Overall, our long-term strategy remains on track, and we see tremendous opportunities from our larger global footprint, our leading position in key markets around the world, our continuation of stepping up levels of new product innovation, our strong brand portfolio with seven powerful brands, each with over a billion dollars in revenues, and over the mid-to-longer term, we do believe that our leading positions in several key emerging markets will be a great advantage for us.", "So then turning to slide 31, I would like to summarize our updated management goals. And again, as we discussed earlier, last year and carrying over into this year, we have been hit by declines in emerging market demands and significant currency valuations. And this is really the only driver of our changing goals because this has had a large impact on our original sales goal. As a result, we now believe we can grow our revenues to $23 billion to $24 billion in sales by 2018 versus our previous goal of $26 billion to $28 billion. And again, the difference is essentially all purely from currency translation.", "Because we have rapidly adjusted to the changed global environment through our previously announced cost based price increases, fixed cost reductions, and continued investment in new product innovation, and we will continue to do so as we go forward. We are offsetting these impacts previously discussed with what I believe is very strong operational execution, and as a result, we still expect to deliver operating margins consistent with our 2018 goals. So, we haven't changed our view at all that we can deliver double-digit operating margins globally. And with that, we expect to reach also our goal of doubling our free cash flow by 2018.", "In total, this will lead to strong earnings growth, and we now plan to deliver strong growth in earnings per share to $20 to $22 per share in 2018. Again, the difference between this and the previous is simply a reduction in revenues due to currency. These revised targets would represent an improvement of 60% to 80% over today's levels of earnings and represent exceptionally strong value creation. As always, there are risks of us putting out long-range goals like this, right, but I think as we've demonstrated last year, we have been able to adjust to the environment and still deliver strong results.", "So turning to slide 32, you can very specifically see the drivers in our ongoing earnings per share improvements. And again, we have multiple paths to drive value creation. We'll drive it through growth, acquisition synergies and cost productivities. And these big levers that we outlined in December of 2014 have not changed.", "We are on track with our acquisition synergies in Europe, and we expect an additional $2 to $3 per share in benefits by 2018. We are assuming demand in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and China begin to stabilize in 2017, but likely only drive moderate recovery growth during this planning cycle, and we don't expect to see that until 2018. Additionally, demand in the U.S. is rebounding consistent with our Investor Day assumptions, and we continue to see solid growth in our adjacent businesses. We also now are seeing more and more growth which is enabled by our Indesit and China acquisitions, which are now part of our baseline revenue assumptions.", "And finally, and importantly from a cost productivity perspective, we fully expect to continue with strong ongoing annual productivity improvements in addition to the benefits from favorable input costs that we're currently seeing, and we see great opportunities to further leverage benefits from our global operating platform. And I think over the last couple of years, we've had a good track record of delivering on those type of benefits. So to sum up, we do expect to grow earnings per share by nearly 60% to 80% over the next three years to between $20 and $22 per share.", "And then on slide 33, you can see the walk on how we expect to double our free cash flow. And as you can see from this chart, cash flow growth is largely earnings driven. Working capital is just a bit higher due to growth in the business. We don't expect any fundamental changes in our rate of capital expenditures which run about 3.5%. And this has not changed.", "So turning to slide 34, I'd just reconfirm we are committed to achieving our vision of becoming the best global branded consumer products company. As a reminder, we are number-one globally in three out of the four regions in the world. We're the largest western company in Asia. We have a top market position in five of the top seven largest appliance markets in Europe, and we also have the number-one position in U.S., Canada and Brazil. So in total, we have very high confidence that our growth plans give us an outstanding opportunity to continue driving significant shareholder returns. And we believe 2016 will be a strong step forward towards reaching our 2018 goals.", "So with that, I will end our formal remarks, and we would like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We can take our first question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go head.", "Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Good morning, Jeff, Larry, Marc. How are you?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Great.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Sam.", "Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "I've got a couple questions here. First off, regarding Latin America, Jeff, you're looking at a margin up 1% or 2% year-on-year on obviously a continued very challenging times. You don't normally do this, but can you help us with what your margin expectations are for the sub-components of that region for the Brazilian white goods, Embraco and the non-Brazilian white goods just to get a sense of what that margin growth means year-on-year?", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sam, I mean, just breaking that out, I won't give you specific, but I'll give you directionally. I mean, there are three or perhaps four segments you can look in that business. The most impacted for all the reasons we talked about is the Brazilian appliance business because of the currency and because demand being down almost 25% with the expectation \u2013 so that's where the heavy hit. But I would say and I think I said this before, we've been in Brazil market for over 60 years and we've never lost money in that market, and we continue to be in a positive-profit position. So even in that tough situation \u2013 but our margins were hurt very badly in appliances.", "In our adjacent businesses, other than offsetting the inflation, they've remained intact. Embraco, which is our global compressor business, was hurt by demand in emerging markets and currency but not nearly as much. And we had a reasonably good year in Embraco. And our international, I would just say that it got hit by all the same currency deval \u2013 the currency devaluations came at different times. We have a big position, for example, to Colombia. Colombia pesos devalued by 50%. Late in the year, Argentina obviously devalued. So we adjust, but there's a larger basket of countries to do. So those margins, although hurt some, were not hurt as bad.", "So the predominant work, I would say, has been to do \u2013 which we've already announced, the cost-based price increases which we've already announced and carry over into this year. We've done significant fixed-cost reduction, almost 30%, I think. We drive the heck out of productivity, but we still have to offset inflation and negative demand. So \u2013 and I think Marc said it exactly correct. If you, based on our assumption of today's spot in currency and the market going down another 10%, we feel pretty good about our ability to improve our margins. If we have another round of volatility, we'll have to adjust again. And we're fully prepared to do that.", "Larry M. Venturelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And the only other thing I'd add to Jeff's, is Sam, is just remember that pricing increases went into effect throughout last year. Production \u2013 fixed cost reductions were taken throughout last year, so you still haven't seen the full run rate in the margins in the fourth quarter exit rate.", "Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Two more quick questions, if I could, housekeeping related. First off, the fourth quarter, your free cash flow was below where your guidance was, the implied guidance. Now I know some of that I think is pension contributions, some of it is a little maybe lower CapEx, but it doesn't explain the entirety of the variance, Larry. Could you help us with what happened in free cash flow in the fourth quarter?", "Larry M. Venturelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. I think, Sam, I think we guided to $600 million to $700 million. I believe we ended up at $620 million. So pretty close to the midpoint. I'd say that working capital was a little bit higher, but that was more due to timing in receivables than anything else. So I think we were very happy with where we ended up, and pretty much consistent with our guidance.", "Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "And then the last question, as it relates to 2016 guidance, could you help us with what your expectations are for raw materials and tax and pension and some of the other below-the-line items?", "Larry M. Venturelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I can help you with some of the below-the-line items, Sam. Tax rate, in the prepared remarks we said 22% to 24%. And then you also asked about pension. We will not have a pension contribution this year. We're fully funded from a funding perspective, so you will not see a U.S. contribution this year. You'll see a small amount that will go out for the foreign plans.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And, Sam, on the cost side, if you look at the walk that Larry provided for the margins, I think \u2013 the way I would look at costs are, we're going to have a very significant cost year this year. And we do look at total cost, which is comprised of our synergies, our restructuring, as well as our ongoing productivity, which includes change in raw material costs. And, as we talk about \u2013 and by the way, that we think that's the best way to look at it, because that gives you a net number, which you ought to expect to see in the P&L or in the margins, which is what we show.", "The challenge talking about \u2013 which caused a little bit of confusion last year is, when you have this volatility in currency, we certainly saw lower net material costs last year. I think we said over $100 million. But we also had \u2013 part of that \u2013 the actual gross number was higher than that, but it's offset by currency increases in markets like Brazil and Russia and so on and so forth. So, bottom line is, we're going to have a big year of productivity. If you look at the margin walk, it's roughly, between all those factors, is about a $400 million reduction of which I would suspect, net, and it really depends on currency, raw materials ought to be \u2013 we ought to expect the same kind of improvement that we saw this year.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey. Nice quarter, Jeff, and great execution. I was hoping you guys, and maybe Marc, could touch on the North American market. It looks like you guys got 3% volume. I wanted to also understand your assumptions. Your press release says 5% growth. How do you think about volumes going into 2016, and with that, I noticed price was also up slightly more than three points in North America? That's probably something I wasn't expecting to that extent of strength. What's the promotional environment like, and what are your expectations for volume in 2016 in North America?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Bob, it's Marc. Let me try to answer these multiple questions. Let me actually start with, first off, by saying we're very pleased with our North America Q4, and I know there were some concerns out there, but these results would have quiet down a lot of concerns. Let me first of all, on the units, because you mentioned the 3% unit; first of all, and we said that in a number of previous calls, our unit shipments are not comparable to what is AM published numbers, because we include a lot more now (30:31) units. So the numbers are not fully comparable.", "Having said that, what you can compare is our unit growth versus our organic net sales growth, so the 3% versus 6%. And you're exactly right. I mean, that shows you just how strong our price mix was, which is the full result of disciplined promotion management and finally the results of our new product introductions. So to have that kind of a lift in such a promotional environment is an achievement we're very proud of. Now let me put it in broader context of the fourth quarter.", "Again, we delivered good ex-currency revenue growth, 6%, record margin of 12.4%, which is exactly what we said we would do, drive growth and margin expansion. What is also important to know, we had ex-currency revenue growth in all our business units, so Canada, Mexico, small domestic, majors, core appliances, which also means we had sequential market share growth Q4 compared to Q3, which is something which, as you know, we've been driving for very hard.", "So now with regards to your question about our expectations for next year's market, as you know, we guide industry to 5%. As I also said in my prepared remarks, we fully expect to grow our revenue in line or above that market assumption. That's what we guide to, and that's our expectation, based on run rates which we have developed, based on new product introductions.", "So we're \u2013 I think, we'd say very confident behind these assumptions. Towards the \u2013 we're coming to work with a broader industry assumption of 5%. As you know, as we guided into 2015, we initially came up with 4% and we lifted to 5%, 5% plus. The final number was 6.5%. Beginning of a year, many people questioned if North America would come to these growth levels, and North America as an industry did. That is still largely driven, the confidence for 5%, we still do believe the housing is at best midpoint of a housing recovery in terms of cycle. We do see consumer sentiment becoming bigger. We do see wealth creation on the mid and lower income levels. So all these factors if you put it in our macroeconomic model, you'll have a lot of confidence behind the 5% industry growth.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got it. That makes a lot of sense, and thanks for the detail on North America. Kind of jump ball in terms of question, I'd love to understand two things; one, the margin walk between 2015 and 2016 in Europe to get to that 7% to 8% range, what's your confidence in executing against plan? And putting aside the fact that we understand things change quickly in emerging markets, what's the likelihood that you can actually achieve positive margin momentum in Latin America? And are you confident that Brazil will not lose money? That's a lot of stuff, but if you could just take it in part, that would be great.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "So, Bob, it's Marc again. So let me first answer Europe and Middle East and Africa. As you know, we guided at the beginning of 2015 4% to 5%, and we hit exact in the midpoint. I would say probably now some people may be surprised that we're guiding out towards 7% or 8% which, as you recall, that was pretty much our targets yesterday. (33:54). We are fully confident on that 7% to 8% and the confidence comes from we do see the benefits from restructuring synergies and ongoing cost productivity.", "So which, as you know when you run a business, if you have a confidence in cost, that gives you a lot of confidence. It's just much more predictable than any top line assumptions. And if you look at 2015, there was largely costs, total costs driven, and we know we have a momentum. We know we have agreement on certain restructuring activities and that carries into 2016. You will also note that our volume assumption for industry is actually not overly bullish. It's 0% to 2%. And frankly, that magnitude between 0% and 2% is entirely driven by what happens to Russia. So we basically we're not overly bullish on Russia. If Russia comes around faster, which we've seen in prior decades and cycles, then you could see an upside versus the 2%. But that's a big assumption right now. But again in Europe, in our view, on all quarters they delivered like a clockwork, and that gives us a lot of confidence for 2016 as well.", "On Latin America, I'm going to get back to Jeff's comments. First of all, let me underline Latin America is obviously heavily influenced by what assumption you take on Brazil industry growth and the real. So on today's spot rate of real and with the assumption that Brazil goes down another 10%, which pretty much will be consistent with what we see right now, so further deterioration of a marketplace based on our already taken cost actions and price mix which we have already deployed. We are very confident to hit that 6.5% to 7.5%. Which is, by the way, it's not too far away from what we had in Q4. So it's not like we were \u2013 from a run rate perspective, it's not like we're planning for a huge step-up. But again, I want to reiterate that's a big assumption about real exchange rates. And we've seen dramatic moves this year, and it's a big assumption about the industry.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, only add the color on that, that Marc had was that this 10% decline is our forecast for demand for the year in Brazil. You know, if you look at the progression of decline throughout 2015, fourth quarter was the worst at almost 25%. So as this carries over, our belief is the full year probably plus or minus is minus 10%. But by definition, it will be higher in Q1 and Q2.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Just want to go back to North America. Could you talk a little bit about how market shares have shifted in the last year and also comment on the impact of product transition on product availability in the past year? Because I think Marc said that the new products were fully available and almost fully floored, so just wondering when that's going to be resolved. Thank you.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, Denise. It's Marc again. Let me try to answer that. So first of all, as I indicated in Q4, we had sequential market share growth. On a year-over-year comparison, we had a slight market share loss, that's basic of a carry forward of momentum which we had from the mid-cycle. But again, the important thing is sequentially we see the business growing in the critical categories. Now that is a very important element of this one. To my earlier comment about product introductions, as you are well aware, we had a lot of product introductions the last 18 months in North America. There was laundry, there was pretty much an entire refrigeration line which was driven by energy standards.", "So we had \u2013 we are behind an unusual high amount of product introductions which, of course, always has a certain impact on the top line. It's not just availability. It's just the ramp up, ramp down, re-flooring. You know whenever you do that, you have an impact. But availability supply chain from ex-factory is fully restored. We're not yet 100% completed with the flooring, but it's pretty much 80% to 90% done on the major product introductions.", "Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the realized synergies in 2015?", "Larry M. Venturelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I mean, we said, Denise, in the prepared remarks between restructuring and synergies we had about $200 million. It was very consistent with what we said before. And synergies on both Europe and Chinese business came in exactly what we said.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners.", "Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC", "Good morning. So just a quick follow-up on North America. In terms of the competitive environment, could you just give us an update on that? Certainly don't expect you to say that it got a lot better, but was there any change? You talked a lot about the breadth versus the depth of the promotions that you saw starting last summer. And any early indications in the early part of the year about what you're seeing there?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Megan, it's Marc. Let me try to answer. During our last earnings call, we said we had a slightly elevated promotional intensity out there in the markets, and I would say but it was pretty much consistent also in Q4. In our \u2013 in that environment, we stuck to the strategy which we had for the last couple years. We participate when we create value for our brands in our company. That's what we've done. So in that promotional environment, which year-over-year was maybe slightly more intense, we basically fully relied on our new products. That's what drove the margin and the price mix impact in that environment. It's hard to of course anticipate what happens in 2016, and it's way too early in the year. But right now I would expect similar environment like the back half of 2015.", "Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC", "Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then I guess I want to touch on Asia because it's the one region no one has asked about yet. But can you talk us a little bit through this nice guidance that you have out there for the full year, but 4Q did drop off. You said you increased some expenses on marketing and other investments in the quarter. Is there any seasonality involved that we should think about when we're modeling 2016? And could you maybe talk us through some of those investments that you made, are any of those going to carry into let's say the first part of 2016 as well.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Megan, it's Marc again. Again, conceptually you've got to split the Asia business into a largely India business and the China business and some other smaller business. Our India business is in \u2013 which is by the way a publicly traded company is in very good shape, strong margins, steady margins, and had also really strong Q4. In China, we had I wouldn't call it seasonality. It's an anomaly. We basically had a one-time investment in certain go to markets, and particularly in certain technology investments which are largely related to introduction of new washers which come to the market in April. So I would not factor that in, in an ongoing model because we know it's largely one-time expenses.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Please go head.", "Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah, good morning, everyone.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So just going back to the China comments, I think there was some commentary that was given there where you guys are expecting down volumes for that market. Can you talk a little bit about how the integration of the (41:10) transaction now that you're such a large part of that market? Just kind of wouldn't that help out the overall volumes of the market? I just want to better understand what you're seeing on the ground level.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Sam, it's Marc. Again, China as a market as a single market from an industry perspective did not grow in 2015, and in fact it was down on the T2 level by minus 2%. We, in our prepared remarks, guided towards a minus 3% for next year. So pretty, by and large, similar environment in China overall. We just don't see right now the consumer sentiment and the housing activity strong enough to hit into positive territory. Of course that can change in that context, but right now that's our assumption going into the 2016 year, and that is also based on fairly recent inputs from trade partners.", "So we're \u2013 that's what it is. It's of course a change compared to two years or three years ago, but I think we have a way to operate in that environment. The integration overall is successful. Of course there's a lot of work, and as you put together different brands, but it is successful. It is on track. And we're kind of as you see from the guidance, we're guiding towards 7% to 8% for 2016, which by definition cannot only come from India. So we anticipate also strong progress on our not only synergy from the cost side but also from the revenue synergies on the China piece of integration.", "Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's helpful. And then just switching gears back to North America, can you just give a comment about how inventories stand right now in the channel? What are your retailers showing? There was some chatter in the fourth quarter that there was a good amount of sell into, so just curious what you guys are seeing at the retail level. Thanks.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, Sam, it's Marc again. I mean, again if you take the Q4 as an industry, and there are first of all there is not fully reliable sell in sell out statistics for North America, so that's based on the data which we've seen and how we triangulate it, you always have in Q4 in the beginning a heavy sell into the promotion periods. If you just look at the quarter overall, we do not see elevated inventory levels as the year begins. If at all, I would almost argue the opposite. Regional inventories are not significantly elevated. As the year begins, it's a pretty normal situation. But, yes, there was quite a bit of load into promotions in October and November.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee.", "Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee | CRT", "Hi. With GE potentially being sold to another buyer, are you seeing any impact on the ground either in North America or in the Chinese market as that deal progresses? And if so, what steps are you taking to get in front of that.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Jay, this is Jeff. You know, the question about are we seeing anything in the market in either market, I think the answer would be no. The GE business, you know the story. I mean, they had an agreement with Electrolux, time expired, it didn't go through, it's clear and it's been clear for some time that General Electric would sell their appliance business. So the global people that you would expect to look at it had plenty of time to look at it. And obviously they wound up getting a substantially improved offer from Haier, and so from that standpoint, they'll go through their process, and we'll know in four, five, six months how that's going to turn out.", "But the question is have we seen any changes? No. I mean, we compete with both companies. Haier is a very substantial competitor in China, very successful, and has created value doing that. General Electric has been a very good and tough competitor in the U.S. for forever. So, Chinese companies wanting to have a good market position in the U.S., this is an attractive opportunity. And they apparently agreed, and that's probably why they paid the price they did.", "Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee | CRT", "Great, and thank you for that. The second question I have, and I think you guys touched on this earlier, but just with the decelerating year-over-year increase in North American units, do you feel like you're on the cusp of changing that through either growth in housing starts or a pickup in renovation remodel? And I apologize if I missed it, but if you all could comment on where you think unit growth should go in North America this year, especially in the U.S.?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Jay, it's Marc. I wouldn't read too much into our guidance of 5% versus the 6%, of which I wouldn't call that a deceleration. The 5% is a midpoint of a spectrum, which is probably, you can put it 4% to 6% or maybe even 4% to 7%, whatever. And a lot is driven by the housing consumer sentiment. So I would still refer to U.S. is midpoint of a recovery cycle, of a long-term recovery cycle. I don't see the end of a cycle. I don't see the deceleration. And the 5% is not a precise number. It's a range, and it could well be that we'll see 6% at the end (46:48).", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And Jay, we didn't include it in this deck, but I think we have it in our Investor Day site, that what we outlined actually three years ago was, particularly in the case of the U.S., where the industry demand was relative to our 30-year average. And basically, the bubble of 2003 to 2005, the decline, the financial recession, so on and so forth. And we kind of laid out what we thought was a reasonable path of recovery.", "And to Marc's point, we view we're only (47:26) at the midpoint. And if you look at the last three years, I would say our forecasts were actually pretty good, plus or minus 1 point, I think. And we're still underneath a 30-year growth rate trend in the United States. So we still have, in our opinion, pent-up demand, as well as \u2013 every piece of the drivers of demand: replacement, new housing, existing home sales, and discretionary are going in the right direction. So we view it as a very positive spot. And to Marc's point, it can be 5%, it can be 4%, it can be 6%.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Good morning, Ken.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Lot of slides in the deck there. In Europe, considering that with such an important acquisition and profit driver, can you get \u2013 you talked about cost restructuring. Can you get a little more granular? Is it just on the execution of the cost side that you're expanding the margins, or are you actually \u2013 can you describe the perhaps in-country dynamic that you're experiencing with this larger portfolio? I mean, are you able to get better positions with the key retailers in countries, or what else is driving this? Because given the realization of this margin in 2016, it seems to indicate, in fact, you might be realizing higher margins longer term than you've guided here in that long-term guidance.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Ken, it's Marc. Let me first try to explain what happened in 2015 and then maybe give an indication for 2016, and how these dynamics come together. If you just look at the full-year P&L in Europe, you realize there's \u2013 if you take up the currency impact, there's a small revenue growth, but the margin growth or expansion came largely from the cost side, to be very straightforward. And the cost side on the other hand, yes, there's some ongoing productivity coming from raw materials, which in the case for Europe, is largely offset through negative currency. That's a transactional impact.", "So the net-net bulk comes largely from realizing the synergies in procurement, in footprint, in SG&A. So if you want state of (49:47) 2015 was largely a restructuring and synergy play. It is, however, important to note that the fact that we held the top line in year one in a post-merger integration is a big deal. Because you typically would see, in such a competitive environment, that you're being attacked from all sides. And we even grow it, and some people ask us about the different pieces. Even if you break down the two legacy pieces, both elements grew organically which, again, is a big deal in year one after such a complex integration.", "Now shifting gears into 2016, again, the cost side are carryover benefits and certain restructuring initiatives which we have just initiated and announced. So that just gives you an unusual high amount of confidence, because you're not relying on certain raw material assumptions, whatever, it's in your control. And I would say, off a margin improvement and profit in Europe, for 2016 it's still, 70% or 80% is cost driven. Now ultimately it comes back to the question of how much revenue growth can you drive with that brand and product portfolio?", "I would expect, and now I'm coming back to more Jeff's point, the long-term plan. In the planning horizon, 2017, 2018, that's when you start seeing the revenue growth coming in. And the simple reason for that one, it just takes a while to have all these product platform integration plans, because that's the most complicated process. And you see we already put a lot of new products now in the market. The vast majority of the new joint products basically come 2017 and 2018, and that's when you should expect the top-line growth. Even in the interim, and that's an important thing is, as you know, one of our biggest attractions of the (15:32) why we bought it, is ultimately the strong country position. We're number one in five of the top seven markets and (15:41) profit of Europe. Our market share in these top five markets has held up or even expanded in the last year. So that's a very, very important achievement for us.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you for that. And then, Jeff, given all the product transitions and rollouts that you had this year, I mean, I think in one of the conference calls, one quarter or two quarters ago, you said in hindsight perhaps you wouldn't have had so many moving parts at one time. Are there any operational/executional issues that are happening in 2016 that we could be aware of that you're a little more focused on just so we don't find out that you are worried about it in hindsight?", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Ken, if I can really simplify and give you a couple perspectives. We did have and we talked about some very, very large new product transitions which affected millions of units of volume. Okay? We always have product transitions. So that is not new. And I would say if the rest of the world was somewhat stable that you wouldn't have probably even noticed the impact of the product transition problems we had last year. But the fact of the matter is, we had, and the way I've described it, the currency devaluation and it's part of life, but it is the most impact in moving currencies we've seen ever since we track currency. It cost us over $4 a share. And at the same time, emerging markets in general, particularly Latin America, it seems like a long time ago, but in 2014, we had an all-time record year in Latin America. Last year, one year, our earnings went down by $300 million and cash went down by $300 million. We had record years in every other region in the world. So it wasn't the operational challenges we had on product trends, it was that on top of dealing with a massive currency issue, a massive decline in demand issue, and it means we had to do other things really well to still grow our earnings by 9% last year.", "So let's fast-forward into this year. And I should say we did very well on the cost side last year for a host of reasons, including the synergies, the restructuring, raw material markets, et cetera. So coming into this year, what we all have to mention is we still have big currency and demand headwinds, but they're less than half the size of last year. If things stay as we see them today, we're going to have another great year of cost productivity. And I would say we have no major known operational execution problems today like we had a year ago. So that's I guess as clear as I could try to be to hopefully address your point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah, congratulations on a good quarter in a tough environment.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, David.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I want to just maybe pick up on a couple of other questions that have been asked, and first is really just what we're talking about product availability. Assuming that you've addressed this and you get that business back in 2016, what does that represent in terms of incremental North American revenue?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "David, it's Marc. It's hard to quantify, and obviously we wouldn't want to quantify for competitive reasons. But there is in particular in the first half of 2015 and Q3 we were impacted. Not just by availability, it's also flooring and the new product introductions, and that's by definition. Again, as I said before in Q4, that was behind us. So it's largely behind us. But yes, in total, you probably have more than a point of market share.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "More than a point of market share?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Good. Secondly, just can you talk about Canadian and Mexican operations and specifically what impact weaker demand had on that 2.9% North American segment unit growth number?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, David, it's Marc again. First of all, often when you look at the numbers, yes, the Canadian market was down 8% in Q4, and to put in context, Canadian markets in the financial recession did not dip as deep as North America. So it held up for much longer. But obviously with consumer confidence, oil, the Canadian market is soft, and we do expect it to be soft also going forward.", "In addition to the markets \u2013 and as we in the investor meeting showed, Canada used to be roughly $1 billion business for us. That was in the old currency exchange rate. So you have a demand side. And on top of that, the currency move for Canadian dollar has been massive. Keeping in mind this no production in Canada, so you have a full currency impact. Having said that, in context I think our team through very disciplined cost based price increase, which we already had announced and executed, we maintained a good margin, unfortunately at much lower base. But the margin in Canada is very intact, very robust, but it's just a much lower base.", "Mexico is slightly different story. The Mexican market is steady pretty much, slightly down, but there's not a huge downside as in Canada. Mexico is a top line issue because also you have Mexican peso was MXN 18, it's just dramatically devalued. And so that has obviously a negative impact on the pure revenue side. It doesn't impact us so much on the ongoing margin side because our Mexican production is 60% local to local production or 70%.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Thomas McNally Mahoney - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Good morning. This is Tom on for Eric. I was wondering if you could size the savings from favorable input costs within 4Q, and 2015 more specifically. And then anything directionally you can give us on how that flowed through by segment in 2015?", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "This is Jeff. Actually I don't have that level of detail in front of us, because our input costs, we buy obviously all the time, but we have contracts, we have hedges, so on and so forth, and we have that information, I just don't \u2013 we don't have it in front of us right now.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, what Jeff said is in his prepared remarks, the total productivity would be 1.5 points to 2 points, and we'd expect each region of the world to have productivity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get a little more granular on a couple of things. First off, the 15% of global sales I think that you highlighted was your total emerging market's exposure. Just wanted to get a sense, was that on 2015 revenues or expected 2016 revenues? And if you could at least give a sense of a breakdown of the order of magnitude? I assume Brazil is the largest, but some of the other components by country?", "Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Michael, to answer your question, what I would say is that that's on 2016 base, the 15%. In order of magnitude, obviously Brazil would be our largest emerging market followed by China. It would be Brazil, China, Russia, and then India.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll return the floor to Mr. Chris Conley for closing comments.", "Chris Conley - Senior Director-Investor Relations", "Well, listen, everyone, we appreciate you joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you at our next earnings call.

Today's call is being recorded.", "For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Chris Conley. Please go ahead.", "Chris Conley", "Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation first quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer; our President and Chief Operating Officer and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our Web site at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports, as well as on Slide 1 of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you, that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think these adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on our Investor Relations website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the first quarter of the year. Our ongoing earnings per share were up 23% and our ongoing EBIT margins were up a whole point. We also stated in the statement that we are reaffirming our full year guidance after what we view as a good start to the year. Our integration activities in Europe and Asia have progressed well, and we\u2019re firmly on track to deliver a significant level of cost synergies for the year. As you will see from our results, consistent with our full year goals, our strong execution more than offset currency and emerging market demand challenges in parts of the world. ", "Now, I will turn to Slide 5 where you see our first quarter results. Our revenues were up 1% versus last year excluding currency. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $2.63 a share, again up 23% in line with our guidance for the year. Free cash flow declined slightly versus last year in the quarter, however we are on track to meet our full year goal. ", "On Slide 6, you\u2019ll see our guidance which once again we reaffirmed. We expect the year to deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.75 a share which represents over 15% growth versus last year. We also continue to expect to deliver free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $800 million, which is a strong improvement over the last year. So overall our expectation is to continue to build on what we see as positive momentum that developed throughout the quarter and as we manage through a challenging environment we\u2019re starting executing and also expect to deliver another year of record results. ", "On Slide 7, we do highlight a few items in our 2016 capital allocation plans. In overall, the priorities here remain unchanged, which are to fund the business, to support strong returns to shareholders and to continue to evaluate value creating M&A opportunities. As you saw during the quarter, we did complete our existing share buyback program with $225 million in share repurchases. In last week, our Board authorized a new $1 billion share buyback program and 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. With our strong business performance, we believe that we have the appropriate flexibility to continue to execute our capital allocation priorities in order to drive long-term value creation. ", "Finally on Slide 8, you can see our 2016 business priorities. Overall our focus is to continue to grow revenues and expand operating margins through a numbers of levers. First, by delivering our restructuring and acquisition cost synergies of $175 million for the year. Secondly, we are seeing and do expect to continue to see mix improvements and revenue growth as we benefit from our new product introductions and the strength of our industry leading brands.", "We continue to see and target growth opportunities in our adjacent businesses and we are leveraging our cost productivity actions to continue to deliver benefits to expand our operating margins. So with these actions, we will generate improved free cash flow from the year which will enable us to continue to create shareholder value through our capital allocation plans. ", "So at this point, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer. Marc?", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America\u2019s performance in the first quarter. We performed in line with our expectations by growing revenues 5% excluding currency and expanding operating margins 70 basis points to 10.5%. We delivered another quarter of sequential T-6 market share improvements and our units sell out in the first quarter outpacing the industry. Behind the strength of our recently launched products and the investments we made to drive profitable growth. Our strong operating margins were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and operating leverage from revenue growth, which more than offset 30 million in unfavorable currency impact in Canada and Mexico.", "Turning to Slide 11, we outlined our 2016 operational priorities for the North America region. Our expectation is that the industry will show 5% to 6% annual growth behind strong housing trends in consumer sentiments. We expect to grow at or above the industry rates for the year as we accelerate the growth of our new products and continue to make targeted investments to drive profitable growth. Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvements and we remain focused on growing on our adjacent businesses.", "Turning to Slide 12, we highlight our exciting new top load laundry platform. It represents a new era in laundry with an industry leading capacity and intuitive front tough controls. We saw significant first quarter growth in the top load laundry, with very positive consumer and major trade -- and customer support and we expect this trend to continue. ", "I will now share the first quarter results for our year for Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 13. Sales were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year, excluding currency sales declined 3%. The topline was a little soft across Europe due to a slightly weaker industry down 1%, the market was down slightly but is strong and what would believe temporary demand declines in the UK and Russia where we have a much larger business. Ongoing operating margin was 4.9%, at 220 basis points increase compared to prior year and in line with our expectations for full year margin improvements. Strong execution of our integration plan and ongoing cost productivity more than offset 20 million in unfavorable currency impact. ", "On Slide 14, our 2016 priorities remain unchanged with a strong focus on integration activities. Ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products. We expect the industry to be flat to up 2%. Over the year, we continue to expect to grow in line with the market and to deliver margin expansion consistent with our full year guidance of 7% to 8%. ", "On Slide 15, we\u2019re proud to feature Europe\u2019s first fully connect appliance suite. These products work together seamlessly to give consumers the performance they expect while offering flexibility and peace of mind.", "Now, I will discuss our Latin America results on Slide 16. Sales for the quarter were $705 million excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased 4%. Industry in Brazil was down 13% which was in line with our forecast of down 10% for the full year. However, through the strength of our brand and products, we gained market share and continue to outperform the industry. Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $42 million, nearly 6% of sales compared to 6.6% on prior year. It is important to note that the first quarter of 2016 was the beginning of last year's significant real devaluation and industry decline. We have readjusted our business for today\u2019s operating environment through previously announced cost based price increases, new product introductions and substantial cost and capacity reductions and are on track to deliver our full year operating margin guidance. ", "On Slide 17, we\u2019ve summarized our priorities in Latin America. We expect to manage through continued volatility through strong cost productivity programs and by maintaining our right sized fixed cost structure. We will continue to invest in new products and remain well positioned with consumer demand with best returns. Based on our expectations of demand down 10% and with a benefit of our offsetting actions, we expect to successfully navigate short-term challenges and deliver on our full year guidance.", "On Slide 18 is our Consul 3 standing range. It is a value based price product for Brazil that includes several premium cooking features that deliver great value for consumers. The initial sales results for this product have been very strong. ", "Now we turn to our first quarter results in the Asia region which are shown in Slide 19. Net sales were $371 million in comparison to $378 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 3%. Our ongoing operating profit was 27 million compared to [26 million] (ph) in the prior period. Ongoing operating margins were 7.3%, an increase of nearly 0.5 point driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost productivity. ", "Turning to Slide 20, we share our 2016 priorities for our Asia operations. We will continue to focus on growth for distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation continues to be flat in the same region with stronger demand in India and slight weakness in China.", "Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8% driven by our larger group platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipelines.", "On Slide 21, we showcase our new top build larger products over China market. Similar to our North American product, it features front touch controls and innovative wash technology for improved fabric care. This is a great example of leveraging our product development capability across regions.", "And finally, on Slide 22, we summarize our regional margin guidance for the full year. Our first quarter performance was consistent with these goals, which remain unchanged as we continue to see opportunities for strong margin expansion in all regions. And now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Larry.", "Larry Venturelli", "Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we have solid performance in the first quarter that was in line with our expectations. Our earnings momentum entering the second quarter and expected run rates for the second half are strong.", "Turning to our first quarter results on Slide 24, revenues were $4.6 billion, currency had a top line impact of nearly $300 million, and excluding currency, sales were up 1%. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $2.63 per share, which was up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs. We achieved these results while absorbing a currency impact of over $0.50 per share or approximately 1-point of margin. Our ongoing EBIT margin improved by a full-point during our lowest volume quarter, and we are on track for the full year guidance of 8% to 8.5%. In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter.", "Turning to Slide 25, we expect another record year performance and are reaffirming our full year guidance. As Mark discussed in the regional reviews, we are confident in our operational plans, and as a result, expect to deliver 15% plus growth in ongoing earnings per share in 2016 and approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow.", "On Slide 26, we outline our expectations for EBIT margin expansion. As previously communicated, we expect to expand our margin by over a point, primarily driven by ongoing cost productivity, favorable price mix and acquisition cost synergies. We expect to continue funding our global brand and product innovation and to absorb between a point and a point and half of margin impact from currencies. Currencies, very recently have strengthened versus the dollar. While we are not adjusting our currency assumptions at this time, should trends continue, we would see lower headwinds.", "On Slide 27, we highlight the cadence of the first-half versus second half earnings drivers; first, given seasonality of our business, we expect volume to be stronger in the second half of the year; second, we should also have lower currency headwinds in the second half of the year; third, we expect strong results from cost productivity programs and our acquisition synergies will continue throughout the year. As a result, and consistent with prior disclosures, we would expect full year earnings to approximate 40% in half one and 60% in half two.", "On Slide 28, we share some details on our first quarter free cash flow results and capital allocation actions. Our free cash flow declined slightly versus prior year, primarily due to higher restructuring cash, legacy product warranty actions and temporary working capital funding related to the integration of product transitions in Europe. We executed a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and the completion of our share repurchase program.", "Our plans to generate $700 million to $800 million in annual free cash flow are on track. With our recently announced 1 billion share buyback program, we have appropriate flexibility to continue with the balanced approach to capital allocation throughout the year.", "On Slide 29, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and integration activities. We incurred $47 million of restructuring expense and delivered $58 million in benefits in the first quarter. For the year, we expect $250 million in expense and $175 million in benefits, consistent with previous communications. In summary, our strong first quarter results support the run rates needed to deliver our full year guidance. Given our results and strong balance sheet, we also believe we have the right plans in place to deploy cash in ways that will maximize shareholder value.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thanks Larry. I\u2019ll turn to Slide 31, which summarizes again our 2016 priorities, which are built around revenue growth margin expansion and delivering strong free cash flow for the year. Four months in the year, we feel like we have very strong and robust plans to deliver on all of these priorities and we remain confident in our full year guidance. And as I outlined on Slide 32, we continue to execute our value creation strategy, which is unchanged. And this gives us an outstanding opportunity to continue delivering significant shareholder returns.", "So with that, I\u2019d like to conclude our formal remarks and open up to Q&A right now. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Rob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Rob Wetenhall", "Larry, I just want to talk about currency for a minute. First, FX exposure in North America, you guys called out a $30 million headwind and I was kind of trying to understand when you think that headwind will abate and kind of it looks like it's a little bit more than just translational and you guys done very-very confident in your guidance and I wanted to understand do you think there is potential upside to your guidance because of what's going on in FX and should we try to quantify that.", "Larry Venturelli", "Yes Rob, as I said in the prepared remarks you know we saw currencies begin to strengthen towards the end of the quarter and we've seen over the last couple of weeks or so that that continued strengthening, so if I was kind of bracketed I'd say you know if these trends continue to be positive and we see the continued strengthening we expect probably the lower end of our currency headwind guidance you know we said 1 to 1.5%, it'd be closer to that 1%, so that would be approximately $0.50 a share. Again I think currencies are moving in the right direction, the earnings that we posted in the first quarter is fully in line with our expectations and support our full year guidance. Operationally as Mark mentioned things are going well, and so that gives us the confidence in our full year guidance.", "Rob Wetenhall", "Got it, and I was hoping Mark could you talk for a second about what you're thinking revenue trends in Europe, it sounds like demand was a little bit softer than you might have otherwise expected do you think this is kind of something that's going to persist or do you think this is transitory and how should we think about revenue growth accelerating in tandem with your abilities to get synergies from Indesit.", "Marc Bitzer", "Hey Rob, it\u2019s Mark, so let me actually put the European performance little bit in context. First of all on the full year base as you know we guided towards 7 to 8% margin, we guided the market demand to be flat above zero, F up 2% and we said we would grow in line with market, we also said we have a lot of focus on server margin expansion in Europe. With that in mind and as I indicated in my prepared remarks we're actually very pleased with our performance in Europe in Q1. We delivered a substantial margin improvement 220 base points, and we continue to deliver integration cost synergies and I would argue we're fully on track towards the full year margin target. On the revenue side and I said that in my remarks, we perceive that as a slight toughness versus what we had in mind but to underline that we characterize that as a temporary softness but particularly driven by the UK and Russia where as you know post Indesit acquisition we have a significant exposure where we saw some weakness. From what we see today we do not this as structural affirment we consider this very temporary issue.", "Ron Wetenhall", "Okay, that's helpful and final question, switching around to Latin America, it sounds like I'm just trying to understand a little bit, it sounds like you had a tough comp, with 1Q '15 and then I'm trying to put that in context. Was Brazil in line with your internal expectations for the quarter or is it something else going on with the other segment in the Latin America business, I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about demand and profitability with the three businesses in the segment.", "Marc Bitzer", "Rob, it's Marc again, the simple answer is we're 100% aligned with our internal plans in Q1. To give a little bit more color keep in mind the decline of particular of Brazilian macroeconomic environment, started pretty much Q1 last year but really accelerated as we went through the year. And you saw the same on the currency, so Q1 was I would say kind of the toughest comparison if you want to see, because it was just the beginning of a recession, so we saw a significant impact obviously on the topline converted back to US dollars and then awesome demand side. We knew that coming through the year and that's why we put the plans wherever plans are and I would say we're extremely pleased with how the team performed on price margin realization i.e. on delivering cost based and inflation based price increases and better speaking we're very pleased with how the team has been managing capacity and fixed costs, and the result is our margins which are particularly keep the topline in mind very promising and we're very confident that we will deliver on our full year guidance margin.", "Rob Wetenhall", "Are the other businesses performing well inside Latin America.", "Marc Bitzer", "Rob there is always gives and takes but I would say the compressor business is performing solid or strong and consistent with what we see in the last couple of quarters, our client business out of Brazil had some issues largely driven by the introduction of import tariffs in Ecuador and Colombia, but again these are typical one time effects were just pipeline issues.", "Operator", "And we can take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan, please go ahead.", "Michael Rehaut", "Thanks, good morning everyone. Wanted to first kind of dive into the North American region a little more if possible. You know you mentioned that the 1Q sales I believe outpaced the industry and just wanted to get a sense you know where did that strength come from, was it any particular product categories and you know offsetting it because you did have 5% volume growth and I know that includes some other of the categories in Canada, Mexico and maybe give us a sense of how those regions did as well.", "Marc Bitzer", "Michael it's Marc, so let me try to answer your question. First of all, I'll heed that from prior calls, as we said in a number of calls, our reported unit shipments versus the T-6 market share units are not comparable, we\u2019re not doing an apple-to-apple comparison because obviously now our unit shipments raised a lot more than what is typically the AMT-6. So, don\u2019t fully compare that. Anyhow, having said that and taking that into context, our unit shipments in Q1 in North America were up 5%, the technique it would say it's slightly trading versus what the AM numbers would show, even though as I mentioned before we\u2019re not fully comparable.", "What is however very important to keep in mind and I indicated that before, our shipment volumes, i.e. sell in volumes after a weak start in January, we had a very strong cap in March and that momentum continued and carried into Q2 and even more importantly we mentioned which we internally look at are so called sell-out volumes, i.e. what is so true on the trade partner level. And on that level we even outpaced the overall markets. So we're actually very pleased with the U.S. shipment trends and the momentum we\u2019re carrying. To your question, more than one category, no it's not one category but of course we feel in particular that we\u2019ve regained strength in our laundry category which as you know is our flagship and last year we had some issues and we saw a strong growth in laundry but it carried through other categories as well.", "Michael Rehaut", "Yes, it\u2019s a great run down and I certainly appreciate the apples-to-apples is not comparable there. So thanks for that additional detail. I guess secondly on the margin itself, if you kind of adjust for the 30million FX hit as well as the top line, I\u2019m actually calculating like 11.5% adjusted North American margin. So, I was wondering if that\u2019s correct Larry and maybe just kind of drive through what were some of the puts and takes of that. And certainly would assume that overall as particularly as currency headwinds lessen you'd still be very much on track to hit the full year margin guidance. So, just trying to get a sense of the different benefits that you\u2019re seeing on the margin side, again, excluding the currency headwind it looks like it was about a 100 basis points above the reported number. ", "Larry Venturelli", "Mike let me take this again. As you know we guided full year North America margins 11.5% to 12.5%. If you would take the midpoint of that, that will be 0.7% higher than last year\u2019s actual, if you would take the midpoint of that range. Q1 was exactly 0.7% higher than last year. So, quarter Q1 year-over-year with exact in line with the midpoint of what we guided on a full year basis, which obviously gives us confidence we are very well on track to work out for you guidance. And that typically as you also know and particularly as you follow our share for long time. There is a lot of seasonality in our Q1 business.", "So, there's a couple of factors like small domestic appliances which are much stronger in Q4 and Q3 and that\u2019s a normal issue. If you would go back to the last couple of years, you always see a margin lift as the year progress. So again that\u2019s very typical and that\u2019s why we\u2019re very confident. Particularly with regards to your question on FX, yes you\u2019re probably correct particularly in Q1 our FX burden was high. In North America the two currencies, very simple it's Canadian dollar and Mexican Peso. First of all both finding and regained some strength to work the end of the quarter. However, on a quarter average, in particular compared to last year this was a tough comparison. That comparison get a lot less challenging as the year progresses.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Denise Chai", "Okay. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask in North America what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive environment and specifically can we get an update on the anti-dumping suit?", "Marc Bitzer", "Denise, let me first talk about the competitive environment. Again, it\u2019s kind of, this is a market where you will always see promotions and we are set for promotions in terms of value creation or if I don\u2019t create value. Right now we saw, and I mentioned in my last earnings call we saw a slightly elevated level of promotion in Q4. We adjusted to that and that\u2019s pretty much the same level in Q1. So, it\u2019s kind of -- I wouldn\u2019t describe the situation as overly concerning or surprising to us. We operate very well in that environment, we delivered strong sales growth and again as I mentioned before we\u2019re very pleased with our sellout momentum which ultimately as you know transit into selling. So we are actually very confident about the overall volume growth and our ability to find and regain some market share which we lost last year. ", "Jeff Fettig", "Denise regarding the dumping, let me give you a brief update on that. I believe we told you last time, end of January the ITC commissioners unanimously voted to proceed with the investigation in the wash or dumping trial process that we filed. It is tracking in line with our knowledge of the process and our expectations. On a high level we would expect by midyear or just beginning in the third quarter that the department of commerce will complete their investigation and establish dumping levels and cash deposits for violating companies.", "Typically there will be six months where the Department of Commerce releases it's final anti-anti-dumping determination and then it goes back to the ITC which we would expect within the next month, and have a final conclusion to that. So, from our perspective, it's progressing as it should. Again, we feel very strong that this has been going on for some period of time, quite a long time really a continuation of the previous washer dumping, which we bought. And so we expect the process to continue in this path.", "Denise Chai", "And just one more, so in terms of raw materials are you still expecting to see I think around north of 100 million in benefit of this year and mostly in the first half? And just related to that, how should we think about the North America pricing down 2% on an average unit basis? Are we seeing you reinvest some of the raw material savings?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, Denise, I think our guidance for full cost productivity, which includes the 100 million plus in raw materials is still very valid. I mean we\u2019re very confident in that and our Q1 results fully support what we expect for the full year from a productivity perspective.", "Marc Bitzer", "Denise, let me just, it's Marc again. Let me just comment on what you referred to the minus 2%; again, very important to highlight the revenue growth excluding currencies. As we said, the published revenue growth for North America is plus-3, excluding FX it's plus 5, which exactly matches our unit growth. So, on an average sales value per unit we\u2019re exactly flat year-over-year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor", "You touched already Marc on the fact that you\u2019re happy with the recovery in the North American business. I wanted to just go back to that a little bit, a couple of earnings calls you go, you\u2019d indicated that that may cost you over 100 basis points of market share. And I guess the question is can you update us on the progress on the product availability issues from last year? And do you feel this recovery positions you to regain the 100 basis points plus of market share that\u2019s been you previously indicated the situation cost last year?", "Marc Bitzer", "So David to that point, yes, you\u2019re correct. Last year, our availability issues, which are very large related to the huge amount of product introductions, because there is a market share. And when we guided on a fully base to grow in line with market above market that they\u2019ve imply to the weakening that market share. I will characterize in particular on the sequential base the Q1 is fully on track towards recovering that lost market share. And I would also expect that number in Q2 that turns throughout the year-over-year improvements. And yes there is large by the larger category, but we had some product introduction issues. So, and that is not fully on track and have seen very strong performance.", "David MacGregor", "And question for Larry, you talked about the 175 million of benefit this year. I guess the question is how much of that goes to margins versus how much of it ends up being reinvested elsewhere in other initiatives?", "Larry Venturelli", "Well, I think you\u2019re referring the synergies, and synergy benefits and David that all would flow in the margins.", "Jeff Fettig", "David, the way I guess I would look at it is if you go to the margin walk page, basically and then particularly in the case of Europe and China where we talked about acquisition synergies, it was squarely are positioned and these would be brought to bottom line expand our margins. And to-date that\u2019s been the case. You\u2019ve got other moving parts, raw materials cost productivity mix price et cetera and currencies, and so there is give and takes. But as a general principle the restructuring and M&A synergies we\u2019re using in those particular parts of the world clearly to expand margin.", "Larry Venturelli", "And if you\u2019re looking at Europe David certainly some very nice solid margin improvement, probably 3.5 points of synergy but that\u2019s being partially offset that just deployed from the unfavorable currency that we\u2019re building.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Megan McGrath with MKM.", "Megan McGrath", "I wanted to follow up a little bit on the North American competitive environment. We see a lot of signage and so for the big box store here around a spring Black Friday event, just wanted to get your thoughts on that in terms of appliances. Is it about the same as last year, or is this new initiative for them in terms of more aggressive promotions in the spring?", "Marc Bitzer", "Megan it's Marc. First of all from an overall competitive environment, trade environment, promotions are just the nature of the North America business. You will have spring Black Friday, Earth Day, you would have more the Labor Day, and Red White & Blue. So there is a lot of promotional holidays, that\u2019s just the nature of the U.S. market but it doesn\u2019t drive the entire market. So, as we\u2019ve said in the past, or to the name of the game and how we effectively play between promotion environment and the regular ongoing business environment.", "On promotions, we on a case by case base make the decisions, does it create value for us and our customers or not and then we make a situation assessment. As I mentioned before, we saw slight increase in promotion environment in Q4 and that carried into Q1 as evidence from our margin expansion I think we can create value, grow the business and add -- expand margins despite that environment, so we\u2019re not overly concerned about it.", "Megan McGrath", "And then wanted to follow-up on the share buybacks, obviously you put a new large share buyback into place you seem to be pretty opportunistic in the first quarter on buying back shares, so how are you looking at that $1 billion authorization, are you thinking about just continuing to be opportunistic are you going to put some things that is more regular in place, do you have a goal in terms of keeping your shares outstanding at a certain level, if you could give us some more color that would be great.", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes Megan, this is Jeff. You know the way I guess we have would -- the best way for us to frame it is, this is part of our capital allocation process and you know on an ongoing basis we have dialogue with our board in terms of opportunities to create value for shareholders and over time they vary or different opportunities occur. Certainly some leaving the last year we purchased we felt it was a very good use of capital for our shareholders, we are funding our business at appropriate levels now to deliver product innovation to the market place around the world.", "We are funding the business for restructuring opportunities with our M&A acquisitions which are delivering great cost benefits, you know in the past we've demonstrated when we saw great M&A opportunities we can move very quickly when we have and we also have certainly returned to shareholders for exhibiting the share repurchase and you know again we've given our long range view of what our financial performance we expect to be and obviously that makes our shares based on that in our view have great opportunity to increase in value and we balance all of those we make different decisions during different periods. But the point of all that is we have the ability to look at all these opportunities and then get very tight any period of time and act on them.", "And that's what we've been doing, we will not, nor have in the past given specific timeframes for when we expect to complete this. You should expect we, as we have been at today's levels it\u2019s highly likely we'll be a buyer can even be a buyer this year of our shares but we don't have a defined period of time by which we\u2019re going to complete it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Ken Zener", "Good morning gentlemen. Should we interpret for North America, the five rough squiggly line 5% plus to be now you're saying 5 to 6% I mean are you taking that up a percent for the industry guidance or is that just a rounding error, and I guess and the reason I'm asking that, seems like North America is obviously they have started off better could it be whether or not, but I think with some people it's maybe surprising with the higher demand side of [indiscernible] that wouldn\u2019t have impacted your guys guidance at all to the F side.", "Marc Bitzer", "Ken it's Marc. So taking your speaking we're taking it up half a point because that's the average of 5 to 6% but all joking aside we do see strength from a North American market in Q1 and we expect some of that strength to carry through as the year progresses. Behind this we are and we remain confident about the US housing market. I know there have been some somewhat sluggish numbers about housing starts we do see that being corrected over time so we're still counting on 1.15 to 1.2 housing starts and we're still counting on existing home sales of 5.3, 5.4 in that ball park and we continue to see that as we observe in the market every day, so that's why we said it\u2019s 5 to 6% could it even be more, could be, we do not see weakness today on the North American market demand.", "Ken Zener", "And then related to last year's product launches and the divided issues you were juggling last year, why wouldn't or why aren't we seeing a greater lift as you, you know you talked about 100 basis points margin so you're covering but why don\u2019t we see more of a lift if that was something you called out last year for your comping against and very easy comps and [indiscernible] vigorous product line in North America.", "Marc Bitzer", "And Kenneth, it's Marc again, obviously we're going to see how the mix progresses I can only say in particular related to what I mentioned before our sell out in Q1 has been very strong and we're talking about high single digits, low double digits sell out. Which is the indication of a newly floor product the new product introduction are working on the floor, if you know the product are working on the floor and they're selling on the floor you know the shipments will come, so that's why we're bullish on what we said before, we will grow in line or above market and obviously outlook is in on above market.", "Jeff Fettig", "And Ken the trend is really is there, I think you know we kind of had the full impact of this in late summer Q3, we improved Q4 versus Q3, we improved Q1 versus Q4 to Marc's point you know the real important thing is what are consumers buying not necessarily what you're shipping that will follow and that's very positive so I think we like the trend we've been on particularly over the last eight-ten weeks and our performance through all the markets should be good.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James, please go ahead.", "Sam Darkatsh ", "Good morning Jeff, Marc, Larry how are you? Three real quick questions if I could, Larry first I want to make sure I understood your commentary around FX, or specifically did I understand it to mean that if you were to mark to market current FX rates than the benefit incrementally to guidance or at least to EPS would be $0.50. Is that accurate?", "Larry Venturelli", "Yes, I\u2019d say, if we continue -- and again it\u2019s still early on, if we continue to see the same trends that we've been seeing in the last couple of weeks or so that would translate to my comments would be approximately $0.50.", "Jeff Fettig", "Let me just add on that. Obviously there is a lot of talk for over a year about currency. Our big parameter is we gave guidance for the year in February, we're really about the things that have been the most volatile which are our currency levels and demand levels, particularly emerging markets demand levels. In the first quarter, we were able to operate within those parameters. Late in the quarter, the currency portion and so far in April has been better than our assumptions. The demand is not, it\u2019s about in line and some markets are worse and the few markets are better. But in our view was particularly with what we\u2019ve seen volatility wise and in the case of Brazil, the political chaos and so on and so forth. It\u2019s way too early for us to change our currency assumptions, but to Larry\u2019s point if you take our two big parameters, currency levels and demand, our view is if they get better we\u2019ll get better. ", "Sam Darkatsh", "Where I am confused is you\u2019re saying if trends continue, so for example if the reais went from $0.26 to $0.28 during the quarter. Does the mean it has to continue to strengthen at that rate?", "Jeff Fettig", "Hold on. We said -- reais is actually 4:1 dollars in February. It\u2019s now 3.55, so a 10% strengthening, built around a political scenario. So, our view is that if it stays at 3.55 which is where it is today we\u2019ll do better in Latin America, same with the Europe which was probably 1.08 or so in February, it's 1.12 - 1.13 that\u2019s the translation effect there. Now, for the most part, the part we have a couple of negatives around the world, but net-net whereas currency was bad all year last year we have a little bit of stabilization which we view as a good thing but it\u2019s way too early to adjust any guidance based on that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.", "Tom Mahoney", "This is Tom calling out for Eric. Quick question on the Europe revenue decline, interesting how the 1Q organic trends compares to what you guys did through 2015. I guess really looking to pinpoint the timing of when you guys cycled the Russia headwind?", "Marc Bitzer", "Tom it's Marc Bitzer. So first of all as you know on a full year basis last year Europe revenue was pretty much flat and that\u2019s where we kind of based the market assumptions pretty much expecting all through this year directionally. So Q1 on constant FX or in local currency, with minus fees of kind of trailing fee point pretty much behind where we want to be from the revenue side. Again, as I mentioned before where it is largely driven by Russia and UK for different reasons.", "UK there is a British pound weakness, we announced some cost based price increases. As you all know we have a safety recall action -- it's a temporary UK issue. Russia, the market remains soft throughout Q1. As we said also on Investor Day, Russia is a market of extreme volatility and we saw in previous and described that kind of market come down very quickly and also comes up very quickly.", "It started already last, pretty much around February or Q1 over Q1, there was a slight weakness even though we worked till the end of the quarter some signs of stabilization in the Russia markets. But it\u2019s very hard to predict how the Russia market develops going forward. Again the latest trends have been a little bit more encouraging but it still remains very soft. ", "Tom Mahoney", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh", "I\u2019d better ask all my questions once before the moderator gets the finger [indiscernible]. I have two other quick questions if I could. First off on slide 27 which is the timing of earnings walk first half to second half. If my notes hold, the costing capacity reductions that used to be two pluses in the back half and now it\u2019s one plus, if that's accurate what\u2019s the derivation of that? And then my final question would be, in Latin America you said the price mix you\u2019re happy with could you help quantify what price mix was year-over-year in the Latin American segment?", "Larry Venturelli", "Hi Sam, this is Larry. You\u2019ll probably note from the slide in the deck there that we had very strong costing capacity from the synergies in Q1. So we\u2019re delivering a little bit ahead of our pace on the synergies and that\u2019s the only reason we adjusted the chart from the previous. But we expect -- obviously expect continued strong productivity and continued strong synergies for the remainder of the year. ", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam this is Marc, on Latin America and we will note that figure ready on you. Just putting in context, so in Latin America we had a minus 22 unit growth in Q1 excluding currency our revenue were minus 4, so that gives you a lot of the answer about the massive progress we made there on driving up our price mix.", "As you also know this is a blend of multiple different businesses, you also have the large national business in there and there is quite a bit of differences in Brazil between what we call T3, T9, T12, anyhow if you peel back beyond and in particular in our all important T3 categories, we had substantial improvement on price mix and we were successful in fact doing several cost based price increases into the market. So in short we\u2019re pleased that how the team mitigates the negative impacts of inflation currency on to price. So we\u2019re very pleased with the progress.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Can you help quantify that market if you could, even if it's a range of what price mix was in the quarter?", "Marc Bitzer", "On the core, as you know Sam, you don\u2019t give detailed numbers on price mix. But on the core Brazil and particularly if you look at the T3, again that\u2019s an element of a core business, we had year-over-year almost double-digit is the improvement.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to David MacGregor with Longbow. Please go ahead.", "David MacGregor", "You talked in the past about the importance of having market share leadership at the country level in Europe. And in the sense you want the virtues of this acquisition is it enhances that country by country leadership position. Can you just talk about how your market share, your leadership countries may have changed versus the non-leadership countries?", "Marc Bitzer", "David, its Marc. And I mean as you know, we typically don\u2019t break down market share progress quarter-on-quarter country by country. Having said that, I reaffirm that one of the key strengths of the acquisition has been the market share strength and position, which we have in several key countries and that is to be honest one year or one and half years into the integration has been fully reconfirmed. Our business in particular, Italy, France, UK and Russia and Poland remained very strong and are very strong. We do not see for your question a decline in market share, significant decline in some of the smaller markets. It's just I think what is reconfirm the structural benefit of having a strong market position, but we don\u2019t see a dramatic shift year-over-year between weaker and stronger markets.", "Jeff Fettig", "And David over time I think you will see it demonstrated through our continued ability to build our overall margin structure. And I think the other point Marc made in Q1 is when you look at overall market, we also have the market mix and having strong share of Russia and UK having those markets down more, which would weight our overall mix a little bit close to the market that\u2019s really in our view a temporary situation.", "David MacGregor", "And then second just a quick follow up, you mentioned twice in your Slide deck the adjacencies business is a growth driver. What kind of growth is achievable in this business? And do you expect margins in this business to be greater in 2016 than they were in \u201915?", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, they\u2019ve been -- overall, that business there is a number of things in it, but two that you know very well, one is our KitchenAid small appliance business. And in the case of North America we have a consumer products business. We have a commercial laundry business, and then everywhere around the world slightly different. But these businesses are each one of them are somewhat different. But our view is we\u2019d like to be able to consistently grow this at least double-digit and that will be SDA that the consumer products ultimately commercial laundry and so on given our position.", "We also have some more businesses like this in Brazil. We\u2019re developing them now, Europe, with the acquisition. We don\u2019t yet have these businesses in China. So there is a little bit around the world. But on average, yes, these are nicely margin business, probably at least double our margins so that we have them in our, our core or major appliance business. And so again when we talk about capital allocation and that sort of things, we do focus on what are the opportunities to grow these businesses could be by adding product lines could be by expanding in new markets around the world and so on. And we focus on that very strongly.", "Operator", "And we also have a follow up from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.", "Ken Zener", "Marc, following up on the question, or your statement that you grew point of sale was high single low double versus the industry shipments. Could you expand on that and give us some context? Is that due to your easy comps last year? Has that happened in the past? What does that mean for your inventory levels and/or your utilization rates? Because I think Larry you said 40% of your EPS will fall into the first-half, which are your midpoints about $3.11. So just trying to understand how those comments might impact your inventory shipments and just context to see that type of various happens often occasionally, rarely?", "Marc Bitzer", "Ken, its Marc. So obviously our sell through or sell out has been slightly higher than the sell in. So that sales up by definition as the reduction of trade inventory in the quarter, and that is by definition. So, no matter how you turn into the ending inventory for retailers is lower than the coming in. I would say it's a combination of both. I think some retailers were slight behind inventory coming through the quarter, but right now I would argue the strong sell through momentum of our product, we will see and we are seeing the shipments coming, catching up. So this is not a structural inventory reduction, it's temporary and ultimately as Jeff pointed out before selling always follow sellout.", "Operator", "Thank you. We also have follow up from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. ", "Michael Rehaut", "Thanks. Just want to make sure I heard right on the Europe segment that you were -- that revenues down 3% ex-FX, even if down 4%, and did I hear right that you saw the market flattish so you underperformed a little bit. And just wanted to get sense of what the drivers were there, sorry if you've covered this already, just want to make sure I fully understood that and if that\u2019s the case how do you anticipate kind of getting back in line with market growth for the full year which I think was still you're looking flat, flat to, well closer to flattish.", "Marc Bitzer", "Michael it's Marc. So first of all what I said is are you going to grow with minus 4 and we think the market was about minus 1 on a total level. So technically yes that would translate into we lost something versus the market, however embedded what Jeff highlight before it's very important to note that our country profile is not exactly the average of the overall market. I.e. we are exposed more to Russia, UK, Italy and France so I would say the overall market profile is not exactly identical to our data profile and in this case and just being a number situation swing slightly up in direction we're more or less more impacted by the Russia decline, but again we consider that temporary. ", "Michael Rehaut", "And then just Larry couple of technical questions on the income statement could you give us a sense what the share buyback, how we should think about fully diluted shares for the second quarter as well as the full year assuming nothing incremental from here and also just the tax rate expectations for the full year if you can revisit that as well.", "Larry Venturelli", "Tax rate Michael we said last call our guidance was 22 to 24% and in Q1 we're 22 and I'd expect that to hold for the rest of the year and I believe your first question was on shares absolute shares used. Weighted average shares, I would just use what you see in Q1.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions at this time, I'll return the floor to Jeff Fettig for closing remarks.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well again everyone, thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you at our next call, thank you.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's program, thanks for your participation, you may now disconnect and have a great day.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Chris Conley. Please go ahead.", "Chris Conley", "Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation fourth quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 1 of this presentation.", "Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions in the first round and then time permitting we will address any follow-up questions after everyone has had a turn.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Well, good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we delivered our fifth consecutive year of record ongoing earnings, with a 14% growth in our earnings per share. This was done through focused execution and strong operational actions and we were able to more than offset the impact of global volatility to deliver good earnings growth. Our restructuring and integration activities remain on track and we delivered over $200 million of benefits during the year. Additionally, we continue to invest on our innovation pipeline. And last year, we launched more than 100 innovative new products throughout the world. We continue to execute our balanced approach to capital allocation, increasing our dividend by 11% and repurchasing $525 million of common stock. In total, we distributed more than $800 million of cash to shareholders, which was up by $300 million versus the previous year. As a result of these collective actions, we did \u2013 we are able to deliver total shareholder returns in the top quartile of the S&P 500.", "Turning to Slide 5 to look at our full year results, our full year revenues grew by 2% excluding the impact of currency. We grew ongoing business earnings to a record level at $14.06 per share as we realized substantial acquisition synergies, delivered unit volume growth and drove strong productivity to expand our margins. We also improved our free cash flow versus the prior year.", "Turning to Slide 6, you will see our 2017 priorities. We continue to see multiple paths for profitable growth and margin expansion. The demand trends we see in the U.S., India and many parts of Europe are positive and we expect currency to have a more moderate impact than we have seen during the last 2 years. Within this environment, our focus in 2017 is to drive our growth above industry demand levels while expanding our margins in all four regions. We expect another year of strong cost productivity and we have detailed actions to reduce cost in place around the world. We also expect to realize significant benefits from our integration activities in Europe, which we expect to be completed by the end of this year. We will continue to fund the business through strong investments in innovation, while leveraging our robust innovation pipeline, which we believe will improve price mix and drive continued growth. We also plan to significantly improve our working capital through inventory optimization plans primarily focused in Europe and North America. By delivering on these actions, we do expect to have the capacity to both manage through global volatility and deliver substantial earnings growth and free cash flow improvement.", "Turning to Slide 7, we show our 2017 guidance. We expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $15.25 to $16.25 per share, which represents strong double-digit growth versus last year. We also expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow, which is a substantial improvement versus last year. And this is really driven by margin expansion and working capital improvements. So in total, our plans, our strategic framework and our record of execution gives us good confidence that we are going to continue to deliver sustainable value creation in 2017.", "So with that, I would like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 9, we will review our fourth quarter performance in North America. Net sales were over $3.1 billion, an increase of more than 8% excluding currency. From an industry standpoint, we stated previously what we expect of the industry to rebound in the fourth quarter. It rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter to deliver a 6% growth rate for the second half, consistent with our 2017 guidance. The industry had a strong Black Friday period, especially in the mass and value segments as the benefits of real wage growth most significantly impacted low and middle income consumers.", "Consistent with the prior three quarters, we leveraged investments in our new products to drive very strong growth in the quarter. Additionally, our sell-through outpaced our shipment volumes, indicating continued solid and consumer demand for our product and brands. Our operating margins were 11.1%, down from the prior year. This was largely driven by price mix and the impact of the Mexican peso. As many of you are aware, the Mexican peso has now devalued nearly 15% since mid-October and our margins were negatively impacted by approximately $20 million. While we have already responded with previously announced cost-based price increases in Mexico, it will take some time for them to fully be implemented. In the U.S., price mix was negatively impacted by the growth of value in mass segments of the industry as well as the elevated level of promotions by certain competitors in the fourth quarter, most prominently in washers. We have recently won an antidumping case against those competitors. But obviously, their activity has still impacted our fourth quarter results.", "Turning to Slide 10, we have outlined our 2017 expectations and operational priorities for the North America region. We expect that the industry will grow by 4% to 6% behind continued solid macro trends, including housing, real wage growth and lower unemployment. Our expectation is that the industry\u2019s strength will continue in mass segments and we plan to pursue opportunities to drive positive mix through strong cases of new product introductions. As a result, we expect to continue delivering growth at or above industry levels while expanding margins. We also remain committed to aggressive cost takeout programs, which are expected to more than offset modest raw material costs and currency impact and contribute positively to margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to deliver operating margins between 11.5% and 12%.", "Beginning on Slide 11, we will review fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Sales were $1.4 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, excluding the impact of currency. Ongoing operating margins were 3.3%. Very similar to the third quarter, our margins were negatively impacted by approximately $40 million in currency and demand impact in our UK business related to the Brexit decision. Additionally, our margins were impacted by approximately $10 million for production and inventory reduction in response to lower demand. As discussed previously, we have already implemented cost-based price increase in response to the currency devaluation, but the full benefits were not yet visible in the quarter. We expect to recover this margin impact by mid-2017.", "Turning to Slide 12, we outlined our expectations and operation priorities in Europe for 2017. We expect the industry to grow 1% to 2% in 2017 primarily driven by growth in Russia and Eastern Europe. We are pleased to see increased demand activity in these countries after several challenging years. Based on current market rates, currency weakness is expected to continue, especially when compared to the first half of the year as anniversary pre-exit rates. Operationally, brands and product transitions remain a key focus and we expect to complete these transitions by midyear. Our consolidated product and brand platform is a key driver to delivering growth in the coming years. In addition to these priorities, our focus in 2017 is on driving significant free cash flow improvements behind working capital reduction initiatives. We expect meaningful improvement in inventory levels as we complete our brand and product transitions. Overall, we expect to deliver operating margin of 5% to 6% for the year, a 1 to 2 point increase compared with 2016.", "I will now discuss our Latin America results on Slide 13. Sales for the quarter were $860 million, an increase of 2%. Our fourth quarter operating profit totaled $70 million and margins increased 130 basis points versus the prior year. We continued to expand margins and gain significant market share for strong operational execution, focusing on delivering price mix and new product launches despite soft industry demand in the quarter. We are pleased with these results and are well positioned going to 2017. On Slide 14, we outlined our 2017 priorities for Latin America.", "We are expecting demand stabilization in Brazil, with single-digit industry declines in the first half and modest growth in the second half. For the full year, we expect the industry to be flat. We expect currency to have a neutral impact to results in 2017 based on current market rates and our hedge positions. We will continue to deliver revenue growth and margin expansion both in and outside of Brazil, driven by price mix initiatives and the strong cadence of new product introduction in the region. We will also continue to drive cost out of the business, leveraging our right-sized fixed cost structure and maintaining our focus in cost productivity. For the year, we expect to deliver 7.5% to 8.5% operating margins, another year of meaningful margin improvements.", "We now turn to our fourth quarter results for the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 15. Net sales were $352 million versus $312 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 18%. Our ongoing operating profit was $19 million compared to $11 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins are 5.3%, a nearly 2-point improvement versus the prior year. We delivered strong cost takeouts and our marketplace investments drove above market growth.", "Turning to Slide 16, you will see our 2017 priorities for Asia. Our expectation is for zero to 2% industry growth for the region. The demand trends remain favorable in India and we expect to deliver revenue growth for our expanded distribution network in China, despite a neutral overall demand environment with strong plans to deliver margin expansion by leveraging our investments and innovation. And we expect to continue delivering strong cost productivity. Behind the strength of our plans, we expect to deliver 7% to 8% operating margin in 2017.", "Turning to Slide 17, we summarize our regional margin progression goals for 2017. We fully expect to deliver another year of record performance and we are confident in our ability to expand margins in all regions through disciplined and decisive execution of our priorities.", "And now I would like to turn it over to Jim.", "Jim Peters", "Thanks Marc and good morning everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we delivered our fifth consecutive year of record ongoing results in 2016. We achieved this effectively \u2013 by effectively managing currency headwinds and demand weakness in our businesses outside the U.S. Turning to our fourth quarter results on Slide 19. Net sales were $5.7 billion and grew by more than 2%, excluding the impact of currency. We achieved all-time record ongoing earnings of $4.33 per share, driven by strong cost productivity, volume and revenue growth and acquisition related synergies, despite approximately $30 million of negative currency impact to our quarterly earnings. Our effective tax rate for the year was just under 17% due to the timing of our tax planning activities. Our guidance assumes a rate of approximately 22% in 2017. Consistent with what we have done in prior years, we will continue to evaluate our tax planning strategies throughout the year and it is possible that we may have some favorability to that number. We also increased free cash flow above the prior year.", "On Slide 20, we provide an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. We incurred restructuring expenses of $173 million and delivered $216 million in benefits. For 2017, we expect $200 million in expense and $75 million in benefits. These benefits are included in our total cost takeout guidance.", "Our 2017 guidance is shown on Slide 21. I will walk through the key drivers and assumptions behind these numbers on the next few slides. On Slide 22, you will see our expectations for 2017 ongoing EBIT margin expansion. Our strong plans position us well for another year of EBIT margin expansion. We plan to deliver improved product/price mix by leveraging the mix benefits of new product introductions. We expect approximately $300 million in total cost takeout, which includes initiatives to more than offset approximately $150 million in global raw material cost increases based on what we know today. We will continue to invest in our industry leading brands and innovative product portfolio to deliver above industry growth rates. And while we expect currency to be a headwind in 2017, we anticipate a more modest impact compared with the past 2 years. In total, we expect to deliver approximately 75 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year.", "On Slide 23, I will highlight the first half versus second half timing of our earnings drivers for 2017. We expect volume to be a positive contributor to earnings in both halves of the year, although historically, the first quarter has been the softest of the year. We expect to see the impact of raw material inflation early in the year given the timing of most of our renegotiated supplier contracts. And consistent with prior years, we expect the impact of our aggressive cost takeout programs to ramp up throughout the year, with the majority of benefits to occur in the second half. As discussed earlier, currency will be a headwind, but the expected impact is mostly in the first half until we anniversary the effects of Brexit starting late in the second quarter and our previously announced cost based price increases are expected to be fully effective by mid-year. Overall, we expect full year earnings seasonality to approximate 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. We would expect normal seasonality in our earnings split between the first and second quarters.", "On Slide 24, we provide additional details on our cash flow and capital allocation priorities. We delivered $630 million of free cash flow in 2016. This includes the impact of $119 million in restructuring cash outlays and $162 million associated with legacy product warranty expenses in Europe. We expect approximately $165 million of restructuring cash outlays and $70 million from legacy product warranty expenses in 2017. We also plan to fund our pension obligations by approximately $45 million in 2017. During the year, we invested approximately $660 million in capital expenditures to fund our innovation programs and returned more than $800 million of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and increased dividends. We expect $700 million to $750 million of capital spending in 2017, consistent with our long-term goal of approximately 3% to 3.5% of net sales. And we plan to continue returning significant levels of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases under our existing buyback program, for which we still have $700 million of authorization remaining. In summary, we expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in 2017, a substantial improvement while continuing to execute against our balanced capital allocation strategy.", "Turning to Slide 25, you can see our 2017 free cash flow improvement drivers. We expect to deliver approximately $200 million to $300 million of cash earnings growth through our margin expansion plans. We expect to generate an additional $200 million in free cash flow through focused working capital improvements, primarily through inventory management. Most of the inventory improvement will come in our EMEA region as we complete planned brand and product integrations related to our integration efforts. We see substantial opportunity to drive cash flow improvements through our optimized manufacturing footprint, simplified product and brand structure and increased supply chain deployment efficiency. In North America, we expect to continue realizing the benefits of previously implemented integrated supply chain initiatives. These actions are expected to structurally reduce inventory levels by approximately six days in 2017. We are planning a slight increase in capital spending to fund innovation throughout the world as we complete integrations in Europe and emerging market demand rebounds.", "Turning to Slide 26, we show our cash deployment priorities, which are unchanged. We expect to continue share repurchases in 2017 in addition to funding the business and delivering a strong dividend.", "Now I would like to turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Fettig", "Thanks Jim. I will turn to Slide 28 and I would like to provide an update on our long-range goals and our value creation framework. Since we first provided our 2018 goals over 2 years ago, we have experienced significant changes in the global economic environment. As we talked about previously, we believe that we are in a strong dollar era, which is not likely to change soon. Since early 2015, we have seen significant devaluations in many currencies and companies, where we operate, have a big position. These devaluations have had a significant impact on our results, causing $6.50 a share of earnings and reducing our revenues by $3.5 billion. Additionally, we have had demand shocks in several emerging markets. For us, that\u2019s most prominently in Brazil, China and many Eastern European countries. These demand shocks have impacted us by another $2 a share in earnings and reduced our revenues by $1 billion. We have responded to these changes with cost-based price increases and substantial fixed cost reductions, while at the same time, continuing to invest in our innovative products and strong brands. We do believe that emerging markets will be a catalyst for growth in the years to come. But the translational impact of currency is something that we expect that we will not be able to fully offset by 2018. Although the environment which we operate has changed, our commitment and our path to create long-term value for our shareholders has not. We remain very confident in our long-term value creation framework, which we again show on Slide 29.", "We are the number one appliance manufacturer in the world, with a leading global market share position along with leading key positions in key countries around the world. Our unmatched scale gives us substantial opportunities to reduce cost and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our investments. We have 7 $1 billion plus brands in our portfolio and a strong innovation pipeline for new products. In fact, our brand portfolio remains one of our greatest assets enabled us to reach over 90% of all consumers globally. We are committed to aggressive cost takeout and productivity and we plan to further leverage our best cost global operating program as we have demonstrated this type of execution over the last several years. Our operating platforms and position in key emerging markets is also very strong and we will capitalize on future growth in those economies as they start to rebound. Finally, our strong free cash flow generation allows us to continue our balanced capital allocation approach. So, we are quite confident that collectively executing this framework will enable us to continue to create sustainable long-term shareholder value creation.", "I would now like to turn to Slide 30 and I would like to summarize the components of our long-term value creation goals. We expect that with our leading portfolio of brands and our product innovation pipeline that we will be able to deliver 3% to 5% annual organic revenue growth per year. We expect to expand our EBIT margins to 10% plus by 2020 through both strong cost productivity and again by leveraging our brand portfolio and product portfolio to drive both consumer demand and positive price mix. With these growth and margin expansion actions, we expect to grow earnings per share 10% to 15% each year. We also expect to deliver free cash flow of 5% to 6% of revenues by 2018. Our 2017 guidance is another big step forward towards achieving these goals and our record of effectively managing through global economic volatility has been good. And we have proven that we can deliver sustainable long-term value creation for our shareholders in most any type of environment.", "Finally, I will turn to Slide 31 and kind of summarize our key messages of the day here. Last year, 2016 was our fifth consecutive record year of ongoing earnings per share and our guidance for 2017 clearly indicates we expect that to continue. We have returned over $800 million to our shareholders, an all-time record. We are confident in our plans to drive significant revenue growth and margin expansion around the world, with a very good recovery, particularly in the European region in 2017. And lastly, we expect significant free cash flow improvement in 2017, which comes from earnings growth and working capital management. So as I step back, overall, we believe our long-term fundamentals are very strong and we look forward to sharing a lot more details about our plans at our Investor Day, which we are scheduling for early May. But at this point in time, I will end our formal remarks and we\u2019d like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Michael Rehaut", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike Rehaut, JPMorgan. First question, and I think this is on a lot of people\u2019s minds with looking into the North American margins, is \u2013 and this is something Marc, I think, you alluded to in your prepared remarks earlier, was the pricing and promotion environment. And you mentioned Marc that promotions, I guess, particularly in washers continued in the fourth quarter despite the initial positive ruling and the subsequent final ruling in January. So just curious, since that final ruling, have you witnessed any change in the pricing or promotional environment? And do you expect \u2013 was there some type of perhaps flurry of activity in the fourth quarter before that? And have you seen any change in the marketplace since then? And then I have a follow-up.", "Marc Bitzer", "Michael, so it\u2019s Marc. Obviously, your question probably backed a little bit of long answer \u2013 implied many questions. Let me first comment on the North America volume and price environment and kind of the impact in our margin, of which what you alluded to the activities by certain competitors is the only one part of that. First of all, the volume, as to some extent expected, but came out even stronger when we originally forecasted. The Q4 industry was very strong. It came, as I pointed out before, largely at the mass and value segments, which is not surprising if you look at all the consumer confidence data on the lower, middle-income buckets. So I would say, finally, the consumer is entering stores. Now, that doesn\u2019t help your price mix to be honest and I will come back to this one later on. The back half, i.e., the second half of 2016 was 6% volume growth, which is exactly what we pretty much forecast for \u201817 if you take the higher end of our 2017 forecast. So yes, the volume was strong. I would also argue that industry sell-in may have been a little bit stronger than the industry sellout, which is different from our own numbers, but we had a very strong sellout. The pricing environment, I would say, was impacted by two factors. One was, as I mentioned before, the growth of the mass and value segments. And two, yes, there were still very intense promotional activity by certain competitors as we alluded \u2013 particularly in washers segment. In Q4, it did not come as a complete surprise because as we know we always talked about they stockpiled a lot of inventory from a summer and that has not completely sold in Q3. So, that was kind of a hangover from this massive stockpiling prior to the summer initial ruling. And particularly, one of them continued an extremely aggressive promotional cadence throughout the entire Q4. Now obviously, the final ruling, as you know, was not in Q4. That was in January. And I would say it\u2019s too early to say, doesn\u2019t really change their behaviors and we are obviously actively monitoring. Of course, our expectation will be that finally, a fair trade environment is reestablished, but the history of the past tells us we have a couple of question marks. But we are obviously actively monitoring and take actions whenever necessary.", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes, Michael. This is Jeff. I would just add to Marc\u2019s comments, couple of things. One as you look at the total North America margin, we did have a fairly impactful currency hit during the quarter. Two, we have \u2013 as you step back and think about it, Marc said it absolutely correctly is we basically had demand for the year of 6%, very steady in the first half, first half is up 5%. We talked last time about the unexpected stop in demand where it was basically flat, which was very strange and we all speculated as to why and then it doubled the run-rate in the fourth quarter. And so \u2013 but for the year it was 6%. I think the reality is that\u2019s pretty much what the markets ran at for the year. That\u2019s not the most efficient way for us to run our business with zero demand increase in Q3 and double-digit increase in Q4. So you obviously run \u2013 have a few inefficiencies in that kind of cycle, if you will. And we did and we have them behind us. And then the third thing, to Marc\u2019s point on margin, yes, we have said all along, we have been very clear publicly with investors, with the government, this illegal dumping that\u2019s been going on for a long period of time has had a negative impact on our margins, but it\u2019s already in our baseline. And we did have a situation in the second half of the year where one particular competitor had stockpiled massive amount of washers and that probably just added to that, but it\u2019s not new. We have been dealing with it. And that\u2019s all reflected in the fourth quarter.", "Marc Bitzer", "And Michael, it\u2019s Marc again. Just to maybe add one last comment and also as we turn the page to 2017 and obviously, the North America margins which is the center of many questions. Our Q4 margins in North America were at the low end of our guidance. They were within the guidance, but the low end. Now you have also seen, we have given the guidance for next year, which is the above for 2016 actuals. And we are strongly convinced we can drive volume growth above market growth and expand our margins. It\u2019s obviously at a more modest pace compared to a couple of years ago, but it is a margin expansion. I also want to emphasize, this is not based on some irrational hopes about certain competitors becoming all of a sudden completely different. We do believe we have opportunities on cost productivity. We have a number of product introductions, which help us on price mix and we took certain other actions. So we are strongly convinced we can expand margins and drive above market growth.", "Michael Rehaut", "I appreciate that guys and it\u2019s a comprehensive answer. Secondly, you also alluded to pricing in the UK and some of the challenges there and the price increases that I believe you enacted last quarter and I believe you said you expect it to be fully enacted by mid-\u201917, along with maybe not just price but also cost actions, just wanted to get a sense of where that price traction with price stands today, do you feel like you are a third of the way in or is it \u2013 in terms of the amount that\u2019s stuck or how you see that in the marketplace. And then just the technical question on the \u201817 guidance if that includes any share repurchase or not for the EPS line? Thanks.", "Marc Bitzer", "Mike, let me maybe first take the UK pricing question and Jim is probably going to talk about share repurchase or Jeff. First of all, again, to put for everyone on the phone UK business in context, historically that represented about 20% to 25% of our new Europe, Middle East and Africa revenues, but also historically represented a higher percentage on our profit, so it was an above average profit market, which also explains why our UK concerns weigh heavily on our European overall margins. On UK pricing, the honest answer is we have been slow in getting traction with pricing. Now, to give a little bit more color on this one. We went out with two price increases and what we have seen in Q4 and obviously, I cannot comment on competitors pricing. What I do can comment on is consumer pricing in the marketplace, okay. If you look at the consumer pricing in the marketplace, you would see that Whirlpool or Hotpoint, i.e., our brand, our branded products have high single-digits consumer price increase, in the ballpark of 7% to 9%. If you would look at the broader market, you would also see that in the second half of 2016, we were largely on our own with that price increase, which probably explains why in a very price elastic market like UK, we had a fairly significant volume impact. So yes, we got a high single-digit price impact, which came with a massive volume loss, but it also tells you that pricing is not yet enough to fully recover what we lost in the currency. It\u2019s just a simple reality. We have further pricing actions and obviously, given the nature of UK market, we have a fairly big mail order business and long-standing consumer pricing. It will be interesting to see in the month of January, which is particularly critical for UK, how the overall consumer pricing landscape is going to be impacted. But we remain confident we will, every month, month by month, find more traction with pricing.", "Jeff Fettig", "We talked about this on the last two calls. And in July when the Brexit decision first came out, we basically said we did not know what the impact would be. In the end of the third quarter, we said it cost us $40 million in the third quarter. And now it\u2019s cost us $40 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We think that will lessen somewhat in Q1 and hopefully some more in Q2 and then \u2013 but we won\u2019t see recovery on our business until Q3 when we start anniversarying this whole thing. So all-in-all, it\u2019s cost us just last year probably $0.80 a share. In the second half of last year, we have put a lot of pressure on the rest of our business. But it\u2019s a \u2013 we believe it\u2019s a matter of time. Unfortunately, we think it will be a full year before we see the full positive benefit.", "Jim Peters", "And Michael, to your second question, this is Jim. We \u2013 in the supplementary materials, we said that we modeled 76.3 million shares from a guidance perspective. And that includes any buybacks we have done up-to-date. And as we have said, there could be future buybacks, but also there are compensation plans where shares are issued. So none of that is incorporated at this point, but 76.3 million is what you should be using.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.", "Ken Zener", "Good morning gentlemen.", "Jeff Fettig", "Good morning Ken.", "Ken Zener", "Two compound questions here to address these issues, it seems that 300 basis points in EMEA tied to Brexit is the differential between the guidance you are giving this year and where we started out FY \u201816 as I look at your guidance there, so that\u2019s I guess kind of understandable. My \u2013 and I think investors\u2019 key concern is given that you also have to prove your success, Whirlpool that is, your guidance for North America margins this year of 11.5% to 12% compares to last year at this point, where you are 11.5% to 12.5%, yet the unit growth is the same, so can you put that in context for \u2013 is it just the peso and the Canadian currency, which seems to be about 60 bps drag year-over-year in the fourth quarter because you had good volume. Marc, you talked about the mass product price mix drawing you down, if you could really be a lot clear about that, because that always happens in the fourth quarter, all of your other businesses, which historically are higher margins, so can you talk about the margin pressure we are seeing in the U.S., isolate currency, isolate the product mix as it relates to these core issues of washers, which are now coming out of Vietnam and Thailand? Thank you.", "Marc Bitzer", "Hi Ken, let me try to answer it. First of all, because you started on the Europe margin progression, yes you are right, the kind of 1 to 2 full points of margin expansion in Europe, which we expect is partially driven by the UK pricing or currency recovery. There is also a significant part of synergies and restructuring carryover. We always allude to this one, so it\u2019s not just baked on pricing. There is also quite a bit of sustained cost productivity benefits and synergy benefits, which lead to that 50 mark progression. Now, more specific on the North America margin, first of all, I would argue that you can\u2019t compare with starting point of \u201817 with the starting point of \u201816 because the overall environment based on currency, raw materials, etcetera, is just not comparable. So I think you should always compare to where you would exit the year and where the exit run rates are, okay. I would say right now kind of first of all, there is ongoing cost productivity we have also in North America, which is more than what we expect as a raw material cost increase, which by the way, is a big difference to \u201816. You had entering \u201816 still raw material tailwinds and we now have raw material headwinds. That is the fundamental massive difference. Of course, there is a fundamental currency reset. Entering \u201816, you had the Canadian dollar reset and now we have a massive Mexico reset, which is from a magnitude kind of not even comparable to what we have seen before and it seems to be getting worse day-by-day. So these are the big differences. But again, the margin expansion is driven by cost productivity, and two we still have a whole bunch of product introductions, which will allow us to drive mix in this still fairly aggressive market environment.", "Ken Zener", "I guess, the second question, I think Whirlpool is one of these [indiscernible], if you will and there is a really interesting article in Cleveland.com highlighting the fact that production just stopped from China and immediately went to Vietnam and Thailand for LG and Samsung, by and large for their products and Jeff, I believe I know you don\u2019t want to talk about politics, but I believe your travel schedule last week involved DC, how \u2013 can you kind of put this in context, because clearly these firms went from Mexico to China and now to other parts of Southeast Asia and we do have a different environment, not only is it more fiscal oriented versus monetary, but we have a President that\u2019s a bit more focused on the imports, can you talk about how perhaps that impacts U.S. producers like Whirlpool and GE? Thank you.", "Jeff Fettig", "Yes. Ken, I mean the high level, I mean let\u2019s start with Whirlpool. We are a global company. We have a global operating platform. And for the most part, our production is local for local. 82% of what we sell in the United States, we make in the United States. We never left the U.S. from manufacturing. We spent probably $1.5 billion over the last 6 years upgrading all of our U.S. \u2013 nine U.S. facilities, not only to the state-of-the-art manufacturing, training of our people, product innovation and so on. So we are hugely committed to successful U.S. manufacturing. We manufacture more in the U.S. than everyone else put together in our category. Now \u2013 so we also have been a victim, if you will, of illegal dumping for a long period of time in the U.S. appliance business. And so as it relates to the \u2013 I can\u2019t comment on any particulars, because I don\u2019t know them, but in terms of the new administration asking input from U.S. manufacturers, the things really are about, how do we ensure that American manufacturer is competitive? How do we create good new jobs in manufacturing? And what kind of inputs could \u2013 in terms of specific, whether it\u2019s around regulations or trade or taxes, would help American manufacturers not only be competitive, but also be able to add new jobs. And so that\u2019s \u2013 we have been part of that as there are many industries and there is obviously no conclusions yet, but given our footprint in the U.S., our position in the U.S., absolutely, we want to both have great manufacturing competitiveness in the U.S. and we want territory.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will go next to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Bob Wetenhall", "Hey, good morning. I don\u2019t know who the question is for, but your volume was like 12%, which is awesome and you had a little bit of a pricing headwind yet you saw margin contract by 130 basis points. So, I just thought with given the fixed cost nature of the business, it would offset the price decline. Can you step me through \u2013 I didn\u2019t think the currency impact, in particular in 4Q specifically was like the driver of negative margin compression. What\u2019s going on specifically just for the fourth quarter in North America in terms of profitability?", "Marc Bitzer", "Hey, Bob, it\u2019s Marc. So let me try to take this one. First of all, yes, our volume growth was significant. As usual, that\u2019s the total volume growth, which we published in North America, which also includes Mexico and Canada and which also includes KitchenAid small domestic, so it\u2019s not fully comparable to whatever is the published market on T6 or T7. Having said all that, as I have mentioned before, the margin impact was largely driven by three elements: one, yes, the Mexican peso weighs heavily, ballpark $20 million and particular as we exited the year, so that is a pretty heavy weight on this one; two, lot of the market growth, it\u2019s hard to exactly tell you for 12% how much loss, but I would say the majority came in mass and value segments, which are profitable, but not as profitable as the high-end products. So, they don\u2019t have \u2013 they are profitable and you make money on them, but they don\u2019t help you lift the average profitability. And thirdly, yes, in particular in washer, we were impacted by the aggressive promotion environment and that was probably the most painful one, because there was a lot of growth in washers in the markets and we simply could either not participate, because it was not value-creating or it was not very attractive promotional environment for washer. So, these were the three big elements which really impacted the Q4 margins.", "Bob Wetenhall", "Got it. That\u2019s exactly where I was trying to get. Thanks for the clarity there. Your segment margin targets for EMEA and LatAm, just trying to get some context, obviously, some FX headwinds with Brazil, softer demand in the UK, you guys have done a great job stepping us through that. Are you confident that as you cycle through in next year, that you can get to this range, because it looks like an aggressive range to get that margin uplift? And by the same token, it sounds like the Brazilian economy is turning pretty dramatically. And is your Brazilian outlook in terms of margin performance and targets potentially conservative given the fact that economic growth seems to be reasserting itself?", "Marc Bitzer", "Bob, it\u2019s Marc again. So, let me maybe first start with Latin America and Brazil and this is maybe one of the most overlooked gems which we had in our Q4 results. Because if you look at the Brazil margins in Q4, despite a really soft market environment of double-digit down, it\u2019s actually fairly impressive. What it really means, we brought the cost in our pricing into a situation where even with low volumes we have actually fairly attractive margins. What we have modeled for full year is flat with some cost in the first half as I indicated and probably modest growth in the second half. So I would say yes, on surface, the Latin America margin target is 7.5% to 8.5%, they may seem aggressive, but you can imagine this is not too dissimilar from what we had in North America several years ago. We have now the right structure from fixed cost and pricing, you load a little bit of volume on this one or you start not losing volume, you have very attractive margins and we are highly confident in Latin America.", "On Europe, yes, it is quite a bit of growth versus last year. I would also argue 2016 was impacted by \u2013 was an extraordinary event, which we are anniversarying through and where we had certain mitigating actions. And on top of that, our cost takeout is and has been fully on track. So, we have no reason to slowdown our perspective integration activities. We know how much is coming through. We have so far fully delivered on the integration cost takeouts. Actually, local currency and over-delivered and so take the two things, working through the UK issues, getting the integration benefits better how we get to these margin targets. And that does not yet fully factoring any stronger growth for Russia, which as you know is highly impactful in our margins in Europe. The one thing which you didn\u2019t ask, but I guess you implied it, we also want to be clear, we have not walked away from our long-term margin targets in Europe. Whatever we communicated around the acquisition, we still think it\u2019s fully achievable, because the UK impact has probably been delayed by a year, but we fully stand behind these long-term targets.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Denise Chai", "Right, thank you. Can you hear me?", "Marc Bitzer", "Yes.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, great. Just going back to Slide 28, could you please breakout the drag from currency and emerging market macro in each year?", "Jim Peters", "In each year. So, if we go back and look at in \u2013 we were $200 million of a drag this year. And then last year, I believe we were $400 million drag from an EPS perspective from currency.", "Denise Chai", "How about emerging markets?", "Jim Peters", "Then emerging market demand, if you really look at, I would say approximately \u2013 that\u2019s approximately half and half, maybe a little bit more heavily weighted to the prior year, within that ballpark now, yes.", "Denise Chai", "And for \u201817, what are you assuming?", "Jim Peters", "So for \u201817, we are assuming currency has an impact of $0.50 right now. And then for demand, as Marc alluded to on the demand, we assume flat.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, got it. Thanks. And just looking at sundry and some which tends to swing around a bit, what are some of the swing factors for \u201816 and what\u2019s baked into your expectations for \u201817?", "Jim Peters", "Sorry, I didn\u2019t hear the sundry. We expect it to be flat year-over-year.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, flat, got it. Thank you. And so just one last one, just looking at your restructuring cash outlays, do you think that \u201817 will be the peak or how are you thinking about this going forward?", "Jim Peters", "Well, I think what you will see at \u201817 and \u201818 are the two heaviest years. And then once we get beyond \u201818, it drops off dramatically. So our expectations right now would be \u201817 and \u201818 are the peaks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor", "Yes, good morning. I guess I had two questions. Jeff, first of all, in your prepared remarks, you made reference to some inefficiencies that you incurred on the, I guess, on the manufacturing side and the laundry given the strength in the quarter. And I am just thinking about that Western Ohio laundry complex, where I believe you are still running two shifts and not yet running a third shift. And I guess my first question is given the strength we have seen in laundry and your success in winning some share back there in 2016, are you beginning to bump up against some manufacturing constraints with the two shift model there that\u2019s creating marginal cost that was a factor in the margin performance in the quarter? And does this mean you have to bring on a third shift in \u201817 and what the economics of that might reflect?", "Jeff Fettig", "David, no, really what I was referring to was we did have a strained second half from a demand and shipment standpoint. Things were \u2013 as you know our industry well, I mean, it\u2019s fairly predictable going up or down or whichever direction. And the first half was pretty solid throughout the quarter, 5% growth. And then all of a sudden, we saw zero, actually, negative growth in July and August and September. And as you know, we don\u2019t wait very long to start digesting our inventories and production and so on and so forth. So we were surprised in the Q3 with 2 months of negative demand and shipments. And then it came roaring back even much more than we expected in the fourth quarter. And so my only point was is that we have kind of a plus 5% first half, flat third quarter and a plus, whatever it was 12% fourth quarter. There is a lot of gyrations in your supply chain and manufacturing adjustments and inventory and so on and it just cause inefficiencies. It has nothing to do with capacity. We can handle \u2013 I mean, you are right I mean we have a lot of options on capacity. We got installed capacity. We got shifts, little bottlenecks we can resolve in a fairly short period of time. So it was really just about the unusual nature of Q3 demand or lack thereof and then roaring back in Q4.", "David MacGregor", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then my second question, I guess with respect to again, you are talking about the recovery of demand and value price points, I am not sure if everyone on the call understands that in those price points, you play with some different brands Roper at Lowe\u2019s and Amana at Home Depot, but in our price checks over Black Friday, you were a full $100 below where the Koreans were playing and I am just wondering if maybe you got yourself a little overly aggressive on value pricing in the quarter and that may have been a factor in the margin performance as well?", "Marc Bitzer", "David, it\u2019s Marc. We saw what you wrote in your pre-call. Long story short, I am not quite sure I would concur with your observation. At one point, we may want to do store check. If you compare a high capacity top loader from certain competitors, which is brought down from a regular MSRP from $999 to $499 and you compare that with a lower capacity agitator model, it\u2019s \u2013 you may have $100 difference, but it\u2019s not remote to comparison. Bit line structure entire point, which we always made about price compression throughout the range. So you are comparing apples-to-oranges. And if you would have seen at some of the frontload pricing and high-end top-load pricing of certain competitors, it\u2019s being, by a long shot, the most aggressive in many years so completely different from apparently what you observe.", "Jeff Fettig", "And I would only add to that Dave, I think that\u2019s \u2013 the price point thing, you are probably right. But in terms of the apples-to-oranges is the issue. In fact that\u2019s what we proved decisively with the Department of Commerce and ITC was that it\u2019s not price points, it\u2019s like comparisons. And we are \u2013 I doubt that we are the lowest in the marketplace.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Sam Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Sam Eisner", "Yes. Good morning everyone.", "Marc Bitzer", "Good morning.", "Sam Eisner", "So, just going to your total cost takeout number that you cited of about 1.5 point, which includes the $150 million of raw material headwinds, I think if you add that on top of the roughly $300 million, you have to drive about $450 million of cost takeout this year, can you just bucket where that\u2019s coming from, I think you called about $75 million from restructuring, but still is a pretty sizable chunk, if you can just highlight where that\u2019s coming from on a dollar basis that would be great?", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam, it\u2019s Marc. First of all, your math is correct, $150 million raw material headwind, that\u2019s what we see at this point. Obviously, associated with some uncertainty, but that\u2019s what we see from today\u2019s perspective between $450 million on all the other cost buckets. So yes, we have $75 million restructuring. There is also quite a bit, as I alluded earlier, of synergies from the acquisitions and our ongoing cost productivity, which basically means targeted cost takeout on certain existing products, etcetera. And also fixed cost actions, which we are taking. So we typically don\u2019t break it down in buckets in terms of what is fixed cost, what is cost takeout and what our synergy is, because and particularly between synergies and cost takeouts, 3 years of integration is kind of hard to split it out. We will split out of course, the restructuring going forward. But again, the total is $450 million in terms of cost takeout absent of raw material and we are - also if you look at historical run rates, I think that\u2019s a level which we absolutely are confident we can achieve.", "Sam Eisner", "Got it. And then just maybe going back to the North America pricing, if you look at the retailer comps, you think Home Depot as a proxy, right, they have seen basically double-digit comp in their appliances throughout the course of the first nine months of the year and so I was wondering if you can just opine on kind of how your customers are thinking about the promotional environment, how accepting are they of getting actually price increases into next year. And then ultimately, is there any kind of commentary that you would like to provide on how any announced price increases are looking through January? Thanks.", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam, it\u2019s Marc again. First of all, when you look at the numbers, which were communicated or published by Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s, yes, their appliance business was very strong. Keep that in mind that it was on the back of some fairly significant distribution shifts in the overall landscape, which has been going on for some time and probably was accelerated in particular back end of \u201816 and is not yet over. So I would see underneath was strong North America market, there is some fairly massive distribution changes, which I would say right now play in favor of both Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot. And we don\u2019t see that this is going to slowing down immediately. In that environment again, it\u2019s obviously \u2013 we don\u2019t comment on how certain retailers respond to our promotion offers or whatever we plan on price increases. It\u2019s \u2013 retailers compete against each other and usually there is not always a receptiveness to drive pricing up, but that\u2019s our day-to-day work and that\u2019s what we have done in the past.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Alvaro Lacayo with Gabelli & Company.", "Alvaro Lacayo", "Good morning. I guess my first question just on the sort of unique nature of the way that the demand for shipments worked out in the back half of the year, maybe if you can provide some more context or perspective on what drove the strength and if there is any sort of one-time items that made this number look stronger, I mean I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s destocking from competitors or if there is some pull forward in demand, but any commentary around that would be great. And then with the 4% to 6% growth that you are predicting for North America going into \u201817, what is the primary driver of that growth in terms of that mass and value segment, is that going to be the predominant driver and does that sort of weigh down on mix through \u201817?", "Jeff Fettig", "Let me take the first one since I brought it up. No. Like I said, I mean we were perplexed in July and August when we saw negative shipments from the industry after a very consistent plus 5%. And if you remember in the third quarter call, we said that didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to us. Candidly, all the underlying \u2013 our drivers of appliance demand were good, in fact very good. And the \u2013 anecdotally, the only thing we could really assess at that point in time with our retail customers was that that was the height of the political election campaign, a lot of negative stuff out there and that makes consumers cautious and for a period of time quit buying. We also said we think that would continue. And I think when we gave kind of our full year guidance in October, it assumed that we kind of popped back to 5% or so demand. Well, the fact of the matter is again, anecdotally, it looks like that was pretty much spot-on and that the pent-up \u2013 the delayed purchases in Q3 came back on full force in Q4. And I frankly think it\u2019s as simple as that. The full year was 6%. We always talked about 4% to 6%. So I think that\u2019s the natural run rate. And I would go back in Marc\u2019s comments for this year. The underlying demand drivers are all good. Replacement is good, new construction is good. Just the home sales is good and discretionary, which is largely remodeling, is good. So that\u2019s why we expect to see that kind of demand.", "Marc Bitzer", "Alvaro, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe just adding particularly for the \u201817 outlook again, we guide 4% to 6%, which will be kind of at the pretty much where the back half was. That is based on we still see strong housing environment, so we basically see 1.3 million housing starts, around 5.5 million existing home sales, low unemployment and consumer confidence above 90. And we \u2013 for today\u2019s perspective, we just don\u2019t see any reason why this would slowdown in \u201817. Now what you need to be careful as in the past is whenever you see monthly industry shipment data, always don\u2019t lose that these are sell in shipment data, which may be impacted by when certain competitors bring products into the country, how they manage, recall the units and shipment data so there is noise in the monthly shipment data. Unfortunately, there is no reliable public information of sell-out data, but from the data which we have, consumer sell-out is much more stable than you would expect from these sell-in data, which also is probably explanation between the strange Q3 versus Q4 numbers. Consumers act more stable from a sell-out perspective and what we see \u2013 what we saw on December, that\u2019s what we have seen in January so far. Now specifically answering your question on the mass and value, yes, we do and that\u2019s probably a positive perspective from a macroeconomic. The wage growth arriving finally in the middle and lower income levels, which drives them back in the stores and then drives some demand. Our job is through cost productivity and mix management to make us very profitable also in these segments.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners.", "Megan McGrath", "Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, just a couple of clarification, on your EBIT walk at the end of your presentation, in terms of price mix, you are expecting zero, I think zero to 2.5 this year, what was it in \u201816?", "Jim Peters", "So if we go back in \u201816, we would have been about a negative point of price mix as we look at for the full year. And then the 0.5, the zero to 0.5 we expect is based on our previously announced price increases going into 2017 as well as our new product launches.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our last question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Good morning Jeff, Marc, Jim, how are you and happy New Year too.", "Jim Peters", "Thank you.", "Sam Darkatsh", "I understand we are up against it on the clock. I just have clarification questions, if I could. Of the $450 million in total cost takeout and $150 million in raw material inflation, how much of that is North America specific for both those line items?", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam, it\u2019s Marc. And as usual, we don\u2019t breakdown exact details. Now, what I can tell you first of all, $150 million, but $150 million raw material headwind is largely North America and largely globally on steel. And steel particularly see on North America and China. So if you want to say so, I would say of $150 million, North America and China sees a disproportioned amount, but we see a somewhat unfavorable environment pretty much throughout the globe. As I said before, there is some uncertainty around these numbers. We don\u2019t believe always raw material trends are demand-driven, so there are there factors coming to play and that drives some uncertainty. But that\u2019s what we see today. The $450 million, on the other hand yes, there is a North America portion. Keep in mind, there is still, I would say disproportionate amount off in Europe and that\u2019s just a result of restructuring and still remainder of integration benefit.", "Jeff Fettig", "Okay. Well, with that, we have hit the hour. I would like to just close again. Appreciate everybody being online. We finished a record year \u201816 and we are going to a record year in \u201817. There is a lot of volatility but hopefully as we have talked, we have got the plans in place to be able to deal with this. So we look forward to \u2013 thanks or joining us.

(NYSE:WHR) Q2 2017 Earnings Call July 27, 2017  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Max Tunnicliff - Whirlpool Corp.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.", "Analysts", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (NYSE:USA) LLC", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded.", "For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.", "Max Tunnicliff - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpool.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on slide 2 of the presentation.", "Turning to slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions in the first round, and time permitting we will address any follow-up questions after everyone has had a turn.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release, we delivered very strong revenue and margin performance in our North America and Latin America regions despite the impact of higher raw material cost, which did negatively impacted our second quarter results. We also delivered sequential operating margins improvement in Europe, and overall we did make good progress in Europe on our supply chain initiatives which resulted in improved availability.", "At the end of the second quarter, our free cash flow increased by nearly $200 million compared to last year, and we are on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow goal of $1 billion. This strong level of cash flow generation allows us to continue executing our balanced capital allocation strategy and effectively returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "During the quarter, we repurchased $200 million share of common stock bringing our year-to-date total to $350 million. We also paid an increased quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share. Overall, our strong confidence in our cash generation has enabled us to announce a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, which brings our current total authorization to $2.350 billion. This increased authorization gives us ample flexibility to effectively execute our balanced capital allocation plans and continue effectively returning cash to shareholders.", "On slide 6 we show our second quarter financial results, where we delivered revenue growth of 3%, ongoing earnings per share of $3.35 a share and a free cash flow improvement of more than $190 million.", "We have seen cost increases on key raw materials, primary steel and resins across the globe during the first six months of the year. In North America and Latin America, we've been able to more than offset these headwinds with favorable demand and productivity gains. In Europe and Asia, however, weaker market demand has made it more challenging to offset this during the first half.", "So I'll turn to slide 7 where we show our 2017 updated guidance. Again, our free cash flow guidance of $1 billion has not changed. We have updated our 2017 earnings per share guidance to reflect the impact of the expected raw material inflation. So, overall, we now expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $14.50 to $15 a share.", "Turning to slide 8, you'll see that our priorities for the year have not changed. We remain focused on realizing the benefits of our integration activities in Europe, and we do expect to deliver sequential margin improvement in the third and fourth quarters. We also continue to expect to drive growth at or above industry levels in both the U.S. and Brazil, and again our focus remains on delivering substantial free cash flow improvements for the year ahead.", "So, with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc to talk about our global operations.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. On slide 10, we will review second quarter performance of our North American region.", "Net sales were $3 billion, an increase of more than 8% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currencies, revenues grew 9%. This growth was driven by a combination of continued industry growth and another quarter of market share gains. We gained nearly 1-point of market share as we continue to see consumer demand for our leading brands outpacing the industry.", "In addition to strong unit volume growth in our core business, we also delivered very strong adjacent business growth, particularly in our KitchenAid small domestic business through new product introductions and share gains. We reported very strong margin of 11.8% for the quarter, fully in line with our full-year guidance as we realize the benefits of double-digit unit volume growth and continued cost productivity.", "Compared to the prior year, margins were impacted by elevated raw material inflation of more than $14 million as well as $10 million of unfavorable currency. In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter operating performance in North America.", "Turning to slide 11, we show our expectations and operations priorities for North America. We continue to expect industry growth of 4% to 6% for full year behind strong trends in housing, low unemployment and real wage growth. The industry grew more than 5% in the second quarter and have now grown 4% for first half, in line with our expectations.", "As we have done in each for the first two quarters of this year, we expect to grow at or above industry levels while driving strong levels of cost productivity. We continue to believe that we're well positioned to deliver our full-year margin growth of 11.5% to 12%.", "On slide 12, we will review the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, down 5% versus the prior year excluding the impact of currency. The sales decline was largely impacted by continued demand weakness in the UK, which was partially offset by growth in Russia.", "We delivered sequential operating margin improvement of $17 million as we realized the benefits of improved system stabilization and product availability compared to the first quarter. Compared to the prior year, our operating margins were negatively impacted by approximately $25 million of raw material inflation and approximately $10 million of unfavorable currency impact.", "Turning to slide 13, we summarize our priorities and expectations for the EMEA region. We improved system stabilization in the second quarter and remain focused on further improvements across the region this year. As a result, product availability has improved compared to the first quarter and we expect to continue driving improvements for our supply chain initiatives.", "We continue to expect 0% to 2% industry growth in 2017, as growth in Russia and Eastern Europe is expected to be offset by weakness in UK. Based on current market rates, we anticipate continued margin impact from currency weakness in the UK. We will continue to reduce inventories, which as a result of product transitions have been slightly elevated.", "Our accelerated inventory reduction, combined with competitive intensity in the first half, is expected to drive a negative full-year price mix impact compared to our prior regional guidance. Raw material inflation is expected to remain stable in the second half.", "In summary, we expect to deliver sequential improvement to operating margin in each of the next two quarters but the magnitude of improvement will be slightly less than previously expected. We now expect to deliver operating margins of approximately 4% in the second half and approximately 2% for full year.", "I will now discuss our Latin America results in slide 14. Sales for the quarter were $848 million, an increase of 3% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currencies, revenue decreased 1%. Operating profit was $59 million and margin increased 90 basis points versus the prior year.", "Similar to the first quarter, the excellent environment continue to be challenging. We saw further industry declines and raw material inflation had a negative impact of approximately $25 million. However, we were able to expand margins through strong operational performance as we continue to deliver cost productivity and positive price mix.", "On slide 15, our 2017 priorities and expectations for Latin America are unchanged. We continue to expect industry demand for the full year to be flat, the first half declines to be offset by flat demand in the third quarter and solid growth in the fourth quarter. We expect to deliver revenue growth and margin expansion for full year from the continued benefit of brand investments and new product introductions, while remaining focused on strong levels of cost takeout to offset raw material inflation. In total, we continue to expect to deliver 8% to 9% operating margin for full year.", "We now turn to our second quarter results for the Asia region, which are shown on slide 16. Net sales were $358 million versus $363 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Our ongoing operating profit was $8 million and ongoing operating margins were approximately 2%. We delivered exceptional performance across all key measures in India, and have continued to see strong demand growth and favorable economic trends in that country.", "In China, the operating environment continued to be challenging in the second quarter. Raw material inflation for the region negatively impacted margins by approximately $20 million. We also saw high single-digit industry declines, which contributed to elevated competitive pressure and drove unfavorable price mix in China. As you saw in our press release, during the quarter, we recorded an adjustment in our China business, primarily related to trade promotion accruals from prior periods. The impact of this adjustment on GAAP operating profit for our China business was $40 million.", "Turning to slide 17, you will see our 2017 priorities for Asia. We continue to expect flat to 2% industry growth for the region, with strong demand in India offset by industry weakness in China. We expect raw material inflation in China to continue in the second half. We implemented the previously announced cost-based price increase and we're expanding our Whirlpool brand distribution for large retailer, and we are introducing a new lineup of cooking products. As a result of these actions, we expect to improve price mix by the end of the year, although full-year margin impact will still be negative. We now expect to deliver 3% to 4% ongoing operating margins for the year.", "Turning to slide 18, we highlight our first half versus second half operating margin improvement drivers. In the second half, we expect to deliver margin benefits in all regions from cost productivity and seasonally driven volume leverage. We also expect less raw material inflation globally compared to the first half.", "In North America, we expect growth in our business to continue positively impacting our margins, and we expect further price mix benefits from the upcoming global launch of our Whirlpool brand Kitchen Suite. In Europe, we expect to benefit from our simplified brand portfolio and further improvement to product availability, as I discussed earlier, and drive approximately 4% margin in the second half.", "In Latin America, we expect to continue our margin improvement trajectory and we expect to benefit from positive demand in the fourth quarter. Finally, we expect to improve Asia margins sequentially through the price mix actions I discussed earlier.", "On slide 19, we summarize our regional margin guidance goals for the full year. We continue to expect strong margin in North America and Latin America, and we will deliver sequential margin improvement in Europe and Asia in the second half through our target actions, but full-year margins are reduced due to raw material inflation and price mix.", "Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim.", "James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our second quarter results on slide 21.", "Net sales were $5.3 billion and grew 3.3% versus the prior year, in line with both our full year and long-term revenue growth expectations of 3% to 5%. Ongoing EBIT margins declined as strong cost takeout and revenue growth were more than offset by approximately $110 million of elevated raw material inflation and unfavorable price mix, primarily in EMEA and China, compared to the prior year.", "Currency impact to EBIT was approximately flat in the quarter as the Mexican peso and British pound weakness offset Russian ruble and Brazilian real favorability. Also on a GAAP basis, earnings per share were negatively impacted by approximately $90 million in tax expense as compared to the prior-year period due to the timing of our tax planning activities in the prior year. We continue to expect a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 20%.", "Turning to slide 22, I will update our expectations for 2017 EBIT margin drivers. We are now expecting slightly higher negative price mix for the full year. We have experienced negative price mix during the first half of the year in EMEA and China, which we expect to partially offset in the second half of the year. We also now expect slightly higher raw material inflation for the full year.", "However, we continue to expect that our strong cost productivity and restructuring programs will deliver net benefits through our earnings. And we are reducing our forecast for the impact of marketing, technology and product investments. We continue to expect the impact of currency to be flat for the full year. As a result, we now expect our EBIT margin to be flat for the full year.", "On slide 23, we update our expectations for total cost takeout in 2017. Through the second quarter, we have delivered approximately half of our full-year cost takeout goal. We now expect $350 million of raw material cost inflation for the full year, with the majority of this impact having already been absorbed in the first half. We continue to expect approximately $475 million of gross cost takeout for the year. I will provide a few additional details on these productivity initiatives.", "Our complexity reduction initiatives are ongoing, including reducing the number of global product platforms, streamlining our brand portfolio and reducing our SKU count in Europe by more than 40%. As a result, we are improving our supply chain efficiency, inventory positions and ability to realize the purchasing benefits of our industry-leading scale. We also continue to focus on minimizing raw material cost volatility through supplier contracts and commodity hedging.", "On slide 24, we show our updated full-year guidance for 2017. We continue to expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow, and our first half free cash flow improvement of almost $200 million has us on track to delivering that goal. As Jeff discussed earlier, we are adjusting our full-year ongoing earnings guidance to a range of $14.50 to $15 per share to primarily reflect the lower-than-expected price mix and increased raw material inflation.", "On slide 25, we provide an update on our cash flow and capital allocation priorities. During the quarter, we repurchased $200 million of common stock, bringing our year-to-date total to $350 million. Given our confidence in our cash flow generation, yesterday we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. This brings our total available authorization to $2.35 billion. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation.", "Turning to slide 26, we updated our full-year free cash flow improvement drivers. Overall, we are on track to deliver $1 billion for the full year. We now expect to deliver cash earnings growth of approximately $150 million. We continue to expect to generate approximately $250 million in free cash flow through our strong focus on improving working capital efficiency, primarily in Europe and North America. And we expect capital expenditures to be $650 million to $700 million, approximately $25 million more than the prior year.", "Turning to slide 27, we remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy. We are on track to be at our targeted capital structure. We raised our dividend earlier this year to $1.10 per share, and we intend to continue repurchasing shares throughout the rest of the year.", "Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you, Jim. I'll turn to slide 29. Let me start by saying we are confident that we will make meaningful progress towards each of our value creation goals this year. Year-to-date, our revenue growth of 3% is in line with our long-term annual growth target of 3% to 5%. We have very strong actions in place to enable and deliver the second half EBIT margin expansion. And we fully continue to expect strong free cash flow generation and delivering 5% to 6% of net sales by 2018.", "On slide 30, I would just summarize the key messages from our call today. Our North America and Latin America regions continue to perform very well. We do expect revenue growth and margin expansion in both of the regions for the full year. In Europe, despite some challenges that we faced, we delivered sequential operating margin improvements and we believe that our growth, price mix and productivity actions will deliver improved EBIT margins in the second half of the year.", "As a result of our strong first half cash improvement, we remain very confident that we'll deliver our $1 billion of free cash flow this year. More importantly, because of our confidence in ongoing future cash generation, our board has announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $2.350 billion, which represents more than 15% of our current market capitalization. And we plan to use this authorization to continue repurchasing shares throughout the year.", "Finally, I'd like to comment on the important succession news, which we announced last month. As part of our ongoing executive succession process, which is driven and overseen by our board, we announced that I will step down as CEO on October 1. And then our board has elected Marc Bitzer as our new CEO, the eighth in our 106-year history. I would just say that I and our board could not be more pleased about these succession changes, and we're very confident in Marc and in our entire executive team that they'll do a great job in leading our company in the future. And I'm very confident that we'll have a very exciting and value-creating future under Marc's terrific leadership.", "So, for me, after five years of being President and Chief Executive Officer and 13 years of CEO that translates into 72 quarterly earnings call, and so this will be my last one. And beginning in October, we'll turn this over to Marc and Jim.", "So, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your support and confidence and investing in our company. And I look forward to the great future for Whirlpool under Marc's leadership.", "So, with that, I'd like to end our formal remarks and then open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. Jeff, congratulations on a fantastic career and a great tenure. You're leaving the company in better shape than you found it and done a lot to grow it. And, Marc, you got some big shoes to fill.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thanks, Bob.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you, Bob.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "So, for my first question, I'd like to understand how you can bridge from this quarter and current trends you're seeing in the market towards reaching your long-term financial targets. And, Marc, I was hoping you could step me through your action plan to address price mix issues that you're seeing in Europe and Asia.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "So, Bob, it's Marc. So let me, kind of \u2013 particularly, if you talk about the long-term guidance. Let me start region by region. North America, as Jeff pointed out, we're in a very good shape. I think Q2 shaped up very well. As you've seen on the slide 18, our guidance for the second half margin is around 12%, which gets us very close to the margin targets which we communicated in the investor call, i.e., the 12% plus.", "So I think our fundamental view on the long-term dynamics of the North American market have not changed. If at all, I think with Q2 and what we see is current trends just to reconfirm our kind of bullish view on the long-term trends in the North American market and I would say by any definition we're performing very strong.", "On Europe, again, our recovery and the sequential recovery is there, but very frankly it's in Q2 being slightly slow when we're expecting and in Q3 it's also slightly slower than we expected originally, but it's there. So, kind of the exiting margins in Europe, we would say is around 4%. That does not change our 8-percent-plus long-term targets for Europe. And again, that is more a result of \u2013 the outcome of that transition will be a very, very strong cost platform in Europe, and then coupled with a very powerful brand portfolio. It's the integration process which we go through, so it doesn't change our long-term expectations in Europe. And you also know, we've kind of through the currency kind of cycles in Europe, so at least that seems to be stable.", "Latin America, if at all, the investor there would be more bullish. As evidenced in Q1 and Q2, we have very strong operating margins on an EBIT level and on an ongoing level, but even more so internally on what we call the gross margin per product, which are very healthy. So, once the volume comes, and it will come, our Latin America outlook is a very positive one and I have no question and no doubt on the long-term target.", "Also same is true for Asia. India, as you can evidence in Q2 and Q1, it is in very strong position. Our brands are in very strong position and we are, if at all, also even more bullish about the long-term prospects of the Indian market. China is still going through rough waters. I mean, the industry has been down minus 9% year-to-date. Given the size of the China market, can that continue forever, when you talk about our strategic horizon, it's unlikely, but for this year, 2017, we're not overly bullish on the China market.", "And having said that, the market is too big, the penetration growth is still there, particularly outside refrigeration and washer and you're also starting to get into replacement cycle. So it's unlikely that these market trends continue. We obviously have also our own homework to do in terms of how we mitigate raw material trends with price mix action. I call that more an execution as opposed to a strategic challenge. As such our long-term perspective on where we expect the Asia margins to come up has not changed versus Investor Day.", "Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's helpful. Thank you for the detail geographically on the segments. Switching gears a bit, I wanted to ask at a high level what's the potential impact of Amazon's decision to sell Kenmore products on the North American pricing environment and how do you see this effecting industry profitability in the next two to five years?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "And, Bob, let me take this one, and then maybe also Jeff can also add his perspective. As you know, the Kenmore brand is owned by Sears and it's subject to their decision kind of where the brand is being sold. So, in a very short-term, and I know there has been some reports and comments on this one, in the short-term, given that we produce Kenmore and still have a very significant OEM Kenmore business, they're certainly not a negative impact for us, if at all, neutral to even slightly positive.", "In the long-term strategically, I think many things have to be seen. I mean, obviously, they need to be seen how strong the sell-through is on this one. And to what extent it can mitigate the inherent Sears decline. So, I would say from a long-term, a lot has yet to be seen, probably in the second half in terms of how much pick up they actually get. I would say, it's an interesting development. I would not, at all, see this as a negative development for Whirlpool.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Yeah, Bob. This is Jeff. I absolutely \u2013 completely agree with Marc. Short to mid-term, I don't see any good or bad impact for us. Our position is and always has been, we're going to be where customers want to shop. And we're doing that today with the trade partners we deal with. We support their online activities. Our job is to have great brands, great products and deliver.", "Now the second part of this, what to do with the industry profitability, I think we've demonstrated over long periods of time that no matter what the model to the consumer is that we are appropriately represented in the value chain. And consumers will decide how big or how little this is. We will make decisions to make sure we are appropriately represented in the value chain.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Good morning, Jeff, Marc and Jim. And, Jeff, again, best wishes for your next chapter of your life and it's been a pleasure dealing with you for all these years and, Marc, also congratulations, well deserved naming to the new post for you.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thanks, Sam.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you, Sam.", "Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Two questions if I could. The spending cut for the marketing and technology initiatives, it was an eyebrow razor for me. Where specifically is that? Why the decision to do so, particularly to such a significant degree and does this potentially jeopardize the Whirlpool brand launch in the back half of this year?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Sam, I can take this one. And, first of all, I know on the surface as you compare to the earnings slides, it looks like a big number, but let me give you a little bit more detail. One part of our brands, there's a certain timing issue in terms of how much of a brand investment fall into Q4 versus Q1. That has something to do with launch timing. Year-over-year, our brand investments, the pure brand investments, will still be up as a company. So, of course, we continued to stick to our commitment to strengthening the brand. So, one part is more timing between Q4 and Q1.", "The other part is in Medline, our technology investments. One initiative which we didn't talk too much about is, we have reconfigured our entire product development cycle from which with the same or better output we actually have reduced engineering and capital expenditures. That is actually a good thing. So, in a certain way, we get more for less. We didn't talk too much about it, but that's also behind this one, and frankly that is very well on track and that's why we feel very confident that with even increased output from product development we don't have to invest exactly the same dollars.", "Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "And then the final question I would have, can you help quantify the efforts to clear out the inventory in the UK? Can you help quantify what the impact is on margins, both in the second quarter and the back half? I'm trying to parse that out separately from what's happening in the legacy business.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Yeah. And, Sam, first of all to clarify, again, it's Marc, it's not just UK, it's on the European level. As we explained in Q1 and also in Investor Day, as part of integration we offer initially 12,000 SKUs, we bring that down to 5,500 or 6,000 SKUs and we basically had to change about 90% of SKUs. As you go through that change process in a very short time period, no matter how well you plan your production plans you have, by definition, obsolete inventory, just by definition it's not miss-plan, it's just by definition.", "And given that we don't want to carry the inventory too long and also with our strong focus in cash flow, frankly, internally we put a lot of pressure on the European team to kind of sell that out as quickly as possible. So, yes, it impacted the first half in margins and it will also impact the second half to a slightly lesser extent, because we burned through a lot of that obsolete inventory. I can't give you the precise number, but I think just the pure impact of burning through that inventory probably in first half was about $10 million or more in terms of margin impact.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and Jeff, great working with you, congrats. Look forward to the next step. And Marc looking forward to working with you as well.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you.", "Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "So, on North America, volume growth has been pretty strong in excess of, obviously, the industry data and it seems like, as you commented, you guys have been gaining share. Can you talk specifically about either who that share is coming from, how you're going about gaining share, should we expect that the share gains lessen in the back half of the year as the Koreans actually have product that they're able to bring into the market after their product transition, or their facility transition? I just want to better understand what are the drivers of your ability to see such high volume levels.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Sam, it's Marc. Let me actually first start with our usual boilerplate answer, but the industry sell-in growth is not exactly comparable to the sellout in our overall unit numbers. I mean, we say that's been our market share, it's not so favorable and we say that also has been our market share is favorable. And what I mean with that, we are internally more focused on the sellout and we're also internally more focused on the entire quality trough sellout.", "Having said that, we feel very good about where we are on the sellout number as also reflected in the sell-in market share gains. There is no one single product category which would stand out from a market share. But, frankly, compared \u2013 and that's probably the biggest change with 2016, we regained some share also in laundry. Our laundry business, as you know, was under pressure, was injured by foreign imports. We see the supply chain challenges and we also see maybe some results of early antidumping actions in the announcement. But I also want to clarify, it is absolutely not only constrained or contained to the laundry category. It's across the board. We're very pleased with our refrigeration and cooking products, and we're very bullish about the Whirlpool brand suite which comes in Q4.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "I'd only add to that is, our brand portfolio is really delivering. Again, Maytag and KitchenAid are the fastest growing brands in the market and Whirlpool continues to be the largest. And so that coupled with great products, to Marc's point, it's spread across our entire business.", "Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "All right. And then maybe just on Asia given the profit weakness there, Marc, you commented that there was elevated competitive pressures and recognizing that margins are going to be down in the second half versus the first half. And you commented that in the long-term you expect to get back to some long-term average. But trying to understand what, \"long-term\" means and how long these competitive pressures are going to last for you guys because it is a pretty sizeable reversal in that segment? Thanks.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Sam, and again, first of all, on Asia, as I explained also at investor call, Asia is largely India and China. So, to simply, yes, there is also some other business in there but it's largely India and China. India had a very strong Q2 and India where, as I said before, we're very bullish about the long-term trends and our market share gains.", "China was a combination of, I would say, actually three elements. One, it's the industry decline which was minus 9% on the Q2 until May. It's hard to read what will happen in the back half, but I would not expect industry growth on a full-year base in China and that's also what is embedded in our guidance so it's probably depressed on the full-year base.", "Then you have the other element, which is raw material, maybe not in absolute dollar numbers but as a percentage of sales, we had the biggest impact of raw materials in China but it's partially due to the more short-term nature of raw material swings in China compared to other regions. And so we saw a huge increase in RMI in Q1 and partially Q2 and right now, I would say, there's uncertainty about the RMI. That's the one thing.", "And the other thing is, we have not been able to mitigate that through pricing actions. We have implemented something now, we announced it, but frankly, in the first half the traction was below where we should be given the raw material trend. So I would say that's the China situation.", "Now the question is to what extent can we address it. We have announced a price increase and we're driving hard to kind of make sure that this price increase, which we already announced, finds the traction in the marketplace. On the raw materials, probably as we are going towards the end of the year, we expect more stabilization but we expect it still to be slightly elevated in Q3 if the early signs point to more normalization in Q4. So, I would say, as we enter 2018, we should see more margin run rate for Asia in total, which we're getting closer and more on track towards our long-term margin goals there.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, and I'd also like to add my congrats to Jeff and Marc. Well done on both accounts.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you, Mike.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "My first question is on Europe, and obviously you've had great success in North America and there's been different structural problems there over the years, and you've been able to \u2013 I mean, it's still a lot of, let's say, at points, structural industry challenges in North America, given some of the competition, you've been able to turn that into a very profitable business over time.", "So, when you think about Europe, you made the acquisition and very quickly as things were doing well, you got that line of sight to an 8% margin. Obviously, there's a lot of challenges right now. I was hoping you could kind of walk me through what gets you from flat in the second quarter to up 4% margin in the back half? And then, going from the back half of 4%, what's the path to 8%?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "So, Mike, it's Marc. So, first of all, on the European margin, again first of all, keep in mind, we were already last year more in 3% or 4% margin levels. So, we're not talking about levels which we have not already achieved post integration. Q1 and Q2 were significantly impacted by the cumulative effect of a number of integration complexities, largely driven by the SAP introduction. And I think we explained that in Q1 and the earnings call.", "So I would say a big part of the second half improvement is just the absence of system unavailability issues, which we encountered in the first half. So, as such, I wouldn't describe the back half margin as spectacular, because that's pretty much the run rate which we had last year. Then we had already the impact of the currency of UK already in the numbers. So, the year-over-year comparison is \u2013 from back half it is not so completely different from last year. So, again, it's the system stabilization around product availability, which we know is, every month, going better. I also indicated during the investor meeting that we had our very important go-live in Poland in July, that went successful. So, we know that's largely behind us. So that makes a big difference.", "On top of that, we see kind of every month, we see continued progress on price margin, on a full-year basis, it will still be down and that's what we indicated. On a sequential base, we're getting better on this one. So, I would say, the combination of more solid top line, not growth, but a solid top line, better margin realization, and frankly also continued progress on cost productivity, that gives us some confidence about the back half margins.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, I appreciate that Marc. And I guess, that kind of gets you to the back half margins. And I'm just curious about the path to 8%. But the second question, also you talk about, I believe earlier on, different actions you're trying to take to offset the raw materials. At the same time I think, you reiterated your total cost takeout. And it looks like the other big movement here is price mix, obviously, in China and Europe.", "So, what kind of gets you back, are there actions that you're taking in the back half of the year so that perhaps going into 2018 that price mix would then get back to even to slightly positive, potentially? I noticed you're taking some price actions in China. But just trying to get a sense of kind of as you look at kind of the incremental challenges here that you're facing, what gets you back to, let's say, neutral or positive as you go into 2018?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "So, Mike, given that I think your question was referring to the global perspective on these questions. So, first of all, let me answer on the cost side. As Jim also indicated earlier, our gross cost takeout is $475 million, that is consistent this Investor Day, which is the $400 million on kind of ongoing cost and $75 million on restructuring benefits. So that is unchanged, which is on a high level and I would also describe as consistent as our Investor Day. These are the kind of levels plus/minus what you should expect from us on an ongoing base.", "The $350 million raw material, as you also know, beginning of the year we started with $150 million then we felt this more like $300-million-plus and now it's $350 million. If you compare it to our internal forecast, which of course, the full-year outlook, what Jim also indicated and if you do the math, of the $350 million, $210 million is already behind us, roughly $210 million. So, we see that that pressure becoming less and less, which obviously kind of takes some pressure of the margin away. You also need to always keep in mind on the ongoing cost productivity builds through the year. The raw materials will be less impactful and the cost productivity builds better on its own should drive something also as we go into next year.", "Having said that on the price mix and as we indicated in the script, on Europe and Asia in particular, we still have homework to be done on price mix. We initiated actions. I've approved price increase, which we already announced in China and additional actions in Europe. So, I think these are particularly two areas where we still have work in front us on the price mix and we're very committed to this one. And I would say, you will see that coming through in the second half. And as we enter the next year, we should have a pretty good run rate on that.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Michael, this is Jeff. I would just add to that, because \u2013 to Marc's point, we expect to move from, what I would call, operationally challenged issues which negatively impacted our business to more of a stabilization in the second half, which gives us about a 4% run rate return. But your question about 2018, I would say very simply, again, we've got to assess the environment and all that kind of stuff. But the absence of the obsolescence that we're having to clear out, which will be largely done, moving back to what I'd call a normal full availability, there's no question we think this is going to drive growth in mix on a year-over-year basis, because we'll move from these integration issues operationally challenging this to a more normal environment that we're used to operating in. So, I think the big lever you'll see going into next year is growth in mix.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah. Good morning. And Jeff, it's been a pleasure working with you. Congratulations on your retirement. And hope a lot of good things coming your way, still.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you, David.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Can you talk about Latin America and one thing that was kind of interesting was the observation that 3Q will be flat before getting to a better 4Q? Maybe just elaborate a little bit around the extent to which that maybe a function of compares versus things that you see unfolding in the market. And just trying to get a general sense as well, you were talking about positive pricing in that market. I know there's been a number of price initiatives down there. But as the market recovers and foreign exchange begins to come back into balance, does the pricing power down there begin to fade? If you could just talk about a couple those things, and then I have a follow-up.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Yeah. David, let me take this one and maybe Jeff can add also some comments on this one. So, first of all, and I know there's a lot of noise about Latin America market demand, et cetera. We think we have a pretty good perspective on the Brazil market and as you know also in some upper markets in that environment. Brazil, we are confident on a full-year flat base. Having said that, as I indicated, that implies Q3 flat and Q4 up on a significant base.", "To be very transparent, Brazil is a very volatile and erratic market. So, we even in our past numbers we had one week, one direction, the other week the other direction and there's a lot of, as you know, political noise, headlines which immediately impact consumer demand. So, there is uncertainty associated with the demand guidance, but through our best of our knowledge we would still expect a flat on this year.", "What I rather want to point out and you may not see it fully in the numbers, the structural health of our Latin America business is very impressive. Of course, on a top line, given the currencies and volume demand, it is still way off the 2014 numbers. The one number which we typically don't show externally is what we call the variable product cost of product margin, which is actually even better in the 2014 level. So, we're sitting or we're faced with a very, very healthy P&L. Once the volume comes, we will have a very nice and attractive leverage.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Yeah. David, I'd add to Marc's comments. We do believe we're starting to bounce along in the bottom, which is somewhat difficult to see until you start looking backwards, but it feels like we're bouncing at the bottom, so we see some of these monthly gyrations, which is far from our recovery. But to Marc's point, and again relating back to Investor Day, we've been through these emerging market trends in the case of Latin America for 60 years. We have never been in a better position from a market share, margin, fixed cost, structure, product innovation in the marketplace, to come out of this recession stronger than we've ever before than any other recession I've seen.", "So, it's certainly challenging until you start seeing demand going back up. We think we're getting closer and closer to that, but we don't know until we see it. But I would say, given that, we're really happy with where our business is, our position is and where our margins are.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Just as a follow-up, if I could, I wanted to ask you about European business and particularly thinking back to the Indesit days, they generated the majority of their EBIT from the UK and Russia. Can you talk a little bit what you're seeing in your Russian business right now to the extent which similar to your comments on Brazil, do you feel that market is bottomed, and we're in a recovery mode? And if so, what should we be thinking about in terms of the incremental EBIT contribution that's achievable in the European business through that part of it?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Yeah. David, it's Marc. First of all, you're correct and your observation is very right. Indesit had very significant amount of their profits tied, are driven by UK and Russia. I think in the last earnings call I also made reference to that even in 2015, or kind of year-over-year in 2016 on a full-year base our UK profits were in the ballpark of $90 million to $100 million. That is certainly not the case and a very significant portion of that has been eradicated in a certain way.", "We're slowly starting to claw that back, but it's slower frankly than we originally were expecting. Part of that is the difficulty of getting the traction for price increase in the UK, but we're making still progress. So, first in UK, I would still give it to some time until we see that level of profitability back in the business. The encouraging thing is, we see now our market shares being back to pre-Brexit which were significantly impacted after we end up at price increases, so it's starting to stabilize but that's not a short-term full recovery UK.", "Russia is a more, how do I phrase, a more short cycled market. You have more rapid swings up and down in the market demands. We were very pleased with the Russia recovery of the market demand in first half and also a stabilization of a currency. There is a little noise right now because the ruble now starts moving in the other direction, again, but these are the kind of, I would say, swings which we'd always expect from Russia. Having said that Russia is, I would say, on the path of the recovery. I would also clarify, in the 2017 guidance, we have not baked in a lot of optimism on either UK and Russia. I think this is more on the strategic horizon, but not on the 2017 guidance.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "David, I'd only add to that, on Russia, obviously, we have less time with that as it's only been a market that's been open for a little over 20-some years. But the trends in Russia are unsimilar than Brazil in the sense that whatever they cycle, the recovery has been better than the previous high. And we have no reason to believe that won't continue, the two bigger, to Marc's point, the bigger factors there that we watch obviously are price of oil and the political factors. But given all that, it is recovery. We have a very strong position, to Marc's point. And we do believe that Russia or that market will recover as well, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly when.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is Jason Oss (49:12) on for Kurt Nagle. Thank you for taking my question, and I'd also like to add my congratulations to Marc and Jeff.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thanks, Jason (49:19).", "Unknown Speaker", "So my question is focused on volumes in North America. They came in a lot stronger than we hadn't expected and then also relative to the industry. I know that it's not apples-to-apples with the AHAM data, but maybe you could help us bridge the gap for this quarter compared to industry. And then I also have a follow-up.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Jason (49:40), it's Marc. First of all, the T6 industry AHAM in Q2 was 5.2%. Obviously, our total volume growth was quite a bit above that. Again, keep in mind, we have also Canada and Mexico in there, which we had in both countries actually pretty strong performance. And we have obviously products outside T6 and we also have a KitchenAid small domestic. In my prepared remarks, I indicated that the KitchenAid small domestic had a very strong quarter. So, there is a significant volume portion also of that growth coming from KitchenAid SDA. Having said that, even on apples-to-apples comparison on the T6, our volume growth outpaced that 5.2%. I would call it high single digits without getting too much on the details. So we outperformed the market even in the core majors, and in addition we got tailwind from SDA, Canada and Mexico.", "Unknown Speaker", "Thank you. And then for my follow-up, could you give us an update on how, for the quarter, the retail versus the builder channels performed in North America?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Jason (50:44), again it's Marc. I mean, it's a little bit back to comments which we made in other meetings, it's only one, a portion of a builder channel is captured in call it the national build, the direct business. There's a big amount of builder business going through the home improvement channel. So that's why when people refer to builder, it shows up in two different channels, the direct channel and the home improvement channel. I would still argue the total builder business is in line with market or slightly ahead of market. And I know there's sometimes a little bit stop and go in the statistics about housing starts and existing home sales. The long-term trends and even this year's trends were still pretty positive, and I would say the builder market in total is ahead of the total AHAM shipments.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Good morning, Susan.", "Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "I want to go back to sort of the Amazon-Kenmore situation and just perhaps get a bit more color there. Can you talk to the current magnitude of your online sales and maybe just give us some sense of your ability to operate within that kind of channel. And with this announcement, have you seen any change in your appetite or the way that you're ultimately thinking about perhaps getting into this and selling more through this way to the consumer?", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Susan, it's Marc. So, let me try to put it maybe in a global context also and then a little bit more North America. The North America online market in appliance is a little bit peculiar relative to the rest of the world. In rest of the world you have, in some parts of the world fairly, A, the online transactions are actually higher than typically in North America; two, you have a lot more pure players on the online market. You see that very strongly in UK, you see that in China, et cetera.", "North America is, the online transactions tend to be lower than rest of the world and whereas largely, I would say, 95% today it's, what we call, bricks and clicks, i.e., it's the existing trade partners who have successful online channels. So, call it our online presence in the market is largely via the existing trade partners which we have, i.e., would it be Lowe's, Home Depot, or Sears and other ones. That's where our online presence is.", "On majors, the Whirlpool branded products are not sold in Amazon. We do have a fairly sizeable KitchenAid small domestic business on the Amazon site. To put it in a little bit of context. And that's why I also said earlier Kenmore at Amazon is right now, I would say, is a neutral to even short-term slightly positive for us. And I think it needs to be seen how that finds traction in the marketplace. I think it's an interesting development and strategically there could be an interesting aspect for us, but again it's too early to judge it yet.", "Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. And so, it sounds like you haven't really seen any response from your traditional kind of retail partners with this news. They're continuing to partner with you and kind of work on their strategies.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Yeah...", "Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Yeah. We haven't seen any abnormal reaction. As you know, the U.S. retail market is a very competitive market, highly competitive with very efficient and strong players, and they have fairly strong online businesses. So as such, we haven't seen any changes and frankly I don't expect a short-term change.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ken Zener of KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations to both of you.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you, Ken.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thanks, Ken.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "So, can you talk to why raw material was so pronounced now versus 1Q? And to prod you on, it sounds like it was actually more of an inability to get price versus actually a change in raw material costs. So, I kind of want to see if that's correct. And can you discuss the contract in China, why it wasn't more of an emerging market issue, dollar costs, the terms tend to be shorter, but it seems to be China and not other emerging markets.", "And then in Europe, so it was mostly UK, again dollar denominated, but it seems like it might be the absence of price realization. So, can you talk about that actual raw material increase versus 1Q because it seemed to be really sharp in terms of happening very quickly this quarter as opposed to something rolling in, and if it's really just that price mix issue versus raw material inflation.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "So, Ken, it's Marc. I think you have multiple questions embedded in one question.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "You're correct.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "So, let me try to sort it out. Let me first talk about the raw materials in total and then specifically. The raw materials, as we indicated, we started the year thinking it will be around $150 million. Then in the last earnings call, that's where we had to say, $300-million-plus. And now we see it kind of stabilizing around $350 million. So that's pretty much where we are. The big move in particular from $150 million to $300 million, largely came from the plastics, (56:03) et cetera, all these ones, which as I indicated in Q1, these are contracts which can't set up on a full-year basis. So, these are typically quarterly or sometimes in spot contracts, where you're just much more exposed to short-term moves.", "We also said, we saw Q1 and to some extent Q2, plastics prices which were significantly elevated in the outset what you would expect from a normal demand supply in terms if you look at input factors. The reason why we see it now stabilizing is, very honestly, the plastic prices have come down a lot in June, July and we see it kind of pretty much hovering about at stable level, certainly not in an elevated level.", "We have a big component, which is big in terms of magnitude but didn't cause a huge surprise is steel. Steel, we knew coming into the year, is elevated. And there were particularly two factors which were on the high side of our original expectation. One was China, because in China prices moved up very quickly. And the other part was in North America steel prices, which and maybe versus speculative element in there around the Section 232. We clearly see the North America steel prices above where you would expect from raw material input costs in the demand side. And there is still on, I would say, stubbornly high levels compared to the rest of the world in steel prices.", "So you take these two factors together, that's why we can right now see the $350 million. But frankly, the last weeks and for the last two months, we didn't see a big move in terms of our expectation. Right now, it seems to be fairly stable and also what I want to point out again is, there is a majority of raw material costs are already behind us. The $210 million of the $350 million is behind us. And in particular, as you get more to Q4, it gets to a more normal run rate.", "Now to your other part of the question, yes, it is correct, we have not been able in some reason to fully offset and mitigate that through price mix. That's what I communicated in the prepared script, but particularly in Europe, where it's both raw materials and still some currencies in UK and China, where we have not been able to fully mitigate it.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "So, we'll take one more question.", "Operator", "We'll take a question from Megan McGrath of MKM Partners. Your line is open.", "Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC", "Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones here. You mentioned the Whirlpool launch in the back half of the year. So, I wanted to get any detail you can give us, generally speaking, on how we should think about the product launch cycle, maybe over the next, however, you feel comfortable, 6 to 12 months?", "And then Marc, the follow up is, you sort of off-handedly mentioned possible progress in terms of the pricing environment, in terms of antidumping, maybe if you could give a bit more color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Yeah. Megan, it's Marc. I mean, obviously, to give you a perspective about our product launch, the next six to eight months we need more than the two minutes which we have left. I mean, in the broader context, as we showed in the Investor Day, we have a very, very strong pipeline and we feel very good about the pipeline which we have.", "The Whirlpool Kitchen Suite is a big deal. So, yes, it's part of a normal product pipeline, but it's a single event, it's a significant one because it impacts all Whirlpool kitchen products. It's a full suite, which will be launched in the course of Q4 and Q1. So that is a big deal, it's also a big deal because it's a, I would say, the first inroad into the mass IoT markets, because we bring connected kitchen suites to the mass markets. So it's significant.", "Again, as we indicated, it's a Q4/Q1. Obviously, as you roll out Kitchen Suite throughout the country, which is a big effort because you have to basically \u2013 it's a significant stall element also in there. But as such, I mean you should also, on a forward base, this is not that our pipeline is dry afterwards, we feel very good about what's coming in 2018 on refrigeration, there's a very significant frontload project for North America in 2018, so we feel very good about what we have in the pipeline. So that's on this part.", "Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.", "And on trade, as we announced, I believe it was late May, we've been involved quite a bit particularly on washing machine dumping in the United States where we've won the last two cases. But the companies that are dumping keep moving production, called country-hopping. We did file under Section 201 of the Trade Act, what we called a safeguard case, which is being worked with the ITC. There is a timeline for that, which we expect to be their final conclusion late in the fall. And based on a positive outcome of that that will go to the administration for a recommendation on how to address this.", "So, as I said then and I'll say now, we wouldn't have filed this if we weren't very positive about it. The law absolutely supports what we're doing based on the facts and we're continuing to work the process.", "So with that, again let me just sum up today. Thank you for joining us. Again, some challenges in the first half of the year, yet we're making great progress. We do expect to, again, have another record year here at Whirlpool. And we've got a number of activities going on, which we think will take place in the third and fourth quarter to get us back on track.", "So with that, we're going to conclude the call. Thank you for joining us, and Marc and Jim will be here to talk to you next time. Thank you.", "Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you.", "James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's Whirlpool Corporation's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Call.

Today's call is being recorded.", "For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.", "Max Tunnicliff", "Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpool.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 2 of the presentation.", "Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Bitzer", "Well thanks, and good morning everyone. On Slide 5 you will see the highlights of this quarter. As we noted in our press release, in the third quarter we delivered revenue growth in line with our long-term goals and delivered free cash flow improvements versus the prior year, primarily driven by strong working capital improvements.", "Our GAAP earnings increased $0.62 above last year and our ongoing earnings per share of a $3.83 compared to $3.66 in the prior year an increase of 5%. Our global operating margins were negatively impacted by two items, significant raw material inflation and price mix weakness including a slow progress on our European integration.", "In response to these challenges, we are announcing strong actions to put us back on track to deliver our long-term goals. We will be executing a series of recently announced Global cost based price increases throughout the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018 to fully offset the impact of the sustained global raw material inflation.", "The price increases are expected to impact more than half of our business. We are also announcing a new cost takeout initiatives which will further streamline our global fixed cost base. This initiative primarily impact our overhead costs including salary headcount and third-party services and is an addition to our ongoing cost productivity programs.", "Finally, we remain confident in the strength of our free cash flow and repurchased $200 million of common stock this quarter, which brings our year-to-date repurchases to $550 million or $125 million above sustained prior year period.", "Turning to Slide 6, we show our third quarter financial results as they relate to our long-term goals. We delivered revenue growth of more than 3% during the quarter and in consistent with our prior expectations we expect to deliver full-year revenue growth in line with our long-term target of 3% to 5%.", "EBIT margins were 6.6%, a decline of 80 basis points compared to the same prior year period driven by raw material inflation and price mixed weakness. We now expected to deliver EBIT margin of 6.5% both full-year due to slight increased raw material cost expectation and second half price mix challenges.", "Free cash flow improved by approximately 120 million throughout the third quarter as we continue to focus on inventory optimization. We now expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $900 million this year due to lower earnings than previously anticipated.", "On Slide 7, we show drivers of third quarter margin performance. Price mix negatively impacted margins by approximately 150 basis points compared to the prior year and was partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of margin contribution from cost takeout. I will provide more detail on these items on the next two slides. Finally, currency was a slight headwind during this quarter due to British pound weakness versus the euro.", "Turning to Slide 8, we will provide more detail on our price mix performance and expectation. In total, third quarter price mix was unfavorable by 150 basis points. Our North America region delivered flat price mix during the quarter and we continued to expect the full-year impact to be slightly negative in that region.", "Price mix in Europe was unfavorable during the quarter, as we continued reducing our obsolete inventory related to brand transition, which was compounded by currency related pricing pressure in the UK. We continue to expect that price mix in Europe will be unfavorable for full-year due to these challenges.", "In Latin America, the investor in Brazil shifted toward washer and away from refrigeration in the quarter, which had an unfavorable impact of price mix. However, we believe it represents a very temporary shift primarily impacting the third quarter and we continue to expect favorable full-year price mix in Latin America.", "We also continue to experience significant price mix pressure in China, primarily due to investor weakness and related promotion intensity. We expect this pressure from China to negatively impact our full-year marks in Asia, despite very strong performance in India.", "Overall, price mix has been a challenge for us this year and we have initiated strong actions to reverse that trend in 2018. We recently announced new global cost base pricing to offset the continuous impact of raw material inflation. This initiative effect our major appliance business across all regions and is expected to impacting more than half of our total company revenue.", "We have already announced price increase in a number of key countries including United States, Brazil, most of Europe, and China. These price increases do not impact our laundry business in U.S., but we will continue to monitor the pending trade action covering washers and take appropriate steps to manage the business.", "Turning to Slide 9, we provide more details on our cost takeout performance and expectation. During the third quarter, we delivered approximately $100 million of cost productivity and approximately 25 million of restructuring benefit. These benefit offset approximately 75 million of raw material inflation.", "Net cost takeout contributed approximately 100 basis points for our EBIT margin for the quarter as productivity was slightly lower than initially anticipated. Going forward, we expect to deliver approximately 350 million of cost productivity in 2017 as slow progress in Europe and volume weakness in China result in 50 million less productivity for full-year. We now expect that approximately $375 million of raw material inflation this year and approximately $600 million of combined raw material inflation of 2017 and 2018.", "As a result, in addition to our pricing action, we have announced a new $150 million fixed cost reduction initiative. This initiative primarily impact our overhead cost including salary headcount and third-party services. This is set separate from and in addition to our ongoing cost productivity program which we will continue to utilize going forward as a catalyst for margin expansion.", "With that, I would like to turn it over to Jim Peters to review our region and financial results.", "James Peters", "Thanks, Marc and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 11, we review the third quarter results for our North America region. Net sales were $3 billion an increase of 5% versus the prior year. This growth was driven by continued market share gain and industry growth in the U.S. as well as strong performance in Canada.", "We reported solid margins of 11.7% for the quarter in line with our full-year guidance of 11.5% to 12%. Compared to the prior year, margins were impacted by elevated raw material inflation of approximately $30 million which resulted in an unfavorable margin impact of approximately 90 basis points. We were able to offset the majority of that impact through a continued focus on cost productivity and unit volume growth.", "Through the third quarter, the U.S. industry is growing 3.5% compared to the prior year, which is in line with our expectation and we expect strong fourth quarter industry growth. We continue to expect 4% to 6% growth for the full-year and currently see the industry trending to the lower end of that range.", "We are pleased with our North America performance in the third quarter and we are confident in the underlying strength of our business. We expect to deliver the lower end of our full-year margin goals to 11.5% to 12%.", "On Slide 12, we review the third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales were $1.3 billion down 4% versus the prior year. We delivered sequential operating profit improvement of $11 million as product availability and overall system stabilization continue to improve.", "Compared to the prior year, our operating margins were negatively impacted by approximately $20 million of raw material inflation which impacted margins by approximately 150 basis points. We also experienced unfavorable currency of approximately $10 million. Our [indiscernible] integration efforts are progressing slowly.", "In particular, we continue to focus on reducing our inventory levels, which continues to be elevated as a result of product transition. For the full-year, we now expect to deliver 0.5% operating margin due to larger than expected currency and raw material headwind and the impact of the ongoing integration. We have taken steps this year to ensure that the vast majority of our brand transition and supply chain challenges are behind us as we enter 2018.", "Turning to Slide 13, we have reviewed the third quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales were $849 million, an increase of 6% versus the prior year. Operating profit was $53 million and margins increased 50 basis points versus the prior year.", "For the first time in more than a year we saw industry growth in Brazil in line with our expectations. this growth was primarily in washers which created price mix pressure on our margin. We also experienced $15 million of raw material inflation which impacted our margins by 175 basis points. Despite these challenges we expanded margins to strong operational performance.", "We continue to expect the industry to be flat for the full-year as the industry is starting to show signs of growth in Brazil and we remain confident that we are well positioned to benefit from manufacturing leverage and drive further margin improvement as the industry volumes begins to return. We now expect to deliver 7% operating margin for the full-year reflecting the impact of unfavorable price mix in the second half.", "We now turn to the third quarter results of our Asia region, which are shown on Slide 14. Net sales were $357 million versus $338 million in the prior year period. Operating profit of $2 million and operating margins were 0.6%. We delivered record performance in India with very strong levels of growth, continued market share gain and market expansion.", "We continue to benefit from demand growth and favorable demographic and we are well positioned for continued success in India. Raw material inflation of approximately $10 million negatively impacted margins by approximately 275 basis points in the quarter. Majority of that impact was on our Chinese business.", "Price mix remain challenging directly related to continued demand weakness in China. We continue to expect flat to 2% industry growth for full-year with favorable demand in India offset by significant weakness in China.", "We continue to expect margins to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter, but our exit rate in Asia will be below our prior expectation. We now expect to deliver 2.5% ongoing operating margin for the year.", "Turning to Slide 16, we review our updated guidance assumption. We are revising our ongoing EBIT margin guidance for approximately 6.5%. We now expect our full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 15%.", "Overall, we now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $13.60 to $13.90 per share. We are also adjusting our full-year free cash flow guidance to approximately $900 million driven by lower earnings than previously expected.", "Turning to Slide 17, we detailed drivers of our updated free cash flow guidance. We are making progress as expected on working capital and we now expect to generate approximately $300 million in free cash flow through our working capital initiative.", "On Slide 18, we provide an update on our cash flow and capital allocation priority. We continued our share purchase program in year-to-date of repurchase $550 million, a $125 million increase over the same prior year period.", "The strength of our balance sheet and more than $2 billion share we purchased authorization has provided ample of flexibility to execute share buyback and we intend to continue repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter at a similar rate for recent quarter while remaining committed to our balanced approach to capital allocation.", "Now, I would like to turn it back over to Marc.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks Jim. Turning to Slide 20. I would like to recap our progress towards each of our 2017 business priority. Our year-to-date revenue growth is in line with our long-term goal; however our margins have been below our expectations this year and we continued to deliver significant free cash flow improvement remain full impact to deliver 90% free cash flow conversion.", "This is my first earnings call as CEO and in light of this quarter\u2019s results, I want to take a moment to step back and discuss my cooperating principles. I\u2019m proud to have been part of this management team for several years and while I don\u2019t expect to make radical changes, I\u2019m not satisfied of our performance or predictability this year.", "As a global company, there are macro factors which impact our business that we can\u2019t control, we will prepare for them while ensuring to remained focus on within our control, [indiscernible] cost, productivity and price mix plus innovation remains core of our company.", "We will continue to make great products that consumers want to buy, and will continue to fully invest in our strong brands and products. And we strive for increased accountability and speed as we execute our priorities.", "And as a management team, we will execute the strategic and tactical actions necessary to create long-term value remain firmly committed to achieve our long-term goals, and in particular of our long-term value creation goals we presented to you in April.", "Now, I would like to end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael Rehaut", "Thanks, good morning everyone, and quite a first quarter conference call for you Marc. It's going to be little rocky I guess near-term. First question, you might have seen there is news out this morning that Sears discontinuing to sell Whirlpool appliances, and it appears through the press it's related to pricing dispute which intern appears to perhaps being to be related to the price increases that you have just announced I'm assuming.", "I was wondering if you could discuss couple of things on this. Number one, there is a lot of questions out there around roughly what Whirlpool's branded exposure is to Sears? And secondly. maybe if you take a on a broader basis, the confidence that you have in your ability to implement and realize these price increases over the next couple of quarters?", "Marc Bitzer", "Michael, let me give the answer in two sections, Sears and the broad pricing one. Obviously we have seen the article in Wallstreet Journal and we don't get into the details of the reasons why. What we can say is that in line with our contractual obligations, we did inform Sears in May that we would no longer supply Whirlpool branded products. As we simply we could not reach terms that were acceptable to both parties.", "Now just to avoid any confusion, we are continue to supply 10 more branded products to Sears and this applies fully to our branded business. To give you a perspective of magnitude, the entire Sears business has declined overtime and now represents about 3% of our global business, of which the branded portion is only the small fraction and I will give you a little bit perspective on this one.", "Now let me make a broader comment on the price increases. As I said in the prepared remarks, it is our intention to fully recover raw material cost increases over two years with the price increase which was just announced. The reason why we are confident behind this one, we have done in the past cost based price increases whenever we are faced with the significant material headwinds.", "Particularly in market like U.S. and Brazil, we have been very successful and the sustained commitment, the sustained drive we are executing now what we have just recently announced. We have full confidence in the price increase we have experienced and we have experienced team in both U.S., Brazil and other markets which can drive that makes us more confident.", "Michael Rehaut", "Thank you, Marc I appreciate that. I'm going to shift to another area and I'm sure there will be other follow-ups on Sears. Just shifting to Europe for a moment, obviously another area of challenge for the company and very slight improvement sequentially over the last few quarters, but obviously well below what you are looking for.", "I noticed that you raised your working capital cash flow and I'm curious if part of the near-term pain in turning this around is due to perhaps an acceleration of some of the excess inventory in the channel that you referred to last quarter in terms of skew rationalization et cetera and how to think about where you are in this process and if this is a one or two quarter fix or is this a one or two year fix?", "James Peters", "Yes, Michael and this is Jim. I think first off your assumption is correct that in Q3, we still did feel the impact of our product transitions and our reduction of inventory as we have moved through those. Additionally, within the third quarter obviously we had weak demand in the UK and currency impact as well as inflated of raw material prices you know we talk about.", "So if you look at the actions we have implemented, again we will be through the inventory reduction by the end of this year within - we are implementing price increases there right now that we have talked about and then we are driving fixed cost takeout. So I think in the near next couple of quarters, near-term that will begin to improve the margin and continue the margin expansion quarter-over-quarter rate that we have seen in fact accelerate that rate.", "Marc Bitzer", "And Michael, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe in addition to Jim\u2019s comment. First of all, we did sequentially improve our margins in Europe, and we will also going forward. Having said that, we are not pleased with the pace of our progress and we would have expected more. You are absolutely right that the obsolete inventory is a key factor.", "To put then in perspective, a year ago, we had roughly 12000 different SPUs in Europe, today we have 7000 and in that process we pretty much changed 80% of all SPUs which were sold. So of course, we want to sell the obsolete inventory as quick as possible and don\u2019t want to carry that inventory, that has a significant impact.", "The other impact is still we are not pleased with the progress of our UK pricing execution and that is something which we are addressing this different intensity, but these are the key drivers, the progress is there, but slow than we anticipated.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Samuel Eisner from Goldman Sachs.", "Samuel Eisner", "Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So maybe sticking with the UK pricing story, I mean [indiscernible] certainly continued to the value fear and so perhaps you can talk about the competitive dynamics with our [indiscernible] in that marking, how positive you are and actually getting these price increase, I know you guys try to kind of reduce the regain mechanism, but how intense is the competition, is it as fierce as it is in North America with the Korea just maybe an overall kind of update on what you are seeing in that market?", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam, its Marc. So I\u2019m obviously not trying to speculate about what the competitive might do or will do. I can comment on what we have been doing, what we are seeing from a marketplace. Obviously this British pound now sliding, there is some up and down over 50 [months] (Ph). Whatever we first put out as price increase clearly what not sufficient, because the pound has sort of deteriorated and we can speculate about British pound may do going forward. But it is clear that the first increases were not remote enough to cover this at the same slide of British pound.", "That\u2019s why we have announced additional price increases, so that is already out in the announcement. What makes for UK market is somewhat challenging is a very concentrated trade environment and that makes price increase a little bit more challenging. The flip side is we have a very strong brand positioning and that these are [indiscernible] where we can drive it, but of course it needs more effort, competitive dynamic are different than in U.S. we are just a different player. They may have different currency exposures and again I don\u2019t want to speculate about what they might to be doing or not.", "Samuel Eisner", "Alright. And then perhaps transitioning to the tax rate a pretty large delta there of 400 that I think its saving you about $50 million of cash flow for this year. Long-term tax rate for the company is over 20%, so how should we think about the medium term implications of or medium term cash flow for you guys as it relates to taxes. Thanks.", "James Peters", "Yes, and Sam this is Jim. In terms of the tax rate and obviously it's been driven by some of our strategic tax planning things in that. Right now we don't comment on any of the future of that, but we still believe that our longer term rate is in the low 20 some percent around 22% as we have said before and I think from a cash flow perspective that's the best way to think about it, because that's pretty close to what our cash tax rate is.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Wetenhall", "Hey good morning and thanks for the detail. I wanted to ask about pricing. The last time, Whirlpool got a lot of price whereas in 2012 which coincided with a lot of raw material inflation and since then price has been flat to negative on a consistent basis. And so it sounds like going forward, pricing is going to be lynched in towards restoring profitability and margin strength. I wanted to ask on the pricing specifically, if you raise prices, why do you think competitors will follow given the competitive landscape and if they don't how do you intend to protect volumes and market share?", "Marc Bitzer", "Bob, it's Marc. And again obviously we don't want to give any speculations about what competitors might do or will be doing. Let me maybe just step a little bit broader context with a size increase and a first off its raw material increases.", "As we all know coming into the year we were expecting raw material headwinds of $100 million to $150 million which would return to $150 million then $300 million. And then we saw that [indiscernible] is not showing any relief it will be around 350 and not 375.", "What has more changed is our outlook for next year, coming into this year we hinted would have expected significantly less raw material increase for the next year. And by now, we are talking about $600 million for two years, i.e. more than $200 million for next year. So what has really changed is our view of raw material are going to change to a positive in the short-term, and at one point we just got a face reality.", "Now you could argue while it took us a long time to get to this conclusion, but frankly some of the outlook for 2018 has only changed for the last six to eight weeks in particular investments in steels, but also in some other raw materials which are important for us like zinc which has just gone through the roof.", "So we are going up off price increases. I can just judge from the past and again I'm not trying to speculate what is going forward, you referred from a 2011-2012 price increases which were also cost based. It ultimately starts with us [indiscernible] do the right things for us based on our cost situation and that's what we are trying to recover.", "Judging from the past, you need to be prepared to lose some volume from some time. But usually it is not over an extended time period. Again, that is just judging from the past, we got to be seeing what is happening this time, [indiscernible] it was a raw material, it's inescapable to some extent for everybody.", "James Peters", "And Bob, judging from the past too, typically in most cases our margin improvements through these cost based price increases has more than offset any potential volume loss.", "Robert Wetenhall", "Got it. And you guys you have reaffirmed your 2020 financial target. And obviously you have had three consecutive quarters where you have cut guidance. Can you give us some margin walk into 2018 given the fact that recent performance has fallen short of company expectations. What gives you confident both going into 2018 from a margin walk perspective and your long-term objective to 2020 that you can get there given the fact that there is a lot of environmental challenges like RMI and kind of a difficulty integration in Europe whereas this confident coming from given recent performance. Thanks to good luck.", "James Peters", "Yes and thanks Bob and this is Jim. I would say to begin with the first thing that is different from the last time we talked about our margin walk from now until 2020 is that we have announced significant cost based pricing and since then we had deterioration in materials. We now announced the cost based pricing to offset that, which we were planning on offsetting it before just with ongoing cost productivity.", "Additionally, we have announced 150 million of fixed cost takeout on top of our ongoing cost productivity. o these are both new levers that we would include in our walk from where are today to our 2020 10% plus EBIT goal.", "Outside of that, we are confident in the other measures that we have in there and including ongoing cost productivity, our ability to realize margins through pricing mix outside of the price increase and our volume growth that we still believe demand is healthy in many of the markets around the world and there is potential for demand recovery in emerging market.", "Marc Bitzer", "Bob, its Marc. Let me maybe just add all to given that you mentioned our 2020 long-term value creation goals. Jim and myself were both of communicating that in January and then in April when we all met in [Europe] (Ph) that we are fully staying behind this. We have been part of developing this target and we are not going to back off.", "I know given that it\u2019s my first the old call on earnings call, probably will be an easy one put some question marks behind this one, but we don\u2019t. We are fully behind it, we are committed which also means we for next without getting any 2018 guidance. Our entire focus will be on margin expansion and we need to catch up what we lost this year.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Susan Maklari", "Thank you. Good morning. Going back to the Sears topic for a bit. Can you just give us some sense, I know that you said branded is a small portion of the total there and given that they had several months to prepare, but what is the inventory position in that? How quickly shall we think about that actually moving through and how do you think about shifting that volume to your other customers?", "Marc Bitzer", "Susan, its Marc and again as you know we usually don\u2019t want to give too many specific details on our trade relation of trade strategy. Having said that, I said early in the first question from Michael, I said entire Sears business is about 3% of our global revenue base, the branded business is a very small portion of that.", "So in terms of the impact what it means to shifting it, to be honest it\u2019s not a whole up, and that\u2019s the honest answer, relative to our North American business volume, these are volumes which are not a major issue. In terms of your inventory question, again these are Sears specific questions which only Sears can answer, but I think the common known fact that Sears does not hold lot of inventory.", "Susan Maklari", "Okay. And then thinking about 2018 and perhaps some of the changes that could come in terms of the competitive environment, given some other reasons ruling from the government and that that proceeding on. Can you talk to perhaps how quickly do you think you could ramp production in 2018 if demand shifts or if we get contingence there? And what is your ability perhaps as some of the retail side of this shift and granted its very small, but still it is kind of shifting a bit? How do you think about perhaps regaining some of that share and what it could mean for you next year?", "Marc Bitzer", "Susan, its Marc and I presume you are referring to the base competition.", "Susan Maklari", "Yes.", "Marc Bitzer", "And first of all also in broader context, we are pleased this year with the overall North American share gain. We are gaining share, we all expect we will probably on a full-year base gain half a point to full point and we are on track on this one. We have a specific issue where it was being harmed on large residential boxes and that is not a new story we had two dumping cases and we have now a safe guard petition.", "Just to put them in context, and I know many of you are fully aware of this one. It is basically three step process, so the ITC needs the first confirm that there has been a injury and then the ITC devolves or recommends a remedy and finally this is up to the president to determine what the find remedy is.", "We kind of won the very first step which is the determination of injury, what is important is what the four to zero vote. So that is I would say a strong confirmation of we have been injured and it's real. So we are waiting for the recommendation of remedies which will become two steps public, but we will expect this December 4 and then it up to the president to decide.", "So I would say sometime late December or more realistic in January we will know what the final outcome of this one is. And to your question, yes, we are prepared to [indiscernible] volumes on our measures. Obviously if we had injury, [indiscernible] we have ideal capacity and we can expand the capacity and hire people there.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Good morning, Marc, Jim, Max how are you? Just got three very quick housekeeping questions. First off, how much price realization is embedded within the fourth quarter guidance?", "James Peters", "Well right now I would say for the full-year, you should assume that our price mix realization is going to be about minus 1%. So again that's about half a point worse than we were when we did the last earnings call. So that's what you should assume for the full-year.", "Sam Darkatsh", "I'm trying to isolate the price increase announcements that are going into the fourth quarter. How much of a benefit is that anticipated to be specifically in the fourth quarter?", "James Peters", "Okay I'm sorry, I took the question the other direction. Right now as we said most of the price increases have been announced and are implemented late within the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter. So it's going to be a very minimal impact on the fourth quarter.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Got you. And then second question, the raw material look that you gave into 2018, have you already determined your steel contracts for next year, or is that pending or you have decent visibility on that. I'm just trying to get a sense of this sensitivity around the numbers that you gave for next year?", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam it's Marc. No, we have not finalized the contract for next year on steel. This is an early look into 2018. But given what we have seen this year, we spend a little bit more time really trying to get understanding what is been most likely scenario for 2018. It's also ultimately cost based pricing decision. In late January or the earnings call from Q4 that's when we give you all the details the formal raw material outlook. But right now I think we highly likely to assume it will be north of $200 million as a raw material cost increase next year.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Curtis Nagle", "Thanks very much for taking the call. So just wanted to quickly focus on volumes in the U.S. So just as a first question, would you guys be able to comment on what drove weakness in the past couple of months of year so for August and September. And looking forward to 4Q, so you are going to be at the - obviously industry is going to be at the lower end of four to six, that still implies I think something like 6% increase at the low end of this year and [indiscernible] was around 10%. I guess what gives you the confidence that you should see such a big acceleration in the fourth quarter?", "Marc Bitzer", "Yes, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe first of all 4% to 6% guidance, yes but it still intact. Having said that, it will be clearly the lower end of that spectrum, probably more trending towards the 4% as appose to the 6%. The reason why we are confident in that industry forecast is simply to sell out, keeping in mind that the number we referred to in the 4% to 6% that to sell in all the AM statistic, but sellout has been pretty steady also over last couple of weeks and give us confidence to pursue within that range.", "Curtis Nagle", "Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick one on Latin America margin. It looks like in terms of the guide that you given for the year there will be a decline in 4Q, what is behind that?", "James Peters", "Yes, Curtis this is Jim. There is a couple of things, one, obviously we have stated that materials has had a continued pressure there. But the new thing is that the mix within the business in the back half of the year has shifted we think temporarily to more washing and less for refrigeration, which our market share is stronger in refrigeration as well as our margins are stronger in refrigeration. So it\u2019s mainly what we believe is a temporary shift in mix within the industry there.", "Curtis Nagle", "So it\u2019s actually continuation of trend you saw on 3Q, is what you are saying?", "James Peters", "Yes.", "Curtis Nagle", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "David MacGregor", "Yes, good morning everyone. Marc, I wonder as part of you trade case filings you indicated that you were losing money in washers and I guess interested in your though process now that this is starting to take shape and I think starting to look like this may ultimately work in your favor. How should we think about how the outcome here if it\u2019s favorable to your interest would impact washer business and what that could mean to North American margins?", "Marc Bitzer", "Yes. Dave, of course it\u2019s probably too early to speculate about the final outcome, because of course also of magnitude for remedies will have a big impact on that question. Having said that and this has been documented in the ITC hearing we had damages and injuries that we lost money in large residential washers. The question is depending on remedy how much volume we can pick up and how much can we improve our margin. So it\u2019s entirely driven by the amount of revenues which we get, I would say let\u2019s wait until January and then in the earnings call we can give you a better forecast about what would it really means for our washer business.", "David MacGregor", "Does it imply that - I mean if you are losing money there, it\u2019s hard to believe the kind of volume that comes into play here could restore a sufficient level of profitability of that business. It would seem to imply the pricing is necessary, is an outcome of this, is that fair to say?", "Marc Bitzer", "David, we will take the right business actually going through we know we will have a remedy. But even to your point, if you are invest in your product and you put a lot of capital, in fact where you don\u2019t get the right leverage on these capitals that means you lose a lot of margin. So volume leverage depending on the kind of product has a significant impact all from a margin here. But yes, I mean it is true also that extreme promotion intensity by [indiscernible] has created significant damage.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Ken Zener of KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Kenneth Zener", "Good morning, gentleman. So I think the dominant sentiment around your stock has been related to North America yet. Your margin guidance at the lower end this year doesn't really support that. So Europe and execution I think are actually the key determinants of your earnings revisions this year as well as concern certainly in my focus for next year. So to that extent, when you are talking about material inflation, A, I mean is that disproportionate in Europe what we are facing this year in terms of the impact on margins, how would you break that out by region I guess. Can we just assume sales weighted or is there extra headwinds you are facing in Europe related to material cost.", "James Peters", "Well, and Ken this is Jim. I think if you were to look at what we saw within the third quarter here, it's about equal or about relative for EMEA compared to the rest of the globe. The only region that we have seen maybe what is a disproportionate share has been within Asia and within China.", "So I would say materials has been a same proportion. As you mentioned, our bigger steps to improving the margin here begin with the exit - the integration activities and the finalization of many of those activities stabilizing our supply chain which will be in much better shape by the end of 2018 and that's probably are bigger, will drive a bigger expansion of our margin within 2018.", "Kenneth Zener", "Okay. That's obviously the bulk of my questions is going to be around this execution Marc and Jim. The 7% 8% goal you guys gave for 2020 originally and I was just looking at your Analyst Day from 2014, that was supposed to be an 2018 goal. I'm sure you guys recall that. That kind of reminds me [indiscernible] they had this $6 target and they missed it by multiple years and now the company is doing quite well.", "What is happening over in Europe, I mean you knew there was 12,000 components SKUs, 7000 was your goals. Can you just perhaps walk us through, and may be very respectfully just how has the landscape changed today given the results versus let's say six months ago and nine months ago. I mean you must have had a roadmap and where did we take a turn to leave us that 50 basis points margins because that's a biggest driver for next year's earnings. And it's difficult to have a clear view on how that's going to slope up right now in my opinion.", "Marc Bitzer", "Let me maybe take me this one. First of all if you asking today, we are reconfirming that our long-term target for Europe was 7% to 8%. And our European team would exactly give you the same answer. And obviously we are kind of not happy with where we are this year. The reason for this one and Jim alluded to this one is we knew about the integration complexity. And that is a very huge complex undertaking.", "The good thing is I would say 90% of a product platform factory move and brand transition are behind us. From the system side, we have now pretty much 70% behind us. So yes, to some extent, we knew about it, it's I would say the compounding effect of several integrations which make it very difficult.", "Once you add on this one, the challenges which came in particular with UK and Russia which were currency related that just made it too much for the thing. And that's why we have a performance which we have and we are committed to turn it around. I would also want to point to is again we are not getting to give a guide for 2018 and the components. But it's clear that Europe will be an important but certainly not the only live of an improved performance next year.", "Operator", "And we will take a follow-up question from Samuel Eisner, Goldman Sachs.", "Samuel Eisner", "Yes, thanks so much for letting me get back on. Looking into next year and free cash flow, I think you guys have a couple of different things that are impacting, I was hoping to get some color on I think last quarter you talked about moving some investments spending without benefit this year presumably that\u2019s a little bit of a headwind for next year as you roll out the new products suite.", "I don\u2019t know if CapEx would go up if you actually get the right remedy on the ITC ruling and I think you talked about that in the individual ITC ruling that you have projects that you could ultimately do from day one, tax rate implications and then also investments to drive the $150 million of cost out. So I\u2019m curious if you can give any kind of color of how you think about free cash flow to next year given those moving pieces?", "James Peters", "Sam, this is Jim. I think the first thing on free cash flow when we talk about CapEx, we still expect to stay within our longer-term capital allocation guidance range of 3% to 3.5% reinvesting within our business. So even with any projects that spending may have moved on we continue to look for opportunities to be more efficient in our capital spend and we are confident that we will be within that range on a go forward basis.", "Working capital is we have talked about, we believe for next year there is continued opportunities within working capital especially within inventory. As we look around the globe we believe that will be a continuing source not to the level that it was this year, but it will be a continuing source of improved free cash flow.", "And then on the tax rate as I mentioned while our GAAP tax rate for the full-year we expect to be in the 16% range. Our cash tax rate is actually closer to the low 20s at many of times. So I think next year there is not a significant change in terms of the tax rate impact on our free cash flow.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up question from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Yes, hi. Thank you. Two follow-up questions first off, are you still anticipated the $100 million in marketing and brand support spending to come back next year? And then my final question is, productivity looks like it was cut from $400 million to $350 million this year. Was that a timing issue, does that get pushed into 2018, what is the really read on productivity next year? Thanks.", "James Peters", "So Sam, on the marketing and technology spend, again we intend to continue to invest in that area and we will obviously look at the new product launches that we have coming for next year and then we will set the appropriate levels of spend in that area, but we do intend to continue to increase our investments especially in our brands and key market. And then what is the second?", "Marc Bitzer", "Let me first Sam on to clarify the $150 million fixed cost reduction that does not include brand investments and brand support. We keep these eyes separate so this is explicitly related to infrastructure cost. So just to avoid any confusions so this is a our declaration.", "James Peters", "And then on the ongoing cost productivity, right now in the back half of the year that\u2019s we talked about. We did have some increased material headwinds, but then on the ongoing cost productivity as our volumes have been less than we expected in certain markets and we have had to adjust our inventory levels that has had an impact on the volume leverage benefits that we get and additionally there are some opportunities for some of the cost takeout programs that we have that will continue to your question. There are some that we will be ramping up now as Marc mentioned, but these were on top of our ongoing cost productivity and you will start to see the benefits of those more into next year.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up question from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor", "Yes, thanks for taking a follow-up question. Marc, can you talk about share gains in North America and I just wonder if you could elaborate where within the price point, where within the line structure do you think you are winning the bulk of that share?", "Marc Bitzer", "David, it\u2019s Marc. I mean first of all it's pretty much across the business, but we are particularly pleased with the progress which we have on [indiscernible] which as you know is largely in the laundry space. We are very pleased with the progress on the KitchenAid where we have a new kitchen suite out there. So from a branded perspective, that's probably where you see today by long shop of bigger share growth.", "It also implies from where it's sitting giving of a [indiscernible] brand in the world and the kitchen branded fitting. That is I would say mass premium and premium segment. So we are actually very pleased that what we would call internally these are good share gains, that don't come at the low end. These are I mean one of our best branded business which we have and we are very pleased with that.", "David MacGregor", "If I could just quick follow-up. I wanted to just ask you for your question on promotional environment we are seven days away from the beginning of Black Friday, and how do you think that's going to play out versus last year. And then, just when we are talking about promotions, as the Korean manufactures relocates to the North American market with their manufacturing in due course however how long that might ultimately end up being. Does this create a less promotional environment, or more promotional environment. Or if you can just talk about your latest thoughts on in terms of how that shift is likely to impact kind of the competitive environment in U.S. market?", "Marc Bitzer", "So David first of all, I can't speculate about what is happening around the Black Friday period. What we can refer to is Labor Day and Columbus Day that has been a promotional tense periods, but not unlike what we have seen in the last 12 months. So it is kind of the same promotional ups and downs.", "It doesn't change our stands and promotional actions. We participate when it creates value for us and we go into production, so that hasn't changed. But I would say it's the same level of fairly intense promotional environment which we can face and I don't know what that means for the rest of the year.", "With regard to your question about the relocation of - announced relocations, because there is not yet any effect [indiscernible]. And again that's difficult for me to speculate. I would argue given that this obviously has not been their first choice, because their first move to Mexico then to China and then to Vietnam and Thailand.", "I would assume that the cost base is not as attractive for them as it's been in other places, because now where it kind of there will be force to play on a level plain field, that's what it means. So I would say the cost based is probably not as aggressive, but I wouldn't conclude from that that they will change their promotion activities. We got to see that how it all spares out.", "Operator", "This concludes today's Question-and-Answer Session. I would be happy to return the call to Mr. Marc Bitzer for any concluding remarks.", "Marc Bitzer", "Yes. So let me just summarize the key message from this call, and we are back on Slide 22. First of all, we remain on track to our long-term goals for revenue growth and cash flow conversion and we remain committed to return to strong levels of cash to shareholders. Second, we are taking strong actions across all regions to offset the impact of sustained raw material inflation. And finally and most importantly, we remain firmly committed to our 2020 value creation goal which is growth margin, expansion and cash conversion despite a challenging 2017.", "Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you again in January.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded.", "For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.", "Max Tunnicliff", "Thank you and welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available at the Investors section of our website at whirlpool.com.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports. ", "We want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.", "At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks, and good morning everyone. On slide 3 we show our fourth quarter highlights. As you saw in our press release, our Q4 ongoing earnings per share were $4.10 in line with expectations. GAAP earnings were impacted by a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $420 million related to a tax reform. We are pleased that despite continued promotional intensity in many countries, we delivered positive global price mix in the quarter and are positioned well on price mix going into 2018. It was our first quarter with positive global price mix since Q4 2015. ", "We delivered strong margins of 11.8% in our North American region, a 60 basis points improvement. Since last quarter\u2019s announcement, we\u2019ve made significant progress in global price mix and our fixed cost reduction initiatives. These are progressing ahead of expectations and we remain confident they will be a catalyst for margin expansion in 2018. ", "As a testament to the underlying strength of our business, we returned record $1.1 billion to shareholders this year. We repurchased $750 million in common stock and paid more than $300 million in dividends, and we expect to continue returning strong levels of cash in 2018. ", "Before I turn to our financial results, I want to quickly discuss the outcome of our safeguard petition on washers. After nearly a decade of litigation, we are thankful that US government has announced an effective remedy. This decision is a victory for American workers and will enable new manufacturing jobs here in United States, including the [new 200] [ph] jobs we have announced at our Clyde, Ohio manufacturing plant. At this point however it is too early to quantify the financial impact on 2018. But this is without any doubt a positive catalyst for Whirlpool. ", "Now turning to slide 4, we show our financial results as it relates to our long term goals. We delivered revenue growth of approximately 1% during the quarter and a full year growth of 2.6%. Our fourth quarter growth was impacted by weaker demand in the US and certain countries in Europe. ", "Ongoing EBIT margins were 6.6% for the quarter, 70 basis points a bit lower than the same period last year. For the full year we delivered 6.4% ongoing EBIT margin. I will discuss the factors that contributed to our reduced margins on the next slide. ", "Free cash flow was 707 million for the full year, an improvement of nearly $80 million versus the prior year, but below our own expectations. The key reason for softer unexpected free cash flow was elevated inventory as a result of weaker than expected industry demand in the US and several other major countries. ", "I\u2019m confident that the margin recovery actions we\u2019ve taken in 2018 including the actions launched last quarter and a renewed focus on inventory management will deliver significant earnings and free cash flow improvement in the coming years.", "On slide 5, we show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year margin performance. During the quarter, we improved price mix year-over-year. Cost takeout and raw material inflation were in line with expectations, and for the full year we delivered positive net cost take out more than offsetting significant increased raw material inflation. Finally in the fourth quarter we had higher technology and infrastructure expenses compared to the prior year, primarily due to a quarterly timing of certain [indiscernible] and product related expenses. ", "On slide 6, I will discuss our price mix performance in more detail. In total, fourth quarter price mix improved by approximately 50 basis points, compared to the prior year. In North America, we mixed positively towards the cooking category and the KitchenAid brand. In addition we slightly reduced our participation in some Black Friday promotions. ", "For the full year price mix was approximately flat in North America, as our strong exit rate offset unfavorable price mix earlier in the year. In the rest of the world, price mix was unfavorable for the year, primarily due to category demand mix in Latin America and the impact of brand transitions and selling through obsolete inventory in Europe. ", "Overall, we are pleased with our exit rate or price mix and we are confident that the improvement we saw in the fourth quarter will continue through 2018. ", "With that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jim to review our recent financial results. ", "Jim Peters", "Thanks Marc and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 8, we review fourth quarter results for our North America region. Net sales were $3.1 billion, flat to the prior year. The US industry grew below our expectations and we reduced our participation in certain non-value creating holiday promotions in the fourth quarter. While revenue was flat, we are pleased with our performance in North America. ", "Overall margins improved 60 basis points to 11.8%, despite a 75 basis points impact from raw material headwinds. We are confident that we are executing the right actions to deliver significantly improved price mix in the coming year, while maintaining appropriate share positions and driving growth. ", "On slide 9, we review the fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales were $1.4 billion, up 1.5% versus the prior year. Operating profit was 4 million, down versus the prior year. Compared to the prior year, our operating margins were negatively impacted by approximately $20 million of raw material inflation or 150 basis points. ", "We experienced holiday demand below expectations in several key countries. We also experienced unfavorable price mix of approximately $25 million, as we continue to progress through brand transitions partially offset by our pricing actions. ", "As we enter 2018, we are focused on completing our (inaudible) integration and clearing remaining obsolete inventory early in the year. This will likely unfavorably impact our margins during the first half of the year. We expect to ramp up from improved price mix, product availability, and marketing spend efficiency in the second half. ", "Turning to slide 10, we review the fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales were $905 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. Operating profit was $64 million and margins were 7.1%. Raw material inflation impacted margins by approximately $15 million or 150 basis points. Despite these headwinds we delivered solid margins. ", "The industry began to shift back to refrigeration from washers, lessening price mix pressures. Additionally, we realized the favorable impact of selling and monetizing certain tax credits in Brazil. ", "We now turn to the fourth quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on slide 11. Net sales were $333 million compared to $352 million in the prior year period. We recorded an operating loss of $1 million for the quarter and margins were impacted by continued raw material inflation of approximately $10 million. Our results were also impacted by approximately $10 million from a charge related to the revaluation of brand intangibles. ", "Our India business continues to perform well with strong growth, continued market share gains and margin expansion in the quarter. In China, we prioritized price mix improvements, but volumes were negatively impacted as we focused on profitability. ", "Before we turn to 2018 guidance, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we will report and guide our regional results on an earnings before interest and taxes basis starting with Q1 2018. Additionally, as of January 1, 2018, we have realigned our Mexico business as part of our Latin America segment and will shift certain adjacent business from North America segment to the Asia segment. These changes allow us to align with the company\u2019s new leadership reporting structure. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance for 2018. ", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks Jim. Turning to slide 13, we\u2019ll review our guidance assumptions for 2018. We expect to grow revenues in line with our long term goal of 3% to 5%. In addition to our previously announced cost based price increases, we are bringing compelling new product to the market which will have a positive impact to mix. In particular, we are excited about the global launch of our new connected Kitchen Suite, which will be a catalyst for strong volumes and mix in 2018. ", "Finally, we expect to benefit from continued industry growth in many of our major countries including the US and Brazil. We expect to deliver ongoing EBIT margin of approximately 7.5% in 2018, an improvement of 110 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of our EBIT margin guidance on the next slide. ", "We expect earnings growth for margin improvement to generate a majority of our free cash flow growth in 2018, and in addition we expect to generate free cash flow improvement for working capital optimization primarily focused on reducing inventories from the elevated levels we experienced at the end of 2017. Overall, we expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14.50 to $15.50 per share. ", "Turning to slide 14, we show the drivers of our EBIT margin improvement in 2018. We expect approximately $250 million of net benefit from improved price mix as well as a $150 million from our fixed cost reduction initiative. Together we expect this to improve margins by approximately 175 basis points. ", "We will also continue to focus on delivering ongoing cost productivity and expect to deliver approximately $175 million in productivity and another $100 million from restructuring benefits, all of which is incremental to our fixed cos initiatives. ", "The combined impact to deliver 125 basis points margin improvement more than offset in continued raw material inflation which we expect to be approximately $200 million to $250 million higher than the prior year. Finally, we plan to continue investing in our business with increased new product introductions in 2018, including a global connected suite which I mentioned earlier. ", "Now Jim will cover our recent guidance and cash priority for 2018. ", "Jim Peters", "On slide 15, we provide regional industry and EBIT margin guidance for the coming year. We expect low-single digit industry growth in all regions and our businesses will benefit from this growth throughout the world. We also expect to benefit from favorable price mix and strong cost take-outs. As a result, we expect to deliver at least 12% margin in North America in 2018. ", "In EMEA, our margins are expected to expand to approximately 2% through improved price mix and completing the final phases of our brand and product transitions. We expect to improve our margins in Latin America to approximately 7%, as we benefit from industry growth, favorable price mix and continued cost takeout. Finally, we expect to deliver approximately 5% margin in Asia, with continued strong performance in India and improved price mix and cost takeout in China. ", "Before I get to our free cash flow guidance, let me briefly outline our view on the impacts of tax reform. We see the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act as a significant benefit for the competitiveness of US companies and a positive development for consumer demand, and we fully expect the tax reform to have a positive medium and long term impact to Whirlpool. ", "The changes included in the tax act are broad and complex, and there is still potential for changes to provisions and other legislative actions. As a result, our estimates may change as we refine our calculations. Our current tax rate guidance for 2018 is for the mid-20% for both the effective and cash tax rates. We will continue accessing the impact on our tax rates and update you on the first quarter call as necessary. ", "Turning to slide 16, we show the drivers of our improved free cash flow for 2018. We expect to drive the majority of this improvement through stronger cash earnings. We will also continue to focus on working capital optimization, primarily related to our inventory in North America and EMEA. This guidance is inclusive of higher restructuring cash outlays versus 2017 related to our global fixed cost reduction initiative and recently announced closure of a compressor facility in Italy. In total, we expect to drive significantly higher free cash flow in 2018 with conversion of approximately 5% of sales. ", "Turning to slide 17, we show our capital allocation priorities for 2018, which are largely unchanged. We will continue to fully fund our business for growth and be prudent about our capital structure to maintain a strong investment grade rating. We also plan to be balanced in how we return cash to shareholders. ", "We currently have approximately $2 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization and we expect to continue repurchasing this year after repurchasing 750 million of our shares in 2017. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Marc. ", "Marc Bitzer", "Thanks Jim. Turning to slide 18, I would like to review our long term value creation framework. We did not make as much progress on our long term goals in 2017 as expected; however, we do expect that the actions we put in place during the fourth quarter have positioned us to get back on track to those goals this year. We expect to drive growth in line with our goals, positive industry growth, improved product availability in Europe and the global launch of our compelling new Connected Kitchen Suite will be candidate for growth. We also expect to drive significant EBIT margin improvement. ", "Global price mix and our fixed cost reduction initiatives will be the primary catalyst, and we are fully focused on ensuring that these actions are effectively and successfully implemented. To be clear, our primary focus in 2018 is on margin expansion, and we remain committed to achieving our goal of 5% to 6% free cash flow as a percent of net sales this year. ", "Now I will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our questions from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. ", "David MacGregor", "Let me begin with just a question on the European business. You highlighted the negative impact Europe has had on the price mix and called out the obsolete inventory challenge. Now I realize you\u2019re pursuing pricing and there\u2019s product availability issues you\u2019re working on, and you\u2019re also taking a highly cautious stance on your guidance at 2% EBIT margins which is well below our EBIT guidance during your analyst meeting last May. ", "From where you stand today Marc, what exactly do you need to do to deliver on that 8% goal you discussed at your analyst meeting last year. ", "Marc Bitzer", "David, first of all in Q4 in Europe as you saw, we delivered above breakeven, but that\u2019s certainly not where our expectations should be and was. We expected a strong result. There are certain things around promotion and demand which was a little bit weak in key countries like UK and we had in Russia some market places disruption due to consolidation. ", "Having said that at the end of the day 2017 was a setback and we were the first one to admit that. I think with our system integration and complexity and some external challenges, I think we lost about a year or 1.5 on our integration timeline and that\u2019s a reality. Having said that does not change where we strongly believe we can take the business, but we also as evidenced as how some of our competitive performance. So with 8% we still strongly believe in the steady state 2018 will be a year where we complete the integration and then we\u2019re kind of really more in a steady state mode. ", "So I strongly believe that the path to 8% is there. It is achievable as evidenced by the competitors. You call 2% a little bit conservative and very honest our internal targets are more aggressive, but given that we missed them particularly in Europe, several times we took a slightly more conservative stand on the regional guidance. ", "David MacGregor", "That makes sense. So my second question is just regarding innovation. When we speak with almost anyone in the industry today they\u2019ll know the key contributing factor to the success of the Korean manufacturing which has been a proven ability to bring to market product innovations that really capture the consumes attention and for which the consumer is prepared to pay a premium price. ", "Whirlpool is innovation leader, there are many out there that would say that you are the innovation leader. So I guess you are now taking over the leadership of the company that has consistently spent 6% to 7% of its revenues developing innovation, a number that\u2019s now approaching a 1.5 billion a year. I guess my question is, what do you do as the new CEO to achieve a higher level of productivity from that annual investment, so that investors need to rely less in the future on cost reduction and cost productivity to achieve the company\u2019s financial goals. ", "Marc Bitzer", "David that obviously was a very broad question. First of all to clarify the numbers, we invest roughly every year about 600 to 700 million in capital, which is not all new products but a majority goes in products, and we invest roughly in total another 600 million in engineering. So the total, but it\u2019s just different line items. That investment has been steady, with a slight increase, but it\u2019s steady as a percentage of sales. ", "Now we may have referred both in investor day to this and also in earnings calls. We have done a fundamental realignment of our entire product development organization systems and structure, and that was pretty much 1.5 years ago. So we\u2019ve done massive changes and I would say we start seeing the fruits of these changes in terms of our innovation pipeline which is actually very encouraging. ", "But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is a highly competitive market place, and I wouldn\u2019t give the companies you mentioned the credit for innovation, but that\u2019s obvious to me. But it\u2019s a highly competitive market place. So you got to run faster. I think the changes which we\u2019ve done internally on our product development we\u2019re well positioned to drive growth of effectiveness but also the efficiency of these investments. ", "And again it\u2019s just also if you would have walked the CES Show, you see our kitchen suite and what\u2019s happening in that space, I feel we\u2019re very well positioned when it comes to the innovation pipeline. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ", "Susan Maklari", "I wanted to talk a little bit about your North America guidance. On that slide you pointed 2% to 3% industry growth there. And given what we saw in \u201917 you ended up at about 6% in units which is the high end of that range. In the fourth quarter, we did see some shift towards maybe focusing more on price as opposed to volumes. Can you just talk to maybe how you\u2019re thinking about that going into \u201918 and how we should think about these different pieces coming together?", "Jim Peters", "Susan this is Jim and I\u2019ll start off here. As you look at 2018 for North America, we expect our volumes to grow in line or slightly above the industry. And again we will continue to, obviously with the new products we are launching, we expect to continue to gain shares in certain categories. But also we expect to continue our focus on value creating promotions and making sure that any promotions that we participate in are value-creating. So again as I said, overall we believe the unit demand for the industry is stable within the US and we see that our growth will be in line with that and maybe slightly ahead of it. ", "Marc Bitzer", "Susan, it\u2019s Marc, maybe to add to Jim\u2019s point. At the end of the day last year industry in terms of shipment to the trade came in at the low end of our initial guidance or even slightly below. But it was still solid, and essentially we\u2019re signaling the same. We see robust demands in the lower single digits and so it\u2019s a continuation pretty much of focus on \u201917. ", "If you would look at factors which could surprise us on positive, I would say, consumer confidence may be also related to tax reform to wage increases that could be a positive, because we sense a certain confidence and optimism out there. But concerns are still constraints on the housing market, supply constraints, and you see that in existing home sales and new home builds. But overall I think there are a couple of factors which gives a positive momentum to markets. Keep also in mind, we always indicated that as the housing cycle progresses, we will move more and more to a stage of roughly 2% to 3% annual growth which from a manufacturing perspective, I would consider a very healthy growth rate; we all love spikes. It\u2019s that kind of a growth rate we like. ", "Susan Maklari", "And then just in terms of maybe some of the inflation. You\u2019re continuing to point to that 200 million to 250 million for this year. Can you just give us some sense of maybe what\u2019s going in to that? Is there anything that has changed relative to where we were and maybe potential to come in at the higher or the lower end of that depending on how things move this year?", "Marc Bitzer", "So Susan it\u2019s Marc again. So stepping back a little bit, we entered \u201917 with a lot lower assumption on the raw material inflation. You may recall we entered the year with an estimate of 100 to 150 and we had to change that quite drastically in the summer and the fall to roughly about 350. So I would say the first major shift on the raw material landscape, we saw pretty much around summer for the last year, and now also as the year kind of progressed towards year-end, we saw that it\u2019s not going to be slowing down, it\u2019s fully continuing. That\u2019s why we refer to that over two year period, \u201917-\u201918 we have roughly 600 million headwinds of which 250 are still ahead of us, 200 to 250. ", "The initial culprits if you want to say is over steel and resins and they both are still very elevated, and you also know that while we - typically on normal contract on steel on resins you can\u2019t go out too long on contracts. So I would say there\u2019s still heightened uncertainty around resins. Unfortunately we see also now this inflation creeping in in other aspects like car parts. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with oil and what does it mean for freight and warehousing. So I would say we feel confident about the current guide of 200 to 250 and that internal forecast has now been stable for several weeks and months. But I will be lying to you if I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s uncertainty on raw material side, because we just see the inflation trends creeping in on many parts of our value chain. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move to Curtis Nagle of Banc of America Merrill Lynch.", "Curtis Nagle", "Just quickly on the tax rate. If you guys could clarify what corporate tax rate in the US you guys are embedding in the guide mid-20s for 2018?", "Jim Peters", "The tax rate we\u2019re assuming is the new tax rate obviously of 21%. But with that there are certain parts of the legislation that we\u2019re still trying to understand especially how it effects some of our tax planning strategies globally, and the impact on those on how that will impact our US tax rate. The other thing you always have to keep in mind is as I said, we see the tax reform as a very positive thing and we believe over the next coming months we\u2019ll have a much better understanding where those tax planning opportunities sit. But also keeping in mind that 45% of our taxable income is generated outside of the US.", "So also when you start to blend the rates together, you have to remember that we still have a large portion of our business outside the US that is in now countries that have a higher tax rate than the US. And so it\u2019s only going to have partial impact on our tax rate in the long run, but we don\u2019t see this right now having a negative impact from a cash perspective. And in fact as we look forward, we expect it to be positive in the mid-to-longer term. ", "Curtis Nagle", "And then just as a quick follow-up, I was kind of curious why you guys aren\u2019t expecting a higher margin in Latin America. I think it implies about, I think a little bit less than a point of growth. Just given all the cost taking you guys have done and the market positioning and some volume growth, I would have intended it to be a touch higher, do you perhaps needed maybe a little bit more volume say Brazil or some of the other markets to get to higher rate?", "Marc Bitzer", "It\u2019s Marc, the background probably of what you described as conservative is probably coming from two areas, one, we do not expect a significant rebound in the Brazilian demand prior to the elections or the election outcome. So I would say it certainly not going to get worse, but we don\u2019t see strong single digit or double digit growth in Brazil in the short term, maybe more as the year progresses in both elections. That\u2019s the one factor. ", "The other factor is the global compressor business is a highly competitive environment with quite a bit of success capacity. And that as you know it sits in our Latin America business where the opportunities for significant growth are just limited. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. ", "Michael Rehaut", "First question just want to drill down a little bit in North America, which continue to be a bright spot for you despite the continued competitive backdrop obviously outside of what may occur following the safeguard petition decision. With the guidance of over 12% margins or at least 12%, I was hoping to get a sense of the key drivers of that. Obviously you\u2019ve talked to positive price mix in the kitchen suite rollout, and if there is \u2013 maybe if it\u2019s possible to break it down between pre to mix volume leverage and perhaps if there is additional productivity or cost reduction. And if that improvement should be kind of steady throughout the year or weighted to one-half versus the other. ", "Marc Bitzer", "Michael, its Marc, let me try to answer it. And as you know we don\u2019t give recent volume or detailed driver breakdown. Having said that, the fundamental levers and drivers are in North America very similar to the global, maybe it\u2019s a slightly different timing. And what I mean by that is, we have announced in North America cost base, try to increase our kitchen business, and we\u2019ve done that in October. That coupled with further price mix opportunities i.e. even more to kitchen age and to a new product might give us a lift on the year-over-year price mix that is true for North America, and for the rest of the world and maybe we see some of these benefits in North America a little bit early when some of our part (inaudible).", "On the volume side, you heard our industry forecast, and what we said is also true for North America. We expect to grow in line or above the industry growth. So again, the overall trends are very similar, but also in terms of raw materials exposure. So in a certain way the margin what we gave for the globe is also true for North America, maybe with a slightly different timing.", "Michael Rehaut", "So I\u2019m kind of hearing that perhaps it might get a little more benefit from price in the first half if I heard that right. Secondly, just going to the other end of the spectrum with the continued challenges in Europe, you mentioned that it\u2019s kind of been a disappointment throughout 2017, and fourth quarter not being an exception to that. I wanted to get a bigger picture from you Marc on, given that this has been the fourth quarter in a row where you\u2019ve had to downwardly revise your expectations and guidance for the segment. Certainly there\u2019s been a lot of challenges in terms of all the factors that you\u2019ve enumerated, the integration, the inventory work-down, the skew count, the tougher promotional environment in the UK. ", "But in a bigger picture level, what has been the biggest challenge of not getting it right in terms of putting out a guidance that you\u2019re able to hit. And are you looking at kind \u2013 how are you looking at to change that or fix that? Is it a personnel issue in terms of getting better execution in the region or is it a matter of getting better information to put together a better set of guidance going forward. ", "Marc Bitzer", "Michael, its Marc again, let me push that back in terms of a European integration. As you may recall, kind of a first 1.5 almost two years, the integration was going very well, frankly even ahead of our expectations. We hit all our internal milestones. And as you pointed out, we had a coup le of quarters now, four or five quarters where we disappointed. And in hindsight you always have perfect 20-20, but I would say it\u2019s a combination of a couple really unforeseen external events like the Brexit, like what I would recall and we had some Russia currency issues, coupled with the accumulation of a complexity of an integration, which is as you know system, factories, products, brands, which is a lot once it comes altogether. ", "And that\u2019s why we had in \u201917 what we call a disappointing 2017. It doesn\u2019t change where we have our long term side in terms of where we can take the margins. So the 8% of 8% and we strongly believe we can achieve that. I think we\u2019re pre-conditioned to really get fair in order to get through some more predictability is it essentially comes down to stability in our systems and supply chain where we had a lot of disruption, a lot of back and forth.", "The good news is we have achieved a lot better stability in the entire supply chain already in Q4 and I feel a lot better how we go in to the next year. We\u2019ve also done internally a number of management system changes to get to more predictability. And frankly and the last, and I mentioned that before, I would say our internal targets are higher than we\u2019ve given as an external region guidance, because on this one we want to probably air more on the conservative side. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James. ", "Sam Darkatsh", "There\u2019s a couple of questions, first getting back to EMEA and I see that is conservatively crafted the margin guide. Specifically to the UK, I think your number one competitor has Turkish labor based cost and has used the weak currency to price aggressively which obviously exacerbates the already very challenging conditions for you. ", "My question, have you folks contemplated hedging the Turkish Lira versus the euro and/or moving production to Turkey. I\u2019m just spit-balling here, but if you don\u2019t do that and the Lira continues its slide versus the euro what gives you the confidence in really EMEA margin target going forward. ", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam that\u2019s obviously a very detailed question. First of all on UK, it\u2019s not only about Turkish competitor who forms a competition, but a very significant factor and yes your right the Turkish lira versus the British pound gave them probably longer protection and we also know ultimately inflation creeps also in to weak currencies. So a lot of the raw material input in steel etcetera will also ultimately show up in the Turkish production cost. ", "But it\u2019s nothing we can do about the hedging, it\u2019s more like ultimately that inflation will also rise on that part of the business. Having said all that the UK market in Q4 was still a very soft one. So we feel better about our price margin realization in UK. So the markets in UK in December have been more promotional was actually surprisingly soft, even softer than the previous quarter. ", "If you want to see any encouragement, but it\u2019s obviously way, way too early to read it. In January the British pound regained some strength which of course takes some pressure of our margins. But I would say that in the early, early data point and we got to see how the British pound evolves over the next couple of months. ", "Sam Darkatsh", "My other question will be much more broad and probably as too simplistic, but your 3% sales growth guide company-wide does that include or exclude FX. I think FX might be, maybe as much as a two point tail wind and with the industry growth expectations you gave along with price that would have imagined that your overall sales growth guide would have been higher than three points if you\u2019re including FX. ", "Jim Peters", "Sam, this is Jim, and right now when we put that out we were assuming FX was slightly positive but closer to neutral. So I think right now and again where FX rates are currently they would say, yes we would have a tailwind on sales. But it\u2019s January and as we know things will progress throughout the year. So right now that does not assume a significant tailwind from any kind of currency or FX changes. ", "Marc Bitzer", "And Sam may be just to add a (inaudible) and that\u2019s also what I had in my prepared remarks. Our focus is on margin expansion, and that is, we lost last EBIT margin 7.5% is one point above this year and that\u2019s our number one focus which has to come from the slight increases which we already announced the mix and the fixed cost reduction program, and that\u2019s our number one focus. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital.", "Ken Zener", "Jim I wondered if you could comment, do you have a first, second half split in terms of how EPS earnings will fall within your guys\u2019 guidance and then could you guys be expletive around tax rate. I mean mid-20s, I think everyone\u2019s going to assume 25% is that what you want us to assume?", "Jim Peters", "I\u2019d say Ken on the tax rate I think 25% is a safe assumption for right now, and so that\u2019s when we say mid-20, that\u2019s where we believe it will be at. That\u2019s kind of in line with what we used to say we thought our historical structural run rate will be. And as we said once we get further in to the year, we will give an update in terms of what we think the impacts longer term and mid-term could be from tax planning strategies. In terms of split between first half and second half of the year, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be much different than any of our prior years. Obviously we have some seasonality that affects us in the first half of the year as well as the ramp up of some of our cost reduction initiatives that are launching right now, and have launched and some of the previously announced cost based pricing that we took is beginning to run in here in the first quarter.", "So, again I think you\u2019ll see a little bit of a tailwind coming in to the second half of the year, but it won\u2019t be significantly dissimilar from some of the prior years where we\u2019ve been anywhere between 45 to 55 in that type of a range. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs. ", "Sam Eisner", "Just going to free cash flow, I think we haven\u2019t discussed that yet. I\u2019m trying to reconcile your $700 million starting point for this year. It looks like it\u2019s inclusive of about $120 million of other items, and so I just really want to understand how do you walk from what you guys have generated this year in terms of free cash flow to the roughly 1 billion to 1.1 for next year. What are the moving pieces I see that in there, but it feels like that there\u2019s a different starting point that you\u2019re using. So I just want to make sure we are apples-to-apples.", "Jim Peters", "I think Sam the one thing, as you assume and we already talked about in here is working capital mixture we see to be at least 125 million, and if you look where we ended on inventory, we think there\u2019s a significant benefit there to some of the things that show up in there that sale of very expensive assets or tax credits. ", "Again we have things like that that go on continuously and obviously we don\u2019t guide on them, but we\u2019re working on them even as part of our value creation strategy to make sure that we\u2019ve got the right asset base for our business. So I don\u2019t think that that will have a significant impact year-over-year in terms of our cash flow. ", "Sam Eisner", "So said another way, your $1 billion to 1.1 billion of free cash flow does include about $120 million or so of other items, is that fair to say?", "Jim Peters", "I would say it assumes an assumption that obviously if there are opportunities there we will take advantage of them. But we don\u2019t see any significant headwinds coming against it based on things that we had this year. ", "Sam Eisner", "That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just going to raw materials, so oil prices are up 35% since November, steel prices are up 20%. Those two commodity buckets are roughly combined almost 20% of your COGS. So I\u2019m a little bit confused how you\u2019re holding your guidance from October yet there\u2019s been significant moves particularly in oil which, oil goes in to benzene, benzene in to major portion of your COGS. Just help me better understand why we should feel confident in the 225 million [debt]. ", "Marc Bitzer", "Sam, its Marc. First of all to clarify also the indication which we gave in October about the 600 million that was not based on spot prices in October. That is based on our models which we have internally about projected raw material cost development. So if you take [steel], we have our models where we take input cost in to consideration, supply-demand etcetera. So it\u2019s a fairly complicated and complex model. So that was our forecast not the spot price. And right now what we see is that the spot price is actually up pretty much in line with our forecast, maybe even slightly higher than the forecast. But our amounts were pretty active in prediction. ", "That doesn\u2019t mean that we have, as I mentioned before, about 250 or 200 to 250 is firm. There could be risks, we don\u2019t know yet, but that\u2019s today kind of our best view in the current year. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move to Megan McGrath of MKM Partners. ", "Megan McGrath", "Since pricing is such a big part of your strategy and guidance this year, I wanted to get a little more tactical color. In terms of the fourth quarter, how much of if you can tell us, how much of the positive price mix was really sort of apples-to-apples pricing, how much were you able to raise price in the market, and how much was mix? And if mix is a big part of this, how do you from a practical perspective make that better mix happen. Is it just coming out with new products that\u2019s more expensive or is there some sort of marketing effort you\u2019re doing to mix more towards the products you want to mix to?", "Marc Bitzer", "Let me try to answer it, so first of all we have internally our tools where we know exactly what we call like-for-like pricing, what is mixed and what comes from promotional investments or trade [burn] investments. We typically don\u2019t publish this one, because I think we would reveal a little bit too much competitive information. ", "Having said that, as I indicated, Q4 was over positive price mix, and I would say a portion of us was already related to some price increases which we announced in certain parts of the world like in Asia. A certain amount was probably from less promotional intensity. As I indicated before and particularly North America, we saw certain promotions which we didn\u2019t see for value creating and we didn\u2019t participate. ", "So I would say it\u2019s a combination of list price increases and reward of a less promotional intensity and lastly we still see the benefits and we\u2019ll see probably more next year from new product introductions. We had last year KitchenAid as a new suite which is flying, I mean it\u2019s really going extremely well. We know we will have some carry over benefits. We know we launched the Whirlpool Kitchen suite that will give us quite a bit of mixed opportunities. ", "So to your question, to do large products with new prices, no. What we typically try to do is involve the products with new features where people voluntarily mix up, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher price on a like-for-like price, but it\u2019s a richer product and people are encouraged to mix up. ", "Megan McGrath", "And as I felt I understand that it\u2019s too early to really talk too much about the (inaudible), but wanted to get your sense on where you think inventory levels are? Do you get a sense that maybe there was some stuff in the channel or a loading of products in to the US ahead of the tariff announcements do you have any feel for that?", "Marc Bitzer", "Let me maybe at first a little bit further expand and we talk about the safeguards position. First of all, as I said before, we are very thankful that the ITC, the USDR and this administration has finally put an end to this long story of dumping. Recently a press reported, sometimes few people confuse offenders with victims. So the LG and Samsung have been dumping for a number years, there\u2019ve been several times we\u2019ve seen proof and evidence and decisions that dumping has been confirmed. So the safeguard finally puts an end to what we call this country hopping and the dumping. So it\u2019s an incredibly good outcome, it\u2019s a good catalyst for Whirlpool Corporation. It\u2019s also encouraging that finally trade laws are being enforced. ", "With that in mind, the reason why we couldn\u2019t specify what is the bottom line impact on our company is, has a couple of reasons. One is exactly to your point, we do not know exactly how much inventory has been built up. We have certain customs data until December , but we don\u2019t have the January data. We saw significant amount of preloading already in December and that probably continued to January. So we can\u2019t exactly estimate, but I would think its a few weeks to a couple of months of kind of preload. ", "Two, we have a certain mechanics around the quota which are not yet fully specified in terms of our quota by country or by competitor. And thirdly, and that\u2019s the most important thing is that it ultimately comes down to the question, will the offender stop the dumping. I can\u2019t give you that answer, but that\u2019s of course the key question in terms of we of course firmly would expect the safeguard measure in place that finally the dumping ends. But we don\u2019t know with certainty. ", "I would say as the next couple of months unfold, we would see a lot more clarity around how all these three factors come together, and maybe we can give you a better picture about what it all means. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Alvaro Lacayo of Gabelli & Company. ", "Alvaro Lacayo", "Just on a follow-up on the safeguard petition and sort of the chatter around the inventory loadings from competitors. In the past when you had those trade related victories, I think they followed a similar playbook where they\u2019ve done inventory loading in anticipation. Maybe if you could talk about a little bit of what were the dynamics you saw in the past and how that impacted the business and how long was that sort of effect felt?", "Marc Bitzer", "Alvaro its Marc again. And again we do not know exactly the inventory levels. We have the customs data until December. I would just say, judging from the past, depending on which dumping actions were typically a couple of weeks to a couple of months inventory which may typically found a way in to the market over a couple of months. I think this time it\u2019s different. It\u2019s different in that respect that in the past they used the bridge to kind of move factories in to other countries. That is a safeguard measure and I think it\u2019s sort of impossible, just not possible.", "The only kind of way out, which is a positive for a country is that they start producing in US and we all know of our certain timeline. So I would say, you should expect, probably should expect that that inventory flushes through in the next couple of months, and that\u2019s it, and (inaudible) probably just the level of supply. ", "Alvaro Lacayo", "And then secondly just on the price mix guide on a global basis, but more focused in terms of just thoughts on North America in terms of, you mentioned the levers to drive the price mix which I think have been levers that you have in the past employed, and you had big product launches before and you\u2019ve had cost based price increases and price mix over the last few years have been a little bit more stubborn. ", "Maybe if you could just highlight of what you think about this time, in terms of what\u2019s different and what gives you the confidence to sort of hit those numbers. And then just from an order of magnitude, where do you see most of those price mix benefits happening across the footprint. ", "Marc Bitzer", "Again it\u2019s a little bit region by region different. First of all, pretty much in all regions we work on cost based price actions and price mix opportunities in some regions also in terms of promotional investment or a triparty investments. But it differs region by region. To give you for example, one example because it\u2019s already behind us. In China, the raw material cost increases are so big and the mix opportunities are somewhat limited, we relied heavily on like-for-like cost based price increases. That is already behind us. ", "I think in US we have in particularly the product pipeline and the brand portfolio. We have more mix opportunities available to us than in other markets. So in US you would probably see a combination of the effect of a kitchen price increase which we already know, but again also the product pipeline which we have. It\u2019s not \u2013 I mentioned it early, but I keep saying about the carryover benefit, but the [Work With] suite launch is significant for us. It impacts a lot of products and if connected suite gives us a lot of opportunities to mix up. ", "And again we know the product that we are launching and they are not year-end launches, they come throughout Q1 and Q2, so very inside and maybe it will drive certain mix and that\u2019s why we are confident about it. ", "Operator", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Marc Bitzer for closing comments. ", "Marc Bitzer", "Let me just may be just summarize key message from this call, and that\u2019s again on slide 20 if you want to look it up. First of all again, global price mix and fixed cost initiatives we announced last quarter are progressing ahead of expectations and that\u2019s a very good news. And we are very encouraged by the price mix, exit rate and strong margins in North America, and we expect to deliver significant improvement to EBIT margin this year and we are committed to further margin expansion in the coming year. ", "We also expect strong free cash flow growth this year as a result of a margin improvement. And we expect to continue to returning strong levels of cash to shareholders in a balanced way. So thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter earnings call on April 24. Thanks.
