My name is Brandon and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. Following the initial remarks from management, we will open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed, or rebroadcast without the Company\u2019s permission.

If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.", "I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Jonathan Ireland, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information on yesterday\u2019s release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the Company\u2019s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.", "All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the Company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors. Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor updates, copies of which are available on our website.", "Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Julia Haywood; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Levy. We also have Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart in the room to assist with Q&A. ", "And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz", "Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everybody. This quarter marked another period in which United took meaningful steps forward in transforming the direction of this Company. Notably, we saw our 25,000 flight attendants ratify new contract, our over 9,000 technicians reached a tentative agreement for a joint contract, and we\u2019re excited to have that ratified soon. Additionally, in the quarter, as most of you know, I solidified my leadership team. This team has deep industry experience, incredible talent in my opinion and a very focused dedication to bring United into its next chapter, realizing a full potential of our great people and the great network and our assets.", "On the business side, we also continued to run a solid operation in the quarter. In fact, we achieved the best third quarter on-time performance in our history. I am going to take this opportunity to thank dedicated and professional United employees that make all of this happen. Thanks to your commitment and determined efforts, we delivered a Company best performance for arrivals during the busy July 4th holiday travel period. We also earned a first or second place ranking in key arrivals and departure measures in the three months between Memorial Day and September 1st, and culminated our great summer month performance with delivering the best Labor Day weekend performance numbers on record. So, it\u2019s great to have our operating program and people back in a good consistent application of their work.", "On the financial side, we continued to record strong financial results including a pre-tax profit of $1.6 billion and a pre-tax margin of 15.7%, both excluding special items. As many of know, we will host an Investor Day on November 15th. With that in mind, today, we will focus our discussion on our recent performance and near-term outlook and wait until November for a discussion of our plans for beyond 2017, including our outlook for both CASM and capacity.", "So, with that said, I\u2019d like to turn the call over -- this is the maiden voyage of both Mr. Kirby, Ms. Haywood, and Mr. Levy. But before I do that, let me say to them all that we\u2019re incredibly thrilled to have each of you join the United family and very much looking forward to sharing our future with you. With that, Scott?", "Scott Kirby", "Thank you, Oscar. Before turning to the slides, I just want to start by saying that I\u2019m very excited to have joined the United team and there are just fantastic opportunities ahead of us. This really is an exciting time for United. It\u2019s true that the last several years have been challenging with the integration that took longer. It was more complex than anticipated, which created cultural, operating and commercial challenges. But now with the integration largely in the past, we can all turn our focus to realizing the full potential of United for our employees, customers and investors.", "The foundation of a great airline is its people. And in the Oscar\u2019s leadership, United has made tremendous progress on creating an integrated, united United. Achieving our full potential will require lots of hard work. But with great people, the best network potential, the right plan and the focus on solid execution, we can deliver a great network, operations, and customer service, which in turn will lead the financial results that reflect the full potential of this airline. Julia will touch on some of the high level opportunities in a moment but before she does, I\u2019d like to take the time and run through the quarter\u2019s performance.", "On slide six, you can see that we made meaningful strides in improving the operation over the past couple of years. On time departures, arrivals, completion factor and mishandled baggage performance have all seen meaningful improvement. Going forward, we expect we\u2019ll continue to improve our operational results through better processes, smart investments and a commitment to efficiency. As we\u2019ve talked about here in the past at United, running a reliable airline is a key to winning other customers and regaining customers that we\u2019ve lost during some of the operational challenges that we had with integration from 2012 through 2014.", "Turning to revenue, slide seven shows consolidated unit revenue performance for the past quarter, which declined 5.8%. This is slightly better than initial expectations due in part to better close-in, bookings and yields into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast consolidated PRASM will decline between 4% and 6%. As you can see on slide, we continue to see sequential second derivative unit revenue improvement as we\u2019re lapping many of the headwinds we have experienced over the past few quarters. For now at least, it appears that we are mostly -- most of the big one-time issues that have been affecting PRASM are in the task. One of the stories in this slide is that issues like currency, energy et cetera aren\u2019t really having a meaningful impact year-over-year any longer.", "We continue to see the sequential improvement in unit revenues despite the fact that there is a meaningful calendar shift of revenues out of fourth quarter and into the third and first quarters. Getting back to positive PRASM is now about a balanced supply demand environment, advancements in product segmentation as well as many United specific opportunities that we\u2019ll talk in more detail about at Investor Day in few weeks.", "Slide eight has some additional detail in each of the geographic regions. Domestically, we\u2019re seeing positive close-in corporate booking trends and a better alignment of supply and demand. Additionally, the domestic pricing environment is beginning to feel more rational. We expect the Atlantic to remain the weakest region of the world. Overall capacity continues to grow at high rates. At the same, the demand is growing more slowly putting pressure on unit revenues. In the Pacific, we expect to see a continuation of recent trends with modest unit revenue declines, modest at least as compared to the Atlantic. And we expect Latin America to be the first region to return to positive year-over-year PRASM, driven by good results across the region but particularly strong results in Brazil.", "In summary, we think the revenue environment has bottomed and we\u2019re starting to see signs of recovery in all regions with the possible exception of the Atlantic.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Julia to share with you her high level thoughts on commercial opportunities that we\u2019ve identified at United, each of which we\u2019ll discuss in a greater detail next month\u2019s Investor Day.", "Julia Haywood", "Great, thanks Scott. I\u2019m also very proud to join the United team. Ever since I began working with United, I can see the potential of our Company and I\u2019m excited to be part of the team to unlock that potential. We see a number of opportunities throughout our commercial landscape to improve earnings over the next several years with the largest opportunities being in revenue management, network optimization, product segmentation, and product improvement. I will provide some high level thoughts on each today and we look forward to our upcoming Investor Day where we will provide more details on these opportunities including actions that we are taking and the associated financial impacts.", "So, first, with respect to revenue management, we believe there are a variety of both near term and longer term opportunities to improve share of United. Solutions for these opportunities can range from small but meaningful tweaks to our revenue management system to making more wholesale changes to our strategies for managing both pricing and inventory. And while much of this work has been delayed during United\u2019s integration, we are now moving quickly ahead.", "Second with respect to our network. Let me start by echoing Scott\u2019s earlier comment. United has the best network potential of any U.S. carrier, but we are not utilizing it fully today. We have spent the summer working to refine the mission of each of our hubs, and we look forward to sharing some of our thoughts with you at Investor Day. But as an important note, the full details of our network playbook won\u2019t be fully revealed in order to protect competitively sensitive information.", "The third area of opportunity we will discuss is product segmentation. As you know, the work being done in this area signals a meaningful step change for our customers, and I believe that over time, it will have an even larger financial impact than the introduction of bag fees. We will use the time at our Investor Day to describe in more detail our entry level fare product while also providing further plans to advance the segmentation progress in other areas here at United.", "Finally, we will discuss the changes we are making with respect to our product and travel experience for our customers. In particular, we are now investing in the premium experience, rolling out United Polaris, our all-new business class service, transforming United clubs and elevating our food and beverage offering.", "In summary, we are looking forward to this day and sharing with you the hard work we have been doing to establish a commercial plan to the organization. Like Scott, I am thrilled to be part of this team and could not be more excited about the opportunities I see ahead for United.", "So, as a wrap up, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank our customers. In my past life, I spent more hours than I\u2019d like to recount on planes and in airports, and I understand how important it is that we deliver to you the travel experience that you expect. The team here has made great strides over the past year and I know that there are even more opportunities to come.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew.", "Andrew Levy", "Thanks Julia. I too am excited to be part of the United team. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be successful in making United the best airline in the world. Yesterday afternoon, we released our third quarter earnings and fourth quarter investor update. While I will discuss both our results and outlook today at a high level, please refer to both of these documents for additional details. With that said, let\u2019s review the Company\u2019s third quarter financial performance and fourth quarter outlook.", "Slide 12 shows a summary of our GAAP financials and slide 13 has our non-GAAP results. Company generated pre-tax income excluding special items of $1.6 billion with a pre-tax margin of 15.7%. Net income was $1 billion, a decline from $1.7 billion in third quarter of 2015 due almost entirely to our higher booked tax rate in 2016. Adjusting for booked taxes, net income was down 9% but earnings per share increased 7% due to the 15% reduction in share count as compared with 3Q 2015.", "Moving to slide 14, non-fuel unit costs in the third quarter increased 3.4% excluding special items, profit sharing and third-party business expenses. Approximately 2 percentage points of this increase was due to the impact of labor agreements ratified in 2016 with our pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers and IAM represented employees. We expect fourth quarter non-fuel unit costs excluding special items, profit sharing and third-party business expense to increase between 4.75% and 5.75%. Approximately 4 percentage points of this increase is due to the impact of these new labor agreements. Our projections however do not include the effects of a recently ratified tenant agreement with our maintenance technicians since it has not yet been ratified.", "As you can see on slide 15, we expect full year 2016 non-fuel CASM to increase between 2.75% and 3.25% with 2.3 percentage points of this increase due to the new labor agreements. However, in 2017, year-over-year effect of these agreements is only expected to be between 1.5 and 2 percentage points. As provided in yesterday\u2019s investor update, we currently expect our fourth quarter pre-tax margin excluding special items to be between 5% and 7%.", "Turning to slide 16 and capital allocation, let me start by saying that we believe a healthy balance sheet and adequate liquidity is critical. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our $1.35 billion revolver which remains untapped. Adjusted CapEx including aircraft, non-aircraft, and aircraft purchase deposits was roughly $680 million in third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to take delivery of eight new mainline aircraft which contributes to CapEx of between $935 million and $955 million. We have already secured financing for these deliveries through last month\u2019s EETC transaction. For the full year, we expect approximately $3.2 billion in capital expenditures.", "We also contributed $240 million for our pension plans this quarter, bringing our year-to-date contributions to $400 million. We do not plan any additional contributions this year. With respect to the share repurchase, we returned $255 million to shareholders purchasing 5.2 million shares during the quarter that brings the total amount of cash returned to shareholders to $2.4 billion year-to-date. And since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2014, we spent $4 billion to repurchase roughly 20% of shares outstanding. We currently have $2 billion remaining under our repurchase authority.", "On our upcoming Investor Day, we will talk in detail about our plans for the capital structure of the business including our views on liquidity, CapEx, debt, pension funding and shareholder returns. We will continue to be focused on finding ways to invest efficiently in our business. This quarter, we had added our second used A319 to our fleet and plan to take a total of 11 of these aircraft by the end of 2017. In addition, we are reviewing our long-term CapEx needs including the fleet and we will give you a more in-depth update next month. Returning excess cash to shareholders will continue to be an important part of the United capital allocation strategy and we plan to providing the context for our plans going forward.", "In closing, this was a very good quarter for United and I am excited on many good quarters to come. I look forward to speaking to each of you again in the next few weeks as we lay out our strategic plan for the Company.", "I\u2019ll turn it back to Oscar now.", "Oscar Munoz", "Great, thanks Andrew. As you heard from the team, there is a lot of energy about the future, and we do have a great day planned for you on November 15th. In addition to what Scott and Julia, Andrew have suggested with regards to the outline of that agenda, we are also going to have Linda Jojo and Greg Hart discuss improvements in both our IT systems and operations broadly so that you can better understand I think the great work being done in those areas to make United more efficient and nimble.", "I also understand the importance of the establishing goals by which you as shareowners can hold us accountable in order to ensure the execution of our plans. We will use the Investor Day to provide financial metrics and targets by which we are managing our business so that you can also track our progress as we execute upon these plans.", "Let me close again by thanking our customers for flying United. We\u2019re focused everyday on continuing to find opportunities to improve your travel experience and I want to thank you for your business and look forward to seeing you on a flight soon.", "With that let me turn over the conference to Jonathan.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thanks you, Oscar. We will now take questions from the analyst community. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Jonathan. [Operator Instructions] And from Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg please go ahead.", "Michael Linenberg", "I guess if I could do two quick ones here, just Andrew, you mentioned 2017 CASM ex-fuel up 1.5 to 2 as a result of the recent labor deals, presumably that doesn\u2019t include any sort of a match on your pilot deal since the Delta deal is still out there, it\u2019s tentative. But does that include the technician piece, the mechanic deal assuming that goes through or would that be in addition to that?", "Andrew Levy", "Couple of things, just to clarify, I want to make sure that my comments were communicated as I intended them to be, which is that we expect the effect of the existing labor agreements, the new ones that does not include the technicians, it does not include any snap up on the pilots, we expect the effect of that next year to be between 1.5% and 2%. So, that is not a CASM forecast, that is just the increase associated with the existing agreements. So, I think -- hope that answered all of your questions with that.", "Michael Linenberg", "Yes. That\u2019s a perfect clarification. And then just to Julia, you alluded to the rollout of call it your entry level fares or at least alluded to talking about it at the Investor Day. I think the plan was for it to be rolled out sometime this month. Why the delay and when do we think that that will actually come into effect?", "Julia Haywood", "We\u2019re looking forward to bringing it in later this year. We\u2019re going to talk more about that at Investor Day. With Scott and I coming in, we wanted to take another look at everything that we\u2019re offering within that product segment and make sure that is exactly the way we wanted to be and that we also roll it out really well to the front line. So, we\u2019re just taking an extra beat on that and we\u2019ll talk more about it at Investor Day.", "Operator", "From Credit Suisse, we have Julie Yates on line. Please go ahead.", "Julie Yates", "A question on domestic RASM, so your peer noted that on a combined basis, domestic RASM for the November to January time period should be flattish trying to normalize for some of that holiday shift. Do you agree with this assessment? And if not, what are you seeing that would suggest otherwise?", "Scott Kirby", "I\u2019m not sure I would get all the way to flattish. We do see continuous improvement in the domestic environment. I think it\u2019s also right to kind of look at it November through January to count for all the calendar shifts. I\u2019m not sure we get to flattish, but it\u2019s certainly trending that direction. I think we started actually, because where we were in the third quarter compared to our competitor, we start from a better position. So, I suspect we will get to positive domestic PRASM before they do. I think we also have more opportunity and more levers that are probably United specific. But we are certainly trending in that direction. And whether it\u2019s going to get there in November to January or shortly thereafter, it\u2019s hard to say certain at this point. But we\u2019re trending in that direction and we feel pretty good about the domestic environment, certainly feels better than it has been a couple of years. Now acknowledge that\u2019s an easy comparison, because hasn\u2019t felt very good past couple of years but it feels better than it has in quite some time.", "Julie Yates", "And then Andrew just one quick one for you. Is there any color -- and I understand you haven\u2019t given ASM and you might want to reserve this for Investor Day, but is there any color you can offer on how we should think about the core CASM ex-growth for 2017?", "Andrew Levy", "We\u2019ll get into that in a little more detail in a month Julie. But we expect at this point in time that it\u2019s going to be consistent with the performance that United has delivered in the past few years. I think United has done a very good job controlling that, its cost structure, the core CASM and I would expect that to be similar as we look forward. But we\u2019ll give you more specific number at Investor Day in about a month from now.", "Julie Yates", "Okay.", "Oscar Munoz", "Julie, this is Oscar. I just want to jump in to Andrew\u2019s comment. Core CASM is an area that will continue. Despite the history, we\u2019ll continue to focus in that strong. We have several initiatives that we\u2019re thinking through, but we\u2019ve got a lot of moving parts and we\u2019ll provide a little bit more color again at this infamous now Investor Day. So, thanks Julie.", "Julie Yates", "Okay, great. And Andrew, one last one, are there any offsets from the recent contracts that have been ratified in terms of profit sharing changes or greater productivity?", "Andrew Levy", "There are some offsets, certainly on the profit sharing. And I think that each agreement kind of stands on its own. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to go in individual detail with each one. But as one example with the flight attendant deal today, it\u2019s 15% profit sharing and it\u2019s going to drop down to -- I think it\u2019s a tiered approach, which would be from 10 to 20 depending on the level of profitability. That\u2019s one example. But we have to kind of look at each one on its own merits to go through the puts and takes. But look, I mean for the most part, we\u2019re going to see an increase in labor expense. It is not completely offset by the profit sharing or productivity. So, we\u2019re going to have to find ways to drive revenue and reduce expense to continue to grow margins.", "Operator", "From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Hey, Scott, you called out some one-time PRASM drivers in your prepared remarks but one thing that I didn\u2019t see in there was the impact of the service disruptions away from you during Q3. Could you all characterize that or was it just not meaningful enough to include in there?", "Scott Kirby", "I don\u2019t think it was meaningful at all. If you go look at our data on a day-to-day basis, you certainly can\u2019t find where it happened. So, I don\u2019t think it was meaningful.", "Darryl Genovesi", "And then with regard to China, you guys called out some -- I guess the outlook for the capacity situation to improve as we approach the caps on a bilateral. Can you just help us understand how you are thinking about the timing of the potential RASM improvement across the Pacific? It looks like -- the fourth quarter doesn\u2019t look great but as you look out into early next year, how do you think the change in the bilateral sort of impact the capacity growth rate over time? And then I guess looking a little further out with the new airport being constructed in Beijing, if there is a strong possibility that that bilateral gets amended to include more capacity on both sides? Thank you.", "Scott Kirby", "So, if you look at our third quarter and fourth quarter PRASM forecast for the Pacific, all things considered, I think that\u2019s actually quite strong performance, particularly for us where in the fourth quarter we\u2019re starting the second San Francisco to Shanghai. So, we\u2019ll have for United at least fair amount of capacity growth. So, for that environment, I think we\u2019re actually doing pretty well. There is a lot of capacity growth out of China in particular but as you point out, the bilaterals were almost capped. And so that\u2019s going to slow down dramatically in 2017 and beyond. The opposite is happening in Japan where capacity is starting to be reduced and we see strong performance in Japan. And so, across the board, we feel pretty good about the trans-Pacific environment.", "Looking further out, once the new airport opens, it takes a long time to chase bilaterals and there is more than just chasing route authorities. The complication with flying to China is you have the route authorities being able to get slots at commercially viable times; it\u2019s been really difficult. And so, I expect that would be part of the next set of negotiations. And so that\u2019s difficult; again, it\u2019s difficult. I suspect it will take quite a bit of time to get results.", "Operator", "From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker", "Just two questions; one, can you say if there was any improvement, if any of your domestic markets showed a positive RASM during the third quarter? I think Delta commented that they saw about 33% in their markets. And I\u2019m just wondering what that number was for you.", "Scott Kirby", "Yes. It\u2019s actually 43% of our markets have positive year-over-year PRASM domestically. Look, that\u2019s an interesting statistic; I only know it because someone asked on the Delta call or they said it and so checked. But what\u2019s I think more important is the momentum that that has for the domestic environment and there is -- this can turn out to be wrong but there is lots of little things that are going on with pricing and with a lot of carriers going through and cleaning up pricing in the domestic environment and make us feel pretty constructive about that entity in particular.", "Helane Becker", "So, I can take away from that that you think it\u2019s relatively sustainable, even with calendar shifts aside?", "Scott Kirby", "Yes. I mean, you have to adjust for the calendar shifts. But adjusting for that, I think that the momentum and -- the domestic -- overall system and the domestic is going to continue to improve on year-over-year basis and the results are going to get better.", "Helane Becker", "Great. And then just a question for you, Oscar. In June, there was an investor call and there were a whole bunch of revenue and cost initiatives that were presented to us. Should we ignore those or maybe not ignore is the right word but maybe set aside those in favor of upcoming initiatives that will be discussed in Investor Day or how should we think about that June call?", "Oscar Munoz", "So, my view and I\u2019ll have Julia and Scott share theirs as well since they are deeply involved in the past work. I think it\u2019s safe to say that the existing work will be not only continued but built upon and gain some incremental value. But I\u2019ll let the folks in the middle of it talk. Julia?", "Julia Haywood", "I think as we look, we are going to talk a little bit more on Investor Day but I think we see upside from what we\u2019ve seen from the numbers that we\u2019re reconciling against versus some of the new ideas and initiatives that we started talking about. There may be some re-bucketing that exists, Helane but besides that I think we see only that will subside. [Ph] So, it\u2019s great news.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on line. Please go ahead.", "Hunter Keay", "Scott, one of the things I think you did at American well was you reduced forecast error in the revenue management tool, so -- over the last year or two particularly. So, how is forecast error within UAL\u2019s RM tool suite; where do you want to get it; and do you think you have the IT in place to improve it?", "Scott Kirby", "I think that there is a lot of opportunity there. We\u2019re going to actually spend a fair bit of time at investor day talking about this. So, I\u2019ll give you a little bit of preview. I like using one example from the summer. In July as United was seeing stronger demand and bookings were coming in strong at the domestic entity, tried to boost the demand and increase the amount of demand. And so, we took a set of markets and didn\u2019t do anything, and we took another set of markets and increased the local demand by a 100% in the forecast, another set of market and increased both the local and the flow demand by 20%. Those were massive, massive changes in demand, and you would expect that to lead to massive changes in output. And at the end of the experiment, those three sets of entities, those three different experimental groups were 0.2% different in outcomes. What that tells you is -- and what that really is, we have a big complicated system. We don\u2019t even have a process to measure forecast versus actuals because it\u2019s so big and complicated. And the team does a fantastic job of managing on the backend but we\u2019re hand managing a lot of markets on the backend and as great as people are, you can\u2019t do that as well as a robust system with thousands and millions of data points can do. Even things like this year coming into Christmas, the demand patterns dramatically differ with Christmas on a Sunday instead of Christmas on a Friday and we don\u2019t have any history that goes back to a time when Christmas was last on a Sunday. So we\u2019re trying to hand this.", "All of that -- the team has done a great job managing that in that environment but it is a significant opportunity. It\u2019s going to require a lot of work; it\u2019s not going to happen overnight. It is going to require some changes in the system. Our fundamental architecture of the system that we\u2019re built on can handle it; there are no issues there. We\u2019re just going to have to build, do the work to build on top of that and do a management. But it\u2019ll take time and we\u2019ll talk more about this at Investor Day, but I think it is a significant opportunity that\u2019s unique to United Airlines.", "Oscar Munoz", "And I\u2019ll also add; I can just add real quickly, over the years people have characterized the United network in very broad and positive terms but yet we\u2019ve never been able to realize the full potential of that. I think you just heard another example of what are the things that have been sort of missing, really take it to [indiscernible]. Again level of energy and excitement in our company is based upon -- predicated on the fact that we have some very-very good people on this now and you can see great output over time as Scott says.", "Hunter Keay", "Yes, that\u2019s -- I will look forward to hearing more about this at the Analyst Day. And that\u2019s actually a good segue into my next question. When -- you guys actually -- you split the VP of network role into two roles recently; you are going to have one person overseeing the domestic network and one person overseeing the international network. So, to me that says that you feel like one of those two is particularly underperforming. So, is that a fair characterization and if so, which do you think is underperforming more relative to where it should be, domestic or international?", "Julia Haywood", "I think we have a very strong international network, I think we have for many years. There\u2019s more that we can be doing on that side for sure. On the domestic side, outside coming in, I think we thought there was a lot of opportunity there and I think that\u2019s only been confirmed from the inside now. So Scott and I are working together with the team to understand the full potential of the domestic network and I think we see significant upside there.", "Scott Kirby", "You\u2019re reading a little much into it about the org structure as people are -- anything like that but we do, we have the best international network certainly of any U.S. carrier that goes -- that\u2019s no one argues that. But we do not have the same kind of margins domestically or have the same kind of success domestically as American and Delta do. And we can get there. It\u2019s another area that I think we have more upside than the others because there\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff; it\u2019s in your management, it can be sales, it\u2019s in the latest schedule, so all kinds of stuff at the Company that\u2019s been very focused on international. But without losing any of that I think we can improve the results in the domestic network.", "Operator", "From Buckingham Research we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.", "Dan McKenzie", "I know you\u2019re saving a lot for the Investor Day, but I\u2019m wondering if you can share just more broadly the growth plans for 2017 and how that would break out domestically versus internationally.", "Scott Kirby", "Dan, we\u2019d love to share but we don\u2019t actually, just don\u2019t have it done yet. As Julia alluded to earlier, we got new people here taking a new look at some of the things. And we will be ready to give you more detail at Investor Day but I apologize, we just don\u2019t -- aren\u2019t ready to do it today.", "Dan McKenzie", "Okay, understood. And then, secondly here, a number of experts are ratcheting down their economic outlook for the UK next year, so just a couple of questions here. I am just wondering if you can remind us what percent of United\u2019s revenue is tied to the UK. And then secondly, how the capacity reductions across the Atlantic are being targeted specifically?", "Scott Kirby", "I don\u2019t actually know what our percentage across Atlantic. I am glad to have now at airline that doesn\u2019t have essentially a hub there where I was before. But it\u2019s obviously much smaller. And on the specifics of the capacity reductions, again that\u2019s work that\u2019s ongoing right now for 2017, so left away; 4.7% of revenue.", "Operator", "From JP Morgan we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Baker", "This first one I\u2019ll just throw out there to whomever would like to take it. When standalone United incurred significant labor cost escalation back in 1999, it isn\u2019t clear that any return on that investment was ever achieved. So, here we are whatever, 17 years later, labor costs are once again rising at a material rate. Is there anything different about the industry today that gives you the confidence that your owners actually witness a return on these recent investments?", "Oscar Munoz", "Jamie, it\u2019s Oscar. Let me start and then I think I\u2019ll let Scott finish, given that he\u2019s had deeper, broader, long-term experience here. I understand the history of this. It\u2019s been told to me repeatedly as we finished our labor contracts and I completely reject the notion that you can\u2019t have efficiency and productivity while also having customer service. I said that constantly. And to that end, in order to get that customer service and that productivity, we have to invest in these folks. And so our employees are very core to our product and customer experience. These costs, -- labor costs are market based costly to your point. Where the difference we are counting on is that over time this collaborative relationship we are building with our labor workforce, we can drive productivity. In fact, we\u2019re in this together. And some will call that na\u00efve, some will call that history doesn\u2019t prove that but I think we are already seeing those green shoots as we say around that. But that\u2019s been my focus. Now I have experts that are going to help us to do that. So, Scott would you have something to add?", "Scott Kirby", "Sure, I agree with everything Oscar said. And we are a service business and our people make the airline run successfully every day, how they interact with our customers is most important thing that we do. One of the things that I am proud of as having been a part of in the industry is getting to the point where we can start getting back to our people, we can do great things for our people in contracts after the 15 years that they have been through and the post 9/11 era furloughs and concessions and losing system [ph]. And so, it\u2019s rewarding to be able to actually give the kinds of raises and economic benefits back to people after all that they can do. I do think the industry is different today and I think it\u2019s important to not only do great things for our people but for our customers and our shareholders, all those things happen to go together. I think 1999 is probably not the first example of time to use, because we all know what happened in 2001 and that really triggered all of the negative things that happened to airline employees over the next 15 years. We\u2019re past that and we are moving forward. I think we can do the kinds of things we have done with these contracts for our people which is fantastic and still get to a role where we have a margins that are higher than they are today and do great things for our shareholders as well. We will talk some more about some of those targets at Investor Day but we\u2019re looking forward to that but we are all genuinely happy for our people that we can offer them these kinds of various contracts.", "Jamie Baker", "And Scott a follow-up, and this touches on I guess Helane\u2019s question before. If you were to rank order the catalysts that are driving domestic RASM improvement, how would that look; is it tighter aggregate supply followed by better fare fencing, followed by increases to base fares or is it cessation of advantage fares, revisions to AP requirements that sort of thing? We all know what the various levers are and I am not asking you to name names. I am just wondering at the industry level what\u2019s really driving the improvement.", "Scott Kirby", "So, I\u2019m going to break it down exactly the way you described it, but I\u2019ll take a step back and say what\u2019s happened really starting with deregulation and came to a head a few years ago that the way we fence the product, sell the product, differentiate the product, changed. And it used to be that we get use fare fences, Saturday night stays to segment the product between business travelers and leisure travelers, and we can\u2019t anymore. And the growth of low cost carriers has forever changed that part of the business. We are getting better even in that world at figuring out segmentation and we\u2019re doing more on segmentation here certainly at United but I think across the industry we\u2019re getting better at that.", "Capacity is still growing faster than demand, but we\u2019re making real improvements in our pricing and yield management strategies that are helping counteract some of that. And then, as Julia mentioned, and we\u2019ll talk more about on Investor Day, product segmentation is the huge leap forward; I think it is a new structural change that we\u2019re going to go through here at United. It will be good for our customers; it will allow us to offer low fares to people that care only about getting the lowest price and then allow us to offer a better product to customers who care about other aspects of the product. And so, we\u2019re excited about that. But really this has been with an industry as a journey of how do we -- changes and how we segment our product for our various customers and we\u2019re just, I think mostly getting better at that. Right now, it\u2019s pricing and yield management stuff that we\u2019re doing is better and product segmentation is getting kick-off in earnest next year.", "Jamie Baker", "But those are long tailed observations. The sense that I get is that kind of mid-August something really started to take place, something incremental occurred. Is that understanding of mine simply flawed, which is fine? You\u2019ve never hesitated in telling me in the past when I\u2019ve been wrong.", "Scott Kirby", "Look, they\u2019re not all long tailed. When I talk about changes to yield management and pricing, those are pretty short tailed. And those are things that we\u2019ve gotten better at in the last two years. Sort of mid-August, there was a timeframe that there were some changes going on in the pricing environment, which I am not going to talk about in detail. That did happen and I think are contributing to near -- well, it feels like an inflection point in domestic revenues. There probably was an inflection point in mid-August as some of the pricing environment started to change at a number of airlines across the country.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Scott, I know you talked a little bit about the various international markets but maybe just taking a step back, can you just talk about international broadly and whether or not you think overall, as we look into maybe next year, there is a path to just yields being stable or do you think international would maybe offset some of the opportunity that you\u2019ve talked about on the domestic side?", "Scott Kirby", "We\u2019d kind of have to go through it region-by-region. So, I\u2019ll start with the best, the Latin America. Latin America is going to be positive of both yield and RASM in the fourth quarter. So, we feel really good about that market. Again the Pacific, I think the capacity story is going to get better as we go through 2017. So, while I don\u2019t have the best forecast, if I just had to make my best guess today, we will get the positive yield across the Pacific at some point in 2017. And across the Atlantic, it\u2019s still going to be a struggle; it depends on what happens with capacity; in that entity, lots of uncertainty is still around Brexit and what\u2019s going to happen there. So, I think that will get positive and two of the three entities and the third one is really a question mark based on what happens in the capacity. ", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Andrew, just a quick question for you. Towards the end of your prepared remarks, you made a statement about I think reviewing CapEx across commitments, et cetera. Can you just talk about what some of the range of opportunities ahead are and maybe some of the things we can look for?", "Andrew Levy", "Sorry. I was -- I thought you were headed to the guidance. You\u2019re talking about more broadly, right?", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Right.", "Andrew Levy", "Yes, I think everything is an opportunity if -- and we\u2019re going to look at everything, everything that hasn\u2019t been let\u2019s call it committed. Clearly, we have plans; we made commitments. But as an example on the fleet side, there is a window of opportunity to be able to make changes once you get within let\u2019s call it a year of delivery, then you\u2019re stuck. But we\u2019re certainly looking at fleet plan, we\u2019re looking at a lot of our CapEx projects that we\u2019re making whether we plan to make, think about making and not just reviewing it from top to bottom to see if we like what we\u2019ve got coming down the pipe and will make changes wherever we think it\u2019s appropriate. I think one example would be mix of new and used aircraft. We\u2019ve already started bringing in some used A319s and we acquired at attractive rates. We\u2019re going to continue to keep eye out for high quality used aircraft to blend into the mix of the fleet here. So, wherever we can find those types of opportunities to reduce capital intensity, we\u2019re going to try and take advantage of that. So nothing specific to talk about at the moment. We\u2019ll talk to you again on November 15th and if there is changes to be made, we will discuss at that time.", "Operator", "From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Scott, a few years ago, you said 87% of your customers at American flew less than one time a year and represented about half of your revenue, or about -- the flip side of that, making up half of your revenue. So, can you say, did those statistics look materially different at United? Have you had a chance to study that customer base?", "Scott Kirby", "So, somebody has showed me the number and I\u2019ve looked at it little different but it\u2019s 85% here. And it is close to half the revenue.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "And then just to stay with you, Scott; sorry to the others and look forward to spending more time with you in November. With respect to your regional aircraft strategy, you had a captive regional at American. Just with respect to your early impressions, is it fair to say that United has not been as proactive as it could have been from a regional aircraft strategy? If we look back over the last few quarters, regional capacity is down materially and you are growing on the mainline. And I am just wondering is this optimal/ideal or has this been a function of supply constraints on the regional side?", "Scott Kirby", "Our constraints on regional side at United are about the pilot contract and the scope. And we are growing it but we will be getting to the scope maximum. I think it\u2019s fair to also say that one of the things we will likely do over time is use our regional supply and more of what you would think of a traditional regional markets and less in big markets. So, today we fly a lot of hub-to-hub between Dallas and Chicago or between Denver and Dallas; we fly regional jets. And that\u2019s something that is unique about United that will likely change. In hub-to-hub markets, we\u2019ll fly bigger airplanes and we\u2019ll use our originals to go fly into places that are smaller cities but that generate higher yielding connecting revenues for the network. I do think it\u2019s an opportunity.", "Andrew Levy", "Can I add? This is Andrew. Let me add, we -- Duane, there has been a plan in place for a while to reduce the number of 50-seaters for economic reasons. And so, I think part of what you are seeing is just that plan continuing to play itself out as 50-seaters are reduced. So, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve been less proactive. I think there is a plan. We\u2019re in the middle of reshaping regional fleet and that will continue as we move forward in the next several quarters.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "And then, just wanted to touch on Brazil. One of your competitors noted a 30% RASM increase in the third quarter. The shape of their capacity is a little bit different than the shape of yours, but wonder if you could comment what your RASM was up in Brazil and specifically how much of that was in August Olympic spike, versus a steady trend over the course of the quarter?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, not that I focus on trying to beat the guys in Atlanta, I did by the way but that was about 31%. And a big chunk of that was the -- would have been the Olympic -- I don\u2019t know the exact number here at United. But as we look out to the fourth quarter, at least we expect yields to be somewhere between 20% and 30%. So, I think that\u2019s a real recovery. The Olympics gave us that kick start but it also led -- maybe because of the Olympics that led us to real pricing changes. The pricing environment to Brazil is far, far better than it was just a few months ago. And that happened sort of around the time that you\u2019re going to Olympics and maybe that\u2019s what caused it but it stuck. So, Brazil is much improved.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Thanks and just to clarify, that 20% to 30% is off of the trough or that\u2019s year-over-year.", "Scott Kirby", "That\u2019s year-over-year.", "Operator", "From Bank of America we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Didora", "A lot of my questions have been answered, but Andrew, I just wanted to touch upon capital allocation a little bit. Obviously the buybacks slowed dramatically in 3Q but you did reiterate your focus on capital returns in your prepared remarks. I guess when we look at 2017, you have higher labor costs, a new fuel curve, increasing your expenses, free cash flow takes a hit as CapEx steps up. So, how do you balance this capital return strategy with much lower free cash flow next year? And do you feel comfortable with higher leverage from here or what is the leverage to keep this strategy going?", "Andrew Levy", "At the moment we\u2019re not considering adding leverage to the balance sheet. That being said, we are going to be reviewing it in more detail in the coming quarters with our Board and look at that where we think it makes sense. But at the moment, we think having a very strong balance sheet is critical. We\u2019re very comfortable with our debt levels at the moment and our liquidity. As you noted, we do have some issues that we need to get comfortable with as we look into 2017. Higher labor expenses, higher fuel curve are certainly the two important things. And as such, I think that it\u2019s likely that the pace of any buyback is going to be probably a little more similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the last quarter, certainly than what we saw in the first quarter where we repurchased 1.5 billion of shares. So, stay tuned. I think we look at that as excess cash and we have excess cash how do we return it to our shareholders. And we\u2019ll take into account all the drivers and the business as we look forward and first and foremost make sure that we maintain a very-very strong balance sheet, which we think is a huge competitive advantage that we care deeply about.", "Andrew Didora", "So, I guess with the earnings inflection next year, would we expect additional debt pay down to keep occurring at United?", "Andrew Levy", "Well, we have -- I don\u2019t believe we have any opportunities to reduce our debt next year other than just by simply making our payments. We have some unsecured that\u2019s due in I think \u201818 and \u201819, we have number of EETC transactions that pay down according to the initial schedules. So, I think that at the moment, we don\u2019t see any big opportunities to just reduce the debt levels but we\u2019re very comfortable with where they are. We certainly are going to be mindful to keep it conservative. That doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t look at more leverage. But as we sit here right now getting our arms around the business and trying to come up with a game plan as we go forward which we\u2019ll share a lot of that in a month from now, I don\u2019t expect any significant changes in at least in the next quarter.", "Operator", "From Raymond James we have Savi Syth. Please go ahead.", "Savi Syth", "Just a quick question on the business or the corporate side, just wondering if you could provide color on just what volumes, how they\u2019ve been trending. And also in the oil and gas sector, I know the drag in 3Q, it was a bit lower than you had anticipated heading into the quarter but I was wondering if that was just seeing the demand recover or that was just better capacity rationalization in Houston and other markets?", "Julia Haywood", "In terms of domestic, actually the closing corporate bookings have really been strengthening and even as we look back to the third quarter, as we talked before, the strength of our domestic routes going positive. We actually saw really steady upward trajectory on sequential year-over-year PRASM for business, specifically actually in the corporate. So hopefully that answers your first question. Energy on the second part.", "Scott Kirby", "Energy was down 14% in the quarter.", "Savi Syth", "And I think it came in better than expected, right? I am just wondering if that was -- you saw a recovery in demand and just more spending or if that was just a capacity rationalization?", "Julia Haywood", "Yes, it\u2019s pretty much in line with expectations; so, not too much of under over on that one, Savi.", "Savi Syth", "And if I may ask, just on the non-fuel costs, just curious, in 2015 versus 2016, the poor CASM; was there anything in particular that drove the better performance in 2015 versus the performance in 2016? The capacity growth wasn\u2019t significantly different. So, I was just curious as to the variance there.", "Andrew Levy", "To be clear, Savi, are you asking about the fourth quarter projection?", "Savi Syth", "No, full year in 2015 versus 2016 that slide that you had there.", "Andrew Levy", "2015, certainly we had a lot of the results from project quality which drove the material decline in our cost structure we have been able to maintain in the business. But no, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unique to 2015, if that\u2019s your question.", "Operator", "From Stephens we have Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins", "Just going back to the June investor presentation with the $1.1 billion value creation that you guys outlined for the second half of 2016, could you give us a progress report on how much of that has been captured and are you may be expecting some of that to push out into 2017 now that it seems like the team is maybe taking a second look at some of those buckets?", "Scott Kirby", "We\u2019ll probably be able to give you a better update on Investor Day but as I look through the items we are running better operations that we know. That was $100 million or so in 2016. It\u2019s one of those; it\u2019s hard to go back and identify that you actually got it or not but we are definitely running better operation. And whether we get it all in 2016 or something that\u2019s going to come later, we are winning back customers; we are winning back share of high value customers. And that\u2019s something we feel confident that we will -- that we are going to get. Another big chunk is the slimline and upgauge program which I think we are on track with because efficiency stuff we are on track with. I think most -- and MileagePlus was another big one as well. And so those are ones that we know that we -- will be achieved. So I think we are largely on track with the 1.1 billion.", "Jack Atkins", "And then I guess going back to your earlier comments on the international market and then comparing that with what you were seeing domestically. As you look out to 2017, would you expect your consolidated PRASM to turn positive in the first half of next year; is that the message that you guys are trying to send?", "Scott Kirby", "I am not trying to send a specific timing on that message mostly because I don\u2019t know it well enough. I didn\u2019t live the history here at United of last year and kind of -- at least I need to have lived that history to feel confident about the timing. I feel confident that we are headed in that direction and we are going to continue to make improvement in every quarter but I just can\u2019t today give you what the high level of confidence when I think we are going to cross the zero thresholds.", "Operator", "Thank you. I will now turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thank you, Brandon and thank you all for joining the call today. Please contact Investor Relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Please go ahead.", "Julie Yates Stewart", "Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information on yesterday\u2019s release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company\u2019s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.", "All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors. Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures.

Pleased to have you here and thank you all for joining us on our call this morning. Our fourth quarter financial and operating performance capped what we think is an outstanding year for our airline.", "In 2016, we we put into action our plan to become the best airline in the world and last year\u2019s results demonstrate we\u2019re well on our way to achieving that goal. We plan to continue delivering on this commitment by investing in employees, elevating our customer experience and driving strong and consistent returns for our shareholders.", "If you turn to Slide 4, let\u2019s review the year. We reported pre-tax earnings of $4.5 billion with a pre-tax margin of 12.2%, both excluding special items. For the year, we earned $8.65 per share, a 13% increase over 2015, adjusting for book taxes as a result of $2.6 billion of share repurchases in the year.", "Before going into greater detail on the financial results, I want to review key accomplishments in the year, which was a year of transmission for us here at United. Notably, we ratified new industry-leading labor agreements for all United employee groups, starting a new chapter in how we build a partnership between management and labor while driving higher employee engagement.", "We also continue to build upon an industry-leading leadership team, a critical step forward in our progress as an agile and innovative leader in the industry. We delivered significant improvements operationally, substantially increasing our reliability and customer satisfaction, as well as achieving the best on-time performance in our history and delivering the most zero cancelation days ever.", "We opened several new international routes to key growing markets, introduced the new United Polaris service, the biggest product innovation for us in more than a decade. And importantly, we outlined the future direction of our company at our November Investor Day, laying out a longer-term plan for earnings growth through a number of strategic initiatives across the airline that we expect to generate significant improvements by the year 2020.", "I couldn\u2019t go on without personally thanking all of our employees for their hard work and commitment in achieving these milestones. More recently, I\u2019d like to extend my gratitude for the great work that was done during the busy holiday season. And so with a shared purpose comes shared success, and of course, with that success comes a shared benefit. So I\u2019m pleased to announce that due to our strong financial performance, United employees will be able to share in the success as we payout $628 million in profit-sharing for the year. Above all, I believe we\u2019ve begun to change the conversation about United from the question what\u2019s wrong to an optimistic what\u2019s next and that has been the most powerful change of all.", "With that, let me turn over to our President, Scott Kirby.", "Scott Kirby", "Thank you, Oscar. I\u2019d like to start by thanking our employees for their hard work over a busy holiday season. In 2016, the United team delivered new all-time records for departure performance, arrival performance, completion factor and baggage handling. Over the holidays, we also set new all-time records for essentially all of our operating metrics and the people of United played a critical role in connecting family and friends during the holidays. In order to continue improving operational performance in 2017, our top focus will be on further improvements in completion factor and departure performance.", "Turning to revenue, our consolidated PRASM declined 1.6% for the quarter. We outperformed our guidance as we went through the quarter, given stronger than expected business traffic in December. If we\u2019re going to miss our guidance range, we certainly prefer to miss like this on the upside. In our view, both the demand and the pricing environment got meaningfully better post-election and that strong demand trend, particularly for business travel continued through the fourth quarter and on into the first quarter.", "Looking forward, we anticipate first quarter consolidated PRASM to be flat at the midpoint of our guidance range, marking the fourth straight quarter of second derivative improvement. We saw strong within-quarter growth in the Atlantic, Latin, and domestic regions. The only region that didn\u2019t outperform our original expectations was the Pacific driven by significant capacity growth from both the industry and United.", "During the first quarter, we\u2019re currently forecasting flat to up domestic unit revenue growth. We expect the Atlantic and Pacific roughly similar year-over-year first quarter PRASM as we saw in the fourth quarter. We expect Latin PRASM to be up, but currently expected to be slightly less than what was in the fourth quarter based on the Easter shift and the fact that our Latin comps get a little harder in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to our 2017 capacity outlook, we expect our first quarter capacity growth to be up 1% to 2% consistent with our full-year 2017 capacity guidance provided at Investor Day. As shown in Slide 9, we expect that growth to be biased towards higher domestic growth.", "On Slide 10, we have provided a brief update on some of our near-term commercial initiatives. We\u2019re working on the network changes and expect to begin implementing changes in Chicago, Houston, and New York later this year. We\u2019re excited to be rolling out later \u2013 Basic Economy later this quarter for travel beginning in the second quarter and our new Polaris product has been a hit with customers and we\u2019re excited and anxious to continue the Polaris rollout as quickly as we can.", "And finally, we continue to work hard on the revenue management system. In conclusion, it sure feels like the revenue environment turned the corner in the first \u2013 in the fourth quarter and assuming that continues, we are looking forward to positive PRASM for 2017.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew to go over the financial results.", "Andrew Levy", "Thanks, Scott. Yesterday afternoon, we released our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings, as well as our first quarter Investor Update. I\u2019ll discuss both our results and outlook today at a high level, but please refer to those documents for additional detail.", "Slide 12 shows a summary of our GAAP financials, and Slide 13 has non-GAAP or our economic results. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.78, up 8.5% year-over-year on a tax-adjusted basis.", "For the full-year, we earned $8.65 per share, which is a 13% increase year-over-year again on a tax-adjusted basis. Excluding special items, we generated $4.5 billion of pre-tax income, basically flat compared with 2015, and a 12.2% margin, which was slightly higher than the 11.9% margin reported in 2015.", "Slide 14 details our cost performance in the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. While labor rate increases created upward cost pressure. We did a very good job managing the rest of our cost to a flat core CASM growth, which exceeded our initial internal expectations.", "Turning to our 2017 cost outlook on Slide 15, we expect our first quarter non-fuel unit costs, excluding special items, profit-sharing, and third-party expenses to increase between 4.5% and 5.5%, with 4 points of this growth due to the ratified labor agreements for 2016.", "Our 2017 full-year guidance of 3.5% to 4.5% non-fuel unit cost growth is unchanged. We expect core cost growth to be less than 1% in 2017 by meeting the cost savings targets, as highlighted at our Investor Day.", "Based on guidance, we\u2019ve provided for costs and revenues in the first quarter of 2017, we expect our pre-tax margin, excluding special items to be between 1.5% and 2.5%. Please note, our first quarter is historically our weakest quarter of the year, which is due to the structure of our route network.", "In addition, this year\u2019s first quarter is even tougher, as it will be a high watermark in terms of non-fuel unit cost growth due to the timing of labor rate increases and the pressure we\u2019re seeing from materially higher fuel costs.", "Turning to Slide 16, we ended 2016 with $5.8 billion of unrestricted cash, including our $1.35 billion revolver, which remains untapped. As of the end of the year, our gross debt balance, including capitalized operating leases was $16.5 billion, about $600 million less than at the end of 2015. In 2016, we generated $5.5 billion of operating cash flow and $2.2 billion of free cash flow. Maintaining a strong balance sheet remains the top strategic priority.", "During 2016, we invested $2.6 billion to repurchase 15 million shares at an average price of approximately $52 per share. In the fourth quarter, we invested $156 million, repurchasing our shares at an average of $59 per share. Since the beginning of our share repurchase program in 2014, we\u2019ve invested over $4 billion, purchasing approximately 80 million shares, which has reduced our outstanding shares by approximately 20%. We currently have just over $1.8 billion remaining of repurchase authority and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders.", "With respect to CapEx, we\u2019re reiterating our 2017 guidance to capital expenditures of between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, with approximately $1.1 billion from non-aircraft CapEx. Please note our aircraft CapEx is elevated this year as we have 15 widebody deliveries scheduled. We have secured financing for all, but a few mainline aircraft deliveries in 2017 through the two EETC transactions we concluded last year and are currently exploring options to finance the 24 Embraer 175 aircraft, which will deliver during this year.", "Regarding our fleet, we maintain flexibility and are further exploring, both our widebody and narrowbody fleets and order book plans. Last week, we announced our plans to move up by one year the retirement of our 747 fleet. This decision was mostly driven by our desire to simplify our operations where possible and enhance fleet and operational reliability. We will now retire all 20 remaining 747s by year-end, but there\u2019s no change to capacity or CapEx, as a result of the earlier retirement timeline.", "Our 14 new 777-300ERs, two of which we accepted in December of 2016 and the remaining, which will come in the first-half of 2017 will essentially backfill the 747 capacity and routes. As we refine our fleet needs and explore how best to achieve them, we\u2019re actively seeking opportunities in the used aircraft market. Our fleet review is a work in progress and we will update you later this year when we have something to share.", "In conclusion, 2016 was a very good year for United as seen in our financial metrics. Moving to 2017, we have challenges in the resetting of our labor agreements, as well as higher fuel costs. However, as we believe, we have great opportunities as outlined at our Investor Day and we look forward to beginning to execute on those plans.", "I\u2019ll now turn it back to Oscar for closing remarks.", "Oscar Munoz", "Thank you, Andrew. Let me just close by saying, we\u2019re excited about 2017. We have the strategy and certainly the structure in place to deliver on all our commitments to not only employees and customers, but to you as investors as well.", "So with that, let\u2019s turn it over to Julie and we\u2019ll get to Q&A.", "Julie Yates Stewart", "Thank you, Oscar. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from media. But please limit yourself to one question and as need one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Julie, and the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line. Please go ahead.", "Hunter Keay", "Hey, good morning. Thank you. Scott, is the share system giving you the tools that you need to execute the vision for United in both the immediate term and the long-term? And is it a permanent solution for United, or is an RFP for a new PSS inevitable at some point in the next one to three years?", "Scott Kirby", "Shares is a good fundamental foundation and architecture. We can make it a lot better for our people by putting a better front-end on it. But it is our reservation system. It\u2019s not limiting anything we do from a revenue perspective or anything like that. It\u2019s just sometimes a little clunkier to use for our people than some \u2013 than perhaps we can make it. We have a number of systems where our IT team now that they\u2019re through the integration work is hard at work on actually making the interfaces easier for people to use. But you shouldn\u2019t expect us to be changing shares and it\u2019s not a limiting factor for us at all.", "Hunter Keay", "Great. Thank you. And then also for you, Scott, as you forge ahead with sort of a top to bottom review of how things are done at United, how are you thinking about, again, this is a near-term and long-term question about the business relationship that you guys have with your GDS providers? And the specific question is, do you envision a scenario at some point in the next couple of years, where you continue to disaggregate your services and maybe push towards a partial content agreement with, at least, one major GDS provider? Is that something that you would really highly value in the medium-term as something you think you can get? Thanks.", "Scott Kirby", "I\u2019m not a 100% sure how the situation will evolve. There\u2019s the potential for GDSes to be partners, that has to be a balanced relationship if they\u2019re going to be partners. It historically hasn\u2019t been what I would describe as a partnership, it\u2019s been a lot more one way. We do have more and more customers coming directly to us. But we recognize that there are some things that some of our customers like to use the GDS for.", "In an ideal world, we\u2019d get to a balanced relationship, where the GDSes were fairly compensated for what they add, but that it was fairly compensated and the customers actually had the choice of whether to go direct or whether to use the GDS. I think it\u2019s also incredibly important. One of the big things that we\u2019re going to be pushing on in the near-term is to get adequate disclosure to our customers when they buy through GDS.", "So we\u2019re going to be rolling out Basic Economy later this quarter and starting travel in the second quarter. To me, the most important thing that we\u2019re going to need to do on that is communicate to our customers. And I assure you, on united.com, we\u2019re going to have a very clear communications about what the rules and restrictions are. And I think it\u2019s going to be really hard to go through and buy on united.com and not know exactly what the rules and restrictions are.", "We want all of our other entities that sell United tickets to do the same thing. And we want customers to know for sure what they\u2019re buying and the GDSes can play an important role in that, hasn\u2019t historically been the top of their investment list, but we need them to do that. And if we can create a relationship, where they\u2019re effectively communicating that and we have a cost structure that is fair and balanced, I think we can continue to evolve on the path that we\u2019re on, but and actually that with those caveats.", "Oscar Munoz", "And this is Oscar, I\u2019d just add on, over the course of the year, this conversation has been going on with many other partners in our distribution process with regards to how we want to move forward together with the emphasis on together and with the end customer in mind as well. And so you will see some evolution and changes going forward, but again all with an open amicable conversational sort of tone as we move forward in our partnership.", "Hunter Keay", "That\u2019s great. Helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.", "Michael Linenberg", "Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Scott, you\u2019ve called out the Easter impact, I think when you were talking about LatAm PRASM.", "Scott Kirby", "Yes.", "Michael Linenberg", "What is it across the system? What is the impact on a network basis? How should we think about that the way Easter falls this year?", "Scott Kirby", "I think we\u2019d say that the Easter impact is probably about \u2013 for the quarter about 30 basis points negative. My guess is, it\u2019s going to be 40 basis points positive for the second quarter, something like that. Having Easter fall on April hurts the first quarter revenue a little bit, but helps the second quarter more. The impact is bigger \u2013 that impact is a bigger shift for Latin than for the other entities, domestic is also reasonably big. But it\u2019s not a huge issue either way.", "Michael Linenberg", "Okay, very good. And then just with respect to the moves in FX, what was that impact on the Pacific in the fourth quarter? Do you have that? And how does that potentially change in the March quarter, because we\u2019ve seen a lot of Pacific currencies go the wrong way, where I feel like\u2026", "Scott Kirby", "Yes.", "Michael Linenberg", "\u2026some of the Latin currencies have gone the right way over the last four or five months?", "Scott Kirby", "So I don\u2019t have a perfect \u2013 a really good number for you here. But I think it was about a 1.5 point negative impact in the fourth quarter, and I don\u2019t have a number for what the first quarter would be. But obviously, the stronger dollar is going to be the negative and that\u2019s been bigger in the Pacific than other regions.", "Michael Linenberg", "Okay, very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess this is for Oscar or Scott. Can you just give us an idea of line of sight on margin improvement, because I think the volatility is obviously hurting investor views of airline stocks right now? So obviously with fuel down the last two \u2013 couple of years, you\u2019ve had very high margins. We know the resets in the labor contracts. But can you talk about your expectations for the interactions on some of these operational improvements and revenue and commercial improvements in the system and when you think you can get back to those levels of profitability?", "Oscar Munoz", "Hey, Brandon, this is Oscar. I\u2019ll just kick it off real quickly and probably hand it over to Andrew to just quickly recap and remind what we talked about at our Investor Day that we have more than several initiatives with regards to our margin improvement and the aspiration again to be leading in that space by the year 2020. So Scott, Andrew, maybe you can just remind him of a couple of the items that we\u2019re working through?", "Andrew Levy", "Yes, I mean, I think you mentioned a couple of specific items, including operational integrity and the benefits thereof. And I think that everything, as Oscar mentioned, were pushing down the path that we outlined at Investor Day, and we\u2019re making progress and doing what we said we\u2019d do. Obviously, a lot of these are longer lead time items. And we\u2019re kind of at the very beginning stages of beginning to execute on them and we expect to see a lot of positives that come from that.", "Oscar Munoz", "Yes, broader conversation that will ensue, I think as we discussed as a team is, someone like me coming from the outside with regards to PRASM and CASM and the focus on that at various times. I have to say the last time I checked businesses run on, at the end of the day margins and that\u2019s something we\u2019re really focused on. So hopefully, that gives you a little clarity or at least support in that, that\u2019s kind of our focus on improving margin. Thanks, Brandon.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "From Raymond James, we have Savanthi Syth online. Please go ahead.", "Savanthi Syth", "Hey, good morning. Just on the Pacific, another question. I understand that FX is an unknown headwind, but I was wondering what your expectations are for the performance in that entity as we go through this year, when we might see some of those supply issues kind of moderate and maybe might get to positive PRASM there?", "Scott Kirby", "So, you\u2019re right. I think the supply issues are bigger than the current issues. And supply gets better in the \u2013 a little bit better in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter and then second quarter gets better again and we expect the third and fourth quarters to get better.", "So the first-half of the year is going to have a lot of supply pressure. But the bilaterals, the amount of flying available, at least, from Beijing and Shanghai to the U.S. from China is \u2013 and the China bilateral is done, is filled by the time we get to the first-half of the year.", "So our expectation is that things will start to improve all else equal in the second-half. I don\u2019t know for sure we\u2019ll turn to positive PRASM, but certainly the second derivative will \u2013 should be a positive \u2013 should be positive just from a supply perspective moving forward.", "Savanthi Syth", "Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And if I \u2013 along those same lines on the Atlantic side, I know much has been said about ULCCs. But it seems like and maybe one of your partners, Air Canada, is adding a lot of or has a lot of goals for the Transatlantic and wanting to be kind of a connecting hub and is adding a lot of capacity. Is that \u2013 at what \u2013 I mean, is that an issue and at what point do you need to respond to that?", "Scott Kirby", "I think I\u2019m going to not be able to answer that question very directly, because we compete with across the board. We need to be competitive with everyone. Sometimes those airlines need to be competitive with our partners, sometimes they\u2019re not. And we are sensitive to anyone, that\u2019s a competitive threat issue for us and we will be aggressive about competing with all of them. But I can\u2019t talk specifically about anything we\u2019re planning to do with regard to Air Canada.", "Savanthi Syth", "All right. Got it. Well, thank you.", "Operator", "From Bernstein, we have David Vernon. Please go ahead.", "David Vernon", "Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Andrew, I guess, I was wondering if you could provide a little commentary around where you\u2019re expecting free cash flow to end up this year relative to the $2.2 billion last year and how much of the buyback you think you can get done in 2017?", "Andrew Levy", "Well, we provided you a CapEx estimate for this year, but we\u2019re not going to provide you with a full-year earnings target. So I\u2019m not sure, I can really answer that question. As far as repurchase of shares, as I mentioned, we\u2019re committed to returning excess cash to shareholders.", "We\u2019re certainly not going to kind of telegraph how we\u2019re going to do that as far as the pace or the price or anything of that nature. But we do remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We have $1.8 billion of authority remaining and we expect to execute all that. I don\u2019t know if it will all be in 2017 or not, I think it just depends on a variety of factors.", "David Vernon", "Would you be willing to supplement some of the free cash from operations with a little more leverage, or are you comfortable with where the balance sheet is right now?", "Andrew Levy", "We\u2019re very comfortable with where the balance sheet is in general. I wouldn\u2019t close the door out on being opportunistic in the debt market. We\u2019re always going to remain opportunistic. But we think that our balance sheet is very good. It has improved a great deal. We\u2019re very happy where it is. And I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any significant changes to the composition of the capital structure.", "David Vernon", "Okay. And then maybe just one last one on the retirement of the 747s. Are you expecting any sort of meaningful cost tailwind from that as you kind of close out that fleet type in 2018, or any sort of write-down that would follow that, or is it going to be kind of more normal course and folded into normal cost inflation?", "Andrew Levy", "No, there\u2019s not going to be any incremental write-down expense, at least, I mean very small perhaps. But for the most part, we\u2019ve already accelerated depreciation of that asset, and so the change from this year to next year is pretty immaterial.", "As far as tailwinds, look, I think that modern equipment is far more efficient and that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re making the decision we\u2019re making is not only for efficiency, but also the operational reliability, which has an effect on both revenue and cost that should be positive by retiring those aircraft and replacing them with modern equipment.", "So I think you\u2019re right that\u2019s probably a 2018 benefit that we\u2019ll see as we continue to fly these aircraft through the third, or I guess, through the third quarter, end of the fourth quarter this year.", "David Vernon", "Excellent. Thanks a lot for your time, guys.", "Andrew Levy", "Thanks.", "Oscar Munoz", "Before we go to the next one, I just want to provide some additional color, I guess, with regards to part of David\u2019s question with regards to sort of forecast or guidance. At United, we\u2019re focused on transparency. Guidance in itself will take many forms and it will serve a purpose for us, bare with us as we sort of come together on the things that we think are important for you to understand and know about us, we\u2019ll provide those.", "In the areas that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s as critical, we will not provide that guidance. Just from a standpoint, I think, as Andrew said, we want to be opportunistic in certain things like repurchases. But also we want to make sure that we\u2019re running the best possible business at all times for the value of shareholders and sometimes guidance gets in a way of that. So you know the story. Again transparency is our objective and focus. You are not always going to get the specific guidance that you want. So just a broad statement. Turn it back over to you.", "Operator", "From Stifel, we have Joe DeNardi. Please go ahead.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Yes, thanks. Oscar, to that point, I guess and maybe this is a question for Scott or Andrew. Just looking at your Investor Day slides, you\u2019ve got MileagePlus adding about $650 million in EBIT cumulatively by 2018 and that compares to 2015. I would imagine that out of all the initiatives there is probably the most visibility into the credit card. My question is can you tell us what the starting EBIT number was for 2015. How much did MileagePlus contribute to EBIT in 2015?", "Scott Kirby", "No, we aren\u2019t going to disclose that.", "Oscar Munoz", "That one is just a no.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Okay. Can I ask, I guess, what are the obvious reasons? If you\u2019ve got this segment of the business that\u2019s enormously profitable and you are trying to convince investors that the airline is different and the earnings and cash flow are more sustainable, why not help us understand the aspect of the business that is vastly different now than it was 10 years ago?", "Andrew Levy", "I think, Joe, this is Andrew. That is something that we\u2019re certainly has been \u2013 something I\u2019ve been talking about since I joined the company. It\u2019s \u2013 MileagePlus is incredibly powerful very valuable. We\u2019re not at this point in time ready to disclose the types of information that you\u2019re looking for, doesn\u2019t mean we may not get there, but we\u2019re not going to get there today on this call. We do agree it\u2019s a real important part of our business and we share your view that it is perhaps underappreciated by investors. So agree in general with your thesis and we\u2019ll see as we move ahead as to how we want to approach that.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Citigroup, we have Kevin Crissey online. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Crissey", "Good morning, everybody. Looking at your core unit costs, excluding newly ratified agreements, which is a quasi-new metric, if we look at the things that your costs exclude \u2013 so it excludes fuel, labor deals, third-party business, profit-sharing and special charges, it doesn\u2019t leave that much left.", "So if I look at like ownership costs, whether it be rent or depreciation, landing fees, maintenance, distribution and the big category of other, what would you say of that core group of expenses, what is the natural inflation rate and you\u2019ve guided to what your inflation \u2013 unit inflation rate is here?", "And what is it that you are doing in those line items to have that core inflation rate be lower than it would be if it were just naturally inflating, because I think like depreciation not having a particularly high inflation rate, aircraft rent maybe less so, landing fees kind of out of your control? What is it in your control within that core unit cost, excluding newly ratified agreements? Thanks.", "Andrew Levy", "Yes, to comment on the cost ex this that and the other, keep in mind the third-party is a very small number. Profit-sharing, we like to strip out and show it just because it can move fairly materially, so we like to try to highlight that. This year, we\u2019re trying to kind of isolate the labor cost agreements, or the labor agreements and the cost associated with it just because it is a pretty significant cost driver for the year.", "So as far as all the remaining cost attributes, I don\u2019t think I give you a natural rate of inflation in total. I just haven\u2019t thought of it that way. We\u2019re going after every single line item that we believe, where we can become more efficient whether it\u2019s maintenance, whether it\u2019s station operations. You\u2019re right landing fees, we don\u2019t control. But to some extent, as you upguage typically that drives a positive effect in terms of profitability although it maybe a little higher on landed weight, certainly airport facilities cost, we\u2019re trying to find ways, we can be more efficient. Distribution, same thing, Scott, touched on that earlier. So there are a lot of opportunities there that that we\u2019re going after.", "Overall, if you exclude the items noted, we\u2019re expecting CASM growth in 2017 to be effectively flat, which we\u2019re very, very confident and been able to achieve that. And we expect to hopefully continue down that path in future years as well. I think we talked about that a little bit at Investor Day.", "Kevin Crissey", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.", "Daniel McKenzie", "Oh, hey, good morning. Thanks, guys. Andrew, circling back on the balance sheet, could you update us on the principle debt that comes due this year? Just based on the last data point I have, it seems leverage should increase somewhat this year. But just setting this year aside, how should we think about that leverage, kind of the gross leverage trajectory over the coming one to three years?", "Andrew Levy", "Dan, we\u2019re trying to identify the actual principle repayment amount for this year. Pardon me, I think $850 million, yes, about $850 million. You\u2019re right by the way though, we do expect that it probably will increase this year as we take all these aircraft that are coming due, much of the purchase price greater than half is going to be financed with debt that will go in the balance sheet.", "And we have a few debt instruments that would be coming due over the balance of the next few years secured \u2013 of an unsecured line, excuse me, actually two unsecureds and a term loan. But those are not due for another due to 2018 or 2019. So you\u2019re directionally right though that we will be adding a little bit of leverage just a type two aircraft deliveries and the financing of those assets.", "Daniel McKenzie", "I see. And then from the investor update, it looks like United is going to continue to retire the 50-seat RJs here, and that\u2019s a continuing theme. Any perspective you can give us on sort of the pace or rate of these 50-seat RJs as we get past 2017? It seems like the fleet restructuring part of the story, the densification, is an important part of the story here. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us a little bit more perspective on how we should think about that.", "Oscar Munoz", "Dan, I\u2019ll start maybe Scott can add onto it. We \u2013 just to clarify, we do not intend to retire the 50-seat fleet. We are decreasing the number of 50-seaters. But we believe the 50 seater has a long-term place in our network. As we look at our fleet plan, I talked about narrowbodies and widebodies, the regional aircraft is part of that equation as well. We\u2019re looking at what is the optimal number of 50-seaters. We know the optimal number of 70, 76-seaters is maxing out our scope clause limitations, which we talked about at our Investor Day. And we are also in the process of getting out of the smaller regional jet 37-seaters, which some of which are leaving this year and some of which, I believe are leaving next year.", "So more to come on that on fleet, as we continue our valuation of the network in the fleet that we need in order to optimize our profitability and we\u2019ll update you as soon as we have more share and that\u2019s good, yes.", "Daniel McKenzie", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.", "Darryl Genovesi", "All right. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for the time. Hey, Oscar, in the middle of last year, you had announced the start of a comprehensive hub-and-spoke review. Should we think of that as for all intents and purposes now being done and incorporated into Scott\u2019s message from the Investor Day, or is that something that\u2019s still ongoing?", "Oscar Munoz", "I think there was an initial thrust to get a lot of the facts and data and sort of a general sense of direction. I think the new team has been working with that as a base. And I think while it never is actually culminating because we are always in a dynamic world. I think, Scott\u2019s latest version of it is probably the more specific focus we\u2019re taking right now.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Okay. So I guess the \u2013 if I could call it a conclusion, the conclusion would be that the current up-structure is \u2013 it already is optimal based on everything you know today?", "Scott Kirby", "Yes. I suspect you\u2019re trying to ask are we going to close a hub and the answer is no.", "Oscar Munoz", "No.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Okay. And then I guess just a quick one for Andrew. Would you provide the year-end pension deficit and also the NOL balance?", "Andrew Levy", "Yes, the NOL balance at year-end 2016 was approximately $4.3 billion, and the pension unfunded amount at the end of 2016 was approximately $1.8 billion.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Great. Thanks very much, guys.", "Andrew Levy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Thanks for the time. Scott, a couple of quick ones for you. One, just on Basic Economy being rolled out here in the coming months for you and the folks over at American. How impactful could something like that be to the environment?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, if you go back to our Investor Day commentary, which we think segmentation, this year is going to be worth $250 million, and we have good at $550 million for next year and going to a $1 billion by 2020. My personal view is those numbers are conservative, so that we\u2019re going to be better than that. But that\u2019s our \u2013 that remains our official forecast, nothing has happened because as to change that anyway.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Okay. And then that $250 million or so, that\u2019s mostly just Basic Economy this year, or is some of the other stuff coming into play?", "Scott Kirby", "Correct.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Okay.", "Scott Kirby", "That\u2019s all Basic Economy this year.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "It is? Great. And then Scott, you\u2019ve historically done a very, I guess, honest job of providing your view on positive PRASM and so on. Seems like we\u2019re there today. Do you think it\u2019s sustainable as you look forward? Can you continue to get better and what are some of the biggest risk items that you are keeping an eye on to make sure that that path remains?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, look, it feels like we are on a really good path that \u2013 it helps to me like there was an inflection point after the election for business demand. Business demand really got stronger virtually across the board. If you combine that with the world where fuel prices are going up, and I think a lot of airlines then start raising fares. So the pricing environment has improved \u2013 is improving. At the same time, I expect that\u2019s going to continue. There\u2019s lots of unknown risks that are out there.", "We\u2019ll see what happens with the economy and with confident post-transition, post-migration and transition. We certainly feel good today. But our \u2013 and our outlook is really based on the world continue to look much like it does today and assuming that happens. I think we\u2019re going to be a positive PRASM this quarter, certainly next quarter, things would be better in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis and then again \u2013 to get again on the third quarter, I think better.", "Fourth quarter comps are a little harder, but we\u2019re pretty optimistic about the year, as we look out. And as Basic Economy rolls in, it will start to even overcome, I think, some of those comp issues, where the comps get harder by the fourth quarter, the Basic Economy will be a countervailing balance to that. So kind of sitting here today, I think each quarter is going to continue to get better. We\u2019ll see second derivative improvement throughout the year.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Very helpful as always. Thank you, Scott.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Baker", "Hey, good morning, everybody. Scott, in the fourth quarter, you outperformed Delta RASM in each of your operating divisions, but based on the first quarter guide, you expect that trend to reverse despite having easier comps in Q1 relative to Q4. So what\u2019s driving that reversal and is it possible that both airlines can be correct with their guides, or do you view them as fundamentally at odds with one another?", "Scott Kirby", "Yes. So first, I would disagree with the statement that, we\u2019re expecting to do worse than Delta in the next quarter. So I recognize our two guidance points are there, which gets to another point. I mean, in this industry and on calls like this, we spent a lot of time focused on our forecast of guidance and the two point PRASM ranges that all of us get. I bet if you go back and look at history, I bet we miss it 40% of the time. The reason is, because we don\u2019t have good visibility into the balance of the quarter.", "Now, I will just give you a little bit of perspective on it. In the fourth quarter, when we were on our earnings call, our, our booked RASM for December was down something like 18% to 19%. So we were 18% to 19% behind, and we were forecasting that we were going to end the month down to 4, that\u2019s calendar \u2013 day/week adjusted by the way, so it doesn\u2019t tie to other people\u2019s calendar numbers.", "We actually ended the month down about 1.5%, that was a big swing. But when you are down 19% at the time of the earnings call and you\u2019re getting down to 4%, and you say will I actually be down 1.5% or it would be down 7.5%, that\u2019s hard to know.", "Jamie Baker", "Okay.", "Scott Kirby", "And we have poor visibility. In the fourth quarter, we were assuming that December was going to be the weakest \u2013 weaker than October, at least, and it turned out to be better. Delta said on their earnings call for the fourth quarter that they were assuming December was going to be the best, which was different and we turned out to have -- Delta turned out in the fourth quarter to be right on the trajectory and we wound up outperforming them.", "My guess is the same will hold true this quarter. Our current forecast is that January is the best month and that March is the weakest month. March, by the way, is booked 15% behind on PRASM right now. The good news is yield is booked ahead and we are behind on load factor and we are expecting to make that up and get back to close to flat, but there is a lot of room left to go between here and there.", "So my guess is that the real answer to your question is, we are not very good at forecasting, because the data is more variable than we would all like to believe. I would add one other point, that is you sort of hit on it by going by region. It\u2019s interesting to look mathematically at the results for us in the fourth quarter versus Delta, where we beat them on the domestic RASM by 1.5 points, in the Atlantic by 3.1, in the Pacific by 3 and in Latin America by 2.1 points, but overall only by 1.1 points. That\u2019s a little frustrating and it really speaks to the fact that just our geography is different.", "We have less exposure to Latin America, more to the Pacific. That trend is going to continue in the first quarter and probably into the second quarter. The good news is, I think that starts to reverse in the third and fourth quarters and the Pacific hopefully will start to outperform. We will be overlapping Latin America. But our core performance \u2013 in the fourth quarter, we were, in each region, between 1.5 and 3 points better. And hopefully, we\u2019ll produce similar results in the first quarter, but we will see.", "Jamie Baker", "Excellent. I appreciate that. I sense that I may have hit a nerve with that, but the response is very disclosive and very useful. The second question on margins and maybe this is for you Scott, maybe for Andrew. But, as you know, there was no relative improvement in the fourth quarter. You\u2019re not guiding for any relative improvement to either Delta or the industry in the first quarter, that\u2019s fine. The Street actually has your margin gap to Delta getting about twice as bad in 2017.", "So it\u2019s \u2013 the question is, is it still United\u2019s position that we should view 2017 as a transition year? You should be excused from margin mediocrity, or does your plan envision any second-half relative margin strengthening?", "Scott Kirby", "Jamie, you are trying to rub nerves.", "Jamie Baker", "Me?", "Scott Kirby", "What I would say is, first, in 2016, you strip out fuel hedging, so you strip out the fact that Delta lost a bunch of money last year hedging fuel, which is probably the right way to look at it. There was some margin gap closure. It wasn\u2019t big. It was 30 points last year. It was 40 points from 2014 to 2015 versus American, at least, based on assuming fourth quarter hits consensus, and there would have been a 120 basis points improvement versus American 2015 over 2016 and an even bigger improvement 2014 over 2015.", "So there was progress being made. And if you look at our first quarter, we have a headwind, at least, relative to Delta, that our labor cost kick in right away. So we\u2019re going to be up something like, I don\u2019t remember Andrew\u2019s exact number, but 350 basis points of CASM from labor and Delta was 125 or something. Delta\u2019s big pay increase comes in April 1. So that\u2019s just the timing issue.", "I very much believe that we are on a path to close the gap, everything we said at Investor Day. I feel more confident today the more I know that we are going to do it. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight. Basic Economy is an example of one of those big things that\u2019s going to be a big step function increase for us when we roll it out and start having it flying in the second quarter, feel very strongly that we\u2019re on the path that we laid out and that this is a team that is going to deliver and by 2020, we are going to have the best margins of the big three network carriers.", "So we feel really good about the path we are on despite what people might want to look at the second or third derivative of margin changes based on forecast margins quarter-to-quarter.", "Oscar Munoz", "This is Oscar. At the end of the day, while we appreciate being held accountable for our actions and our words, we constantly have said that that\u2019s proof, not promise and so we will keep delivering and inevitably everyone will agree. But with regards to the aspiration, it is clearly not one of mediocrity, I think we have said that before. And again, I just echo Scott\u2019s words with regards to the strategy and structure we have in place to get that done. So keep asking your questions, Jamie, and we\u2019ll keep answering them. More importantly, we\u2019re going to keep delivering to the point that we convince others to buy our facts and our proofs.", "Jamie Baker", "Excellent. Thank you, both. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "From Stephens, we have Jack Atkins online. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins", "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First one here for Scott. Scott, how should we think about the potential for you all to revise your capacity growth plans as you move through 2017 if we continue to see an acceleration in the unit revenue environment? Asked another way, can you help us think about the PRASM or margin level that you all need to see before you start thinking about accelerating capacity growth versus moderating it?", "Andrew Levy", "Well, that\u2019s not really the way we think about it based on like system level PRASM. We do bottoms-up analysis. And our capacity did not dictate it from being or from Oscar or from anyone that\u2019s in the room here today to say, our capacity is going to be X, Y, Z based on PRASM. It\u2019s a bottoms-up forecast and that\u2019s the right way to do it.", "It\u2019s by the way, it\u2019s not the way it\u2019s been done at United historically, but we\u2019re going to do bottoms up and build. And if there are opportunities then we\u2019ll find when there\u2019s places that it doesn\u2019t make sense, we\u2019ll stop flying. We\u2019ll be disciplined about looking at the financials of each route individually, and so really it\u2019s not going to be top-down-driven.", "We probably right now have although more uncertainty than we would normally have and that uncertainty can go both ways plus or minus, just based on all the changes that we\u2019re making the reviews that we\u2019ve done then hub structures that we\u2019re changing. We\u2019re still working through a lot of the bottoms-up, while we conceptually know the traction and the vision that we have for the future the exact timing and when it\u2019s going to go. And if it work perhaps, you\u2019ve got to be determined and so we\u2019re going to do bottoms-up process market-by-market and hub-by-hub.", "Jack Atkins", "Okay. Thank you for that. And then last question here just to follow up, given the strength that we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. dollar post the election, fluctuations we\u2019ve seen in foreign currencies, obviously, that has an impact on passenger revenue overall, but can you speak to just the changes in demand patterns that you are seeing, if any, due to the fluctuations that we\u2019ve seen in currency?", "Andrew Levy", "I have looked that enough to tell you that we\u2019ve seen anything of significance where I think you\u2019re implying, for example, reselling more point of origin in the U.S. and set a point of origin foreign companies \u2013 foreign countries. If we are it\u2019s not data that I\u2019ve seen, so no conclusion for us.", "Jack Atkins", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker online. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, guys, it\u2019s actually O\u2019 Connor [ph] in for Helane. So business yields obviously outperformed your expectations in the fourth quarter. But I just want to talk a little bit about the demand side. What\u2019s your expectation for corporate travel growth in the first quarter and what was it in fourth quarter?", "Andrew Levy", "We don\u2019t have specific expectations for corporate growth that we try to forecast or if we do no one has ever told me about it. It\u2019s been positive. We saw throughout post-election we\u2019ve seen positive business demand, positive business growth. First-half of the year has started strong. We\u2019ve had so far in January, RASM has been up every single day except for two. One of those two was January 1st, which was down something like 20% because the Sunday versus Sunday last year very different. And then we had one other day that was down 1.3% that\u2019s indicative of strong business demand and close in demand. But I don\u2019t have a specific forecast for corporate demand is going to do, it\u2019s strong right now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Sorry, go ahead.", "Oscar Munoz", "Sorry, Connor, I was going to add just and you see the same data with regards to business round table and all those different surveys that are out there is general. You have consumer index, which is positive. I mean we also have just sort of business sentiment been higher. So we\u2019re aware of that same issues. But as Scott said, we\u2019re seeing some of bit in our business as well.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. And then Andrew, just on the \u2013 about the fleet a little bit, I know you didn\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to make a commitment until later in the year. But can you just talk a little bit about the widebody fleet? And so I know you\u2019re taking up the 20 747s this year. Are there any big retirements that you expect in 2018? The reason I\u2019m asking is just because trying to match up your order book with your expected retirement just like and see if there\u2019s an actual potential deferral or whatever that you could possibly do later on? Thanks.", "Andrew Levy", "Well, I would first start out by saying that that we\u2019d like to reach decision on fleet as soon as we can. So we\u2019re not holding back till later in the year. We\u2019re just doing the hard work to make sure that we make the right decisions. So as soon as our work is done, we\u2019ll share it. We at this point in time other than the 747 fleet, we do not have any retirement plans for the rest of fleet.", "That being said, obviously, those are some of the things that we\u2019re talking about as we review the fleet, because we\u2019re looking at not only make decisions for the next couple of years, but looking out many more years into the future. And so there will be more to share as time goes on and we concluded our work. But other than the 74s, the rest of the fleet we expect to continue to operate, you have information on the delivery stream that we have out there at the moment.", "As we mentioned, anything that we can look at because it\u2019s far enough into the future, there\u2019s a part of the review that we\u2019re conducting. And so, there maybe changes, but we\u2019ll see and we\u2019ll let you know since we do.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Hey, thanks and congrats, Julie, on the move over. All of the revenue questions so far this earnings season have been a little less insightful without you on the line. [Multiple Speakers] So I wanted to follow-up on Jamie\u2019s question. Just with respect to margins, and I think so much of the conversation is relative, but I guess I\u2019d take absolute. When do you think \u2013 what are you driving the business to begin to stabilize and expand margins again? Is it fair that this is completely off the table every quarter of this year, or are you driving the business to expand margins this year?", "Andrew Levy", "Well, we\u2019re trying to \u2013 our margin expansion, we all believe that we\u2019re going to be able to expand margins. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be an exact trajectory of, it\u2019s going to get 50 basis points better this quarter and 50 basis points next quarter. There\u2019s a lot of volatility in that. We think we\u2019re on a path to expand margins with all the stuff we laid out at an Investor Day, that\u2019s not just relative, but that\u2019s also an absolute.", "In the first quarter of this year, we got a big headwind from the labor deals and from fuel prices. So it\u2019s going to go negative for us to go negative for everyone in that quarter. But we think, we\u2019re taking longer-term view about the margin trajectory, and we think we\u2019re on a path that\u2019s going to get us sustainably higher margins. But it\u2019s not going to be on exact every single quarter it goes up, because there\u2019s just too much volatility in the business in the short-term.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "So margin expansion is off the table this year, in any quarter of this year, or that is too strong a statement?", "Scott Kirby", "I know that\u2019s too stronger statement.", "Oscar Munoz", "Way too stronger statement.", "Scott Kirby", "That I mean we\u2019re guiding, where we\u2019ve given you guidance for the first quarter and really that\u2019s another side, maybe we\u2019ve given you full-year guidance. But we\u2019re \u2013 we just \u2013 the answer is, we don\u2019t know. We\u2019re certainly going to try to enhance margin that\u2019s our number one focus just to drive margin higher. And I believe we can get there.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "And then, Scott, maybe just big picture, there has been some consolidation touching some carriers in SFO. You\u2019ve had some low-cost carrier access in Newark. Can you quantify these headwinds or tailwinds in your revenue trends into what you can see so far?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, I\u2019m not going to quantify it, but I\u2019ll say that we\u2019re going to compete aggressively on both of those fronts.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Okay. And then just lastly on Atlantic, it feels like you may be sandbagging most egregiously there. I don\u2019t know how it can\u2019t get better with comps as weak as they are and with capacity coming down. Is there anything that we might be missing in that perspective? Thank you.", "Scott Kirby", "Well, I hope you\u2019re right.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Go ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Comps go \u2013 comps get about 600 basis points easier, your capacity growth decelerates, so how do we get to kind of the same outcome for 1Q?", "Scott Kirby", "Look, I hope you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t spend as much time trying to make sure that trying to you spend more time trying to make sure that forecast is as close as you can get, so your model is right. I spend a lot more time trying to maximize revenue, and so I hope you\u2019re right.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Thanks for taking the questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] And from Wall Street Journal, we have Susan Carey. Please go ahead.", "Susan Carey", "Good morning, everybody. Scott, I kind of want to come back to Basic Economy with your. You talked about incremental revenue I believe of $250 million this year $518 million in 2021 bill. Is this all from Basic Economy? And can you tell us when the rollout is going to be domestic only? Do you have plans for it to roll it internationally was the question?", "Scott Kirby", "Yes, so our numbers are more \u2013 in this year it\u2019s mostly about Basic Economy. But moving forward, it\u2019s also about having Premium Economy and even includes things like once you\u2019ve got more products, I think, you have more customers buy actual paid first ticket, which is once they\u2019ve got the option of Basic Economy, Main Cabin, Premium Economy first class to first class price now looks a lot closer to Premium Economy. And so people today are looking at what is officially a Basic Economy price versus first class, the differential is big.", "So there\u2019s a bunch involved in our number that\u2019s not just Basic Economy or even Basic Economy and Premium Economy. As to rollout, we\u2019re going to start selling it later this quarter. And the first travel will be in the second quarter at some point in the second quarter. So we\u2019re still working through all the final make sure everything is done, make sure it works right and but coming soon.", "Susan Carey", "But is it going to be domestic only at the outset?", "Scott Kirby", "Yes, sorry, Susan, I forgot that part. At the very beginning, it\u2019s going to actually the only one station. And I guess I could\u2026", "Susan Carey", "Which one?", "Scott Kirby", "Minneapolis. We\u2019re going to roll that in Minneapolis and we\u2019ve serviced all of our hubs from there. We have a great team there. We\u2019ve had some history with us of rolling out new products. And so we\u2019re going to roll it out there just kind of make sure everything works then we\u2019ll roll it out to the rest of the domestic system. We expect to have it in the rest of the domestic system in the not too distant future. And then we\u2019ll roll it out to \u2013 we also tend to roll it out to near international, so places like the Carrabin, as an example, and we\u2019ll contemplate long-haul international after that. We don\u2019t have a plan one way or another on that. But we expect to get it rolled out across the entire domestic and near haul international system not too long after we launch it assuming it\u2019s going well.", "Susan Carey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "From the Associated Press, we have David Koenig. Please go ahead.", "David Koenig", "All right. Hi, guys, just following up on the basically\u2026", "Oscar Munoz", "Hey, David.", "David Koenig", "Hello.", "Oscar Munoz", "Yes, hi.", "David Koenig", "Yes, okay. Yes, just follow-up on Basic Economy American just announced details of their Basic Economy offering, including a date for putting that fare on sale. And they said this is an issue that you caught some flak over. American says its flight attendants are not going to monitor whether those Basic Economy passenger put their personal item in the carry on bin. How is that going to work at United? And what is your learn from the public reaction to your proposal so far, what you said about it so far?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, that\u2019s absolutely true that we\u2019re not going to ask flight attendants to monitor. What we\u2019ll do is collect the bags the size of carryon bag that like a roller board, we will collect those at the gate and if customer does get to the gate, which we think we\u2019ll be able to screen most customers and keep them from getting to the \u2013 in the lobby, we\u2019ll be able to get bag to the lobby. But when customer does get to the gate, they\u2019re going to be charged at the gate a bag fee plus the handling fee to have gate shut for that bag. And so they just won\u2019t be on the airplane, those bags, so there is nothing for the flight attendant to monitor.", "Now I suppose a customer could put a personal item like a purse in the overhead, but and fine, but we\u2019re not going to ask our flight attendants to monitor anything and we are going to leave our flight attendants to deliver the greater customer service they do today. And actually just make their job better, because a lot of times they are stuck trying to help move bags around when the cabin is full and that\u2019s a difficult part of their job and we\u2019re going to minimize that happening with Basic Economy.", "David Koenig", "It sounds like you\u2019ve slowed down the whole rollout here. Is that because of the reaction when you first disclosed some of the details around you\u2026", "Scott Kirby", "We haven\u2019t slowed anything down at all.", "David Koenig", "Okay.", "Scott Kirby", "We are making sure we get it right. We have even as late as this week had more test on making sure that we\u2019re communicating it clearly to customer when they purchase. As I said earlier on the call that to me is the most important thing that we\u2019re doing and making sure our communication to customer is just crystal clear.", "Second big thing that we\u2019re doing is making sure that our airport team has done an incredible job and had some really clever ways to make sure that we keep bags \u2013 get bags all in the lobby, but to make sure that we\u2019re going to be able to implement this operationally and do so smoothly. So no slowdown at all. We are just making sure we got all the eyes dotted and TS crossed.", "David Koenig", "Okay. Thanks, Scott.", "Scott Kirby", "Yes.", "Operator", "From Bloomberg News, we have Michael Sasso online. Please go ahead.", "Michael Sasso", "Yes, good morning. Could you just talk about I think you talked in the recent past about beefing up your offerings out of O\u2019Hare, maybe adding some additional connecting locations to O\u2019Hare, particularly from maybe some smaller spoke cities and such can you talk about your plans for that. What you\u2019ve done how expensive do you expect that to be?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, we\u2019ve already just started adding some in places like new services to San Jose. And I\u2019m not sure when our next schedule is going to get published. But when we have our summer schedule, we will expect to have a few more destinations and a few more frequencies, particularly in some of our competitive markets and that\u2019s something that I think is just every season and every schedule change, we are going to continue to be growing here in Chicago. We are excited about the future here. We think there\u2019s great opportunity for us and we are going to start implementing some of that this summer and it\u2019s just going to be a continuous process for several years.", "Michael Sasso", "And just a follow-up, I think somebody mentioned that you are doing this partly in response to American and some growth that American has done in Chicago and will you seek to much American\u2019s growth, or the number of connections or whatnot they have in Chicago? How does this relate to what American has done in Chicago?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, I don\u2019t know where you heard that from. I don\u2019t think I said anything like that. We think we have a great opportunity. We have a better and larger hub here. We do have a better product. We have great people. We have better reliability in Chicago than American Airlines and so we think that\u2019s a growth opportunity for us to go out and win here in Chicago and we are going to do that.", "Operator", "From FlightGlobal, we have Edward Russell. Please go ahead.", "Edward Russell", "Hi, thank you for taking my question. There has been some discussions of management headcount reductions recently. Could you provide some more detail on what functions are being reduced and how many employees are going to be leaving the company?", "Oscar Munoz", "Ed, this is Oscar. Over the course of the year, we\u2019ve talked about the fact that our structure has to follow our strategy and post the work that we did at Investor Day, we\u2019ve been reorganizing our folks specifically to align with our customer initiatives, with our margin initiatives. We have created a Chief Customer Officer, for instance. We have bifurcated and focused our financial organization to be more directly impacting both the commercial and operational side separately. There\u2019s a host of things, but enough to meet that that have progressed. In that process, we\u2019ve also found some bureaucracy and some redundancy in and some redundancy in certain areas and so while there has been some exits of a relatively small number, we\u2019ve had equal or greater impact by a lot of promotions, a lot of job transfers and a lot of job specificity focused on the things that our strategy evolve.", "So as the overall numbers, there is no goal; there is no specific number to report. We\u2019re just trying to sort of, again, focus our great company on the future.", "Edward Russell", "Okay. If I could ask one follow-up. I\u2019ve heard some discussion of say the fuel hedging team is going to be reduced or eliminated. I mean, can you talk about is that happening as you shift away from fuel hedging, or other departments that are going to be impacted?", "Andrew Levy", "Yes, this is Andrew. So we are no longer hedging fuel. We do have a very small number of folks that involved in that and I believe they are going to be reassigned to other areas within the company. That was never a large number of folks in that group.", "Oscar Munoz", "Ed, this is Oscar, again, just one thing I neglected to say, and I think it\u2019s a very important part of that. In the organizational effectiveness initiative that we are going through, the front line, our front managers, our customers are not impacted in anyway. In fact, we anticipate hiring thousands of people as we do every year with regards to sort of refreshening our front-line organization.", "Edward Russell", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And finally from the TheStreet, we have Ted Reed. Please go head.", "Ted Reed", "Thank you. I have two questions. First, I was surprised that your margin in first quarter is in single digits. Why is that? Is there something structural at United or seasonal that keeps your margin low \u2013 that low in the first quarter?", "Andrew Levy", "Yes, we have less exposure to Florida and the Caribbean. And so the first quarter is always the lowest quarter for United compared to Delta and American, but it\u2019s just about where our hubs are. We don\u2019t have a hub in Atlanta or your hometown of Charlotte.", "Ted Reed", "Okay. Thank you. And secondly, Scott, you talked about changes at San Francisco. Is that because San Francisco is working so well that you don\u2019t need to change it, or is that one of the hubs you were saying on the investor call that the flights are too closely aligned with international and not with domestic? Is that not true in San Francisco and in connection with that, do you still plan to continue the policy of increasing flights to interior China?", "Scott Kirby", "We \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve been pleased with the results of the interior China so far. And so we are \u2013 I\u2019 m at least agnostic about whether we continue to grow there. If it is working, we will and if it\u2019s not, we won\u2019t, so it all depends on the results. I do think that there\u2019s opportunity for us in San Francisco.", "We\u2019re a little more facility-constrained there and so figuring out how we can get more gates to grow and add capacity is one of the critical things that we have to do. It\u2019s easier to talk about some of the other mid-continent connecting hubs as opposed to San Francisco, where we\u2019ve got constraints, but it\u2019s a fantastic market for us. It\u2019s the best Asian gateway that \u2013 of any gateway in the U.S.. We have a great customer base there. We have a great team in San Francisco, and we would like to find ways to get more gates and actually grow there.", "Ted Reed", "All right. Thank you, Scott.", "Julie Yates Stewart", "Okay, thanks to all for joining the call today. Please contact Media Relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Foxhall", "Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call.", "Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chairman, President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey; and Senior Vice President and Treasurer, Gerry Laderman. Jack will begin with some overview comments, after which, Jim will review operational performance, capacity and revenue results.

For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website.", "Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, Chairman, President and CEO of United.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, Nene and Sarah, and thank you, all, for joining us on our second quarter 2013 earnings call.", "Today, we report a profit of $521 million for the second quarter or $1.35 per diluted share. I want to thank all of my coworkers for their effort and professionalism as they work together to serve our customers and improve our operational and financial results. I would also like to thank our customers for choosing United, as we continue to build the world's leading airline.", "During the second quarter, we demonstrated progress across all of our top priorities for 2013. We operated a more reliable airline this quarter, despite experiencing moderate to severe weather and air traffic control delays during almost half the days in the quarter.", "We generated record second quarter revenue of $10 billion and posted a profit of more than $0.5 billion.", "Heading into the second-half of the year, United is well-positioned to continue delivering solid operational performance and excellent customer service and to achieve our return on invested capital target of at least 10% this year.", "Our frontline coworkers are focused on making our customers' experience more comfortable and less stressful. The investments we've made to support our operations and train our people are paying off. In the second quarter, we improved our on-time departure rate, reduced our maintenance-related cancellations and substantially closed the gap to the industry in relative on-time arrival performance.", "Our customer service is clearly improving, and customers are taking notice as customer satisfaction scores are up substantially versus last summer. As of today, approximately 80% of our 46,000 mainline and United Express flight attendants, airport agents and reservation agents have completed our new customer service training called It's Our Job. And we are on track to complete the training in the fourth quarter. Delivering excellent customer service is an absolute priority for us, and we are intensely focused on continuing the momentum we built in this critical area.", "We continue to make progress towards integrating our labor groups. And this month, we resumed negotiations for a joint collective bargaining agreement with a union representing our passenger service, fleet service and storekeeper coworkers. We're in discussions with the unions representing our technicians, flight attendants and flight dispatchers as well. And by working together, we have the opportunity to reach additional competitive and responsible joint collective bargaining agreements by the end of this year.", "Our network is the best in the business, connecting customers to more destinations around the globe than any other airline. Our hubs ring the United States, providing powerful international gateways. Our network is highly attractive to business travelers, and is only becoming more attractive as we continue to improve our operational performance and our customer service.", "We continue to optimize our network within the confines of capacity discipline, which is core to our operating strategy. In April, we expanded our Latin America presence with new service between Washington/Dulles and Guatemala City, and service from Chicago O'Hare and Washington/Dulles to San Jose, Costa Rica.", "In June, we launched daily, nonstop service between Denver and Tokyo/Narita using the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Our Denver-to-Narita service is a great example of how the Dreamliner opens up new, profitable route opportunities. Its efficiency, range and seating capacity are ideal for markets such as this one.", "We're making investments in our fleet that will allow us to provide high quality service to where our customers want to go and enhance our already industry-leading network. Operating efficient, reliable and customer-pleasing aircraft is critical for our long-term returns.", "This quarter, we made a series of adjustments to our long-term fleet plan, ensuring we have the right number of replacement aircraft on order with the appropriate seating capacity and range to match market demand. John will speak about that more in a moment.", "In addition to adding new aircraft to our fleet, we're improving the interiors of existing aircraft. United is the only U.S. carrier to offer flat-bed seats on every long-haul international flight from the continental U.S., with more than 7,100 flat-bed seats in the air. We offer global satellite-based Wi-Fi on 57 aircraft today, including nearly half of our 747 fleet, and we'll be installing global satellite-based Wi-Fi at a rate of over 25 aircraft per month for the remainder of the year.", "Towards the end of this year, we will begin installing streaming video on our satellite-based Wi-Fi aircraft, marking the start of our shift toward providing in-flight entertainment content for our customers to use on their own devices. We're also installing new interiors, including flat-bed seats on our p.s. aircraft flying transcon flights out of New York Kennedy, and expect all of our p.s. aircraft to have new interiors by the end of the year.", "We're modernizing our product offering on the ground as well. We have completed the rollout of our new, simplified boarding process at 26 airports, and we've received excellent feedback from customers and coworkers on the new process. We've reduced the percentage of boarding-related departure delays by more than 60% versus last year, in part due to the boarding process enhancements we've made. We expect to see further improvements as we roll out to the majority of our stations through the end of 2013.", "During the second quarter, we opened a new United Club in Seattle, featuring our new modern design built around the needs of our business customer, and expect to open an additional modern lounge next month in San Diego.", "We continue to enhance our powerful loyalty program, MileagePlus. In the second quarter, we took another step toward orienting our program to better recognize the value our Premier members create for United by introducing a revenue component to our Premier status qualification requirements for the 2015 program year.", "Just this month, we announced new exclusive partnerships with 2 iconic brands, Marriott and Mercedes-Benz, further enhancing the value that our MileagePlus program offers members. Our new partnership with Marriott, which is called Rewards Plus, offers our Premier Gold members and above a status match to Marriott Gold, and reciprocally offers Marriott Platinum members a status match to MileagePlus Silver. The new program also offers members improvements and points transfers between the 2 programs.", "MileagePlus is the world's largest travel loyalty program with the most ways for members to earn and use their miles, and we intend to expand the value of the program to our members and to United in the future.", "We are focused on providing solid operational reliability, great customer service and a modern competitive product for our customers, creating economic value for our shareholders and providing a great place to work for our coworkers, and we've made good progress on each of these fronts this quarter. We're on the path towards achieving all of these goals, and we will continue to work together as we build the world's leading airline.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim and John to go through the results in greater detail.", "James E. Compton", "Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to thank my coworkers for managing our operations in the face of difficult weather conditions this quarter. I also want to thank all of our customers for choosing United. We are working hard to win your business each and every day.", "We are consistently running a reliable airline with good customer service, and are now focused on becoming even more dependable and your carrier of choice.", "The weather in the second quarter was extreme. To put it in context, our operations were impacted by moderate to severe weather, 41 delays during the quarter, which was 25% higher than average. Despite these challenges, all of our frontline coworkers focused on minimizing the impact on our customers, providing good service and maintaining as normal a schedule as possible.", "Excluding the impact of weather, we ran a solid operation and saw significant year-over-year improvements in our controllable completion and long delay rates. Our investment in spare parts and return of spare aircraft to prior levels are paying off, and our maintenance-related cancellations declined by 37% year-over-year in the second quarter.", "We continue to define our best-in-class network to the driver turns by introducing new service to meet demand and eliminating unprofitable routes. This quarter, we initiated 3 new long-haul international routes, including Denver to Narita service using our Dreamliner, and recently announced, we will cease our Newark to Istanbul and Newark to Buenos Aires flights this fall, as they did not meet our return expectations.", "United has the best global network for U.S. travelers, and we will continue to find new, profitable opportunities to expand the breadth of our service for customers.", "Our second quarter consolidated capacity decreased 2.1% year-over-year, and we reduced our capacity in each entity, except Latin America. We expect third quarter consolidated capacity will decline 0.4% to 1.4% year-over-year. For the full-year, we expect our capacity will decline 0.75% to 1.75%.", "While we do expect our fourth quarter capacity will increase between roughly 3% and 4%, nearly half of the fourth quarter increase is due to lower comps from last year, given the impact that Superstorm Sandy had on our operations in 2012.", "Over the long term, it's important we continue to match capacity with demand, which we define as maintaining capacity growth at a rate less than GDP.", "Turning to our revenue results. We outperformed the industry in unit revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, with consolidated PRASM growth of 1% year-over-year. The trans-Atlantic region performed quite well for us in the second quarter, with unit revenues and yields each increasing approximately 6% year-over-year.", "We've rightsized our footprint in Europe over the last several quarters, and the improvement in our trans-Atlantic unit revenue results this quarter illustrates the benefit of capacity discipline.", "Our Pacific unit revenue performance contracted 3.4% year-over-year, in part due to capacity growth of our competitors adversely affecting yields, and in part due to continued yen weakness. The depreciation of the yen reduced second quarter passenger revenue by about $30 million, and we expect the year-over-year yen pressure to continue throughout the remainder of 2013.", "Corporate revenue continued to grow modestly in the second quarter, increasing approximately 2% versus the second quarter of 2012.", "We're working to provide our customers more comfort and choice when they travel. We offer Economy Plus seating on 92% of our mainline fleet, and we are the only U.S. airline to offer fully flat-bed seats in the premium cabins on all of our long-haul international flights from the continental U.S. Offering this type of product consistency helps us meet and exceed our customers' expectations when they fly internationally on United in the Premium cabin.", "We continue to install global satellite-based Wi-Fi, providing connectivity just about everywhere we fly, which is an important product for our business and leisure customers.", "We are also investing in indi [ph] technology our customers use to keep in touch with United. This quarter, we enhanced our mobile applications for iPhone, Android and BlackBerry 10, including streamlined user interfaces and the first phase of new self-service functionality, which customers can use to manage their itinerary if a flight delay or a cancellation should occur.", "We also expect to make mobile boarding pass scanning available at all of the domestic airports we serve by this fall, and we'll be this first U.S. network carrier to do so.", "Driving best-in-class revenue results requires a network with strong local inflow demand, providing aircraft that can supply the demand, competitive product, great customer service, reliable operations and a strong revenue management system.", "As we lap many of our integration milestones from last year, our network and our systems continue to mature. We now have more than a year's experience using SHARES, our passenger service system, together with ORION, our revenue management system, to optimize revenue over our unmatched global network by balancing local inflow traffic, both domestically and internationally, especially in our Newark and San Francisco hubs.", "Turning to our near-term revenue outlook, things continue be solid and mix is holding steady. We currently estimate United's third quarter consolidated PRASM to increase 3% to 5%, and July consolidated PRASM to increase 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year.", "Ancillary revenue continued to show strong growth in the second quarter, as ancillary revenue per passenger grew 13% year-over-year to over $20 per passenger. The Economy Plus upsell continues to perform very well, growing 37% year-over-year in the second quarter.", "Our excellent ancillary revenue growth in the first half of the year positions us to exceed our 2013 goal of increasing ancillary revenue per passenger by 9%.", "We are encouraged by the progress we've made on ancillary revenue to date and are excited about the significant runway ahead. We believe there is considerable room for us to grow in this high-margin space. Our strategy to further grow ancillary revenue consists of 3 categories.", "First, introducing new value-add products and services like global satellite-based Wi-Fi, Premier access and annual subscriptions of existing products, such as Economy Plus.", "Second, optimizing pricing on existing products through our powerful and nimble technology platforms, which allow us to apply both -- apply better revenue management to ancillary products as we've begun to deal with Economy Plus.", "And third, maturing our customer relationship management capabilities so that we can better provide the right offer at the right time to the right customer through a wide range of channel.", "In the second quarter, we signed a deal with Sabre, enabling us to increase our customers' access to our ancillary products while aligning our interests in this distribution channel.", "We are laying the technical foundation to offer ancillary products like Economy Plus on Sabre next year. Our philosophy is quite simply customer choice and engagement. We serve a very large customer base, flying more than 140 million passengers per year and engaging with tens of millions of MileagePlus members, not all of whom want or value the same thing from us, and not of all of whom, in return, create the same value for the company. Adapting our business model to tailor the offers and the experience for our customers is critical, and is one of the many ways we will be improving our customers' experience and our returns at the same time.", "Customers have a choice when they fly, and we want to provide the most compelling value proposition for travelers to choose United. We will continue to invest in our reliability, our customer service, our network, our fleet, our product offering, our loyalty program and our technology to make clear that United is the right airline for the global business traveler and leisure traveler alike.", "We are pleased with our relative unit revenue outperformance this quarter and want to expand that leadership even further. And by working together, my coworkers can do just that.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John D. Rainey", "Thanks, Jim. I first want to thank all of my coworkers for working together to help United get further down the path to achieving its full potential and making this a better airline for the 140 million customers we serve each year.", "Today, we reported net income of $521 million and a pre-tax margin of 5.2% for the second quarter. We continue to make progress executing on our plan. On a monthly basis, we've improved our pre-tax margin year-over-year in 3 of the last 4 months.", "Our second quarter operating margin was 8.2%, which was an improvement from the second quarter of 2012.", "During the second quarter, we ran a solid operation with better customer service; made progress in improving our cost performance; made prudent, long-term investments in our aircraft, facilities and technology; and improved our balance sheet by paying off a significant amount of debt. These are the right steps toward laying the foundation we need to generate sufficient long-term returns.", "Our second quarter consolidated operating expenses were flat year-over-year. Second quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, increased 7% versus second quarter 2012, in part due to a 2.1% reduction in consolidated capacity, a much greater capacity reduction than that of our peers.", "We expect our unit cost pressure to substantially subside in the back half of the year. We anticipate that in the second half of 2013, our CASM, excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, will increase between 2% and 4% year-over-year and continue to expect our full-year, nonfuel unit cost to increase between 5.5% and 6.5%.", "We're committed to running a more efficient operation and are making progress with new initiatives that will contribute to our goal of keeping our annual unit cost growth at appropriate levels going forward.", "One area where we will become more efficient over time is at our airports. Year-to-date, we've demonstrated our ability to operate a consistently reliable operation, despite high load factors and challenging weather. As Jim said, we will continue to run a reliable operation. And by enhancing our boarding process, improving the tools our coworkers use and the technology our customers use, we will improve the productivity of our agents, permitting them to provide even better customer service, while simplifying and de-stressing our customers' travel experience.", "This week, we announced Early Out programs for eligible frontline coworkers in the passenger service, fleet service and storekeeper work groups contingent upon ratification of joint collective bargaining agreements.", "These programs enable our coworkers to make career choices that are right for them, whether it be transitioning to a new career or early retirement. These elective programs also enable us to better align our staffing with the workload.", "We are always looking for opportunities to provide our customers and coworkers more control and choice in their experience, while managing our cost wisely. In June, we modified the retirement program for about half of our management and administrative coworkers by freezing their defined benefit pension plan and moving to a defined contribution plan beginning in 2014. All of our management and administrative coworkers will be able to make the best retirement decision for their personal situations.", "We're continuing to improve our fuel efficiency. In addition to operating an increasingly fuel-efficient fleet, we're engaged in a number of operational initiatives to reduce fuel consumption.", "During the quarter, we announced an agreement with AltAir Fuels to purchase 15 million gallons of biofuel starting in 2014. This agreement underscores United's efforts to be a leader in alternative fuels, as well as our commitment to the environment.", "We also announced an agreement with Aviation Partners Boeing to launch a retrofit program for our 737-900ER fleet, in addition to our 737-800 fleet, with the new Split Scimitar Winglet. The new winglet design provide significant aircraft drag improvements with approximately 2% additional fuel savings for these aircraft.", "We're taking prudent steps to ensure our fleet is the right one for United's long-term network strategy. Our fleet strategy seeks to maximize return on invested capital over the life of the asset, and ensures that we have the right aircraft to continue to improve our industry-leading network with the onboard product our customers desire.", "We are taking a measured approach with our fleet replacement capital plan, one that provides flexibility to respond to economic conditions and allows for a balanced allocation of free cash flow going forward.", "We announced orders for widebody aircraft and 76-seat regional jets during the quarter. Today, we operate 154 widebody aircraft with an average age of about 15 years. In total, we now have 94 widebody aircraft on order, which will be delivered over the next 12 years, comprised of 59 more Dreamliners and 35 A350-1000s. These aircraft will be terrific additions to our fleet as they will provide double-digit improvements in operating economics and a superior onboard experience for our customers and coworkers versus current-generation aircraft. In addition, these aircraft are ideally sized to fill a void in our current fleet in terms of seating capacity and range.", "It's important to balance capital demands when determining which aircraft to replace and when. On one hand, when we replace older aircraft with a much more fuel-efficient, next-generation aircraft, we significantly improve the bottom line. As one data point, for each Boeing 757-200 that we replace with a new 737-900ER, we project more than a $2 million benefit annually on a run-rate basis, inclusive of ownership cost. This adds up to a fairly substantial number as we plan to retire 73 domestic 757-200s by the end of 2015 and replace them with new 737-900ERs.", "Conversely, when we identify opportunities to invest in our existing fleet and materially improve its operating economics, we can delay the capital cost of replacing those aircraft and fly them for a longer period of time. One example is our Airbus fleet, consisting of 152 A319 and A320 aircraft. We will be adding slimline seats to improve the per-seat operating economics while providing more legroom for our customers.", "We're also improving the customer experience on these airplanes by adding Wi-Fi, in-seat power and larger overhead bins. These improvements will allow us to utilize each aircraft for several more years than we had originally planned.", "Given the substantial flexibility we have within our order book, we're able to optimize our aircraft delivery schedule and corresponding capital requirements as the needs of our business dictate.", "We also announced an order for 30 Embraer 175 aircraft and an agreement with SkyWest to operate an additional 40 E175s under the United Express brand starting next year. These 76-seat aircraft are more fuel efficient and provide a superior customer experience versus the 50-seat aircraft they'll be repricing. And we're excited to bring them into our fleet.", "As I've stated before, we intend to keep our overall fleet count roughly flat over our planning horizon over the next 5 years with a measured approach to replacement over that period. This helps smooth capital requirements, financing needs and operational training and change.", "We're investing responsibly in our product, our facilities and our people, and expect between $590 million and $610 million of gross capital expenditures for the third quarter and approximately $2.5 billion for the full year 2013.", "We continued to strengthen our balance sheet in the second quarter, and now it's the healthiest it's been in years. We made $540 million of debt and capital lease payments in the second quarter, including $144 million of prepayments. Our second quarter interest expense declined 9% versus last year. As we look forward, we expect approximately $500 million of debt and capital lease payments for the rest of 2013.", "Our scheduled maturity profile beyond this year is very manageable as well, with $1.1 billion due in 2014 and $1.9 billion in 2015. This includes $800 million of the 6 3/4% secured notes, which are prepayable at par starting next September.", "We seized the opportunity in May to add a benchmark issue of unsecured debt, $300 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2018, with an interest rate of 6 3/8%. Importantly, we intend for this transaction to be earnings accretive and leverage neutral. We used a portion of the proceeds of this offering to pay off a $49 million note due in 2019 with an 8% coupon, and intend to use the remaining proceeds to reduce other high interest rate debt.", "We closed the second quarter with an unrestricted liquidity balance of $7 billion, including our $1 billion undrawn revolver.", "Improving our balance sheet benefits all of our stakeholders. A strong financial foundation reduces the risk in the business for our investors, increases the confidence our customers and coworkers have in our long-term success, and enables consistent investment in assets that generate appropriate returns.", "Finally, while we made significant progress during the second quarter and generated over $0.5 billion of earnings, we are by no means satisfied with these results. We're starting to see the benefits of the investments we've made and the actions we've taken, but we're in a very early stage of where we need to be.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, John. This quarter, we began to demonstrate the capability of the new United. We ran a competitive and reliable operation despite challenging weather conditions. We made significant strides in improving our customer service. We showed the strength, breadth and balance of our global network, with industry-leading unit revenue improvements.", "We made prudent long-term investments in our fleet, our product, our technology and our people. We've improved our balance sheet to the strongest point it's been in years.", "At United, we're building the airline that customers want to fly, investors want to invest in and our coworkers want to work for. We have clearly turned the corner post-merger, and I'm confident we're on the path to becoming the world's leading airline.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Sarah to open up the call for questions.", "Sarah Murphy", "Thanks, Jeff. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] From Cowen Securities, we have Helane Becker online.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to get little more color on the corporate business that you said. I think you talked about seeing small increases. I don't remember the adjective you used, but I was wondering if you could go through, maybe, where you're seeing the increases?", "James E. Compton", "Helane, this is Jim -- yes, this is Jim. As I talked about it, we saw about a modest growth of 2% in corporate revenue in the second quarter, fairly consistent with the growth we saw in the first quarter in terms of growth rate. In terms of where we're seeing -- if I broke it down into kind of strong performers versus some weak different industries, obviously, we're seeing good strength in business services, computer services, IT, electronics, financial services and the pharmaceuticals. Some of the more kind of lagging or slower performance would be in the areas like aerospace and defense and some in manufacturing. But good strength in the pharmaceuticals and financial services, in particular.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg online.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. Just a couple of questions here. Jim, when we look at your Pacific PRASM, and it was down, how much of that would be attributable to the weakness of the yen? What was the currency impact?", "James E. Compton", "Yes, Mike, this is Jim. About 2% of that RASM decline was due to the depreciation in the yen.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then you mentioned that the impact was $30 million, and I -- presumably, that's more translation than demand. But as the weaker yen persists, will it be a bigger impact going forward than the $30 million? Or will it not be as bad because you'll mitigate it through capacity reduction or reallocation of seats? How should we think about that?", "James E. Compton", "I think we see the impact kind of being consistent to what we've seen in the second quarter as we look out into the third quarter. From a demand perspective, you're right. In the Micronesia area, where it's strong, point of sale. Japan, obviously, as the travelers make it into the U.S., the demand side gets affected a little and so forth. But we kind of expecting the same trend that we've seen in the second quarter.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. My second question, just for John. When we look in the miscellaneous expense of $123 million, in the footnote there was an $80 million -- $81 million mark-to-market hit on the hedge. How much of that is out of period? And then what else is in that bucket?", "John D. Rainey", "Mike, $80 million of the $81 million are mark-to-market hedge losses that are out-of-period. $1 million was in effectiveness, which is recognized this period. And there are 2 other items, I guess, I would call out in non-op that are also anomalous and more onetime in nature. One is the write-off of a sale of investment we had. That was about $10 million, and then there was a similar amount for -- cost related to the early conversion of our convertible securities that were -- that we converted during the quarter. So those 3 items accounted for the majority of that. And again, I think that it's one of the reasons that while we improved year-over-year on an operating margin, our pre-tax margin did not, and we can point to those onetime items.", "Operator", "From Evercore Partners, we have Duane Pfennigwerth online.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I'm wondering if you could give some detail on the other revenue growth line and help us think about maybe the offset in the guidance regarding the third-party business expense. What's going on with that third-party business expense line? And if we actually strip that out, how should we think -- be thinking about the growth rate in, I guess, the high margin of the revenue growth?", "John D. Rainey", "Sure, Duane. This is John. In the second quarter, our other revenue grew in excess of 20%. We saw a strong growth there. But to your point, part of that is related to a third-party contract we have where we sell fuel, and the expense for that is down in other operating expense, but associated revenue is also in the other revenue line. If we were to strip that out, the year-over-year increase is in the high -- mid- to high-single digits in terms of other revenue. But I think that, that somewhat obscures some of the real progress that we're making just in the general ancillary revenue category. You might remember, we had a goal at the beginning of the year to grow ancillary revenue by 9%. As Jim said in his remarks, we're up 13% in the second quarter, and we're expecting that to continue through the balance of the year.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful, John. And then, you're probably unwilling to talk about CapEx longer-term, and I do appreciate the detail that you put out in that recent filing. But maybe you could talk about how we should think about, what we should add to, I guess, the aircraft and IT CapEx that you put forth. How do we think about maybe the other bucket of CapEx and maybe the growth or decline from the $2.5 billion level this year?", "John D. Rainey", "You bet, Duane. So allow me to categorize that into 2 separate buckets, aircraft and nonaircraft. With respect to aircraft, we have 700 mainline jets today, more or less. If we fly those planes for an average of 25 to 30 years, then we need to replace 23 to 28 planes a year just to stay at the same level. And that's what we're striving for, a maintenance level of CapEx with respect to our fleet. As we've discussed, we do not intend to grow our fleet in our planning horizon. So that's the level that I would assume there. With respect to the non-aircraft CapEx, we're spending in excess of $1 billion in that category this year. And as I said at the beginning of the year, about half of that is -- are items that are sort of \"once in a generation type\" items, things like building a data center here in Chicago, 2 new maintenance hangars this year. So I would expect that to abate over time. Our run rate level is probably somewhere between $700 million to $800 million, maybe something slightly higher than that. But certainly not this level that we've been this year.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So when you add all that up, is growth CapEx -- or gross CapEx higher or lower next year?", "John D. Rainey", "We haven't commented on that. We'll give some guidance towards the end of the year.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "So, I'm struggling to come up with how to think about this choppy PRASM. It feels like almost 2 steps forward, 2 steps back a lot over the last like 6 to 9 months. I thought you kind of pulled out of this in the early year, and then you had a tough April and May. And I thought June was a little better. Now July looks a little soft. And you gave 3Q PRASM guidance, which you don't typically do, so you obviously feel pretty good about what you're seeing in the bookings. But I mean, why is it so choppy? Because -- is it an operations issue? Because I thought that was already resolved. The on-time is there. The pilots seem to be happy, they're not slowing flights sites or anything. Why is it so choppy? And how should we be confident modeling in PRASM outperformance based on anything other than just either easy comps going forward?", "James E. Compton", "Hunter, this is Jim. First of all, it's -- the choppiness in RASM is not an operational impact or so forth. So it's -- what we've seen in the past is adjustments to revenue and so forth that sometimes can drive some of that choppiness. There's -- we've had capacity adjustments that, for instance, in the first quarter, being down approximately 5% and -- which would obviously drive a little bit better RASM growth and stuff versus the second quarter, where capacity was down 2.1%. The intent of talking about 3Q guidance of 3% to 5% was really -- and I'm going to refer back to Jeff's point about turning the corner. If you look at our second quarter RASM growth of about 1% that we reported today, 2.1% capacity decline, the 3% to 5% RASM growth, slightly less capacity decline, is another indicator of us turning the corner. And so our goal this year is clearly kind of driving great customer service, the reliability that we've talked about. And internally, we talk about it as beating the plan, and I will tell you, when we talk about beating the plan, it means that everything that we do, right? So the team is very focused on hitting that 3% to 5% guidance I gave, as well as constantly trying to beat that number. That's kind of what we do, but I think the intent was, to your point, was to kind of point -- take out a little bit of that choppiness that comes in a month-to-month reporting and give you a little guidance on the third quarter total, particularly relative to the second quarter.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. Yes, I just -- I don't know, it feels to me like, to some extent on the revenue line, there might be some struggles going on the corporate side, sort of get to Helane's first question. And I see Delta adding routes like Newark-Paris, and to me, it's an indicator which, I believe, is probably a pretty lucrative pharmaceutical-corporate route for you. And to me, it implies that Delta thinks that they can take advantage of your weakness. And I don't know how you would respond to something like that, but obviously, you have network challenges everyday. But, I mean, did you feel like you're communicating enough with your corporates in your key markets to the point where threats like that shouldn't necessarily concern us?", "James E. Compton", "I think -- so one, we're communicating all the time with our corporate. And I've talked about this in the past that the conversation with our corporate's very different than 1 year ago, the conversations about the value of the network and what we can do in partnership for your travel needs and what you're trying to do going forward. So that communication is constant and going on. As we look at different competitive -- the Sky Team, some of that capacity has been there before from Air France, and so now Delta is flying it and so forth. But again, we're really comfortable with our position in New York. As I mentioned on the call, as we've been maturing our systems here, particularly with ORION and our SHARES system, what we're being able to do is better manage higher-yielding traffic across our hubs, particularly in San Francisco and New York. So that allows us to kind of make the best decision on what type of traffic is going over Newark, whether it be lower-yielding local traffic versus higher-yielding flow traffic. So we're really, really excited and feel really good about our competitive position in New York. So we've had -- we have competitive capacity challenges all the time. What we do is we have a really strong plan that we're focused on and focus on hitting it.", "Operator", "From JP Morgan, we have Jamie Baker online.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Jeff, I'm going to assume that the results in the first half of this year didn't quite measure up to what the internal targets were on, say, January 1. Of course, I don't know that for a fact, so you can correct me if I'm mistaken. But if, in fact, results were below what was internally forecast, can you review for us each of the substantive steps that you've taken to get results back on track? And will these initiatives actually make up for lost ground or simply, and hopefully, drive improvement from here?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Jamie, the most important this for us this year, I mean, we really focused this year on 3 things. One, we had to get our operation back on track, which we did, and it's been quite successful. We've had many initiatives do that. We're running a competitive operation today. It's a good operation, and it's improving. A second piece we're focusing on was customer service, because our customer service fell away last year. There's no question about that. And we needed to get our customer service back to a, not only competitive level, but a level of excellence. So we've spent a lot of time with our own folks, not only in training, but giving them the tools they need to make sure that we can get good customer service, our flights off on time. And changes in a lot of procedures where things that passengers can see and experience, for example, the boarding process or procedures in terms of marshaling aircraft, marshaling them in, getting them out. Having jet bridges on time, that sort of thing. So there's been a lot of improvement in the customer service and the operational liability. And the third part has been to beat the plan, and we continue to be focused on that. Are we satisfied with our financial results this quarter year-to-date? Absolutely not. We are not satisfied with them. They do not represent what we can and will be, and we're really focused on that. But we have a host of activities that are going on, not only in terms of the operations and the customer service, as Jim has talked about, making sure that our conversations -- and our conversations with our corporate customers today are very different than they were last year. Last year, it was a year of apology. This year, it's an opportunity for us to sell our services to our important corporate customers, make sure they understand not only the power of the network, but the investments we're making in our fleet and in our product and in our technology, our people. There's a lot that we're doing. So we're excited about how things are going directionally. Look, going through these mergers is tough. It happened to our friends earlier when they first merged, and I'm confident it'll happen to our friends in the next merger. But the fact is, these are tough things do go through, but we've turned all that corner behind us now, and I'm actually excited about the direction where we're going. But in terms of our performance to date, our financial performance, no, absolutely we're not satisfied with that.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And just to press on this issue, Jeff -- and I'm not looking for modeling guidance here and I don't want to put words in your mouth. But given what you just responded with, is it enough that you would anticipate closing your margin gap with that of your closest competitors in 2014?", "John D. Rainey", "Jamie, this is John. This is a slow process. It's one where we are making good progress. Believe me, we all here wish it were to happen overnight. But the important thing for us is to continue to see improvement. And one area that Jeff talked -- did not mention is the area of cost. I mean, obviously, our level of unit cost increase this year is unacceptable to me and to many others. But we've got tremendous initiatives underway. And I'll just -- I'll point to a couple of different examples. I mean, I talked about, in my prepared remarks, the Early Out. This is something that is very good for employees. It allows them to transition to another career or retire early. And also, it's an opportunity for us to lower our wages, as well rightsize the workforce in particular locations. Maintenance is another issue. This is an area where, as we have been dealing with some of the issues with an older fleet and an unreliable fleet, we spent more there than we plan to going forward. It's one of the key areas that we will see improvements in as we begin to take delivery of new planes. And then I would point to fuel as well. I've talked about the capital investment we're making on winglets. This is a capital investment that provides a return on invested capital many times in excess of our 10% goal, and it pays back very promptly. So there are a lot of different areas where we believe we can really begin to improve relative to our competitors. That said, we recognize that, like a lot of this merger, it will take some time.", "Operator", "From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we have Glenn Engel online.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two questions, please. One is for Latin America and for Asia and Europe. Can you go through which of the countries outperformed or did worse than the average, like Heathrow versus rest of Europe? And the second question is on the wage side. When you look at this year, how much of the labor cost impact has been from harmonizing contracts? And what percent of the labor cost has that represented so far?", "James E. Compton", "Glenn, this is Jim. Let me take the entity performance first. Starting with the trans-Atlantic. We actually thought that strong trans-Atlantic routes and growth was pretty well spread, but particularly to London, as you mentioned, as well as to Germany. We've worked really hard with our partners, the team with Lufthansa. So we're seeing good strength to our German markets. But also, quite frankly, the strength is pretty widespread within Europe, both London to Paris and so forth. So we're very happy with that. In Latin America, the weakness was more in South America, with the rest of Latin America actually performing quite well. But in South America with some yield pressures, with -- as a result of some of the capacity, put some pressure on us in the Latin America division. But it was mostly in South America, the weakness.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And Asia?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "I'm sorry. Oh, in Asia? It was -- we saw yield pressure into Australia. Obviously, we've already talked a little bit about the yen and the impact of the Japan. Our Asia or China particularly held up pretty well. And -- but between the Japan with the yen depreciation, and to Micronesia and the impact of the trans-Pac with that, as well as the -- some yield pressure in the Australian market.", "John D. Rainey", "Glenn, on your question about wages. Approximately 2/3 of the increase in our wages line this year is related to collective bargaining agreements. We are committed, though, to getting to market base pay with all of our labor groups. That's been the approach that we've taken from day 1. But just as so, we are committed to getting to a market-based allocation of resources as well. And this is an area of opportunity for us going forward as we begin to become more efficient in our operations.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So the 2/3 of the labor cost tied to the wage increases, but you've only increased pay in roughly half of your workforce levels?", "John D. Rainey", "No, Glenn, we've actually -- with the exception of our airport agents, which we do have an accrual on the books for, we have reached collective bargaining agreements with all of our major work groups. And in those, they received a pay increase. We still need to go through the JCBA process with some remaining work groups, but that should not result in the type of pay increase that you saw with the pilots. The pilots, we took a different approach where the first step was to get the JCBA.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And you're saying going forward, at some point, we should start seeing productivity to offset the further wage increases?", "John D. Rainey", "That's correct. A lot of the investment we made in the operation took place with more hedge in the third quarter last year. In the third quarter of this year, we should get pretty close to our productivity level last year. But in the fourth quarter, you'll begin to see year-over-year improvement.", "Operator", "From Barclays, we have Dave Fintzen online.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just to follow-up a bit on some of the cost questions and just maybe take a little bit of a step back. John, you mentioned sort of 2% to 4% CASM x fuel in the second half. Obviously, there's a lot of structural initiatives underway. I mean, did you think out over the next couple of years? Obviously, old United was through bankruptcy, you've been in -- through the merger for a while. Are those structural initiatives enough that we should be thinking inflation -- less than inflation on CASM x fuel with the kind of capacity declines maybe we'll see? Or is it -- is that 2% to 4% more the run rate we should be thinking about or something inflation-plus over the next couple of years on CASM? Can you just kind of help us -- not even in '14, specifically, just the next -- enough of a horizon, so we just have some sense of the run rate?", "John D. Rainey", "Sure, Dave. We're not going to manage this business on a run-rate basis with 4% annual CASM growth. Period. We absolutely need to have, in a capacity-flat world, CASM growing at something less than inflation. We're going to see cost pressures in all the normal areas that are more difficult to control, like landing fees and other rent. But with different initiatives, like the fuel efficiency, putting technology in the hands of our employees and customers, we can drive huge savings to the bottom line each year. And we've got several of those initiatives already in place and hope to begin to see those take effect next year. So on a run-rate basis, we should absolutely be held to the standard of keeping our CASM x fuel growth at something less than inflation each year.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have John Godyn online.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jeff and Jim, both of you mentioned a lot of commentary about the attractiveness of the network to business travelers and improvements that you're making to appeal to corporate travel. We've certainly seen Delta make improvements of their own and the Virgin Atlantic concept that they have going on, and we know that new American is on the horizon and some of their synergies are related to taking corporate travel market share back. I was hoping that you guys could just shed some light on how you see the corporate travel competitive landscape evolving from here. And should we be envisioning a more competitive corporate travel market? Or is the pie getting bigger? Any color there will be helpful.", "James E. Compton", "John, this is Jim. I'll start. I think that the way I think about it from our perspective and a capacity discipline philosophy is that as -- demand is measured by GDP growth faster than capacity. I think the pie is growing, and obviously that's dependent on the strength in the economy. That allows us to then manage that demand much more appropriately and manage the mix up. And that's just business traffic in general, but corporate's obviously a piece of that. Within that, the way we think about corporate is, again, our conversations with our corporate travel partners are about the value proposition that we bring to them and trying to price it accordingly to that value proposition. And so it will -- it is competitive. It will be competitive. But we think that our value proposition is, when it's our turn in front of the travel managers, a pretty powerful one, given our network, given the systems that we have in order to make sure that the capacity is there for them and so forth. So I don't know if that answers your question other than that it will be competitive. We do think we have a terrific value proposition with that leading network that will give us a really good position in that competitive environment.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Wall Street Journal, we have Susan Carey online.", "Susan Carey", "Jim, I just wanted to verify a couple of points on your RASM guidance I -- maybe I misunderstood. You're saying that you're having -- your third quarter forecast is PRASM growth of 3% to 5%?", "James E. Compton", "Susan. Yes, our guidance on the third quarter is 3% to 5%, that's the range. And I mentioned that July was running at approximately 3%.", "Susan Carey", "And did you give us a full year?", "James E. Compton", "No. No, we only went out through the -- the guidance was only through the third quarter.", "Susan Carey", "And your third quarter capacity is going to fall by 0.4% to 1.4%?", "James E. Compton", "That's correct.", "Susan Carey", "And full year, 0.75% to 1.75% decline?", "James E. Compton", "Yes. Yes, that's correct.", "Susan Carey", "Okay. I just want to make sure. And my second question, I guess, will be for John. I'm just not aware of these 2 programs you announced on the labor side, the Early Out programs, the voluntary Early Outs for CSAs and ramp. And I believe you said these elective programs are subject to new JCBAs or just CBAs? And also I wanted to know a little bit more about the modification program for half the management and admin folk. Can you spell those out a little bit more?", "John D. Rainey", "Sure, Susan. The Early Out program, you're correct, it's contingent upon achieving a joint collective bargaining agreement. Both the dollar amount and the number of employees that will participate in that is yet to be determined. We've just announced that. But this is an opportunity where the company can benefit immediately through lower wages, and it provides good options at the election of our employees. So we're very excited about that. With respect to the pension, you're seeing a general trend across all industries and companies moving to defined contribution programs. And as part of the merger, we needed to align the retirement programs for all of our management and administrative coworkers. This was a step in that direction, and what we've elected to do is move the Continental side of the management and administrative to defined contribution programs well.", "Susan Carey", "And on identical terms as the UAL side?", "John D. Rainey", "Yes, that's correct.", "Susan Carey", "Okay, so there -- the Continental folks are moving to the United DB plan?", "John D. Rainey", "United defined contribution plan...", "Susan Carey", "The DC plan. Okay. And this has already been done?", "John D. Rainey", "Yes, we just announced this. It will begin to take effect next year.", "Operator", "From Bloomberg News, we have Mary Jane Credeur online.", "Mary Jane Credeur", "Could you elaborate a little bit more about your thinking on capacity? Some of your peers across the industry -- most of your peers across the industry are going to be up a little bit the back end of this year, granted some of that is issues unique to them, upgauging aircraft, some longer stage lengths. But why is this decline right for you? And are you risking potentially leaving some business on the table?", "James E. Compton", "Mary Jane, this is Jim. Our capacity guidance and philosophy hasn't changed at all. It's geared toward that capacity discipline and making sure that supply and demand are in line. As you mentioned, we had some impacts, obviously, last year from Superstorm Sandy on the East Coast in our base, so that we have -- we do have some capacity growth in the fourth quarter coming this year with nearly half of that the result of that. But if you look over the long-term, our long view, as John also mentioned, that our fleet count will remain relatively stable over the next 5 years, that our capacity is also going to be very stable. So nothing about our approach to capacity has changed and don't anticipate that to change, given our fleet order and our 5-year plan. So -- but we do have that issue in the fourth quarter where the comps from last year are driving some capacity growth.", "Operator", "And we have time for one more question from the media. From the Associated Press, we have Josh Freed online.", "Josh Freed", "Can you say a little more about what you have in mind when you talk about doing revenue management on ancillary products as you've done on Economy Plus? Can you help me understand sort of where you're headed with that?", "James E. Compton", "Josh, this is Jim. The ancillary group and the merchandising group works very closely and actually have brought in some of the talent from revenue management into that group to assist in this area. Some of these things we're doing -- 1 year ago, for instance, in Economy Plus, we would have had one price point, right? And today, we have multiple price points, that's the results of our transition to the SHARES PSS system, giving us the ability to begin to segment the customers and offer different price by where the seat is, by day of week, by market and so forth. So some very initial kind of revenue management principles, particularly on the pricing side, we're already applying. And I think we're seeing great results as we talked about the 37% growth in Economy Plus sales that I talked about earlier. Our goal is to continue to build on that and to -- without giving any kind of specific initiatives, revenue management is all about appropriately segmenting the -- what customers are looking for and what they value and pricing that accordingly, understanding that demand and pricing that. And we think some of the revenue techniques that we do in the traditional way in terms of managing fare and inventory, we're going to be able to do in the ancillary side and drive some of that great results even further.", "Sarah Murphy", "Okay. We're out of time now, so we'll conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call Media Relations if you have any further questions.

With that, I will turn it over to DeAnne.", "DeAnne Gabel", "As announced yesterday, Continental will record a special non-cash tax charge in the fourth quarter, but has not finalized the amount given the technical nature of the issue. As a result, today the company is presenting its pre-tax results. By mid-February, Continental will finalize the computation of a special non-cash tax charge, and will report its net results in the company's Form 10-K.", "Earlier today, we issued an updated for investors presenting information relating to our financial and operational outlook for the first quarter or full year 2008. This investor update was included in our filing with the SEC and can be found on our website under the Investor Relations section.", "Let me give you the usual reminder today that we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures such as pre-tax income excluding special items. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures to be discussed can be located on Continental's website at continental.com under the Investor Relations section. In addition, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements that are not limited to historical facts, but reflect the company's current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events. Our forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For examples of such risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors set forth in the company's 2006-10-K, and as well as securities filing.", "With that, let us get started and turn it over to Larry.", "Larry Kellner", "To those of you on the call, good morning and thanks for joining us.", "As I have often stated, my co-workers are the backbone of our success and I want to star off by thanking them for the dedication and team work, which resulted in Continental reporting a pre-tax profit for the full year as well as for the fourth quarter of 2007.", "As a result of our 2007 financial performance, I am pleased to say that on this upcoming Valentine\u2019s Day, we will distribute a record of $158 million of profit sharing to our co-workers. That is $47 million more than we distributed last year. On behalf of the entire management team, I want to thank my co-workers for a job well done.", "For the full year 2007, on a pre-tax basis, we recorded income of $566 million or $542 million excluding previously announced special items. A large improvement over last year. For the Fourth Quarter 2007, excluding special items, Continental reported pre-tax income of $24 million. Our first Fourth Quarter pre-tax profit for the year 2000. including special items, we reported a Fourth Quarter pre-tax profit of $71 million. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $63 million excluding net special items or $80 million including the items. This is our largest Fourth Quarter operating income in more than five years.", "Considering the fuel price increases cost us more than $200 million over last year\u2019s Fourth Quarter, I am especially pleased with our results. They were achieved by combining strong revenue growth with a continued focus on increasing our efficiency throughout the business and other cost producing initiatives.", "In addition to solid financial results, the team once again did a great job delivering consistent operational performance. For the full year, we averaged a record of 81.7 mainline load factor on a year-over-year capacity increase of 5.6%. And our monthly DOT on time performance ranked within the top half of the major network tiers in ten of the twelve months in 2007.", "This strong operational performance earned my co-workers $33 million or $755.00 each in on-time incentive payments during 2007. When you combine the on-time incentives, my co-workers will receive $191 million incentive payments for their excellent performance in 2007.", "Looking at 2008, there had been numerous reports that the US is on the cusp of an economic recession. We are watching our future bookings closely and do not be slowed down based on our current booking levels. We did see some softness in bookings over the holiday period. This softness may have been caused by slowing economy or could have been due to how the holiday spell with Christmas and New Year\u2019s falling on a Tuesday, however, we are pleased with the strength of our bookings over the last ten days, and again, do not see a slow down based on our current booking levels.", "Regarding the airline sector specifically, as you know, the level of on whether it is about potential industry consolidation has increased. As you might suspect, we have been asked a few times about what the consolidation are. We are obviously following developments closely.", "As I have said before, we have talked to a lot of people in the industry and we readily analyzed the risk and rewards of potential business combinations involving Continental as well as the effect of the business combinations among our competitors could have on us. We believe that our competitive position continues to improve, first, I have got great co-workers who enjoy coming to work and take great pride in providing clean, safe and reliable air transportation everyday. That results in a strong product which we continue to enhance.", "From a network perspective, our competitive position also continues to improve. For example, we will now have access to London, Heathrow which has previously been denied. We are expanding growth markets like China and India with the addition of Mumbai last fall and Shanghai in 209/", "In addition, in spite of the recent DOT announcement regarding voluntary flight gaps at Liberty, we can expand our capacity there by replacing regional jets with mainland aircraft and a cruising aircraft size on our current mainland flights. We have a a modern fuel efficient fleet a time when fuel prices made that matter a great deal. So we have got the best new aircraft order book among the major network carriers at a time when Boeing and AirBus are pretty much sold out of new airplanes for several years.", "In addition to our powerhouse set at Liberty, we have a large modern hub in Houston where many companies in the local economy actually benefit from high fuel prices. We have been investing in both Liberty and Houston over the years and so we are well positioned for strategic growth.", "We also have the highest percentage of our capacity dedicated in international flying of the major network carriers who will continue that profitable international growth strategy. However, as I have said, we continue to watch developments closely. Our overall position remains the same. We have a strong plan should the industry remain as it is and should the landscape change, we will always act in the best long-term interest of our shareholders, our co-workers, our customers and the communities we serve.", "Before I close, I want to add that we join Boeing in being disappointed about further delays in the 787 program that they announced yesterday. Boeing is a great partner to Continental, and they are not focused on just delivering a plane, but rather, they are focused on delivering a great plane. When it makes its arrival, the 787 is destined to be a game-changer. And its impact on global aviation is going to be significant for decades to come.", "As we get information on the extent of the delay, we will make appropriate adjustments to enable us to continue to develop our international network. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Smisek and Jeff Misner to discuss the quarter\u2019s revenue and cost performance details.", "Jeff Smisek", "We had a great year in 2007 and I want to thank all my co-workers for delivering superb results. We once again had solid top line growth. In 2007, we grew a total revenue by more than a billion dollars to $14.2 billion. That was an 8.4% growth rate, almost double our capacity growth rate. We even had a very good top line growth in the seasonally weaker fourth quarter, with total revenue increasing 11.6% to more than $3.5 billion. During the quarter, mainline RASM was up 6.9% year-over-year driven by a yield increase of 7.6% as the mainline load factor decreased 0.5 point year-over-year to 79.7%. We continue to see year-over-year yield improvement in all our international regions and we saw some nice improvements in the mainline as well, which were up 6.9% year-over-year.", "During the fourth quarter, we also saw strength in regional yield which were up 9.7% driving regional RASM up 9.8% load factor or about flat year-over-year at 77.3%.", "Throughout 2007, our team did a great job managing our inventory, pricing our product competitively and taking actions to more appropriately segment business and leisure travelers such as re-instituting the Saturday-night stay requirement in certain markets, all with the result of maximizing our revenue. And of course, you do not get paid if you do not complete the mission.", "Despite several major winter storms in the mid-west and the Northeast during the quarter, our team delivered a system-wide mainline segment completion factor of 99.2%.", "Looking ahead to the first quarter, demand throughout all regions remain strong and yields continue to run higher than last year as we have been able to recapture a portion of the rising cost of fuel through increased fares or higher fuel surcharge. Importantly, to be able to do this without experiencing any material drop-off in demand, we are comfortable with our forward bookings over the next six weeks. Consolidated domestic bookings for the next six weeks are running one to two points ahead of last year. The Latin bookings are about two points ahead of last year. Both trans-Atlantic and Pacific bookings over the next six weeks are running slightly behind last year, however, we expect much of this gap will narrow by the end of the quarter.", "For the first quarter, we expect both our consolidated and mainline load factors to become about half a point year-over-year.", "With regards to corporate travel specifically, we have not seen a slow down in demand. In early December 2007, we met with approximately 50 of our top corporate accounts and they have generally indicated to us that they expected their international travel would be up slightly versus 2007 and that their domestic travel would be about the same level this 2007.", "We continue to be encouraged by the average ticket price growth on continental.com, our lowest cost distribution channel. During the fourth quarter, the average ticket price sold on continental.com was 18.3% year-over-year and fourth quarter sailed on and kind of coming up to 19.6% year-over-year. In addition, just last week, we set a new seven-days sales record of $82.7 million on continental.com.", "On the capacity front, we expect first quarter consolidated capacity to be up 4.1% compared with the first quarter of 2007 with consolidated domestic capacity down 0.2% and consolidated international capacity up 10%. Our first quarter international growth is mainly driven by the run rate of new markets we started last year.", "For the full year 2008, we expect to grow mainline capacity 2% to 3% and expect mainline domestic capacity will be down slightly year-over-year. For the full year, about half of our international growth will be attributable to the run rate of new market added in 2007, we also plan to up-gauge and add frequency to a number of our routes to Latin America this year.", "We will continue to execute our long-term growth plan with a focus on international expansion while maintaining our flexibility to react to a changing environment.", "Access to London, Heathrow has been on our most wanted list ever since Larry and I came to Continental almost 13 years ago, and we are pleased to begin offering service to Heathrow from both our Houston and Liberty hubs at the end of March.", "We are also pleased that DOT is taking action to place voluntary caps on aircraft operations at Liberty and JFK. These caps should help our operations in the New York area which has been the most congested air space in the nation. We will be able to grow our capacity at Liberty as Larry mentioned over time by up-gauging the size of aircraft we operate there.", "In closing, I want to again thank my co-workers for the great job they did on the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2007.", "On Valentine\u2019s Day, I look forward to participating with all of my fellow officers in distributing a hundred dollars of profit sharing to our well-deserving co-workers. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Misner.", "Jeff Misner", "Thank you for joining us this morning. As Larry and Jeff said, 2007 ended up being a great year and we are really happy with the results, particularly given a difficult fuel and operating environment we faced. We are also pleased to post the pre-tax profit for the fourth quarter in the face of a hundred dollar plus per barrel of jet fuel. Additionally, as Jeff mentioned, our team did a great job on the revenue side and I congratulate them, but I also want to add my complements to the team for delivering on the cost side. They did a terrific job as well.", "The profits went up today as the direct result of the commitment of our entire team to our company, our shareholders and our customers. As DeAnne mentioned, we filed our investor updates this morning, which has our first quarter 2008 guidance.", "Since the guidance is posted on our website, I will not take the time repeat it all in my comment. However, for the first quarter of 2008, we expect mainline CASM excluding holding fuel rate constant to be up about half a percent year-over year. For the full year 2008, we are targeting consolidated mainline CASM excluding specialized holding fuel rate constant to be down slightly. We continue to work at improving our cost structure and we have taken a lot of cost out of the system over the last few years, but that does not mean we are going to sit back and relax.", "Last year, in addition to taking advantage of many small, but meaningful opportunities, we also made significant improvements in some maintenance and technology contracts, which we expect together with several smaller initiatives, will save us more than $100 million annually while we get them all fully implemented.", "Looking forward, we will continue to focus on distribution cost and regional flying as well as continue to scour our cost for other opportunities. For the $14 billion cost structure, we can always find something to improve on and we will continue to work hard to lower our unit cost without sacrificing our operational integrity or our product.", "Unfortunately, it seems like every corner we discussed the rising cost of fuel and unfortunately, this quarter is no exception, but we cannot control the cost of fuel, we can continue our efforts to increase our fuel efficiency. We will achieve some efficiency gains just by replacing some of our older less fuel efficient 737-500 aircrafts with new more fuel efficient 737-800 and 900 ERF aircraft to be delivered throughout 2008.", "To give you an example just how meaningful this can be, if you compare our 737-800 fleet to an MD-80 fleet or a DC-9 fleet, and you assume a thousand mile stage lane, our 737-800 burns an average of 5.8 gallons less per seat than MD-80 and 14.6 gallons less per seat of DC-9. At $2.50 per gallon, that means for an MD-80, you have to have $14.00 more of revenue for every seat on the plane. And that every seat, whether or not they are sold and for that you have to generate $36.00 more in revenue for every seat on the plane that is just to cover the extra fuel cost versus our 737-800. And if you cross an entire fleet, the numbers add up pretty quickly.", "In addition to the fuel efficiency of our fleet, our fuel taskforce continues to look for better ways to run the airline and reduce fuel burn to more efficient operations wherever possible.", "And we continue to hedge a portion of our near-term fueling in 2007, we recognize the fuel hedge gains are more than $51 million and you can find the details of our current hedge position in the investor update.", "From the fleet as we announced last year, we have entered into agreement to sell 15-owned 737-500 aircrafts. Three of which exited the fleet in 2007. The remaining 12 are scheduled to exit the fleet by the end of this year 2008. And during the fourth quarter, we entered into an agreement to terminate the leases on five additional 737-500 aircrafts which will be sold. These aircrafts are also scheduled to exit the fleet by the end of 2008.", "The 737-500 is the least fuel efficient, highest standard aircraft that we operate that makes good sense in this environment to take advantage of the opportunity to sell them. These 737-500 exits begin with the retirement of one 737-300 and a 32 new aircraft deliveries that Larry mentioned will bring us to the mainline fleet count of 379 by yearend, up 14 aircrafts by the end of the year.", "Now, briefly turning to cash flow, we ended 2007 with $2.8 billion of unrestricted cash in short term investments and expect the end of the first quarter of 2008 with between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion of unrestricted cash.", "In our investment update that we filed this morning, we noted a range of capital expenditures for 2008. While some our CapEx is related to projects we have committed to, we also have other projects which can be deferred. As reflected in the range given at $538 million to $688 million of CapEx. Should economic conditions warm, we will scale back our capital expenditures and can do that without materially impacting our operations.", "In addition, we noted in the investor update that total debt in capital lease principal payments are estimated to be $652 million in 2008. However, there is approximately $200 million of aircraft debt during this year that we expect to be able to finance.", "Similarly, while we currently plan to contribute $257 million to our defined benefit pension plans for 2008, we do have the flexibility to fund only $140 million for the year, and still meet our minimum funding requirements, and last week, we contributed $60 million for 2008 funding requirements.", "We will always have more work ahead. We are very pleased with our progress. Our past investments are a clearly paying off, our facilities are world-class and are strategically located to support our globally well-balanced international network. Our product continues to gain attention as being the best in the industry and most importantly, our people are without a doubt, the best in the business.", "All of these efforts clearly are producing industry leading results that are evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year results. We will continue to make smart investments to ensure our continued success for the future of our shareholders and employees and satisfaction of our customers.", "Finally, we expect to file our 2007 Form 10-K next month. With that, I will turn it back to Larry.", "Larry Kellner", "2008 can prove to be a year of many changes. And as I have said before, just like we have always done, we will act in the best long-term interest of all of our stakeholders.", "In addition, because it is important not to lose sight of the basics of our business, we will continue to focus on providing clean, safe and reliable air transportation and get better than our competitors. My co-workers make sure we do that everyday, and I want to again thank them for all they do. With that, I will turn the call back over to DeAnne to begin the QA.", "DeAnne Gabel", "With that, we will open the Question and Answer session for the analyst, followed by the Question and Answer session for the media.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions.)", "Our first question comes from William Greene from Morgan Stanley. William, please go ahead.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "I am wondering if you can talk to us, are there any reasons why you would not be able to stay in the Sky Team alliance or in your domestic co-chair when the Delta and Northwest merger were announced?", "Larry Kellner", "I think if we would look at it, we will watch how the industry unfolds and always look for kind of what is the best positioning for us. We are very happy with our relationship in the Sky Team and where we are. We have got good partners. We are in that alliance with Delta and Northwestern and the Sky Team as well. So I do not want to speculate with where all the future would go, but I would tell you we are happy with where we are. That is a grouping up here that is all in the Sky Team today.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "No, is there something in the agreements that sort of prohibit you from staying in the event of a change of control?", "Larry Kellner", "All of those agreements are confidential, Bill, so I do not want to comment on the details of our agreements with the Sky Team period.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Can I ask just a couple of revenue questions? When you go into Heathrow, should we assume that it will be either a drag or eventually, I assume some sort of step up in the trans-Atlantic yields, but when we think about first quarter and second quarter modeling, will that have a noticeable effect, I do not it not too late for first quarter effect, but I do not know about second.", "Larry Kellner", "Yes, clearly, if you look at the first quarter, we do not start until March 30 on arrival there. So it is not going to have any impact on the first quarter. We are adding capacity. We will go to pre-flight so if you look fee levels, we will stay pretty close because we have not used to for instance, from Houston 2-777s, but we use 2-76s and a 777 from Houston and then we use 2-75s in Gatwick from New Ark. There will clearly be some transition there. I could not tell you right now whether it would be positive or it would be a slight fix while we are still up there, typically in a new market\u2019s running capacity, we would expect the little pull up in the second quarter, but Heathrow is a little unique so we will just work with that as we get there.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, just lastly, the holiday shift? How much on average does that affect RASM in a quarter?", "Larry Kellner", "You are talking about?", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "The Easter shift?", "Jim Compton", "In fact, it is a relatively small number. During the holidays, obviously with the Tuesday that it fell in; comments is that a lot of traffic moved into January with that Tuesday and kind of that week pulling off more leisure in the past.", "In terms of Easter going forward, I think that you will see a little of it obviously moving into March in the first quarter domestically. I think, internationally, sometimes it is a shift from the Easter holiday internationally will actually keep it out into April, so I would say it is a net positive Easter moving into March.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for your help.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ray Neidl from Caylon Securities. Ray, please go ahead.", "Ray Neidl - Caylon Securities", "Just to clarify the tax charge for the fourth quarter, I noticed in your guidance that you are going to be booking taxes about 36% going forward, even though most of it is non-cash, in the fourth quarter this year, that tax charge, should we consider that a one time charge or should we consider that as a normal EPS type of charge if that is the case, I calculated, you made about $0.22 for the quarter.", "Jeff Misner", "The fourth quarter charge is a one time charge as we explained. Kind of related to some changes in the law with respect to the policy of retirements and so on, so that is kind of a one time charge. Going forward, we will be booking taxes normally as we have done in the past years ago.", "Ray Neidl - Caylon Securities", "Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying that. The other thing is, Larry, if you could just clarify for us the golden bullet that Northwest has. When officially does that terminate? What state does the Delta-Northwest negotiations for merger have to go to before that bullet is terminated, which leaves you free to pursue your own course?", "Larry Kellner", "Ray, the golden share, we have a couple of options, it does not terminate, we actually just have the right to repurchase it for I believe six months going forward from there so that the trigger would be definitive documents. It is not the confirmation of the merger we need it to be definitive documents and they would have had to announce the definitive deal before we have the right to redeem the golden share.", "Ray Neidl - Caylon Securities", "And what cost would that be to Continental to redeem it?", "Larry Kellner", "A hundred dollars.", "Ray Neidl - Caylon Securities", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Goldman Sachs. Robert, please go ahead.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "This is actually Chris filling in for Rob. Just wanted to dig a little deeper on the international demands on recognizing your commentary that corporate demand is holding up nicely and both factors are up nicely. If we can dig into the trans-Atlantic and Pacific, you did comment that load factors are down slightly. Is that just a function of getting more aggressive on yield or is there is any clause that perhaps, we are coming to an inflection point considering that trans-Atlantic spend?", "Jim Compton", "As we mentioned in the update, we are basically seeing load factors that are down a bit. We think we will close that gap and we are very happy with the yield trade off that we have out there as the strength in the yield that we saw in the fourth quarter. We do not see anything breaking away from that as we look forward in the first quarter.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, fair enough and then Jeff perhaps on the cost opportunities that you alluded for 2008, you mentioned distribution, you mentioned the most expenses, could you just perhaps flush that out a little bit more detail with a little more granularity?", "Jeff Misner", "I mean, in the distribution side, we are of course pursuing the kind of new things to appropriately channel, and so we think there are still some opportunities in that particular area. On the regional side, we are looking at opportunities with Express Jet to see if we can make some enhancements to the contract there, and so we will kind of work those issues as we go forward, we really do not have enough on that. And just across the whole spectrum of cost, there is a number of things that you can do in terms of trying to gain more efficiencies where there is use of technology or other methodologies, and then also, as the company kind of continues to evolve, what was important yesterday may not be as important today and we may have new focus and new things that we want to focus on and so, one of the key is I think, continue to work the cost side, as you start on new opportunities and others become less important, you need to kind of weed those cost up for those other things that are no longer currently as important and sometimes, they have a tendency to kind of get set into place and they are in there and you have to drag them out and get rid of them a little bit, so there is opportunity to that nature as well, so there is just a whole host of things that we can look at and we will continue to do. We have got a lot of metrics that we measure all different departments by and we will kind of continue to learn those and those kind of drive towards efficiencies.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. Thank you for your time.", "Operator", "Our next questions comes from Mike Linenberg from Merrill Lynch. Mike, please go ahead.", "Mike Linenberg - Merrill Lynch", "Two questions, the first is, I look at your week count. It looks like for yearend \u201908 versus yearend \u201907, you are up about 4%, and that is your mainline fleet, you have indicated that your mainline capacity is going to be up 2% to 3%, and when I look at the airplanes that are coming in and the planes that are going out, it looks like that the planes that are coming in are like 50% larger with these larger 737-800 and 900s coming in, are you getting there because we are looking at the rate on your mainline fleet in 2008 or are you maybe anticipating additional 737-300s or maybe other aircraft that are older coming out the fleet this year?", "Jim Compton", "There is a combination factors. A bit of it is utilization and a bit of it is timing of the aircrafts coming in and aircrafts departing, and there is a little bit work that is still being done and exactly how the schedule is going to shake out, given some of the activity in the northeast border with cap and so on, so we are kind of still working our way through that, but I think there is a little bit on the utilization side and a little bit timing of the deliveries and exits.", "Mike Linenberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then just my second question, and maybe I will throw this at you and Jeff as well, in the September 10-Q, it was indicated that you would be spending potentially up to $130 million for slots that he said that your service pattern, it appears you got some pretty good slots there, early arrival and decent time of departure, I think there was a report out there that you may have paid as much as $60 million for a single slot pair, ultimately what you paid, how does that reconcile to the $130? Did you get up to the $130, or was the CapEx number bigger than that? Any color on that front?", "Jim Compton", "I cannot really go into the specifics of what we paid in the individual slot, but I think our commentary earlier was that at that point, that is what we kind of committed to, but I think, in the current year, it is reflected in our CapEx, the numbers that we have provided you so the amount that we are paying is kind of out there, buried I guess in the CapEx, but we cannot really talk in terms of the specifics on any particular pair of slot.", "Larry Kellner", "I would add that we are happy where we ended up. We are very positive both in London and to the network on a long-term basis. It was a lot of work, but it was important to us to be well positioned, both in Houston and in Liberty and we think we accomplished that result at a price that was in the same line when we went to the Board originally kind of thinking here is the authorizations we needed and we are able to accomplish that in line with our Board authorizations.", "Larry Kellner", "And Mike, if you anybody who has got anymore slots for sale, please give us a call.", "Mike Linenberg - Merrill Lynch", "Well that was going to be my next question, you are obviously still in the market looking for additional slots.", "Larry Kellner", "We will look to build our pattern in Heathrow over time. We think there is significant demand from New York to Heathrow. I think if you look at our competitor\u2019s schedule, you will see that we will still have some opportunities there.", "Mike Linenberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great and nice job this quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jamie Baker from J.P. Morgan.", "Jamie Baker - J.P. Morgan", "Jeff, I am under the impression, United might be for sale and they have some Heathrow slots if that helps you out. My real question is a follow up regarding the recent meeting with your top 50 corporate accounts, I am curious, roughly what percentage of revenue they might account for and what industries they are bias to. I am curious for example, how large a role of financial service firms might play in that top 50?", "Jeff Misner", "Well, my recollection, I had sit in a portion of the meeting and my recollection is that it was a pretty broad range of corporate customers. There were obviously large representatives from large pharmaceutical companies that we deal with located in New Jersey and the northeast. Some obviously oil and gas companies here at Houston that is really a broad range. I do not recollect the distribution in terms of financial services firms that were represented, and I can imagine with all of the fallouts from sub prime mortgages and all that is going on with the financial service firms right now, everybody else has cut back that they might well be adjusted to travel.", "Larry Kellner", "And we can also add that while there is a small percentage if you look at our total revenue across the system, they are much more important when you look at international business first which is the key driver of what we do and so we tend to look at them as a key group, not so much as the percentage of total revenues, but what they drive on our international network and front.", "Jamie Baker - J.P. Morgan", "Well, and for what it is worth, I do not want to take attention away from Continental. I was frankly surprised that after renewing corporate travel policies for this year, my employer did not make any substantive changes as it relates to air travel, so for what that is worth, thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Credit Suisse. Dan, please go ahead.", "Dan McKenzie - Credit Suisse", "How much of a benefit if any did Continental get from the New York airspace redesign in the fourth quarter, and I guess, I am just wondering if that is factored into your cost outlook looking ahead?", "Larry Kellner", "It started late in the quarter, Dan, and I think it will be very hard to measure because if it is a multi-year process to implement that airspace redesign and the pieces that are started are merely giving us a little ability to vector candidly, we would probably and again, hard to measure the revenue impact, but I can tell you it is a good operational impact and we commend Secretary Peters and the President for opening the military air space. We used that both over Thanksgiving for many flights as well as over the Christmas Holiday for many flights and it gave us another alternative because since it was announced in advance, we could plan for it and that was probably a larger impact to the quarter, but I think when you get to individual operational improvements like that, it is very difficult in a one off-bases to have any certainty in measuring a number that we want to put out there, but I can tell you the military airspace was positive and the airspace redesign on a long term basis will be positive for us and so we are happy to move it forward.", "Dan McKenzie - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and then just following up on an earlier fleet question, it looks like Continental is giving back CRJs this year. I am just wondering if you can provide some perspective on what is driving that and whether that is a good run rate going forward?", "Jeff Misner", "Yes, some of the CRJs that we operate, we will go ahead and have those removed. We are basically, every year 145 is kind of financial, remove the CRJs and of course they are offset a little bit by some people and hundreds of things that we have coming in as well.", "Dan McKenzie - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gary Chase from Lehman Brothers. Gary, please go ahead.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "As you look at the first quarter, at least the way we have it. The easiest revenue comparisons industry wide, I do not know that this is necessarily true for Continental, but the easiest comps industry-wide for revenue are in the first quarter, can you just give us a little more color around how your outlook that you say is strong, is it strictly in your context that you think the momentum will continue there or is it you feel like some of the yield gains that you have been able to achieve in the back half of 2007 will carry into \u201908 and you will still be able to get those flat load factors that we are talking about.", "Jim Compton", "I think it is important towards your second point that I think that what we are doing in the year of \u201907, there was momentum in the pricing environment, as well also the capacity and so I think that momentum actually carries not just in the first quarter, but actually gets considerably accomplished and moved through the year.", "Larry Kellner", "I would point out that we have actually, in the past, we tried very hard to give us much revenue guidance as we can, but further out you go in the year, we have found historically, it is just tougher and tougher for us internally or for you to predict simply because we are good at what we can see in the bookings, so our comments today are some things that you can see through yesterday and we will get a little smarter about how much of the fuel, what impact that has as we go forward in RASM and other areas as we go through the year, but we found it even internally difficult to see far out just because so much of the bookings are currently at 30 days and specifically a lot of high value bookings for the last 30 days.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "But Larry, I mean, it sounds like the strength that you are referring to is not just a function of the fact that you think that first quarter last year was a low point and easy comp, is that a fair way to restate what you just said.", "Larry Kellner", "I think that is it fair to say, I want to stick to where I was which was, we feel comfortable that while you see lots of reports of an economic slow down, as we look in our bookings, we feel comfortable with our booking levels as of today and I would tell you, we are not doing that at the expense of yields today, so we feel comfortable about our outlook from where we stand and we will keep watching everyday, I can assure you as I have mentioned in my comments that over the holidays, we did see some softness and we paid attention to it, looking back, I believe that had more to do with the Christmas and New Year\u2019s thing in the middle of the week on a Tuesday that it did with the slowing economy, but we will never know, we just did see some softness, but that has come back here over the last ten days.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "And Larry, could I ask you just one question too, and then I will let you back to the beach party you were apparently trying to start there, on consolidation, I have heard you talked about this in the past and I think I understand what you are saying, could you just give us a framework for how you are going to think about it, I mean, Continental is not a large airline now relative to some of your competitors, you get better revenue, you are happy with the performance I have heard you say that, so I have to assume that in viewing a shifting landscape, a change in the relative size of Continental is not by itself an important factor for you, is that fair and then could you just sort of take us to how you are going to think about it, and what it is that you are going to look at to determine if doing anything at all is appropriate for Continental?", "Larry Kellner", "I think there are two things, one I would disagree somewhat with you, if you do pay attention to the relative size, and I think we would have some concern. We have been working very hard over the last ten years to improve our relative position. We do have excellent hubs in New York and Houston and we have got a hub in Cleveland. We have got a good operation at Guam, but relative size is important in the network business and so I think we would pay attention to our relative size and we are going to watch this. What we see going out in the marketplace, there are lots of speculation in the press and we are just going to have to watch the market as we go forward and watch what our competitors do and watch what we believe our competitors are going to do and make what we believe are the best decisions for us. I cannot tell you because there are so many alternatives and I would just point out to give you a flavor for that. Jeff Misner and John Reiny probably have dozens of models, I can assure you the others are taking a 19% stake and Jet Blue was not one of them, and so there are always surprises in this business, we will keep our eyes on it. We will keep looking forward. If we see something or hear something, we will not hesitate to act aggressively and at the same time, we have got an excellent franchise. I have got great co-workers and we like our position as the industry stands today, but I suspect that if you look forward things will change whether they will change the consolidation part or change because of fuel prices, we will see and we will work to find the best solution for them. It is difficult to speculate because there are so many alternatives.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay, appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James Higgins from Soleil Security. James, please go ahead.", "James Higgins \u2013 Soleil Securities", "A couple of question, could you give us some color on the strength in your regional RASM in the fourth quarter, where it came from, it really seems to be surging relative to what has been the case earlier in the year.", "Jim Compton", "Regional RASM, Jim?", "James Higgins \u2013 Soleil Securities", "Yes. Just where you saw the strength.", "Jim Compton", "In terms of the regional capacity, Jim, we saw a good strength in New York Liberty partly due to a couple of things, two things. One, some of the things had just moved again to grow with the 190 down in New York and so forth as far as comparable comps. In addition, secondly we have been pretty focused on managing the revenue across the system, but also in New York particularly with some of the fences that Jeff alluded to in his comment.", "So whether if Karen and I stay, three-day minimum stay, the whole point being that we are business of segmentation and the adaptability of the segment of the business versus leisure calls us to optimize the revenue. A lot of that came in particularly in New York where we have that overlap with the regional capacity.", "We also saw strength obviously in Houston also. It has also begun to also move some of those fences into the marketplace also.", "James Higgins \u2013 Soleil Securities", "Great. You have a very good international business product but you lack something that increasingly your competitors are going to, which is the full flat business-class seat. I wonder how you are going to compete going into Heathrow with that current seat and wonder if you have any plans to change it?", "Larry Kellner", "One I would tell you at the meeting Jeff Smisek mentioned earlier with our Continental corporate customers. We got two clear messages. One may like a lie-flat seat; two, they did not want to pay anymore for it and they were very clear about the fact that if we were taking seats off the airplane to get a lie-flat seat and expecting to recover that in the fair that was not a good assumption and so as we roll out the 787, announce something with regard to our new international business. We are not ready to do that today.", "We understand both the demands from the marketplace to continually take that product up a notch, but we also are listening to our customers who have been very clear to us that there is a balancing factor on price and ultimately we have an obligation to our shareholders, to our co-workers and to everybody else to make sure we have business model that works. And so we will make some changes as we roll out the 787 and we intend to roll that through our fleet, but we are not ready to announce today and I think like lie-flat is a great product.", "But much like the CD old three class cabins going away where everybody used to have a great first class, a business class that look like domestic first and then a coach product. Actually, what we have got in his mini request for today is something that is cheaper than business first, but better than coach and from an operational perspective we will try to find the right balance because we do not want to get back and then try to operate a free class product.", "James Higgins \u2013 Soleil Securities", "Sounds like a good idea. And then finally, Southwest is talking a lot about technology called RNP, Required Navigation Performance, which they are saying they think can take several minutes off of their flights. Obviously, you are a longer hull carrier and so the impact might be less because it is all about approach and departure. Is that something that you have looked in and is that something you have given any thought to?", "Mark Moran", "We are working several initiatives with FAA and air traffic on enhancements with RNM and RNP. We have some efforts. We are working on Guam right now, GLS and we will continue to work through these initiatives.", "Larry Kellner", "Jim, the upside for us is while we are a longer hull carrier and we fly the heavily congested airspace in New York, we can get some benefits there, they could be significant.", "James Higgins \u2013 Soleil Securities", "We think so. Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Frank Boroch, from Bear Stearns, Frank please go ahead.", "Frank Boroch \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Good morning, Larry this question is for you. If you had a blank slate today and could establish in parts of the country aside from you are currently are, where would you want to be?", "Larry Kellner", "Well, I think as you look at our network, I am going to answer, Frank that a little bit more broadly, we view ourselves as having three things we need to improve. One was we have not had access to Heathrow, which is huge for our corporate customers. That will get fixed in late March, not to the full extent, we want to a little, we will sure be off to a good start. We have not gone to the trans-Pacific service at our 25-787 on order, we will do a lot to help us to fill that gap and increase our trans-Pacific service.", "We continue to be weak on the West Coast, more south, though I will tell you that the domestic business is not the most profitable thing today. We would be happy to get our domestic system back to break even and so we would be careful about domestic expansion, but if we have a weakness in out network it is more south on the West Coast.", "Frank Boroch \u2013 Bear Stearns", "I am just sure thinking about the flight caps in the Northeast. What would it takes for you guys to take to the recognize, slotted at New Ark as an asset on your books.", "Larry Kellner", "Since you addressed this to him or me, I will let him answer the accounting side, but I think that typically, where you put slots on your book it would be like Heathrow where we buy them. And, so I think, if you ended with a slot situation in New Ark, you would not put any thing on our books, because we are already in that position today.", "Jeff Misner", "We recognize these right now already. These voluntary caps.", "Jeff Smisnek", "I mean, unless we are paying for something then we will have that.", "Frank Boroch \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Okay great, thanks, guys.", "Ned Walker", "If you could review the Question and Answer process and once again for the journalists, if we could have one question, a quick follow-up. We should be able to accommodate many people as possible.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions.)", "Our first question from Andy Compart from Travel Weekly. Andy, please go ahead.", "Andy Compart \u2013 Travel Weekly", "I was just wondering if you could tell me about what level your free-surcharges are at now internationally and if you have one domestically. If you give any sense that is offsetting the fuel cost increase.", "Jim Compton", "It is hard to answer that in the simple way, because surcharges are so different across the system. Obviously, high in the internationally given the length and so forth, and they are also different geographically and internationally also.", "In the domestic, there is kind of base line right now and again it is a little bit more difficult, because the fuel surcharges on some fares, but it is not all fares. But, generally, it is $10.00 one in a way in US, kind of general sense, because it is a difficult flight because, light pricing over time, they tend to kind be more focused, move somewhat fluid, depending on competition and so forth.", "Andy Compart \u2013 Travel Weekly", "Can you say what the range is internationally or are you allowed or able to say how much revenue are you and specifically from the fuel surcharges themselves?", "Tim Compton", "Anywhere from $50.00, in certain countries $100.00, one-way in other countries.", "Andy Compart \u2013 Travel Weekly", "Can you separate what the revenue is from the surcharge itself?", "Tim Compton", "No.", "Andy Compart \u2013 Travel Weekly", "Okay, so you cannot say how much of the fuel increase or fuel cost that is offsetting.", "Tim Compton", "Yes, we do not look at it that way, obviously we are managing towards this higher fuel costs, but at the end of the day it is kind of a price point that is out.", "Andy Compart \u2013 Travel Weekly", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein, from Bloomberg News. Mary please go ahead.", "Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News", "Earlier, you were talking about the delay on the 787s, and you said that down the road you must be considering what you might need to make. Can you be more specific, in terms of what you might have to consider, do you expect delays in your deliveries at this point?", "Larry Kellner", "Yes, we expect our first plane is scheduled originally for March of 2009. We do not expect that plane to arrive in March of 2009 if it is going to be a safe assumption based on what Boeing said. We have three planes coming up in to 2009 and we are adding China in the spring of 2009. Clearly, that will make a great tough summer force in 2009, as we are going to have to take the planes to fly China or something else, likely, as we get a little more color we will be able to adjust that and explain where we are heading, but clearly we will have some challenges for the summer of 2009.", "Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News", "Do you anticipate that you might alter your order to some extent?", "Larry Kellner", "I am not going to comment on future orders.", "Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Hensel from the Houston Chronicle. Bill, please go ahead.", "Bill Hensel \u2013 Houston Chronicle", "I wanted to ask, you guys mentioned that you are going to be adding frequencies to Latin America. Could you expand on that a little bit?", "Jeff Misner", "We are taking delivery this year of 32 new generation 737 aircraft, 800 and 900 ARs, and we will be flying a number of those aircraft into Latin America. We will be increasing frequency in some markets and we will look to add some other markets as well. We are not in a position announce the decision of that right now, but that is where some of those aircraft will go to.", "Jim Compton", "One, we have already loaded it. It was just pointed. We have gone two times in Panama and we are looking at some frequency in Managua and Guatemala.", "Bill Hensel \u2013 Houston Chronicle", "You say you have already done Panama?", "Jim Compton", "Yes.", "Bill Hensel \u2013 Houston Chronicle", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Ritter from Reuters. Chris, please go ahead.", "Chris Ritter - Reuters", "I have a follow-up question I guess on the 787 delay. You said it is going to make for a tough summer for you in 2009 and because of the delay, is there any option to get some compensation from Boeing for the delay in terms of either money back on the planes or in terms of better pricing on future orders, anything like that.", "Larry Kellner", "Chris I will just give you the general answer. The Boeing is a great partner to us and we will work with them on a long term basis. I do not want to get into our contracts specifically with Boeing, but we will have some challenges in the short term. We recognize those and we will work through those with Boeing for the long term.", "Chris Ritter - Reuters", "Okay, alright. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Liz Fedor from Minneapolis Star Tribune. Liz, please go ahead.", "Liz Fedor - Minneapolis Star Tribune", "Good morning. I am sitting just a few miles away from where I know that golden share is sitting in a safe and so if you would like to elaborate anymore on how you feel that place with the consolidation realignment, I would be interested in that. But in particular Mr. Kellner, you indicated earlier in the call you said we are following developments closely. We believe that our competitive position continues to improve, so I am not getting a signal that you are eager to jump into this consolidation game right now. There are others who have laid out very specifically what their principles of consolidation are.", "Could you say, is it your preference to remain a stand alone carrier that you will only get in this consolidation game if it starts to unfold? If you could elaborate on any of those issues.", "Larry Kellner", "Let me just try to answer that and hearing your question and clarifying what I have said for you. We do believe we are very well positioned today and I think we have been pretty clear that we believe our path as an independent carrier if the industry remains as it is puts us in a good position. However, we know that things may change. The golden share does add some complexity to our situation and so if Northwest were to be merging with someone and that golden share was not in play that would change the nature of some of the restrictions on us and would also have changed the fact that the interest would be changing. So you have two facts coming together at once.", "We need to look at what was happening, where that was and what we thought that meant for us for the future. I think in analyzing those facts before we would be able to comment beyond that. There are so many scenarios and I want to be careful not to speculate but at the same time those who I am talking, my co-workers or were talking to investors or talking to media, it is clear we are paying attention to it and we are going to do what we think is in the best long term interest of our stakeholders.", "But any speculation on individual situation is difficult. But clearly in the case of Northwest, were they to be involved in a transaction and where the golden share then become redeemable because that would change our circumstances and we need to address that change condition and at that point, address what specifics we then knew and how we are going to respond to them.", "Liz Fedor - Minneapolis Star Tribune", "Have you had any conversations with any one representing Northwest, regarding the golden share in recent weeks, whether it is a representative or a Northwest executive?", "Larry Kellner", "The lawyers are waiving me off there, so I am just going to leave that question as a question.", "Liz Fedor - Minneapolis Star Tribune", "Would they prefer to answer the question?", "Larry Kellner", "No, I think they prefer we do not comment.", "Jim Misner", "Do you have another question?", "Liz Fedor - Minneapolis Star Tribune", "No, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question- is from David Jonas from Pro-Media Travel. David, please go ahead.", "David Jonas \u2013Pro-Media Travel", "Just a little thing, you folks could a little bit more about the paperless boarding pass pilot and how that came about and any prospects for expanding that either in Houston or at other airports.", "Larry Kellner", "We have been working closely with the TSA. The TSA has the level of security for them, knowing that the boarding pass is a genuine boarding pass. It is very convenient for our customer, especially customers, who are traveling on a return segment of their travel, where they may not have easy access to a printer.", "They can simply get that bar code on their PDA and use it, not only to get their security, but to check-in, to actually board our aircraft, as well as the gate. We are working with TSA. Right now, we have expanded it, we expect it to be in Boston, also in DC and in New Ark, and we expect that the rollout over the next couple of months, it is just a matter of coordinating with the TSA.", "I think that you will see that program grow; we believe it will be adapted by other carriers and hopefully, there will be one day where there never will be again any kind of paper in the boarding process.", "David Jonas from Pro-Media Travel", "Okay, great thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from David Koenig from Associated Press. David, please go ahead.", "David Koenig - Associated Press", "Okay, thanks. I had a question about the 787s, I think you probably said what you are going to say there, real simple, why did you bail out this week on the $50.00 fuel surcharge?", "Jim Compton", "The chronology of price increase and surcharge are always interesting. We initially went in on the surcharge. We actually went in a much more broader than the initial surcharge increase that United put in. We constantly monitor the competitive situation and as we saw people coming-in, in a much more limited basis, we actually took the opportunity to refuse our filing of that broad-based and go in at a smaller base. So at the end of the day, actually on Tuesday, we were one of the last one in about 35,000 shares on that surcharge as with Northwest.", "So, all those things, again it is again all fluid. Carriers come in at different points in the process and we are making an independent decision of what is right for us and as we went through that process, we have adapted it and changed the surcharge. At the end of the day, it was not competitively out there.", "David Koenig - Associated Press", "Okay, so the other folks were wheedling away at the surcharge underneath your feet, basically and you had to do what you did?", "Jim Compton", "Yes, we actually have been obviously doing a lot of things in the revenue, if you go back to the summer of \u201906 or even this past summer. We are much broader in surcharge in the system versus the competition. As I mentioned earlier, we actually have surcharges on fare price with other carriers, and told him it is just the fluid process that we are trying to optimize our revenue at a very micro level and a lot of moving pieces with increases like that.", "David Koenig - Associated Press", "Thanks.", "Ned Walker", "That concludes the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Financial results briefing. I want to thank, Larry, Jeff, Jeff, Jim, Mark, Jerry for your participation and especially the participation of everyone on the telephone. We will go ahead and conclude at this time and see every one back in April. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Welcome to Continental Airlines' Second Quarter 2007 Financial Results Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). ", "As a reminder, this conference call is being webcast and recorded Thursday July 19th, 2007. I would like to turn the call over to Ned Walker, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and DeAnne Gabel, Director of Investor Relations. ", "First, Mr. Walker. Sir, you may begin. ", "Ned Walker", "Thank you very much, Tatiana, and welcome everyone. Joining us here in Houston today we have Larry Kellner, our Chairman, our Chief Executive Officer, as well as Jeff Smisek, our President and member of the Board of Directors. Also Jeff Misner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Compton, our Executive Vice President of Marketing, Mark Moran, our Executive Vice President of Operations and Gerry Laderman, our Senior Vice President and Treasurer. ", "The format is similar to what we've done in previous earnings calls. Larry will have a broad overview comments on the industry as well as Continental. Jeff Smisek then will follow-up with capacity and revenue review, followed by Jeff Misner who will look at the cost structure and the balance sheet. ", "We've allocated about 20 minutes for the executive comments followed by 25 minutes for analysts' questions and after that 15 minutes for the media questions. Once again, we ask everyone if they can have one question with a quick follow-up, that way we can accommodate people as much as possible. ", "With that, I'll turn it over to DeAnne. ", "DeAnne Gabel", "Thanks, Ned. Earlier today, we issued an update for investors with any information relating to our financial and operational outlook for the third quarter and full year 2007 and other information. This investor update was included in a filing with the SEC and can be found on our website under the Investor Relations section. ", "Today we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures, such as net income excluding special items. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures to be discussed can be located on Continental's website at continental.com under the Investor Relations section. In addition, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements that are not limited to historical facts but reflect the company's current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events. Our forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For examples of such risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors set forth in this company's 2006-10-K, and as well as securities filing. ", "With that, I'd like to turn it over to Larry. ", "Larry Kellner", "Thank you, Ned and DeAnne. Good morning and thanks for joining us. First off, I want to thank my entire team of more than 45,000 co-workers. They're the backbone of our success, and they've done a tremendous job overcoming the daily challenges of running an airline and maintaining consistently reliable operation. Once again, they've pulled together to deliver solid results, achieving the largest second quarter pre-tax profit the company has posted since 2000. ", "I know that the high-low factors we've been running and the continuous weather issues add to the daily challenges, but I admire my co-workers' tireless commitment to customer service and quality. I'm proud to work with the most professional men and women in the business. ", "For the second quarter, Continental reported net income of $235 million, or profit of $2.10 per diluted share excluding special items, which is a 13% improvement over the same period last year. Including special charges, we reported a net income of $228 million, or a profit of $2.03 per diluted share for the quarter. As a result of our financial performance, I'm pleased to say that through June 30th, we've accrued $92 million for profit-sharing this year, which is a $32 million improvement over the same six month period last year. ", "The actual amount of profit-sharing to be distributed to co-workers next February depends on the company's full year 2007 financial results. But our goal is to stand at even bigger profit-sharing checks than we did this past February. My co-workers also earn $10 million in cash incentives during the quarter for finishing first in on-time monthly performance among the major network carriers in June and for finishing in the top three major network carriers in both April and May. Once again, we've shown when we work together, we win together. ", "In addition to improved financial results, the team set new operational records. We posted a record second quarter consolidated load factor of 83.2%, half a point higher than the records set last year. We're also making strides in demonstrating our commitment to the global environment. During the quarter, we announced a relationship with Sustainable Travel International, to offer customers the option of participate in a Carbon Offsetting Program. Proceeds from the purchased offsets will be invested into high impact sustainable environmental projects. ", "In addition, we continue to work on making our fleet more fuel efficient. During the quarter, work continued on our project to install winglets on 37 of our 737-500s and 11 of our long-range 737-300s. We expect to have winglets installed on more than 200 aircraft by the end of the year. We will itself reduce fuel consumptions and emissions by up to 5% by reducing drag and increasing aerodynamic efficiency. ", "Looking forward, as many of you know, we're operating at a tough domestic revenue environment. We've decided to scale back our growth plans for next year and now expect to grow mainline capacity 3% to 4% rather than the previous target of 5% to 7%. Our long-term plan beyond 2008 remains to grow mainline capacity an average of 5% to 7% annually. But as we've stated before, in some years that growth may be more and others may be less. ", "We will continue to execute our international growth plan. I'm sure many of you watched the unveiling of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner. This will be one of the most technologically advanced customer pleasing planes ever built. And we're competitively well positioned with 25 firm orders and options for many more. We're excited to add the 787 to our fleet beginning in 2009 and think it'll be a gain-changing aircraft with which to broaden our international footprint. ", "Before I close I have a few comments about the competitive environment. A lot is happening. Open skies with the EU brings both opportunities and challenges. Continental will for the first time have access to London Heathrow, while likely facing increased competition across the Atlantic and the prospect of additional European consolidation. Meanwhile in the U.S., new low-cost carriers are entering the market and existing low-cost carriers are growing. We expect the domestic market environment, although bolstered by strong summer demand, to continue to experience soft yields. ", "Finally, we're challenged by high energy prices. West Texas intermediates at over $75 a barrel and jet fuel is over $90 a barrel. As a results of all these, the competitive environment is changing, and we'll be responsive to that change. We have the best people and the best product in the industry and have a modern fuel-efficient fleet with 89 new Boeing aircraft on firm order including 25 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. We also have the only powerhouse hub in the New York area, and here in Houston our hub at Bush Intercontinental serves as a premier gateway to Latin America. ", "With that I'll call the call over to Jeff Smisek and Jeff Misner to discuss the quarter's revenue and cost performance details. ", "Jeff Smisek", "Thanks, Larry. I join Larry in thanking the entire Continental team for doing a great job this quarter. During the past three months we faced many challenges across our system, as summer storms caused delays and record heat made it tough to work on the ramp and in some of our shops. But the team did a great job maintaining the integrity of our operations and providing the high quality of service our customers expect. Thanks to all my co-workers for the superb job they do everyday. ", "The tough weather hurt our second quarter on-time performance however, I'm proud of our team for delivering a systemwide mainline segment completion factor of 99.4% during the quarter despite the bad weather. We know that while customers don't like to be late, they like it even less if we cancel and they're unable to get to their desired destination. So kudos to our entire team for being committed to getting the job done and getting our customers where they want to go. ", "During the quarter we once again achieved good top-line growth with passenger revenue increasing 5.2% to $3.4 billion. As a result of record load factors and increased international yields, consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile for the quarter increased to 0.5% year-over-year despite pressure on domestic yields and our reduction in regional flying. ", "In the second quarter, both domestic and international demand were strong, and we achieved a new record for second quarter consolidated load factor. Although we saw good mainline RASM results in June, we're hesitant about celebrating a domestic recovery quite yet, as we continue to see yield pressures in the domestic region. ", "Although there's been some recent domestic capacity reductions announced, we estimate that low cost carriers will put more than 25 additional aircraft in the domestic service during the second half of the year. We're doing what we can to drive our domestic yields up, such as our $7 domestic fuel surcharge, being selective about the sale fares we match and careful revenue management. ", "These efforts do make a difference at the margin but as an industry we've not been as successful as we were last year in increasing domestic fares to keep pace with the rising cost of fuel. It's also been a disappointment to see the level of industry fare selectivity that we've seen in this, the peak summer season. ", "Looking at our domestic system on a hub-by-hub consolidated basis for the second quarter, in Newark and Houston we have small capacity increases with load factors about flat. Cleveland load factors were down about 1.5 points year-over-year on capacity growth of 11%. For its O&G size, Cleveland has always been underdeveloped, and with some of the recent capacity decreases by our competitors in nearby hubs, we've got the opportunity now to begin to right size in the Cleveland market. ", "While domestic yields in general were down year-over-year in the second quarter, a considerable amount of the yield pressure was concentrated in our domestic markets out of the northeast. Our domestic network is an integral part of our system that provides our customers the connecting opportunities that help make our international market successful. ", "So we want to maintain a healthy balance between our domestic and international capacity and thus plan to grow our consolidated domestic capacity 2.8% this year. However, we are being responsive to the current domestic revenue environment, and as Larry mentioned, we are scaling back our mainline growth plans for next year. Substantially all of that reduction will be in the domestic system. ", "Looking forward to the third quarter, we expect overall demand to remain strong with our mainline load factor up year-over-year to between 84% and 85% and with our regional load factor also coming in higher at between 80% and 81%. We expect third quarter consolidated capacity to be up about 3.5% with consolidated domestic capacity up 2.1% and consolidated international capacity 5.3%. Even with our expected reduction in mainline capacity growth to between 3% and 4% in 2008, we'll continue to execute on our growth plan with a focus on international expansion, while maintaining our flexibility to react to a changing environment. ", "From a strategic perspective on the revenue side earlier this month, we entered into comprehensive alliance with Kingfisher Airlines, one of the fastest growing airlines in India. This alliance gives us frequent flier and airport lounge access reciprocity and future coach sharing providing better service to customers who travel between the U.S. and India and transfer between the two carriers. This relationship will compliment our existing service to Delhi and our new service to Mumbai, which is scheduled to start on October 1 of this year pending government approval. ", "Additionally, in June, we entered into a strategic relationship with China Southern Airlines for frequent flier and airport lounge access reciprocity and extensive coach sharing providing better service to customers who travel between the U.S. and China and transfer between the two carriers. And earlier this week we applied for service between New York and Shanghai for 2009 under the recently expanded bilateral agreement between the United States and China. ", "In closing, I again want to thank my co-workers for the great job they did this quarter. Our plan is working and yielding good results and we remain focused on returning to sustained profitability. We're going to continue to execute on our plan but will also be responsive to the changing environment. Regardless of what the future holds or what challenges must be overcome, as we work together we'll continue to win together. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Misner. ", "Jeff Misner", "Thanks, Jeff, and again thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Well despite all of our weather and ATC operational challenges, we're pretty pleased with our second quarter results. Revenue came in a bit stronger than we initially expected, and we continue to work the cost side of the ledger. I'd like to also join Larry and Jeff in saying thanks to all of our employees for a job well done. As DeAnne mentioned, because we thought it would be helpful to our investor community, we did file our investor update this morning which we used to file after the call. The update contains our third quarter full year '07 guidance, so I won't repeat a lot of the details in my comments. ", "So on the cost side, on a year-over-year basis, the increase in same quarter costs was primarily attributable to increased flying, higher maintenance costs and increase in profit-sharing and other variable compensation. Our second quarter mainline costs per available seat mile, is CASM, on a GAAP basis, increased $0.09 on 1% year-over-year. Excluding special items and holding fuel rate constant, mainline CASM was up 1.5% year-over-year, which was a little better than our guidance. ", "Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect our mainline CASM, again including special items and holding fuel rate constant, to be up about 3% year-over-year. As I mentioned last quarter, throughout 2007, we'll continue to see pressure on the maintenance line as our fleet ages and a larger number of heavy checks are needed. We also have some program escalations in our aircraft maintenance contracts but we are working on a couple of initiatives to offset some of these increases and hope to have some of those initiatives in place by year end. ", "We'll also see some increase in the wage and benefit line due to increased volume variable pay and our 2% compensation increase for all work groups that agreed to reductions in 2005 which went into effect earlier this month. Our cost pressures will be partially offset by improvements in our regional jet economics as we complete the transition of part of our regional flying to Chautauqua. Larry mentioned our current plan to scale back mainline growth a bit next year. That of course will put some additional pressure on CASM but we think it's the right thing to do in the current environment. ", "As I mentioned earlier, we'll keep working on the cost side, but we're not going to sacrifice our operational integrity just to save a buck. We're going to continue to invest in our product and in tools that help us do our jobs better including in investing in our people which means continuing to have sufficient staffing. As has been adequately demonstrated by some of our competitors lately, you can tighten things only so much from a staffing perspective before it ends up costing you more than you save. ", "On the fuel side, high fuel costs continue to plague the industry. During the quarter, Gulf Coast jet spot prices averaged $86.19 per barrel and they've continued to climb. Yesterday jet fuel spot price closed at $90.41 per barrel. To match higher fuel prices we're going to continue with our fuel hedging program. And as of yesterday, we've hedged approximately 34% and 13% of our projected fuel requirements for the third and fourth quarters respectively using general cost collared contracts. You'll find a lot more detail on our hedge position in the Investor Update. ", "In the third quarter, we expect fuel prices to average about $2.26 per gallon which includes taxes and the estimated impact of our hedges. For the unhedged portion of our third quarter fuel requirements, we're assuming an average cost per barrel for crude oil of $73.08 based on the forward curve as of July 10, with jet price for being $18 for July and $20 for August and September. Now as we said before, our best hedge is that we have the most fuel efficient fleet of any U.S. network carrier. ", "For the fleet earlier this month, we made some adjustments to our fleet plan as part of our continuing efforts to optimize our operations. Anticipated change in our fleet plan in the near term includes selling 10 Boeing 737-800 aircraft to Transaero. These aircraft are scheduled to be removed from the fleet from October 2007 through November 2008. We are also in discussions for the sale of five more Boeing 737-500 aircraft which would be removed from our fleet before the end of 2008. Additionally, we accelerated the delivery of three Boeing 737-900 ER aircraft from 2009 to 2008 to bring our total deliveries for new Boeing aircraft in 2008 to 33. I may have misstated that. I might have said 757-300s. What I meant is all those 10 and the additional five are 737-500 aircraft. ", "Briefly looking at the balance sheet, we entered the second quarter with $3.18 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments and expect to be in the third quarter with $2.8 to $2.9 billion of unrestricted cash. We'll provide you second quarter debt balances in the 10-Q which we expect to file later today. With respect to our defined benefit pension plans, we've contributed a total of $211 million to our pension plan so far this year and expect our total contributions during 2007 to total over $325 million. This significantly exceeds our estimated minimum funding requirement of $187 million for this year. Taking care of our obligations to employees is a defining part of our culture, and we'll continue to work hard to secure their future. ", "In conclusion, we continue to face cost pressures both on an absolute basis, as well as on a relative basis, because a number of our peers have been able to drastically cut their cost structures through bankruptcy process. But we'll keep our discipline, and we'll continue to work on efficiency and productivity gains to help offset some of the pressure. You can find the investor update we discussed that we filed this morning detailing our forward-looking guidance just discussed, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, in the Investor Relations section of our website. And as I mentioned, later today we'll file our second quarter Form 10-Q. With that, I'll turn the call back to Larry. ", "Larry Kellner", "Thank you, Jeff and Jeff. We're pleased with the results of this quarter but remain focused on the road ahead. There will always be challenges but I have confidence that my co-workers will make the best of every situation. We have the right people, the right product, the right fleet and the right facilities to meet the challenges ahead as we work together to continue to deliver the high quality products our customers expect. Once again I want to say thank you to my co-workers for the contributions they make to the business everyday. Together we look forward to delivering more good results in the future. With that, I'll turn the call back over to DeAnne to begin our Q&A. ", " DeAnne Gabel", "Thank you, gentlemen. With that, we'll begin the question-and-answer session for the analysts, followed by the Q&A for the media. Tatiana, if you could please review the Q&A process, we'll be ready to begin. ", "Questions-and-Answers Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question come from William Greene from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Yeah. Hi. With regard to the growth rate cut in capacity for next year, how much flexibility do you have to move it down and the five other aircraft that you might sell, is that already included in this or might that be additional? ", "Larry Kellner", "This is Larry. We have estimated, yeah, that those five aircraft are out in our fleet plan to the 3% to 4% expected growth rate assumes that the 15 737-500s exit between the end of this year and through almost to next year. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "And do you have flexibility to drive it lower if you needed to or is that of all we can do at this point? ", "Larry Kellner", "No. We've cranked since 9/11 the utilization of the fleet quite a bit. And clearly our plans based on a pretty strong utilization of the fleet that we have. We always have some flexibility if the market conditions change to take that utilization down. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And how should we think about the balance sheet impact of those sales? Or is it going to affect the cash balances very significantly? ", "Larry Kellner", "We believe that it will be slight positive cash. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. But they're mostly all leveraged so there is no doubt. ", "Larry Kellner", "There is data on all the aircraft. We believe it will be a slight positive. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just lastly were there any one-time items here in the quarter related to weather or the northwest issues or what not that you can talk about or add color on that might have affected either RASM or some of the expense categories? ", "Larry Kellner", "It\u2019s hard to tell. June came out a little better than I thought it would at the beginning of the month and as far to tell how much of that Dallas had a tremendous amount of weather. But as we are having this call we\u2019ve got the rain beating against the window here in Houston. We\u2019ve had our share of weather here in Huston. Also it\u2019s hard to net it out and say put a number on it. But clearly June performed pretty well for us. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So we'll just sort of have to go with that it would \u2013 ", "Larry Kellner", "Yeah. It\u2019s just part of our\u2026 ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Is it a material or you can't net it out? ", "Larry Kellner", "Yeah. Within the net of our weather negatives were offset by anything we picked up from anybody else's weather or operational problems or it was just a stronger market. In my sense looking at July it was just a little stronger market. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks for your help. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Goldman-Sachs. Please go ahead. ", "Robert Barry - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, guys, good morning. ", "Larry Kellner", "Good morning. ", "Robert Barry - Goldman Sachs", "I wanted to follow-up on the growth question and I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on your logic for doing it, and to what extent it has to do with your a stance in the past about not feeding any market share to certain competitors? ", "Larry Kellner", "It doesn't tie our market share comments. We have no change in our willingness to see market share, for instance, in the New York market. What it does tie to is the fact that there is a good market on a global basis for small narrow bodies 737-500, once regional jets came in had been our toughest fleet type and so we had the opportunity to reduce that fleet by the 15 we own. We started looking into marketplace for a chance to do that. And this just reflects both that fleet type and where the market is for fleet and the chance that we could do that. ", "We've got 64 new 737s on order new-gens from Boeing and so clearly this is a case where as you look at over the next three years we clearly have a number of aircraft coming from Boeing and we had some flexibility. We also plan to retire 300s. The reason we have got the 500s in the longer fleet plan is because the other 48 500s on lease from 2012 to 2015. And so we know that\u2019s the fleet type will be operating on a long-term basis. ", "But we are gradually moving out of the classics to the more fuel efficient new-gens and this is just a chance to take advantage of market opportunities. ", "Robert Barry - Goldman Sachs", "That is interesting. So I mean, I assume that there is also some embedded assessment of the '08 expected supply and demand dynamic in the market or is it really just about an opportunity that to sell the aircraft? ", "Larry Kellner", "Well, it is a combination of the two. Clearly if fuel was $20 a barrel and domestic market was extremely strong you wouldn't be looking at those options. So I mean if you got to look at it in total. ", "Robert Barry - Goldman Sachs", "Sure. And then\u2026 ", "Larry Kellner", "And small 737 is the least fuel efficient than the 737s we operate on a per-seat basis. ", "Robert Barry - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then just a question on the international outlook, clearly it continues to be very strong. I'm wondering what your thinking about it going forward, and if we should start to be concerned at all about tough comp. I know there is some enthusiasm about comps getting easier on the domestic front. On the fleet side, should we be getting concerned about difficult comps on the international front? ", "Jim Compton", "Robert, this is Jim. Obviously, this thing we saw strong performance across all the entities and international side and bookings going forward also are consistent with what we saw in the second quarter. So, at least this is kind as far as you can see, which is, what we kind of talk about going forward, and in the third quarter we don't see any really changes. We still see good strength in the internal across all the entities. ", "Robert Barry - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Ray Neidl from Caylon Securities, go ahead. ", "Ray Neidl - Caylon Securities", "Yeah. With the Boeing 737-500s you are not going to be taking a penalty by reducing the size of that fleet and operating only 48 are you? In other words with crew training, spare parts, they're interchangeable with the other 737 types, is that correct? ", "Larry Kellner", "Well the classics are quite a bit different than the new-gens, but we have still got 48 300s which we'll also be facing out over time. But we look at the size of our classic fleet which is still over 100, we have a lot of flexibility there, as we work that down. We'll still have a decent; we'll still have 48 of them as we get to 2012 in the classic group. So we don't think it is a big impact. ", "Ray Neidl - Caylon Securities", "Okay. Great. And then regarding the fleet on the small-end, what's the current status, it sounds like you are pretty well complete with your regional jet contracts, but I'm just wondering what the status is of ExpressJet, to your service, to your costs, are you satisfied with them? And if you are still contemplating maybe at some point using larger RJs. ", "Larry Kellner", "Well, Ray, couple of things. One, ExpressJet has always done a good for us operationally. Clearly we continue to work the cost side there. And if you look at the larger RJs our scope clause and our main line pilot contract is that 50 seats, we don't think we can make the economics work on a 70-seater flown at the main line. And so we don't have any plans in the 70-seat jet area at the moment. ", "Ray Neidl - Caylon Securities", "Okay. Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ", "Mike Linenberg - Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Good morning all. I got two questions, my first one related to follow-up Ray with ExpressJet. Can you give us a timing on the outcome of this binding arbitration? When do we expect to hear something, some part A to that? And part B would be how the transition has gone with Chautauqua, how you view that relationship, how that is looking. And then I have a follow-up. ", "Larry Kellner", "Sure, Mike. On ExpressJet, I think our best guess is that you'll hear about the end of the month to early in August on that arbitration. And with Chautauqua, the June performance, they had a controllable completion factor in June, so that excludes the weather and ATC if you start other completion factor but if you look at what they can control maintenance (inaudible), and 99-3. So clearly we\u2019ve got into the transition with stock where they're doing a very good job for us. We're pleased with how that is working. ", " Mike Linenberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Good. And then just my second question I'm sure, you perused the joint application for antitrust immunity between northwest, delta, KLM and air France, basically it looks like they want to operate as one across the north Atlantic. Do you, given sort of your role in sky team? Do you view that as a threat? ", "Larry Kellner", "I think we look at it competitively the right thing for us with our hub at Newark Liberty is to keep growing that hub. We have clearly got 787 coming in and which is going to make a big transition for us internationally. Our sky team is very important to us as it gives us a lot of reach we wouldn't otherwise have. Right now, we think we're headed in the right direction on the international front. ", " Mike Linenberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Very good and nice quarter. ", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ", "Dan McKenzie - Credit Suisse", "Hi. Good morning. Two questions here. You touched on fleet flexibility for 2008, but fuel at $75 and we haven't even had a hurricane yet. I am just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the risk of fuel going significantly higher. We have some prognostic occasions with fuel it could even go north of 90, how are you thinking about that risk and how could you respond there I guess how quickly could you respond? ", "Larry Kellner", "First of all, fuel is already above 90 because when we're buying jet fuel, not crude. We've approached fuel several ways. One, obviously, our investment in our modern and fuel-efficient fleet is incredibly important. We have got the most fuel efficient fleet among the majors and we continue to invest in new aircraft and obviously all the ancillary operations that we do, our operational methods we do to minimize our fuel burn. ", "We also hedge the fuel component of tickets we\u2019ve already sold and we rely on the market, frankly to price fuel correctly in the future. We can quibble as to whether the market is doing a good job pricing of fuel right now, and I don't think we've done as good job as in industry this year as we did last year, but what we're relying, frankly, on, you know, carry that (inaudible) rationing as fuel prices increase. ", "We\u2019ve done I think a superb job having a fuel-efficient fleet and continuing to renew that fleet, and our employees are also doing a great job in the operations everyday to conserve fuel. And so I think we're in a quite a good position compared to our competitors, but nobody likes really, really high fuel prices, but it is something we learned to live with. ", "Dan McKenzie - Credit Suisse", "Yes. Sure. And just for clarification, I was talking WTI north of 90, not necessarily jet fuel. ", "Larry Kellner", "You tell what the (inaudible) fuel prices, but the fact is where it -- fuel is higher than we could of imagine it being a year or two ago and yet we turned in the largest second quarter profit that we had since the year 2000, so I think we're handling it pretty well, frankly. ", "Dan McKenzie - Credit Suisse", "Sure. Second question, you know, relates to the FAA reauthorization bill. I'm just wondering, what you're seeing there and, how far away are we from some improved air traffic control efficiency and what are you guys working on and how would you sort of quantify potential savings from many efficiency improvements and of course the timing of those? ", "Larry Kellner", "Sure. Dan, this is Larry. The professional air traffic controllers of the FAA are doing the best they can with the tools they got and we need to get them new tools and that's going to take several years, not several months. And we have to figure out how to pay for those tools. And I think step one is figuring out how to pay for those tools and inside what those tools are going to be so, we can get on with the process of getting the controllers and the tools they need. ", "I think the challenge we got is we can't continue to have a commercial airlines and the passengers paying for over 90% of the system and using about two-thirds of it. And as private jet aviation and distinguish private jet. There is a lot of confusion out there. Piston-powered aviation isn\u2019t using the air traffic control system. This isn't about prop and piston flying. ", "This is about jet flying. But very light jets that are coming out like a (inaudible) aviation we got have a further impact on the air traffic control system and we've got to figure out a process for how we're going to pay for these new tools and we need to make sure the people who are paying for the tools get first priority on the system. ", "So, I think we have a lot of work to do. I think congress is making progress, but we need not to put this off for another year or two because even after we decide how we are going to do it, we have then got to figure out what tools we're going to use and then get into the implementation. So we're years from getting a better fix to a system that it\u2019s already add its capacity. And, again, I think the controllers are doing the best they can with the tools they got. But we need to move forward. Hard to estimate cost savings but they will be significant and we just need to see exactly how the system works out how rolls it. ", "Dan McKenzie - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Boroch from Bear Stearns. Please go ahead. ", "Frank Boroch - Bear Stearns", "Hi. Good morning. My first question is, I wanted to see if you could talk about how the trends can performed in the second quarter and your outlook for the current period. ", "Jim Compton", "Yes, frank, this is Jim. Transcon perform within the domestic continued to be strong for us implemented horizon point of view and load factor point of view. And you know one of the stronger domestic entities for us. ", "Frank Boroch - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. I look historically, it seems as though it Continental moving into the third quarter relative to the second quarter, unit revenue tends to increase about half of a percentage point. Is there anything -- this year that suggested that that -- maybe is different with capacity changes or last year we had the security scare and what not that somehow this year might be different than the historical sequential average of RASM up about half point over the second quarter. ", "Jim Compton", "I'm not going to comment on the seasonality of it. I just refer to our comments and the investor updates overall versus that trying to speculate on the seasonality. But you have that seasonality, and I kind of go with that. ", "Frank Boroch - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Bill Mastoris from Bank of New York. Please go ahead. ", "Bill Mastoris - Bank of New York", "Thank you. With regard to the 10-737-500s are any of those in your double ETCs and if they are, and if any of the other five potential sales are in the double ETCs, would it be correct in saying that you will continue to be the obligor and on even all the potential sales of those 737-500s. ", " Gerry Laderman", "This is Gerry, if you look at the whole group of 15, some of those are in some of those double ETCs that I am sure you're familiar with and to the extent that we sell aircraft any of the aircraft that currently have debt on them, we would pay off the debt before we sell the aircraft. ", "Bill Mastoris - Bank of New York", "Okay. And okay. That's pretty much what I would expect. I didn't know whether you were going to continue to be the obligor, but obviously you answered that. But my second question this has to do with the applications or start-up I should say of Virgin America. ", "You were one of the major objectors on to their application and normally you wouldn't do that unless you would consider them at least a potential future threat. Maybe you could comment on what type of impact you might think they would have on Transcon yields going forward. ", "Larry Kellner", "Yes, Bill, this is Larry. Once they amended their application we didn't oppose it. We had only opposed before an ownership elements and that was not -- I mean, whether its sky bus or if you look at last couple years jet blue or several other airlines that have started, we know there will be new entrants into the market and that has been a continual thing since 1978. ", "So I would just clarify what we opposed in the Virgin America application was for ownership aspects and the structure, and not. Truly from competitive standpoint truly they are going to compete with us just like every other start-up in the U.S. does. I saw this morning where they announced the routes, clearly they are going to put a significant amount of capacity in the Transcon. ", "If you look at the number of planes they have and where they're going, primarily San Francisco and L.A. to JFK and Dulles and they're also going to do some north south flying on the west coast between San Francisco and L.A and San Francisco and Vegas that won\u2019t have impact on us all the capacity in the Transcon which has some impact on us though it\u2019s a big market and they are not flying the exact cities pairs we\u2019re flying that they're going to JFK and not to Newark. ", "Bill Mastoris - Bank of New York", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Chase from Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. ", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Good morning, guys. Just a couple quick questions for Jim. Obviously, I think through some of the comments you\u2019ve made on the call, you know, obviously noting continued softness in the domestic environment, but I'm just curious, we shouldn't take any other comments you made to mean I think you are getting incrementally worse. ", "Can we say that the things are getting incrementally a bit better? We do have capacity reduction as we move into the second half and as you said things did look pretty good in June. So is there some inflection point that we should be thinking about as we move into the second half? ", "Jim Compton", "Gerry it is Jim. You know, my ability to see far out is always obviously difficult in this business and so forth so that as Larry mentioned we are pleased with our June revenue performance and have seen some of that continuing in July so forth. So some of what I talked about kind of, where are we at an inflection point? But we\u2019re clearly able to kind of \u2013 do better in the summer high demand periods and so forth. And so, we've been able to do some things Jeff mentioned in his comments, a $7 fuel surcharge each way in the domestic business. That is a result of studying the high demand relative capacity and so forth. And obviously those things begin to change in the fall. So, what we see is a continued weak pricing environment in the domestic. A number of sales, even during the summer period, that, again with -- at a micro basis some we match, some we don't. And as you get out to the fall you don't have that offset of the high demand period and constraint capacity during the summer as you head into the fall. ", "Gary Chase - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And I guess, as I remember, the latter part of last year, I mean, I think, at least by memory, people were affected by the liquid ban and terror alert in the international markets, so I mean is that wrong perception that you kind of went through that internationally without any difficulty in contrasted domestic? Because I would be thinking that the international comps get a little bit easier as you move into the second half as well. ", "Larry Kellner", "I think clearly for us, seems like you always have to be a historian in this business. In the Tel Aviv market where year-over-year some of the things that were happening in Tel Aviv last year and then as you mentioned in August with the London situation, so clearly there was some fall-off in traffic in associated revenue in that, that will have year-over-year based on kind of the way we see bookings right now that is positive.

(Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the conference over to Ned Walker, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications, and DeAnne Gabel, Director of Investor Relations. ", "", "Ned Walker", "Joining us here in Houston today, we have Larry Kellner, Continental\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Smisek, our President and member of the Board of Directors; Jeff Misner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Compton, our Executive Vice President of Marketing; Mark Moran, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Gerry Laderman, our Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. ", "We\u2019ll open it up with some overview comments from Larry. Jeff Smisek will follow that with a review of capacity and revenue, and then Jeff Misner will look at our cost structure and balance sheet. ", "The timeframe that we\u2019ve allocated for today is about 20 minutes for executive comments, followed with a 25-minute window for analysts\u2019 comments, and then about 15 minutes for questions from the media. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to DeAnne.", "DeAnne Gabel", "", "Earlier today we issued an update for investors with any information relating to our financial and operational outlook for the second quarter, full year 2008, and other information. This investor update was included in a filing with the SEC and can be found on our website under the Investor Relation section. ", " ", "As a reminder, today we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures such as net loss excluding special items. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be located on Continental\u2019s website at continental.com under the Investor Relation section. ", "Our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements that are not limited to historical facts but reflect the company\u2019s current beliefs, expectations, or intentions regarding future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For examples of such risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors set forth in the company\u2019s 2007 10-K and its other security filings. ", "With that, here\u2019s Larry.", "", "Larry Kellner", "", "I\u2019d like to start off by saying thanks to each of my over 45,000 coworkers. There have been many distractions in the marketplace, including record-setting fuel prices, speculation about industry consolidation, and general concerns about the economy. My coworkers have done a great job in not letting these concerns distract them from what they do better than anyone else in the business, delivering clean, safe, and reliable air transportation along with award winning customer service. ", "With that, let me recap our first quarter results. For the first quarter 2008, Continental reported a net loss of $85 million or a loss of $0.86 per diluted share, excluding a $5 million after-tax gain from the sale of aircraft. Including this gain, we reported a net loss of $80 million or a loss of $0.81 per diluted share for the quarter. ", "On the operational side, our team once again did a great job getting our customers to their destination by delivering a system-wide mainline segment completion factor of 98.9% for the quarter, and my coworkers continue to be recognized for their excellence. ", "For the fifth consecutive year, Continental was rated the top airline on FORTUNE\u2019s Annual Airline Industry List of World\u2019s Most Admired Companies. We also ranked Number 41 on FORTUNE\u2019s World Most Admired Companies \u201cTop 50\u201d list which ranks companies in a wide variety of industries. Continental was the only U.S. passenger carrier on the \u201cTop 50\u201d list. ", "On the product side, we\u2019re continuing our efforts to deliver an even better product. During the quarter, we announced an agreement with LiveTV to offer live in-flight satellite-based television throughout the cabin on our next generation 737 fleet and on our 757-300s. We expect to begin to offer this service on domestic flights beginning in January 2009. We also expect to begin to offer Wi-Fi email and texting capabilities on those aircraft through LiveTV.", "Looking forward, given the challenges we face during the quarter, my coworkers delivered solid first quarter results. Our international network continues to perform well, but our domestic network continues to face the challenges of excess industry capacity and ticket prices that have not kept pace with the rising price of fuel. Unfortunately, it looks like jet fuel prices may remain at record-high levels for the foreseeable future. ", "In addition, we are faced with a weakening economy and therefore think that it\u2019s prudent for us to reduce our domestic capacity from previously planned levels beginning this fall. We currently expect that our domestic mainline capacity will decline 5% on an annual run rate basis beginning this fall. ", "We\u2019re now planning to remove from service an additional 14 older less fuel efficient 737-300 aircraft as leases expire on those aircraft from September 2008 to April 2009. These 14 737-300s are in addition to the 34 737-300 and -500s that we were already planning to remove from service in 2008 and 2009. These aircraft will be replaced with more fuel efficient 737 next generation aircraft. We\u2019re taking deliver of 32 new 737s in 2008 and an additional 18 737s in 2009. We\u2019re also taking delivery of two 777s in 2009. ", "We also expect to reduce our regional capacity growth rate beginning this fall, although our plans there are fluid as we try to work out better economics for our regional capacity and as the CRJs flown for us by Chautauqua come off lease. ", "Before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to comment on what the recently announced Delta/Northwest merger may mean for Continental. The proposed Delta/Northwest will change the competitive landscape for Continental and the entire airline industry. As I\u2019ve consistently said, our preference has been to remain independent as long as the competitive landscape didn\u2019t change; however, the landscape is changing. ", "We\u2019re reviewing our strategic alternatives and we\u2019ll do what we need to do to continue our success and to remain a strong long-term competitor. We are committed to doing what is best for our coworkers, stockholders, customers, and the communities we serve. ", "As a result of Delta/Northwest having signed a merger agreement, we have redeemed the Golden Share that Northwest held. In light of the Delta/Northwest announcement, we\u2019re also reviewing our continued participation in our alliance with Northwest, Delta, and SkyTeam. We are committed to being an important player in one of the three global alliances so that we can offer a broad global network to our customers.", "Despite the speculation about our future cost by this demand, as we evaluate what course of action would be in the best interest of Continental and all its stakeholders, we will not take our off what is the most important thing \u2013 running a clean, safe, and reliable airline that delivers excellent customer service and a quality product to our customers. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff Smisek and Jeff Misner to discuss the quarter\u2019s revenue and top performance details.", "Jeffery Smisek ", "I join Larry in thanking the entire team for delivering better than I would have expected results considering that in the first quarter Gulf Coast jet fuel prices averaged over $118 a barrel, economic concerns continue to grow, the U.S. credit market had a meltdown, and the U.S. dollar continued to weaken. Not only did we have strong consolidated yield increases, up 7.2% year-over-year, we ran a consolidated load factor of 78.5%, down just slightly year-over-year on a capacity increase of 4.1%. Our consolidated RASM was up 7%. ", "In the first quarter, we grew total revenue by $391 million to a total of a $3.6 billion. That was a 12.3% growth rate. So we had solid revenue results. Unfortunately, our cost grew more than our revenues led of course by the rapid rise in fuel prices. On the good news side, demand in general continued to hold up well; however, we are beginning to see some softness in the Trans-Atlantic sector, which we believe is mainly attributable to the weak dollar. However, things are still good there, just not as good as we\u2019d expected. ", "In March, we began lapping some fairly strong business first yield increases from the prior year. But thanks to nice year-over-year improvement in leisure yields during the quarter, Trans-Atlantic yields were up 6.6% in the first quarter. However, we are seeing some pressure on our year-over-year Trans-Atlantic RASM going into the second quarter. ", "During the quarter, we saw some increased competition on our Trans-Pacific routes as both Copa and JAL added several new frequencies, which had a negative impact on Trans-Pacific load factors. But overall Pacific RASM, which includes both our Continental Micronesia Pacific routes and our Trans-Pacific routes was up 8.8% year-over-year due to increased yields which were up 12.4%. ", "Our Latin region continues to do and mainline Latin RASM was up 6.7% due to both increased yields and higher load factors. The Latin region is seeing some increased competition from low cost carriers which may increase pressure on RASM going forward.", "We also continue to see domestic mainline yield increases along with a slight improvement load factor which resulted in a year-over-year RASM improvement of 8.3%. We\u2019ve had better success with fuel surcharges offshore than we have had onshore, and our domestic business continues to lose money. There\u2019ve been numerous attempts to increase domestic fares in recent months; however, the majority of these attempts have failed in low cost carrier markets. We estimate that about 85% of our mainline domestic revenue is exposed to low cost carrier competition, so domestic price increases that stick only in non low cost carrier type fares don\u2019t really do much for us. ", "We also saw strength in regional yields during the first quarter with about a half point increase in load factor, resulting in an RASM increase of 9.8% compared to the first quarter of last year. ", "Looking ahead to the second quarter, there are some small pockets of demand weakness in certain time periods in a few markets over the next couple months; but overall, we\u2019re comfortable with the demand outlook. Consolidated domestic book seat factor for the next 6 weeks is running about a point ahead of last year. ", "Latin bookings are running 4 to 5 points ahead of last year. Trans-Atlantic bookings are running 1 to 2 points behind last year and Pacific bookings are running 3 to 4 points behind last year. But in the Pacific, we\u2019re comfortable with the load factor versus yield tradeoff we\u2019ve been receiving. Net/net for the second quarter, we expect both our consolidated and mainline load factors to be down about a point year-over-year. ", "We currently expect demand will remain solid throughout the summer. But unless the economic indicators improve dramatically, we think things are likely to get pretty tough after we get passed the peak summer travel season. Therefore, as Larry discussed, we\u2019re reducing our domestic capacity more than we\u2019d earlier estimated starting in the fall. ", "For the second quarter, we expect mainline capacity to be up 1.5% compared to with the second quarter of 2007 with mainline domestic capacity down 3.4% and international capacity up 6.9%. Our second quarter international growth is mainly driven by the run-rate of new markets we started last year and our Heathrow expansion this year. We expect regional capacity will be up 8.7%. ", "For full year 2008, we expect our total mainline capacity, including international, will be up about 2% year-over-year. As Larry mentioned, we currently expect that our domestic mainline capacity will decline 5% on an annual run-rate basis with our additional capacity reduction beginning this fall. For 2009, we expect our total mainline capacity, including international capacity, will be about flat year-over-year. ", "We had good news at the end of the quarter as we were able to enter London Heathrow for the first time. At the end of March, we launched our largest single date international expansion in the company\u2019s history when we inaugurated twice-daily wide-body service from both our Houston and Liberty hubs to Heathrow. ", "We\u2019re pleased to finally be able to offer our important corporate customers the opportunity to fly up to Heathrow, which is their airport of choice in London, and we look forward to the opportunities this presents. We\u2019re pleased with our progress to date. ", "During the quarter, we added 6 new modern Q400 turbo props to our regional fleet and plan to end the year with 15 Q400s in service. As with any new aircraft type, we\u2019ve been having some teething pains at the start. But we\u2019re solving the issues, and we think the aircraft will do a terrific job for us and our customers. ", "The economics of the Q400 versus the regional jet are much more favorable, so we\u2019re pleased to add this to our service option. Plus, given the added bonus of the Q400s performance capability, we\u2019re working closely with the Newark tower to maximize the use of the 1129 cross runway which should help our overall operation in Newark. ", "Speaking of operational improvement, the DOT has issued a tentative order capping operations in Liberty during peak hours to 83 operations per hour. The caps are scheduled to be effective as of June 1. We\u2019ll be able to grow our capacity at Liberty over time by increasing the size of the aircraft that we operate there. We hope that these caps will benefit our operations at our Liberty hub. ", "In closing, I want to again thank my coworkers for their great job they do every day. We wouldn\u2019t be earning the business we get without our great coworkers. Our competitors, like us, face the challenges of record-high fuel prices, increased competition, a weak dollar, and a weakening economic environment. ", "However, we have several advantages, not the least of which is that we have the best team in the business to help us keep our eye on what\u2019s really important, providing clean, safe, and reliable air transportation every day and returning to sustained profitability. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff Misner.", "Jeff Misner", "", "As Jeff mentioned, revenue growth was strong; unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t strong enough to cover the rising cost of fuel. Skyrocketing fuel prices continue to consumer the progress we\u2019ve made over the last few years in controlling our costs. Even still, I want to thank our entire team for their continued efforts to reduce costs and increase efficiency throughout the business. It\u2019s those efforts that are keeping us in the game. ", "As DeAnne mentioned, we filed our investor update this morning, which has our second quarter 2008 guidance. Since the guidance is posted on our website, I won\u2019t take the time to repeat it in my comments. ", "As mentioned, we\u2019re operating in very difficult times. In addition, to reducing our mainline domestic capacity beginning this fall, we\u2019re implementing another initiative that is expected to deliver approximately $200 million in annual benefits when fully implemented. This includes both cost savings as well as revenue generating initiatives. The following cost guidance reflects what we expect to achieve from the initiative in 2008, as well as the impact from the announced mainline domestic capacity reductions.", "For the second quarter 2008, we expect our consolidated CASM, excluding special items, and holding fuel rate constant to be down about 3% year-over-year. Our mainline CASM, again, holding fuel rate constant and excluding special items, to be down 3.5% year-over-year. ", "For the full year 2008, excluding special items and holding fuel rate constant, we now expect consolidated CASM to be down about a 0.5% to 1%, and mainline CASM will be down 1% to 1.5%. At this point, we have not included in our guidance any cost savings related to our regional operations, but we\u2019re actively looking for ways to achieve better economics with ExpressJet, the cost of which remains significantly over market. ", "As I said at the beginning, over the last few years, we\u2019ve made remarkable progress towards reducing our cost structure, but we\u2019re not done yet. We\u2019re committed to achieving long-term sustained profitability so we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to increase productivity and decrease efficiencies across all parts of our business as well as work on we\u2019re to increase revenue. ", "On fuel, jet fuel set new highs during the quarter and currently represents a full one-third of our cost structure. Unfortunately we\u2019ve experienced new highs this month as well. For years we focused on fuel efficiency in our operations, but today\u2019s prices make it even more imperative. We continue to make improvements by continuing our winglet program and working on a variety of fuel savings initiatives. ", "In addition, we have just signed an agreement to remove eight more of our least fuel-efficient aircraft that is the 737-500, from our fleet in 2009. We continue to hedge a portion of our near-term fuel needs, the details of which you can find in the Investor Update. ", "On the fleet, as Larry said, we\u2019re now planning to remove from service a total of 48 older less fuel efficient 737-300 and -500 aircraft in 2008 and 2009, including the eight 737-500 I just mentioned, which are being sold to parties who will operate them outside the United States. We expect to end 2008 with 373 mainline aircraft in service and 369 service at the end of 2009. ", "Cash, we ended the first quarter with $2.5 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments, which excludes $237 million in core value student loan related auction rate securities that were reclassified from short-term to long-term investments during the quarter. We expect to end the second quarter 2008 with between $2.9 and $3 billion of unrestricted cash, again excluding the auction rate securities. This range does include some anticipated future financings including a loan facility to fund predelivery deposits for new aircraft, a refinancing of aircraft debt that matured earlier this year and other financing initiatives our corporate financing was focused on. We\u2019ll provide more information about these financings as they\u2019re finalized.", "In light of record high fuel prices and other challenges facing the industry, we have pulled down our cap ex plan for the year and now expect cash cap ex will be about $468 million for the year. This is slightly below the low end of our previous estimated range, and more detail on this could be found in the Investor Update.", "In concluding here, an environment a weakening economic outlook, a weak dollar, soaring fuel prices is not the backdrop we had originally planned on. But as our track record over the last decade shows we\u2019re pretty nimble and quick to respond to current conditions. When tough decisions need to be made, we won\u2019t hesitate to make them; but we will be thoughtful and thorough to ensure that our response is appropriate. ", "Finally, given all the things that are going right now in the business, we expect to file our first quarter 2008 Form 10-Q by the end of this month. ", "With that, let me turn it back to Larry.", "Larry Kellner", "", "There are many changes happening in our industry. As we look to the future, we want to emphasize our strengths. We have a great team of professional men and women who deliver award winning service to our customers, a strong well balanced network with an enviable position in New York as well as established hubs in Houston, Cleveland, and Guam. We also have a young fuel efficient fleet and a strong new aircraft order book. That said, the competitive landscape is changing and we\u2019ll do what we need to do to make sure we remain a strong long-term competitor.", "In closing, I want to again thank my more than 45,000 coworkers for the great job they do every day. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to DeAnne to begin our Q&A.", "DeAnne Gabel", "", "We are ready to begin the question-and-answer questions for the analysts followed by the question-and-answer session for the media. ", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from William Greene - Morgan Stanley. ", "William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Larry, can I ask you just to outline a little bit what options you have with the ExpressJet? I guess the best case would be they give you the economics you want, but I don\u2019t know sort of what outcomes we\u2019ve got here and what it could mean for capacity. ", "Larry Kellner", "", "Well, Bill, I think there\u2019s two things. One, we\u2019d like to improve our overall cost structure on our regional capacity. Two, we\u2019re pretty flexible about how we do that, so I don\u2019t want to get into a detailed discussion. I\u2019d like to kind of keep that for something Continental\u2019s working on. I will tell you, ExpressJet continues to do an excellent job for us operationally. It\u2019s simple a cost issue. As fuel prices go up, we feel more pressure on that front. ", "William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes, so I guess that\u2019s what I was kind of getting at. It seems to me that the flexibility in the contract that it affords you, gives you an opportunity of reduced regional flying which I would think would be a good thing in this fuel environment. Is that wrong? ", "Larry Kellner", "", "Well as I said in my remarks, we\u2019ll continue to look at regional capacity clearly at these fuel prices. We probably need a little less of it, not a little more of it. ", "William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Then when you think about the M&A side, have you had discussions with your labor groups, and what is their reaction to this?", "Larry Kellner", "", "Well, Bill, we\u2019re always pretty inclusive in our discussions. Again, I\u2019m not going to get into the details of things we\u2019re not ready to talk about yet. But just know that we\u2019re not going to change our culture here. We\u2019re going to continue to be very coworker focused and make sure that they\u2019re informed once we\u2019ve made a decision of kind of what we\u2019re doing; or as we work through processes, we\u2019ll clearly work with the appropriate (inaudible).", "William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "All right, maybe just one detailed question last. Just one the international RASM, how much of the growth came form currency and fuel surcharge?", "Jim Compton", "", "Bill, this is Jim. On the Trans-Atlantic side, we\u2019ve recorded 2.8% RASM growth, but 2.5 of those points were related to currency, and on the Pacific side about 3.5 points. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Ray Neidl - Calyon Securities. ", "Raymond Neidl \u2013 Calyon Securities Inc.", "", "Larry, overall regardless of what Continental\u2019s position is going to be in M&A or asset acquisition, what do you see this industry looking like a year from now if oil prices do stay at $115 a barrel or even go higher? Is it going to be significant smaller do you think? ", "Larry Kellner", "", "Yes, it\u2019ll be smaller.", "Raymond Neidl \u2013 Calyon Securities Inc.", "The other area, back to ExpressJet, as oil prices stay very high and you say they have a high cost structure, would you consider going to other independent contractors to supply you with some of your feed, and would you go to your unions to see if you can get usage of larger RJs?", "Larry Kellner", "", "Ray, I want to keep all the flexibility we can. So as soon as we\u2019re ready to announce something, we will. I would tell you, again, I think we\u2019re working primarily to figure out how on the planes ExpressJet flies for us we can do that more efficiently, make sure we find the best results candidly for ExpressJet and ourselves.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Jamie Baker - J.P. Morgan Chase. ", "Jamie Baker \u2013 J.P. Morgan Chase", "", "Larry, there\u2019s not been too much disclosure as it relates to your SkyTeam participation, particularly as it relates to what happens post Delta/Northwest. Are you a free agent in terms of exiting the alliance? Is there a plenty associated with that? Do you have to give advance notice if you choose to walk?", "Larry Kellner", "", "Jamie, again, I want to be helpful as I can be on this call, but all I\u2019m going to say is we\u2019re reviewing our continued participation with Northwest/Delta and SkyTeam and we think it\u2019s important that we\u2019re a major player in one of the three global alliances. ", "Jamie Baker \u2013 J.P. Morgan Chase", "But in terms of whatever strings might restrain you, is it something that\u2019s even an important consideration? You\u2019re welcome to say, \u201cHey, Jamie, it\u2019s kind of a stupid question,\u201d if that\u2019s the case. ", "Larry Kellner", "", "I just say, \u201cJamie, we have flexibility.\u201d", "Jamie Baker \u2013 J.P. Morgan Chase", "Second, I guess for Jeff and/or Gerry. Mark Streator and I were both wondering what sort of steps you might you able to take here in order to bolster liquidity in light of what could unfortunately be a fairly substantial cash burn if fuel doesn\u2019t quickly cooperate. ", "Gerald Laderman", "", "Jamie, we don\u2019t typically comment on financings until they\u2019re completed. Jeff mentioned a couple we\u2019re working on in the commercial bank market. As you know, the corporate finance team always has a list of things they look at, but we prefer not to be that specific until we actually move forward with some of them. ", "Jamie Baker \u2013 J.P. Morgan Chase", "But in the absence of a money management business and the absence of a regional subsidiary, in the absence of a Heathrow slot portfolio that you could borrow against, I mean our potential concerns misplaced in this regard or\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll just leave it that.", "Gerald Laderman", "", "Well, we\u2019ve guidance for the end of the second quarter and beyond that, as you know, we focus almost every day on cash or every day on cash. Yes, it really depends on where we see fuel, where we see revenue, where we see the capital markets, but we stay very focused on both short- and long-term cash. ", "Larry Kellner", "", "I\u2019d just add to that: if you look back, we financed this year\u2019s aircraft last spring. We are always working ahead of the cash front. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Mike Linenberg - Merrill Lynch. ", "Mike Linenberg \u2013 Merrill Lynch ", "", "In the reclassification of the auction rate securities, was there anything that ran through the P&L, or was that primarily a balance sheet move? ", "Jeff Misner", "", "It was all balance sheet, nothing in the P&L.", "Mike Linenberg \u2013 Merrill Lynch ", "Then just another question here: When I look at the delivery schedule for the 737-800s in \u201908, I think it\u2019s 18, is that a new number? Was that previously 30 or was that actually changed sometime ago and I just missed it? ", "Gerald Laderman", "", "For 2008, we still have the 30, 18 is 2009. ", "Mike Linenberg \u2013 Merrill Lynch ", "Oh that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s what I meant, 2009 I think previously I thought was 30. Was that cut back?", "Gerald Laderman", "", "Yes, we haven\u2019t talked about our 2009 delivery schedule for quite some time. It may well have been the last time we talked about it that number was out there. We did disclose over the last year or so or two years a number of adjustments to the delivery schedule, so today that number is 18. ", "Larry Kellner", "", "Mike, we\u2019re taking 50 airplanes between the two years. At one point we were taking 60; however, we\u2019re now taking 24 in 2010. So over the three year period, we\u2019ve clearly moved around (inaudible) with Boeing up to 32 in the current, for instance, but we have 74 positions over the three-year period which is actually an increase from where we were before over the total three years. But we did decrease some in 2009 and moved some of those to 2010.

For whatever reason, and I just I probably have to go back and check this, I think your bankcard processing agreement does have a financial covenant maybe related to one of the coverages. Is that something, I think in the past you\u2019ve indicated in your 10-K that you were well above that. But based on kind of where things are moving and fuel prices on current guidance, is that something that is at risk of being tripped or is that something where you\u2019re in talks with the processor and what are potential solutions? Whatever you can say on that would be helpful. ", "Jeff Misner", "", "That facility does have some covenant (inaudible) ratios and so on. Gerry may want to jump in here, but just like cash, we watch those covenants all the time. So we do have that focus. Gerry, do you want to add anything?", "Gerald Laderman", "", "It\u2019s disclosed in the 10-K. We\u2019ve got the fixed charge coverage ratio; we\u2019ve got the cash threshold. We\u2019re well above the cash threshold. On a fixed charge coverage ratio, it\u2019s something that we, it\u2019s sort of rolling 12-month measurements that we just continue to look at.", "Mike Linenberg \u2013 Merrill Lynch ", "Gerry, when you say rolling 12 months, is that something where every month it\u2019s measured, or is it every quarter, or is it sort of a one-year look back?", "Gerald Laderman", "", "It\u2019s every quarter looking back basically.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Daniel McKenzie - Credit Suisse. ", "Daniel McKenzie \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "I\u2019m wondering if you can provide some perspective on the new capacity plan. In particular, I guess what crude price assumption was embedded in the business plan when you decided on the 5% domestic cut in capacity? ", "Larry Kellner", "", "Danny, it\u2019s tough because we know, and I think history is proving its true on this, that this month\u2019s crude price doesn\u2019t necessarily have a great correlation up or down to the crude price will be in the fall. But as we looked here at a couple of months, if you look at kind of mid February to mid April, with jet fuel prices over $120 a barrel, it doesn\u2019t make sense on our older less fuel efficient 737 and 300s and 500s on the marginal routes, so many of those same routes do much better when they\u2019re on a 737-800 or -900, so part of this is simply a transition. ", "We\u2019re going to take 50 planes over the two-year period, \u201908 and \u201909, and we have 48 planes coming out. The planes we\u2019re taking are actually bigger gauged airplanes than the ones we have coming out. Clearly we can use some bigger gauged airplanes also to have more range more effectively into Latin America. ", "So I wouldn\u2019t tell you the fair environments a piece of it because it\u2019s to the extent you can recover it in fares, higher oil prices are less of a challenge. When you have a soft economy, as we do domestically, you\u2019ve got dollar pressures. So as you look at the whole picture, the less fuel efficient planes make less sense and we\u2019re accelerating getting them out; and we did that kind of the framework of $120-plus a barrel jet fuel.", "Daniel McKenzie \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I guess given the weakening economy, I\u2019m just wondering what percent of your corporate travel customers are telling you they won\u2019t be able to deliver the volumes they promise at this point?", "Jim Compton", "", "We constantly are in close talks with our corporate folks with the relationships we\u2019ve built. You mentioned back in January, we talked with some in December and basically we saw growth in international relatively flat domestic corporate travel. We polled them again recently, I would say that it actually hasn\u2019t moved that much, although slightly to the downside that they\u2019re kind of also watching the environment and a little bit softer international and both domestically, but actually better than what my expectations were. ", "Jeffery Smisek", "", "I would also add, obviously it depends upon the corporate customer, right? Sitting here in Houston with oil and gas customers, they\u2019re booming, so they\u2019re traveling all over the world living large. But if you\u2019re in the financial services business, you have obviously a different outlook on life and travel for right now.", "Daniel McKenzie \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just one last very quick question: Does the cost guidance include the additional cost from the newly updated bumping rule from the DOT, or is that impact now really material?", "Jeff Misner", "", "I think that\u2019s probably immaterial.", "Larry Kellner", "", "I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s immaterial. I would tell you, one\u2026", "Jeff Misner", "", "Well, the overall cost guidance. ", "Larry Kellner", "", "Yes, in the overall cost guidance, it\u2019s another cost that we\u2019re putting more pressure on us and it came out yesterday so it\u2019s not rolled into the guidance yet. ", "Jeffery Smisek", "", "This is Jeff. I would just add that that\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s essentially another cost burden on the industry and effectively a tax on the industry at not a particularly good time. But I understand the reason for it; I understand the need and desire to change, it just comes at an unfortunate time in our business.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Justin Fisher - Goldman Sachs. ", "Justine Fisher \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "The first question is just about the capacity cuts that are currently going on in the industry, and you mentioned that in the markets where you have competition from LCCs it\u2019s tougher to gain pricing power. ", "So more broadly, how permanent do you think the capacity cuts will be overall from mergers or from what you are doing independently if there are LCCs that have the ability to maybe add flights and try and take some share?", "Larry Kellner", "", "Let me just say that LCCs have to buy fuel too and actually have seen a lot of impact in the fuel price increases. If you look, you\u2019re seen several carriers not only go bankrupt but liquidate. You\u2019ve seen Frontier go bankrupt. Sop there\u2019s pressure on the LCCs from fuel as well. I think where we see the most pressure is where we\u2019re flying. Many of the LCCs are flying newer more fuel-efficient aircraft. ", "In fact, JetBlue\u2019s entire fleet is newer more fuel-efficient aircraft. Where we see the most pressure is where we\u2019re competing domestically with 737 classics versus a low cost competitor competing on a new more fuel efficient aircraft. We do better by far with our 737-800 fleet where we have the more efficient aircraft and so I think that\u2019s a piece of the challenge in getting price increases within the domestic market. ", "I would say that as you see older aircraft coming out, those are somewhat permanent cuts and the order books with a lack of availability of aircraft at Boeing and Airbus make it more difficult to replace that capacity in the short-term.", "Justine Fisher \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Then on the international side, what do you think for the London market in particular? I know AMR reported yesterday that they are seeing some weakness in London but strength in other cities. I think that it looks like outlook for yields on Trans-Atlantic might be tough given capacity. But can you tell us, give us a bit more granularity on the particular markets, London and then versus the others? ", "Jeffery Smisek", "", "I would say obviously we\u2019re new into Heathrow, but we\u2019re actually pretty pleased with the performance so far. I think that our travelers have wanted to be flying on Continental perhaps versus some other carriers into Heathrow, so we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the London market, and we\u2019re pretty comfortable with our performance in Heathrow to date.", "Larry Kellner", "", "Yes, our capacity there is up and we expect in some challenges simply the fact that our capacity\u2019s up over 20% there. But I think if you frame what\u2019s happening with our expectations, we feel okay about it. ", "Justine Fisher \u2013 Goldman Sachs", " The fixed charge coverage ratio, that is just in the credit card agreement or is that in your bank agreement as well? ", "Jeff Misner", "", "That\u2019s just in the credit card agreement. ", "Justine Fisher \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Then the only covenant in the bank is just a minimum cash covenant, right? ", "Gerald Laderman", "", "That\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Frank Boroch - Bear Stearns. ", "Frank Boroch \u2013 Bear Stearns", "I was wondering if you could maybe just give us a sense, what would, if you have a ballpark figure, domestic fares, how much higher would they have had to been to make money in the first quarter? ", "Jeff Misner", "", "I\u2019m not sure I have the number off the top of my head here. Jim, can you grab\u2026", "Jim Compton", "", "Yes, this is Jim, Frank. It\u2019s obviously real difficult. We\u2019re in an environment that obviously with the rapid rise in fuel, what you\u2019re always doing at the macro level is managing price versus demand at elasticity and so forth. So I think it\u2019s tough to put a number on that because I think the rise in the fuel has been so high and in my economic school analysis would say that elasticity is measured on small price changes. It\u2019s a little bit difficult when you have large price changes and so forth. ", "So I think we\u2019re going to continue to work at a macro level. We\u2019ve done a number of things in terms of fencing business versus leisure, in terms of picking actually some surcharges even where alpha feeds don\u2019t, but it\u2019s clearly done at a macro level. I think Jeff\u2019s comments earlier in his notes that obviously it\u2019s not enough at this point given kind of the rise in fuel prices.", "Larry Kellner", "", "Just to give you a framework, while it\u2019s a hard to be super precise as you look at the whole business and domestic pieces connecting international, etcetera, it\u2019s somewhere between a 5% and 10% increase in domestic fares with exactly the same traffic level would\u2019ve gotten close to breakeven if you look at the size of our domestic network. So it\u2019s not\u2026 You don\u2019t need a 20% fare increase, but on the other end, you need to get to about 10 on the domestic fare side to kind of balance what we\u2019ve seen here in the first quarter.", "Frank Boroch \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Given the run-ups since end of the first quarter in jet fuel, if we were to assume you\u2019re paying spot for the, during the peak summer months, do you think you can make money in the summer? ", "Larry Kellner", "", "Well, I don\u2019t want to comment on future earnings guidance. We try to be careful not to do that, but I\u2019m more worried about the fall is the way I\u2019d answer that question.", "Frank Boroch \u2013 Bear Stearns", "In leaving M&A aside, the DOT\u2019s preliminary approval for the SkyTeam antitrust, expanded antitrust immunity, does that threaten Continental\u2019s European franchise, and is that something Continental needs to react to?", "Larry Kellner", "", "Well we need to be an important player in a global alliance. I think two things I would emphasize there: We have flexibility and we\u2019re going to review that situation, but I don\u2019t feel at the moment we don\u2019t feel threatened. We just need to make sure we do the right thing here.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Bob McAdoo - Avondale Partners. ", "Bob McAdoo \u2013 Avondale Partners LLC", "", "Yes, just a couple quick ones: You made the comment that obviously excess domestic capacity is a problem. With everybody continuing to pull domestic down but continuing to add international, do you get the sense that we\u2019re anywhere near the point where international capacity is going to get to that point where we have to start talking about excess international capacity with what you\u2019re doing and what Delta obviously is doing a bunch of it? Are we anywhere near that point?", "Larry Kellner", "", "Well clearly as others add capacity and we add capacity, you get closer to that point. There\u2019s a limit on all fronts. But by the same token, the international business is working at these fuel prices; the domestic business isn\u2019t working at this fuel prices. In the international arena, it\u2019s not just the U.S. carriers, it\u2019s also what impact the dollar has on travel demand, what impact the economy has, and what our foreign competitors do. ", "Clearly this business is getting more global; and so internally when we look internationally, we don\u2019t look just at our competitors here in the U.S. - a Delta or a Northwest or a United or an American, we also look at what the international guys \u2013 the Lufthansa, the BA, the Air France-KLMs are doing. So I think it\u2019s a broader question. But if you look at today, the international business is working much better at these fuel prices than the domestic is working, which is why I think you see the adjustments on the domestic side. ", "Jeffery Smisek", "", "The only thing I would add to that is obviously foreign point of sale works in our favor with the weak dollar, so that\u2019s a benefit that you don\u2019t have within the domestic business.", "Bob McAdoo \u2013 Avondale Partners LLC", "How much of your business, your Trans-Atlantic or Trans-Pacific business or whatever, in general do you get from overseas?", "Larry Kellner", "", "About 30%.", "Bob McAdoo \u2013 Avondale Partners LLC", "About 30%. So you feel comfortable that we\u2019re not anywhere near being to the point where we\u2019re up against a second wall. Where we get the same kind of wall internationally, we do domestic; it\u2019s still kind of working.", "Larry Kellner", "", "Well, I think the constraint you\u2019ve got is just aircraft availability. People have been growing internationally in most cases by cycling airplanes out of their fleet that they were using domestically to move them internationally and so you contracted a limit on that. ", "Clearly while we\u2019re not happy with the 787 delay or what we\u2019ve you seen, we\u2019re not effected by the 380 delays, but both those delays have slowed down the availability of international wide-bodies which put some further constraints on long-term international growth, which probably makes you feel more confident about that arena is simply looking at what assets are available over the long-term.", "Bob McAdoo \u2013 Avondale Partners LLC", "Just a quickie on the Q400, what kind of customer reactions are you getting from that? Are they taking that okay? I know obviously from Portland to Seattle, people use it all the time. I just wonder how they\u2019re doing it out of Newark. Are they doing it okay ? Are they feeling comfortable with the airplane in terms of customers?", "Larry Kellner", "", "Well, I think it\u2019s always safe to say that if you\u2019re on a prop, people want to be on RJ. If you\u2019re on RJ or Q400, people want to be on 737. If you\u2019re on a 737, they want to be on a 75. If you\u2019re on a 75, they want to be on a 777. So we\u2019re realistic from the customer side that every market, the larger the airplane in many cases, the better the service we can provide and the product we can provide. But I think overall we\u2019re happy with Q400. ", "We\u2019ve had some teething pain, more from an operational side as we bring in a new fleet-type. It\u2019s got good noise canceling software on it which makes it perform better than what you think of the typical prop. But it works best in short range destination and it\u2019s had some operational benefits to it in the way we use 11/29, one of the runways in Newark.", "Bob McAdoo \u2013 Avondale Partners LLC", "With the 11/29 runway issue, can you sneak in there without having your flights be counted as part of the overall lid come summer or does that going to still count as part of the lid in terms of departures?", "Larry Kellner", "", "It still counts as part of the lid. I wouldn\u2019t say we sneak in, we just the advantages of air traffic control. Clearly because the plane flies at lower attitudes, that makes the ride in many cases a little bumpier, which is not good from a customer side. But it also makes the ATC management a lot easier. ", "Bob McAdoo \u2013 Avondale Partners LLC", "So the delays aren\u2019t as much, but you can\u2019t really add any new flights beyond what you had before.", "Larry Kellner", "", "No, they\u2019re part of the cap.", "Operator", "", "The final question comes from Bill Mastoris - Broadpoint Capital. ", "Bill Mastoris \u2013 Broadpoint Capital", "", "The 14 737-300s that you plan to go ahead and remove, and this is a question obviously for Gerry, Gerry, are those coming out of let\u2019s say one-off deals; or they coming out of EETCs; and if so, are they are concentrated in one or two? I suspect probably some of the older ones would be affected.", "Gerald Laderman", "", "The 14 737-300s that we talked about, those are all older aircraft that were financed before the EETC vista, so there all kind of one-off leads.", "Larry Kellner", "", "They\u2019re normal leads expirations; we\u2019re just not going to extend the leases further on those planes.", "Bill Mastoris \u2013 Broadpoint Capital", "Then maybe you can give us an update on finance deliveries. I know that you have really quite a few financed in \u201908, but maybe if you could just kind of recap that for \u201908 and \u201909 that would be greatly appreciated. ", "Gerald Laderman", "", "Sure. The EETC we did last year covered 30 aircraft and we have the flexibility of using that money for 30 of the 35 aircraft that deliver through \u201908 and the first quarter of \u201909. We\u2019ve also been working among the financing, such as Jeff mentioned, bank financing for a couple of new deliveries as well in that same timeframe. ", "So it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re comfortable that all of our aircraft this year we believe are financed, and we\u2019re beginning to look at next year\u2019s aircraft. ", "Bill Mastoris \u2013 Broadpoint Capital", "Gerry, are those going to be all owned or leased or is there a breakout that you\u2019re comfortable giving us color on?", "Gerald Laderman", "", "Well, the EETC aircraft will all be owned and so far the incremental aircraft we\u2019ve been looking at financing are also going to be owned.", "Ned Walker", "", "That concludes the analyst portion of the call and Christine, if you could go ahead and review the process for the media to ask the Q&A session here. Also like to ask everyone if they could have one question with a quick follow-up, we\u2019ll hopefully accommodate most of the media. ", "Operator", "", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session for the media. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. ", "Mary Schlangenstein \u2013 Bloomberg News ", "", "I wanted to ask if you can be any more specific on the additional cost cutting and revenue-generating initiatives that you mention that will result in $200 million in annual benefits. Can you talk a little bit about what that might include and when you first expect to start seeing some benefits?", "Jeff Misner", "", "It\u2019s a combination of revenue things as well as some cost cutting ideas as well. On the revenue front, some of the things that we\u2019ve actually just recently announced, (inaudible) fee, would be one of those types of idea. There\u2019s some ideas where we\u2019re going to do a little bit of capacity fencing, for lack of a better term, that is kind of control capacity and allocate a little bit differently that we think will generate some incremental revenue as well. Then there\u2019s other kinds of fees and things as well, some of which are in existence that might just get adjusted and so on. ", "On the expense side, it\u2019s relatively a long list and many, many items on that list are less than a million dollars. But some of the items, you look at the marketing and advertising and promo budgets and things and pear some of that back, somebody has ideas that we have some kitchens so we\u2019ll look at down streaming meals as opposed to deal with outside catering in some of the other locations, just a whole host of very small things at that nature. As you can imagine, over the last several years, we pretty well clipped off the really big exciting items and so we\u2019re really kind of at that level of (inaudible) at this point.", "Larry Kellner", "", "But, Mary, we\u2019ve been pleased. We\u2019ve gotten just a tremendous amount of creativity from our employees on little things we\u2019re doing that we can do a little smarter. Clearly as fuels continue to go up and they work hard to be efficient, there\u2019s an awful lot of creativity out there. So while there aren\u2019t a lot of things on the cost side that really jump out and you say, \u201cWow, that\u2019s a big number and the rewarding part of that, as Jeff mentioned, is that would\u2019ve hoped we\u2019ve gotten that earlier. There are a lot of smart things that while they\u2019re smaller, and it\u2019s really a huge team effort with everybody working together to make sure that we deliver a quality product to our customer and at the same time be just as efficient as we can. We\u2019re looking at everything we throw away. We\u2019re watching everything we do to say, \u201cHow can we be as smart as possible?\u201d ", "Jeffery Smisek", "", "Just to add that, we\u2019re very focused on making sure that we maintain the integrity of our product. You\u2019re not going to see us get rid of meals at meal time, things like that that are competitors have done. We\u2019re very focused on making sure we\u2019re going to continue to deliver our customers a great product that they\u2019re used to getting from Continental.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Richard Newman from The Record. ", "Richard Newman \u2013 The Record ", "", "I wanted to ask you about at Newark, if you could share anything about which finance, which business sectors, what they\u2019re saying about their travel demands going forward, particularly financial and pharmaceutical companies in the New Jersey/New York City area?", "Jim Compton", "", "As we kind of talk to our corporate travel partners that we work with, we talk to them on a continuing basis, I think we\u2019re seeing some of\u2026 As I mentioned earlier, as we continually poll them on the trend, we\u2019re seeing some concern with the economy, although less than what we would\u2019ve expected. As Jeff mentioned in his comments, I think the financial service markets we\u2019re watching very closely and seeing some softness there. But really overall, we\u2019re seeing people kind of saying about what they\u2019ve said in December to slightly lower.", "Richard Newman \u2013 The Record ", "About what they said in December or slightly lower as far as demand goes?", "Jim Compton ", "", "Yes, focused on kind of a financial service companies.", "Richard Newman \u2013 The Record ", "One other thing, it was mentioned that Continental may benefit from the flight caps in Newark. How are you going to benefit from the flight caps in Newark?", "Jeffery Smisek", "", "This is Jeff. I was talking about the operational benefits. Newark has traditionally been a very delayed airport because of the air space and the very crowded space and the operational caps limiting the number of flight operations in Newark should result in fewer delays, which will be a great benefit to our customers and candidly a benefit to us as well because delays inconvenience passengers and candidly delays cost us money as well. ", "It\u2019s nothing that we do want to be delays. We want to run an on-time airline. We want to make sure that passengers arrive. We want to make sure passengers connect to their connecting opportunity flights, so it\u2019s something we hope will be really beneficial for us in Newark. ", "Larry Kellner", "", "I would add to that, tough, that from the operational side, which I fully agree with and we worked with FAA on that, it was painful because we had to eliminate as we looked at summer several scheduled flights out of the schedule because of the caps. So there\u2019s always that balance between satisfying demand and kind of keeping the operational integrity. ", "But clearly if you look at last summer\u2019s experience, I commend the people of the FAA for the work they did on it and the Department of Transportation to try to find a solution to a very difficult issue with regard to what happened to capacity last summer. But I wouldn\u2019t underestimate that it was painful for us in the sense that we had to remove flights from the schedule that we had submitted in the original schedule for next summer, especially in certain peak hours so that we could fit within the caps.", "Richard Newman \u2013 The Record ", "Can you mention which flights?", "Larry Kellner", "", "Again, what we tried to do is take flights\u2026 There\u2019s always better times a days that other times a day to run flights and so you hate having to move a flight that you wanted to run at 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., but the caps force you to do that. ", "Operator", "", "The final question from the media comes from Bill Hensel from the Houston Chronicle.", "Bill Hensel \u2013 Houston Chronicle ", "I wanted to ask a couple things. One is: You\u2019ve mentioned on the turbo props that you\u2019ve had, two of you mentioned, teething pains. Can you be more specific on what kind of problems you\u2019ve encountered?", "Larry Kellner", "", "This is just kind of from the sense, Bill, of any time we start up a new aircraft and we\u2019re going to make we do it right whether you get into delivery delays or procedures, things don\u2019t always work perfectly in a sense of what you write down in the plan on a sheet of paper. So as we go through that process, I think everybody\u2019s working hard, but it\u2019s a new aircraft to our system and this is a business that focuses first and foremost on safety and we\u2019ll always continue to do that. So the result of that is there\u2019s cancellations and delays that you prefer not to have because you\u2019re not going to go until you know you\u2019re ready to go and that\u2019s a common situation with any new aircraft. ", "Jim Compton", "", "Some of the areas were as simple as we just add a little more block time in the schedule because of the fees and the way the aircraft is being routed into the airport and some things like that just to make sure we keep the same on-time integrity.", "Jeffery Smisek", "", "That\u2019s Mark Moran, our Senior or Executive VP of Operations.", "Bill Hensel \u2013 Houston Chronicle ", "Also wanted to ask whether in regard to fuel have you been able to find anything that you do differently to save money or to make it more efficient whether it\u2019s just the way it\u2019s managed or the ways it\u2019s delivered, anything like that that you could share?", "Larry Kellner", "", "No. Bill, we mentioned we\u2019re going to do a biofuels test flight in coordination with Boeing and GE next year. But in the sense, we have a very solid fuel management group, this is Larry, and we\u2019ll continue to look for every enhancement we can find in that process. But there\u2019s nothing\u2026 We pipeline straight to the gate in most cases, for instance, in Air Continental and actually have an underground fueling system. It\u2019s a very efficient process. It\u2019s just a very expensive product.

(Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the call over to Ned Walker, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and DeAnne Gabel, Director of Investor Relations. ", "Ned Walker", "Joining us here in Houston we have Larry Kellner, Continental\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Smisek our President and a member of the Board of Directors, Jeff Misner our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Compton our Executive Vice President of Marketing, Mark Moran our Executive Vice President of Operations. We also have Zane Rowe our Senior Vice President of Network Strategy and CFO-Elect as well as Jerry Laderman our Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer.", "I\u2019ll go over the format briefly, the same thing that we\u2019ve done over the last several quarters, Larry will give an industry corporate overview, Jeff Smisek will then review capacity and revenue results, followed by Jeff Misner who will look at Continental\u2019s cost structure and balance sheet. We\u2019ve allocated 20 minutes for the executive comments and then we have a 25-minute window open for the analyst questions and we\u2019ll conclude with a 15-minute window for media questions. Once again, when we do get to the Q&A portion if you could have one question and a quick follow up we should be able to accommodate everyone.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to DeAnne.", "DeAnne Gabel", "Earlier today we issued an update for investors visiting information relating to our financial and operation outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2008 and other information. This investor update was included in the filing with the SEC and can be found on our web site under the Investor Relations section. Please note that today we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures such as net income excluding special items. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures to be discussed can be located on Continental\u2019s web site at continental.com under the Investor Relations section.", "In addition, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements that are not limited to historical fact or reflect the company\u2019s current belief, expectations or intentions regarding future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For example of these risks and uncertainties please see the risk factors set forth in the 2007 10K and other Security filings.", "With that I would like to turn the call over to Larry.", "Lawrence W. Kellner", "I want to thank my co-workers. They\u2019re the backbone that makes this company great. We\u2019re going through some very difficult times in the airline business as jet fuel climbs higher and carriers including ourselves have been forced to make difficult decisions such as capacity cuts and co-worker headcount reduction. Yet despite the tough time our team has maintained their focus and delivered clean, safe and reliable air transportation, and they\u2019ve done it with a professional working-together attitude. So again thank you to all my co-workers. It\u2019s an honor to be on your team.", "With that let me recap our second quarter results. For the second quarter 2008 we reported a net loss of $25 million or a loss of $0.25 per diluted share excluding $22 million of previously announced net after-tax special items. Including those special items we reported a net loss of $3 million or a loss of $0.03 per diluted share for the quarter.", "On the operational side our team maintained their stellar reputation for completing the mission by delivering a system-wide mainline segment completion factor of 99.5% for the quarter. Time and time again my co-workers are recognized for their excellence. I\u2019m pleased to say that thanks to them for the fifth consecutive year Continental was named the Best Airline in North America at the 2008 OAG Airline of the Year Awards.", "We\u2019re experiencing the worst financial environment for US carriers since 9/11 due to record high fuel prices, the weak dollar and the generally uncertain economic environment. In response to those challenges we\u2019ve implemented a number of initiatives to maintain our competitive position in the industry and bolster our cash position.", "During the quarter we announced additional capacity reductions. Although it was a difficult decision for the team to make, it was the right decision. Over the last year and a half as oil\u2019s continued to climb ever higher we\u2019ve been reducing our growth plans. As you may recall our initial target was to grow mainline 2008 capacity by 5% to 7%. By the fall of 2007 we\u2019d already pulled the growth down to 3% to 4%. Then as the cost of fuel continued to rise, we further adjusted the schedule down to only 2% to 3% growth. The first half of 2008 the cost of fuel continued to soar, so along with many other steps we\u2019re taking we announced that we\u2019re significantly cutting our fourth quarter capacity so that for 2008 we now expect full-year mainline capacity to be down slightly as compared to 2007. In connection with our capacity reductions we\u2019ve announced that we\u2019re accelerating the retirement of 67 737-300 and 737-500 aircraft removing the majority of our least fuel-efficient mainline aircraft by the end of 2009. ", "When times are difficult cash is more important than ever and we raised approximately $900 million of cash through various transactions during the quarter and ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of unrestricted cash. In addition we implemented numerous fuel surcharge and fare increases as well as a $25 fee for a second checked bag for non-Elite customers on certain domestic and Latin America economy class tickets. The second bag fee has been very effective. In the domestic market we\u2019re seeing about a 60% reduction for second bags checked by affected customers and for Latin it\u2019s about a 35% reduction without any meaningful problems at the TSA checkpoint or onboard with carry ons. This is very good for us as we save the weight onboard our aircraft as well as the handling and mishandling bag costs. We don\u2019t know if our planned capacity reductions for the fall is appropriate until we get more data indicating what fourth quarter RASM will be, but to date we\u2019re seeing a significant year-over-year increase in average fare for fall bookings.", "Another step we took during the quarter to improve our long-term competitive position was to announce our plans to join United Airlines and the Star lines and to cooperate extensively with United, Lithuania, and other members of the Star lines. I\u2019m excited about this opportunity as Star is the most comprehensive airlines alliance in the world and our membership, along with the joint ventures we intend to create, will provide substantial new benefits for our customers. In addition to broad domestic code sharing that we planned with United we will soon be filing an application with the Department of Transportation requesting approval to join United along with Lithuania, Air Canada, and six other carriers in their already-established anti-trust immunized alliance. As noted in our earlier press release about the alliance we plan to establish a TransAtlantic joint venture in which we will pool revenue with United, Lithuania and Air Canada to compete more effectively with the recently approved joint venture including certain SkyTeam members. We also plan to form joint ventures with United and other Star lines members in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. We\u2019ll keep everyone updated as we make progress with the transition from SkyTeam to Star in the months ahead.", "Before I turn the call over to Jeff Smisek to discuss the quarter\u2019s revenue performance and Jeff Misner to discuss the quarter\u2019s cost performance, I want to thank Jeff Misner our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This will be Jeff\u2019s last earnings call as he is retiring at the end of next month. I\u2019ve known and worked with Jeff for over two decades in a couple of companies and he\u2019s served Continental with integrity, candor and professionalism since he joined us here in 1995. I along with the entire management team have been privileged to work with Jeff and want to thank him here publicly today and wish him the very best in his retirement. I also want to congratulate Zane Rowe who will become our Executive Vice President and CFO on Jeff Misner\u2019s retirement. I do want to point out that it will also help to avoid some confusion as we\u2019ll no longer wonder which Jeff said what.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff and Jeff.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "I want to join Larry in thanking my co-workers for keeping their focus on running a clean, safe and reliable operation during these incredibly difficult times for our industry. Our operations have been running smoothly and our entire team is focused on increasing revenues and holding the line on non-fuel related expenses.", "For the second quarter we continue to see yield improvement in all regions. Our consolidated yields were up 7% year-over-year. Our consolidated load factor of 81.4% was down 1.8 points year-over-year on a capacity increase of 2.7% resulting in a consolidated RASM increase of 4.6%.", "In the second quarter we grew total revenue by 9% or $334 million to just over $4 billion so we continue to have solid revenue results. Unfortunately, due to the increase in fuel costs our costs grew by more than $600 million in the quarter. Demand in general has continued to hold up well. However, the softness we began to see in the TransAtlantic sector last quarter continued throughout the second quarter which we believe is mainly attributable to the weak dollar. Yields for this region were up 3.2% year-over-year. We still had solid passenger revenue results for the region which were up 12.4% year-over-year. However, if the yield performance was softer, then we\u2019d expect it going into the quarter. We expect to continue to see this pressure on our year-over-year TransAtlantic yield throughout the third quarter although we\u2019ll be dialing down our year-over-year capacity growth in that region. So we expect positive year-over-year RASM growth there.", "During the quarter we continued to experience increased competition on our TransPacific routes as both Copa and [Jalin] increased frequencies last quarter. In addition Beijing bookings have not been as strong as we had expected. We attribute this to a drop-off in the number of leisure travelers related to hotels charging premium room rates in advance of the Olympics as well as a drop-off in leisure and business travelers related to China making it more difficult to obtain both tourist and business visas. All this had a negative impact on TransPacific load factors. Our overall Pacific load factor, which includes both our Continental Micronesia Pacific routes and our TransPacific routes, was down 2.5 points year-over-year. But yields were up 10.9% year-over-year resulting in a RASM increase of 7.4%. Advanced bookings for our TransPacific routes look better starting in September and we expect our overall Pacific load factor for the third quarter will be about flat year-over-year.", "Our Latin region continues to do well with mainline Latin RASM up 6.3% due to both increased yields and higher load factors. The Latin region did well as some travelers who traditionally travel to Europe for their summer vacation are instead opting to go to Latin America. We\u2019ll also be dialing down our year-over-year capacity growth in Latin America in the third quarter which should improve our RASM performance there.", "We also continue to see domestic mainline yield increases in the second quarter but load factor was down 1.2 points which resulted in a year-over-year RASM increase of 5.2%. We\u2019re pulling down our domestic mainline capacity significantly beginning in September and expect that our RASM there will improve significantly for the third quarter. We\u2019ve seen numerous domestic fare increases attempted by the major carriers although few of them have been matched by low-cost competitors and so they\u2019ve had little practical effect. A problem that our low-cost competitors have is that they\u2019re largely leisure customer base is quite price sensitive so they have trouble raising fares even in the face of high fuel prices. That of course bleeds over to us with respect to a large number of our domestic routes and our leisure customers but thankfully we also have a large base of business customers.", "We also had regional yield improvement during the second quarter. The load factors were down 1.4 points year-over-year resulting in a RASM increase of 6.4% compared to the second quarter of last year.", "Looking ahead to the third quarter we\u2019re comfortable with the demand outlook for the next six weeks. We continue to see year-over-year yield increases throughout all regions. Consolidated domestic booked seat factor for the next six weeks is running about flat as compared to last year. Mainline Latin bookings are running 4 points to 5 points ahead of last year while TransAtlantic bookings are running about flat as compared with last year. Pacific bookings are running four points to five points behind last year but again advanced bookings for our TransPacific routes look better starting in September. For the full third quarter we expect both our consolidated and mainline load factors to be down about a point year-over-year.", "As for corporate travel trends our market intelligence shows that most companies are not significantly reducing their air travel budgets. However, we\u2019ve heard that some companies are asking their companies to book trips further in advance to take advantage of lower price restricted tickets which of course will lead to a drop in the number of close-in and thus higher yielding bookings. We\u2019ve also heard they\u2019re asking their employees to use preferred carriers to take advantage of savings through discounting agreements, to obtain higher level internal approvals for travel, and to book coach versus business class for some of their travels. This is all pretty typical behavior in a weaker economic condition. And while it\u2019s good news that we aren\u2019t hearing of travel budget decreases for the most part, we also aren\u2019t hearing of many companies increasing their travel budgets to compensate for higher fares. So the number of trips taken will have to decrease if companies are to stay within their travel budget.", "As Larry mentioned we don\u2019t have a lot of data about the fourth quarter booking trends in yield yet. If domestic RASM doesn\u2019t perform as we expect it to for the fourth quarter, we may need to make further capacity reductions and we won\u2019t shy away from doing what we need to do depending of course on what the rest of the industry looks like then. We\u2019ve been focused on building our cash position so we can have the staying power that will be necessary as we go into the seasonally weaker fall and winter seasons.", "For the third quarter we expect mainline capacity to be flat compared to the third quarter of 2007 with mainline domestic capacity down 2.8% and mainline international capacity up 2.9%. Our third quarter international growth is mainly driven by the run rate of new markets we started last year and our Heathrow expansion this year. We expect regional capacity will be up 8.4% driven mostly by our increasing use of fuel efficient Q400 and replacing 19-seat Beechcraft with 37-seat Q200 turboprops flown by our business partners. Due to the significant domestic mainline capacity reductions we announced earlier which begin September 3, we expect our total mainline capacity including international will be down slightly for the full year 2008. For 2009 we expect our total mainline capacity including international capacity will be down 1% to 3% year-over-year with our mainline domestic capacity expected to be down between 4% and 6%. This of course assumes that we don\u2019t pull additional capacity in response to market conditions.", "I want to close by thanking my co-workers for all they\u2019re doing in these tough times. Everyone is working together to make sure that Continental emerges on the other side of these problems as a profitable carrier with great service and great product.", "Before I turn the call over to Jeff Misner I want to join Larry in thanking Jeff for all he\u2019s done for Continental. Jeff has been a superb Chief Financial Officer. He\u2019s a man of solid integrity and excellent judgment. Moreover, he\u2019s been a friend to many of us at Continental and we will miss him very much.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff Misner.", "Jeff Misner", "As we discussed given the continued escalation in oil prices we\u2019ll be initially reducing our capacity beginning in September. But reducing capacity is a critical step that\u2019s only part of the story. For a pull-down to be successful you need to get the associated toss out of the system as well, and we\u2019ve been working very hard doing just that. And we recognize the difficulty that many of these decisions pose and I want to thank the team for their willingness to make those tough decisions, all the while maintaining a working-together can-do kind of attitude.", "Our costs ex-fuel came in a little better than our guidance for the quarter mostly attributable to a long-term incentive program which is mark-to-market each month based on changes in our stock price. Excluding the impact of that program our costs came in about $7 million better than our guidance. Maintenance was a few million better than expected due to the timing of some events. Other rents, landing fees came in a couple million better primarily due to some airport credits. And depreciation and amortization also came in slightly better than we expected.", "As DeAnne mentioned we filed our investor update this morning which has our third quarter full-year 2008 guidance. Since the guidance is posted on our web site I won\u2019t take the time to repeat it all in my comments. As we announced earlier in the quarter we reached a new seven-year capacity purchase agreement with ExpressJet. We estimate that annual savings resulting from the revised agreement will be approximately $50 million. This is net of the effect of their reduced lease rates related to 30 aircraft ExpressJet will continue to sublease from us and also costs associated with the expected grounding of 30 regional jets returned to us. Our 2008 cost guidance incorporates the impact of these changes.", "As I mentioned last quarter we\u2019ll continue to work on eliminating inefficiencies and non-value-added costs from the system. As we previously discussed we\u2019ve identified many new revenue and cost-savings initiatives and expect to realize about $100 million from these initiatives this year and expect the amount to exceed $200 million annually once fully implemented.", "For the third quarter 2008 we expect our consolidated CASM, that\u2019s cost per available seat mileage, excluding special items and holding fuel constant to be down about 2% year-over-year and our mainline CASM again holding fuel rate constant and excluding special items to be down about 2.5% year-over-year. For the full year 2008 excluding special items and holding fuel constant we now expect consolidated CASM to be down 0.5% to 1% and mainline CASM to be down 1% to 1.5%.", "Our jet fuel of course continued to set new highs during the quarter and for the same quarter consolidated fuel expense was 40% of our total cost. You\u2019ll note that the fuel was almost twice the cost of wages, salaries and related costs in the second quarter. For years we\u2019ve focused on fuel efficiency in our operation but at today\u2019s prices of course it\u2019s even more imperative. We continue to make improvements by retiring many of our least fuel-efficient mainline aircraft and continue in our winglet program and working on a variety of other fuel-savings initiatives.", "Getting non-essential weight off the aircraft continues to be a big focus. For example we\u2019ll begin using a lighter more durable life vest. We estimate at current fuel prices we\u2019ll save about $2 million a year from this action alone because of the weight savings once the fleet is fully converted. And we continue to hedge a portion of our near-term fuel needs using a combination of callers and call options in both heating oil and crude oil. Additional details on our most recent hedge position can be found in the investor update.", "On the capital rating front Jerry, Jack and the entire corporate finance team as well as the legal team were kept pretty busy during the quarter raising money for us. During the quarter we sold 11 million shares of Continental common stock for net proceeds of approximately $162 million. In addition we sold our remaining stake in Copa and received net proceeds of $149 million recognizing a gain of $78 million.", "Our co-brand bank card partner Chase approached us earlier in the year asking us to extend the term of our co-brand relationship, which we did in the second quarter. In June we received a payment of $413 million from them, $178 million of which is for certain commitments related to the co-branding agreement including the extension of the agreement through the end of 2016 and the balance is related to advance purchase of frequent flier miles. We also amended our bank card processing agreement during the quarter. The agreement extended the term of the agreement through December 2016 and modified certain covenants. Trigger levels to post additional collateral are no longer tied to a fixed charge coverage ratio. They\u2019re now tied to our unrestricted cash and short-term investment balance. More details regarding the amended covenants and collateral requirements can be found in our second quarter 10Q which we expect to file in the next few days.", "The team also closed transactions to borrow approximately $208 million under various debt agreements secured by aircraft purchase agreements in mainline jet aircraft. We received net proceeds of $173 million in the second quarter and expect to receive the remaining funds in the fourth quarter of 2008. We\u2019ve now completed financing arrangements for all aircraft delivering in 2008.", "In cash we ended the second quarter with $3.4 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments which excludes all student loan related option rate securities. We expect to end the third quarter between $2.8 million and $2.9 million of unrestricted cash, again excluding the option rate securities. We expect cash capital expenditures for 2008 to be $427 million net of aircraft purchase deposits paid or refunded and we have more detail on the cap ex in the investor update. The pension year-to-date we\u2019ve contributed $102 million to our pension plan satisfying our required minimum contributions for the calendar year 2008. Given current market conditions we do not plan to make any additional contributions this year.", "Concluding, the environment continues to be very challenging. Whatever we need to make it through this challenging time, we plan to do it. The Continental team has a great track record of being nimble and responding as necessary to changes in the industry environment. We intend to return to profitability and we\u2019ll be working hard to make that happen. And finally, we expect that as I mentioned we\u2019ll file second quarter Q in the next few days.", "And I too want to congratulate Zane on his appointment. Zane, from now on it\u2019s all yours baby.", "With that we\u2019ll turn it back to Larry.", "Lawrence W. Kellner", "There are many significant changes happening at Continental and in our industry. These are tough times but there\u2019ll always be an airlines industry and we intend not only to survive these tough times but to come out the other side as a profitable carrier with a strong competitive position. We\u2019ve taken numerous steps to bolster our liquidity and reduce our capacity plans to better align ourselves with the current economic environment. And if additional changes are required we\u2019ll do what\u2019s appropriate. While we\u2019re making changes to the business to cope with near-term issues, we\u2019ll remain focused on positioning ourselves for the long term which includes our plans to transition from SkyTeam into Star as well as continuing to maintain our culture and invest in our product.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to DeAnne to begin our Q&A.", "DeAnne Gabel", "With that we\u2019ll begin the question and answer session for the analysts followed by the question and answer session for the media. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from William Greene - Morgan Stanley.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "If I can just ask a couple of questions, first on liquidity, you guys do a great job finding sources but what\u2019s left? What\u2019s still there that we are probably not thinking about?", "Gerald Laderman", "As we say I think almost every quarter, we prefer not to comment on transactions until we\u2019ve completed them. So suffice it to say we stay very focused on liquidity and continue to look at opportunities as they present themselves.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "I guess let me just try to be a little bit more specific. So you\u2019ve pre-sold some miles. Is there a lot left that you could do or did you kind of max out in that regard? And I know you don\u2019t like to say kind of what you think you could monetize, but is there any meaningful unencumbered assets or will you have to get creative from here?", "Lawrence W. Kellner", "Well I think two things Bill. One, I think typically we pre-sell miles I think for a brand new carrier that\u2019s typically tied to renewing a contract or an extension of the contract or else you\u2019re selling those miles at a discount which we wouldn\u2019t want to do. And so I think we\u2019ll always look at balancing good economic decisions, but I think the key there was that was just part of renewing the contract but clearly opportune based on the environment. Two, think with regard we have continually kept most of our assets pledged. We\u2019ll always look for opportunities. Clearly the option rates are not included in the cash balance that we allude to, so we\u2019ve got some assets there. We\u2019ll just see how the whole option rate market continues to evolve and we\u2019ll always look for other creative opportunities. But I think also there was clearly a push to make sure we had a very strong balance at the end of the second quarter and I think as you see the second quarter results come out relative some others you\u2019ll see we\u2019re in a pretty good position.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Just one quick follow up, on business travel, Jeff Smisek, you went through some comments there and I\u2019m just curious if you think that some of the commentary that you\u2019re hearing from your corporate if that\u2019s sort of symptomatic of a coming downturn in business travel. Is there sort of an unambiguous sign that you can sort of see from past cycles where you say, \u201cWell that\u2019s actually the thing that makes us worried. That\u2019s the thing that we watch for.\u201d?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Bill I think what we see is businesses operating in what\u2019s characterized as a generally uncertain environment. I mean some of our business customers, for example some of the financial institutions, clearly they\u2019re under pretty tight screws on some of their travel. Others for example sitting here in Houston the gas comes up for service companies, these guys are living large and flying all around the world up front and spending money like drunken sailors. So it just depends upon the business. I think in general what we\u2019re seeing are reactions to a generally weaker economic environment and businesses tightening down on their travel budgets, not so much necessarily by decreasing them because they still have to get out and have face time with clients and customers, etc., but making sure that you\u2019ve got the higher level of approval authority. Some of the folks who perhaps used to be able to fly up front, they have a little more restriction on their ability to fly up front. Things like that which you see in tougher economic times.", "Lawrence W. Kellner", "And Bill I think that clearly you see some indicators. The problem is those indicators might have predicted 10 of the last five downturns. People are always looking for the recession where things are going down and so clearly since the beginning of the year there\u2019s been tremendous talk about the economy and a downturn and where things are. So, it\u2019s one of those things that clearly its got our focus and attention but it\u2019s difficult to know if this is a false alarm or a real alarm and we\u2019ll only see that if we see business travel unfold over the fall. But, clearly a risk.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Ray Neidle \u2013 Calyon Securities.", "Ray Neidle \u2013 Calyon Securities", "Larry some just general questions on your outlook, the first thing is are you part of the airline movement for congressional investigation of the futures market in oil? And, if you are, what\u2019s your background on that? What\u2019s your thinking on that?", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "Yes, I signed the letter that the ATA had and I\u2019m definitely part of the ATA board and part of that group. My general view is that we\u2019ve got two issues here, we\u2019ve got a supply issue that\u2019s not keeping up with demand and then we\u2019re seeing huge volatility on a day-to-day basis. I think there\u2019s clearly a underlying supply element here we\u2019ve got to address for the long term but when you see oil move $5 and $10 in a day and then move back $10 a couple of days later, yesterday at least you could tie it to supply but many of these days you can\u2019t tie it to supply. So, clearly, there\u2019s a speculative element as well as a supply element and I think we\u2019d all be better off if we could take some of the volatility out of the oil market. ", "It\u2019s interesting you don\u2019t see, from the supply side, lines anywhere like you saw in the mid 70s yet you\u2019ve seen incredible price escalation and so clearly I think there\u2019s an element of both short term volatility driven by speculators as well as some long term supply issues and my hope is that the congress will address both of those issues.", "Ray Neidle \u2013 Calyon Securities", "Larry the other big picture question that keeps coming up now, consultants, politicians, the media, even a former Enron executive have been saying that maybe the industry needs to be reregulated. Do you have any thoughts on that?", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "Yes. I said this earlier, I think it was at the Merrill Lynch conference, if you look back at the last 30 years there hasn\u2019t been a time where I\u2019d say it\u2019s been real good for customers, passengers or airline employees. Clearly, customers have gotten lower fares if you look at the adjustment but I think there\u2019s tremendous unhappiness kind of on all fronts and we need to go back. I think I\u2019d start with air traffic control system, I think Congress has failed there to really lay out the plan to get us the infrastructure we need to operate. And, we may see some drop off in that pressure again as people reduce capacity again this fall but, these are things that take a long time to do and we need to get the air traffic control system moving and fixed. ", "I was with Senator Rockefeller last week and he\u2019s very focused on it. I commend, he\u2019s been working very hard to try to move that effort forward but we need to get a focus in Congress I think first on air traffic control system but really to step back and look at the business. Bob Crandall\u2019s very thoughtful if you look at what he\u2019s saying. I think you\u2019re not going to have regulation like you had pre 78 but I do think we need to look at how we make the structure better and I would be very supportive of an effort to look at what changes we can make to provide a more stable environment for everybody. I think that\u2019s good for the country, I think it\u2019s good for the airlines, I think it would be good for our customers, I think it would be good for our employees.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Jamie Baker \u2013 J.P. Morgan ", "Jamie Baker \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I\u2019m curious on the Express Jet contract, the revised contract if in addition to the cost savings you\u2019ve quantified if there\u2019s any revised language that would be relevant if Continental or Express Jet were to file bankruptcy. I\u2019m still trying to quantify the risk to big Continental if Ex Jet is somehow forced to file.", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any significant changes in the contract that relate to that. I did say that I think the changes that rather than being able to terminate with basically 12 months notice instruct to pull down this provides some stability to Express Jet. It\u2019s a seven year long term contract that while at a lower rate is closer to where the marketplace is. I also believe provide them the opportunity to add some stability to their company. Clearly, they\u2019ve made some changes outside of that contract and I\u2019ll let them comment on those. But, I just think Express Jet does a good job for us. I think this gives some stability to the situation and allows them to plan going forward knowing they\u2019ll be a partner to us for the long term. In addition, we relieved them of several restrictions that they had on how they could operate, what they could do so I think it gives some more flexibility to them in addition which will make them a stronger more viable company for the future.", "Jamie Baker \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "The way that you said closer to market though might have implied and this might not have been your intent Larry, that they\u2019re still somewhat above average?", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "I think if you looked at a pure competitive bid situation we might have been able to get a rate that was somewhat lower than where we were. We don\u2019t believe, or I think I\u2019m very comfortable with that but we made a significant improvement in our rate, enough so that we were comfortable balancing that with the transition risk and the great job that Express Jet does for us. We were looking to find a solution with Express Jet. Jim worked very hard to try to find a solution. From Express Jet\u2019s side, they were looking to find a solution and so I think in all cases we compromised to get to a result that I think is good for both companies and avoided a lot of disruption that could have otherwise occurred and so we were willing to spend a little bit to avoid that.", "Jamie Baker \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "And a second question, when you net any breakage costs against the move from SkyTeam to Star, any quantification as to how the overall benefits are going to compare? I\u2019m assuming you wouldn\u2019t switch teams if it wasn\u2019t P&L positive?", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "It\u2019s hard to quantify still models and alliances exactly how that will run. Clearly, we think it\u2019s a positive once we\u2019ve got the transition completed, once we get there that but I think the real positive for us is where we think it will take us long term and the partners and the ability. But, we\u2019ve changed strategy as well by going in to, or proposing to go in to a JV with antitrust immunity across North Atlantic and broaden that in other areas of the world and we think that provides significant long term benefits as well. So, it\u2019s both the fact that we think the alliance will provide more benefit to us and two, with the strategy changes we\u2019re opening up a lot of new opportunities. I\u2019d also add that we think the cooperation we have with United, we\u2019re going to look to find every opportunity we can there to create both customer benefits, make it as seamless as we can make it as well as be as efficient as we can be.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg \u2013 Merrill Lynch.", "Mike Linenberg \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Yes, just two accounting questions, looking at your guidance when you look at the cap ex, the cash cap ex piece it looks like in the latest piece it looks like you\u2019re getting more money back in your next purchase deposit line and yet it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s been any change to the fleet situation. What is that? Is that something back from Boeing? Anything on that front?", "Jeff Misner ", "The purchase deposits are obviously on the Boeing equipment and I think with the 787 delays out there, we\u2019re experiencing a little bit of something different than what we might have otherwise expected to see at that point. I think it\u2019s mostly attributable to that. ", "Mike Linenberg \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Will there be further monies coming back as a result of that later this year or in 2009?", "Jeff Misner ", "Well, this was for the full year guidance so that takes care of year. I don\u2019t know if I know the answer to that off the top of my head Michael.", "Mike Linenberg \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Then my second question, when you look at the guidance for the third quarter, it\u2019s not that far off from what you did in the June quarter. And yet, there\u2019s a lot of ancillary initiatives that are out there. Is there upside risk to that number? Is that a conservative take on that or are the bag feels is that going to just up as another line item. Am I missing something there?", "DeAnne Gabel", "That can go in to other revenue line.", "Mike Linenberg \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Your third quarter I think it\u2019s similar to what it was in the second quarter?", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "Bags are just ramping that up. I don\u2019t recall the exact day of the intuitive.", "DeAnne Gabel", "Well, we launched in May but there was some ticket travel dates with your summer travel especially for those family vacations people but further in advance and so they booked prior to the policy changes.", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "Mike, I do say that I will tell you that our general philosophy is to always try to be conservative with the guidance especially in areas where we have new fees. And, I will join you in being hopeful that it\u2019s better than that but that\u2019s what we\u2019re comfortable with today as far as what we see as we ramp in some of these in service fees. But, we\u2019re very happy with how they\u2019re going and clearly we think they\u2019re providing operational benefits as I alluded to in my comments and some cost savings as well as to the fees and we are on the second bag somewhat indifferent as to the fee or not having the bag checked because they\u2019re clearly very positive operational and cost impacts to us to see a rejection in those second bags. And, people who check two bags, the second bag will be just people who are tending to just bring more and so from a weight perspective that second bag is very key to us.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Justine Fischer \u2013 Goldman Sachs. ", "Justine Fischer \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "The first question that I have is probably a difficult one to phrase but, your comment on ancillary revenues specifically the second bag checked was interesting because it seems as though people are checking fewer second bags so it\u2019s possible that the revenues you would expect from that aren\u2019t as much. But, at the same time you mentioned the cost savings to the bottom line. So, are the cost savings that you\u2019re seeing on the bottom line as much as the potential revenue benefits that you thought you would see? So, even if people aren\u2019t checking as many bags there\u2019s still the net same benefit from those ancillary revenue strategies?", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "It will take us a little more time to get a clear grasp of that and get everybody transitioned in. But, clearly our belief in setting the fee was that the third bag fee is substantially higher than second bag fee and so there\u2019s a case where we\u2019re trying to recover our marginal costs on the third bag and we also tend to bulk out the aircraft in some place both in Latin American and some domestic flights you run in to capacity issues. Clearly, we\u2019ve set that second bag fee with a view that we\u2019re happy if you don\u2019t check the second bag. The savings we get we\u2019re okay with the fee. We were trying to find that balance. We need some more data before we can tell you we think they\u2019re both right in synch as we get fully transitioned in and look at the impact, especially on our hub operations on connect both on mishandled bags which we are seeing our mishandled bag numbers improve significantly since we moved the second bag. But, we also have a lot of other initiatives Bill [Mian] and his team are doing just a great job bringing it in. So, it\u2019s difficult to separate how much of this is some of the other initiatives on how much of this is second bag without a little more data.", "Justine Fischer \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Then the next follow up question is just one more on the general state of the industry in the fourth quarter because you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing some stiff competition at last on the fare front from LCCs and so despite some actions that the largest legacy carries might take to either cut some capacity or raise some fares you\u2019re not seeing the follow through from the LCCs. So, how do you see the situation playing out if in the fourth quarter people like you and AMR are cutting capacity substantially but for example, someone like a Southwest doesn\u2019t and still undercuts fares. Does that lead to the legacy carriers saying, \u201cNever mind, we still have to go back to competing on capacity?\u201d Or, do you just cut more? How does that play out if the LCCs continue to throw a wrench if you will in the capacity reduction plans with you guys.", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "I think while clearly you aren\u2019t seeing the LCCs cut capacity at the levels that the majors are, if you look across the system whether it\u2019s Southwest or Jet Blue, on a relative basis to their growth in the past, you are seeing significant capacity discipline across the industry. We are seeing an average fare as we look at fall bookings that is significantly higher than a year ago. The question is what will the demand levels be at those higher fares? Who needs to go on sale? What other actions happen in the industry? Because, this has been very different than previous downturns as you\u2019ve literally seen an ATA or a Skybus go away overnight and so that can have capacity impacts on the industry as well. So, it\u2019s a thing that we\u2019re going to take all the action that we need to take to make sure that we\u2019re not only survivors but that we come out on the other end and are profitable and have a good solid business. And it\u2019s a little difficult to speculate but I\u2019d say where I disagree with your premise is that I do see the LCCs while they\u2019re not cutting capacity clearly showing more discipline and looking at what they need to do and you see carriers like Midwest making significant reductions in their capacity. I think this is a think that we\u2019ll just keep an eye on and make sure that we\u2019re doing what we believe is best for our shareholders and the company.", "I would tell you that what we\u2019ve done to date is the fact that we\u2019re getting rid of less fuel efficient planes that either we can sell or leases expire in relatively short term. Capacity reductions get tougher as you go forward because you don\u2019t have the fleet flexibility and in addition, we\u2019ve been very focused on getting as many employee volunteers that we can get so that we can produce the impact on the operation. That also gets tougher as you go deeper so we\u2019re clearly focused on trying to make sure that we get to the white level about the same time as I tell you future cuts are harder than the cuts we\u2019ve done.", "Jeff Misner ", "The one thing Justine that I would add to that is that as we have cut capacity, [inaudible] has cut capacity as the low cost competitors have dialed back their growth. That also gives us enhanced revenue management opportunities so you\u2019re going to see our yields improving as a result and that\u2019s really important as well.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Gary Chase \u2013 Lehman Brothers.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Just a quick question for Jim Compton if he\u2019s there or I guess Jeff Smisek. You talked about this shifting booking curve business travel kind of booking a little further out and the impact that\u2019s having on your yields. I\u2019m curious if, and Jeff you were just talking about enhanced revenue management, have you put in enough fences where you\u2019re confident that that changing behavior is not going to affect the ending outcome. That you\u2019re not suffering dilution from that, from that change in the booking curve, or do we still need to come further on that before you can make that statement?", "Jim Compton ", "Yes, I think that over, as Jeff has mentioned over [inaudible] that we\u2019ve seen in the past, another piece of that is a continuation to try to build up more of the fences in the segment business versus leisure and so whether it\u2019s three day minimum stays or Friday night stays across, Saturday night stays, we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive in that area in terms of putting those fences in. That being said, as people pre-plan and again, our sales force has continuous communication with the corporate travel partnerships that we have and they are telling us that pricing \u2013 they\u2019re managing their budgets too so they do look for opportunities to book further out which then would say that they could hit a 14 day advance purchase fare that can have significant savings versus seven day AP for instance, and so forth. ", "So, I think we continue to look at it, we continue to kind of manage as Jeff made a great point that your yield increase two ways, you get yield increase by the absolute fare going up and you get yield increase by revenue managing your bucket. With capacity coming down that\u2019s a great opportunity to continue to manage your bucket that might offset some of that behavior that we\u2019re seeing moving forward.", "Gary Chase \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "It sounds like you think it will be modestly dilutive though with that behavior shift or is that not right?", "Jim Compton ", "Again, it\u2019s hard to speculate on that. I think Larry advised in his comments that when we talk about the fourth quarter a significant piece of that traffic it just isn\u2019t booking yet, we\u2019re so far out on the booking curve. So, what we see is we see good \u2013 we\u2019re comfortable with our bookings and the fare levels that we have on the books today for the fourth quarter but that\u2019s got to be correlated to more of a leisure type passenger so it\u2019s a little bit early to speculate on where we\u2019re going to be in terms of your question on dilution.", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "I think from a policy standpoint it\u2019s always easy in a corporate world to change policy but as we all know in the business world flexibility and reacting to conditions is really important and so as you watch you really don\u2019t know about close end traffic declines until you see them. Go back to the spring of 2000 there was a significant drop between April and May. I will tell you, we looked back, there weren\u2019t a lot of indicators that will tell you that was coming but when it happens you can clearly see it and, as I alluded to earlier, you predict that about 10 times for every five it happens and so you\u2019re just keeping your eye out to say, \u201cLook I know there some stress in the economy but I think it\u2019s no different than the volatility you\u2019re seeing in the market.\u201d Monday was a pretty down day, Tuesday was a pretty down day, yesterday was a pretty good day. We\u2019re just kind of watching that but I will tell you that I do believe on close end traffic, especially from our [inaudible] insight that\u2019s why revenue management works, it is more difficult to actually execute on 14 day advance purchase simply because in many cases businesses can\u2019t plan that far in advance.", "Operator", "", "With that we\u2019ll turn the call over to Ned.", "Ned Walker ", "With that we\u2019ll conclude the second quarter earnings Q&A with the analysts.

", "Ned Walker", "", "Here in Houston we have Larry Kellner, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Smisek, our President & Chief Operating Officer and a Member of the Board, Zane Rowe, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Moran, our Executive Vice President of Operations and Jim Compton, our Executive Vice President of Marketing as well as Jerry Laderman, our Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer.", "The format will begin with Larry will have some overview comments. Jeff Smisek will then review capacity and revenue and then we\u2019ll conclude the comments with Zane Rowe who will discuss cost structure and the balance sheet. We\u2019ve allocated 20 minutes for the executive comments followed by a 25 minute Q&A session for the analyst and then a 15 minute session for the media.", "We\u2019d request that you have one question with a brief follow up and that way we should be able to accommodate everyone. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to DeAnne.", "DeAnne Gabel", "", "Earlier today we issued an update for investors presenting information relating to our financial and operational outlook for the fourth quarter and full and full year 2008 and other information. This investor update was included in the filing with the SEC and can be found on our website under the investor relations section.", "Please note that today we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures such as net loss excluding special items. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures to be discussed can be found on Continental\u2019s website at www.Continental.com under the investor relations section.", "In addition, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements that are not limited to historical facts but reflect the company\u2019s current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For examples of risks and uncertainties please see the risk factors set forth in the company\u2019s 2007 10K as well as other Securities filings.", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "I want to start by thanking my co-workers for doing a great job again this quarter. Despite several severe storms including Hurricane Ike that affected both my co-workers personal lives as well as our operations, my co-workers did a great job working together to provide a suburb product. During the quarter they earned on-time incentives for two out of the three months. ", "I also want to compliment my co-workers on how smoothly they implemented our schedule reduction and the great job they did minimizing furloughs through voluntary programs. Regardless of the challenges that arise, our teams\u2019 dedication delivered excellent customer service and a premium product truly sets us apart from the competition. With that, let me recap our third quarter results. ", "For the third quarter 2008 Continental reported a net loss of $145 million or a loss of $1.32 per diluted share excluding $91 million of previously announced special items. Including those special items, we reported a net loss of $236 million or a loss of $2.14 per diluted share for the third quarter. It\u2019s disappointing to report a loss in what is historically been one of our seasonally stronger quarters. But, given that our consolidated fuel expense for the third quarter was $736 million higher than it was last year, I think our team did an excellent job minimizing the loss. ", "During the quarter we unveiled details of the new lay flat seat for our business first cabin. I think our customers are going to be delighted with the new seat and I\u2019m pleased that the team was able to design a seat that lays completely flat without compromising functionality or the effective use of cabin space. Customers will begin seeing the new seat on Continental\u2019s 777 and 757 200 aircraft that serve long haul international routes beginning in the fall of 2009 and we\u2019ll install it on 12 of our 767 400 aircraft beginning in 2010 as well as when our 787s deliver, they\u2019ll have the seat as well.", "Also in response to our customers showing a clear preference for service to London\u2019s Heathrow Airport versus Gatwick we announced that effective October 25th we\u2019ll add a third daily non-stop flight between our New York hub and London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. In addition to the three daily flights from New York, we\u2019ll operate twice daily service to Heathrow from our Houston hub. As a result of having a competitive schedule from New York and Houston to Heathrow, we\u2019ll discontinue flights to London Gatwick from both New York and Houston.", "Looking to the future, it\u2019s too early to gage precisely the net effect on our business from the recent global economic turmoil. On one hand fuel prices have declined significantly and if they stay around their current level we\u2019ll benefit greatly. On the other hand, we know that demand for air travel will be adversely affected by a recession and it remains to be seen how deep, wide and long the recession will be.", "We\u2019re being cautious about demand and realistic about our access to the credit markets. As a result, we\u2019ve been working with our partner Boeing and have reached an agreement in principal with them to reschedule in to later years 16 737 aircraft originally scheduled to be delivered in 2009 and 2010. We also have an agreement in principal for backstop financing through the remaining 14 737 aircraft scheduled for 2009 delivery. ", "We\u2019ve also moved the two 777s that were scheduled for delivery next year in to 2010 instead. We feel that rescheduling these deliveries and obtaining backstop financing for the 14 remaining 737 aircrafts scheduled for delivery next year were prudent moves in these uncertain times. One thing that is different about this cycle compared to other economic cycles is that the industry including Continental has already cut a significant amount of capacity.", "The capacity reductions together with a significant cost savings from lower fuel prices should provide a substantial cushion against the negative revenue impact from a further weakening economy. As previously announced, we\u2019re planning to join the Star Alliance and to join United along with Lufthansa, Air Canada and certain other Star Alliance members in their already established antitrust immunized alliance. ", "During the quarter we filed an application with the Department of Transportation to join these carriers in an antitrust immunized alliance and are in the process of finalizing our response to the DOT\u2019s request for additional information. While we\u2019re waiting to receive approval we\u2019re continuing to prepare for our transition from SkyTeam to Star. Star is the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world.", "We expect to be able to transition out of SkyTeam and in to Star by the fourth quarter of next year and we\u2019re very excited about being able to deliver all the benefits of the Star Alliance to our corporate and leisure customers. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff Smisek.", "Jeffery A. Smisek ", "I want to join Larry in thanking my co-workers for running a solid operation for the quarter. In addition to the usual summer storms that impact our operations we also had to deal with a couple of tropical storms and several hurricanes including Hurricane Ike that directly hit Houston and forced us to shut down our Houston hub for two and a half days. ", "Despite these challenges and the personal impact on thousands of our co-workers who had damaged homes and no power or water, the team did a great job keeping the operation running smoothly and serving our customers. We estimate that the adverse impact of Hurricane Ike on our operating results for the third quarter was approximately $50 million. ", "During the third quarter we had good revenue growth and again recorded year-over-year yield improvements in all regions. For the third quarter we had a domestic mainline year-over-year yield increase of 9.4%. We traded some load factor for those higher yields but the trade off was worth wild as our domestic mainline RASM was up 6.8% year-over-year. In the third quarter Trans Atlantic RASM was up 6% driven by a year-over-year increase in yields of 7.8% as load factor was down slightly.", "The positive foreign exchange impact on Trans Atlantic RASM was about two and a half points. Our Pacific region includes our Trans Pacific routes as well as our Continental Micronesia operations. Overall, our Pacific yields were up 9.3% for the third quarter on 7.4% less capacity. Loads were down about half a point resulting in a RASM increase of 8.6% year-over-year. Our Latin region continued to do very well. ", "The mainline Latin yields were up 13.3% and RASM was up 14.9% as load factor increased about a point. We also saw improvement in regional yields during the third quarter. However, regional load factor was down 5.2 points year-over-year on 6.2% more capacity so regionally RASM was just slightly up year-over-year. ", "Before I talk about what we see in the fourth quarter I\u2019d like to talk a bit about the general effects that all the turmoil in the world financial markets is having on corporate air travel. Let me start by saying that we don\u2019t have a lot of data yet and we are not sure of the magnitude or duration of the effects. However, it\u2019s clear that there will be an overall negative effect on corporate travel although our early indications show the effects vary by industry and region.", "We\u2019ve recently surveyed many of our corporate accounts and I\u2019d like to share some takeaways from their feedback. Obviously, the financial firms in New York City are feeling the biggest effect with all of them indicating a significant reduction in travel spend for the remainder of the year and a sizeable expected reduction in their 2009 budget. That said, we\u2019ve never before been a player among financial firms in the New York to London Heathrow market as we didn\u2019t have Heathrow access so we don\u2019t expect to be as adversely affected as those carriers with enormous dependence on Heathrow traffic.", "On the positive side, now that we\u2019re building a reasonably competitive schedule between New York and Heathrow, we have an opportunity to compete for global corporate contracts that we were shut out of earlier. So, we have an opportunity to take share away from our competitors. That said, we expect the overall New York to Heathrow market will shrink. For the most part energy companies around the globe continue their travel spend as today\u2019s oil prices are still pretty high compared to historical prices. ", "So, as of now we don\u2019t expect significant reductions in travel spend by most of our energy customers. We\u2019re seeing a significant down turn in traffic from the automotive companies and related vendors throughout the globe with particular reductions in travel from the US to or from Asia and the US and to or from Mexico. We expect that our pharmaceutical customers will be budgeting for travel at slightly lower levels for 2009 although a lot depends on product launches which can cause a spike in travel.", "We\u2019re also seeing typical behavior among most of our corporate customers in response to weaker economic conditions. This behavior includes businesses asking their employees to buy advance purchase tickets to take advantage of lower price restricted tickets, requesting employees to use preferred carriers to take advantage of savings through discount agreements, requiring higher level internal approvals for travel and requiring travelers to book coach versus business class on flights under a certain length.", "We do have a bit of good news as we\u2019ve signed a number of new corporate contracts on renewals that position us to gain market share from our network competitors beginning this quarter and extending in to 2009 with particular upside in key international markets like Houston and New York to London Heathrow. As I said earlier, this is a key point as we haven\u2019t had the ability to compete for this traffic in previous years.", "Obviously, as the economy declines leisure demand will decline as well. We have a good early indicator of that from sales on our Continental.com website where we are seeing a slowing of year-over-year growth in sales. Now, turning to the fourth quarter outlook in the domestic mainline system, our yields are not building quite as strongly as we expected a few weeks ago and so we somewhat reduced our year-over-year mainline domestic RASM expectations for October and November to low double digit growth from our earlier expectation of low to mid teens growth.", "In the Trans Atlantic region we\u2019ve seen some softness in the front cabin yields but this is being more than offset in strength in back cabin yields. In addition, we in the industry are pulling down some capacity in this region during the fourth quarter which should help bolster our RASM growth in the fourth quarter for this region. I should note that the weakening Euro will likely negatively impact our RASM growth in this region in the fourth quarter.

So, is it safe to assume that maybe you\u2019re already seeing the weakness then in the domestic market and that inevitably that\u2019s going to affect international? And, if so what do you really have that you could cut because a lot of the markets, particularly in Trans Atlantic are sort of single daily flight I would think of and you would have to actually exit the city. Is that how you think about it?", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "I think there are a couple of things, one I think that clearly there is some challenges on a global basis in the economy and while we may have seen them start here in the US they\u2019re out there. On the other hand there aren\u2019t as many alternatives and there\u2019s a certain amount of international travel I think you\u2019re going to continue to see as the world gets more global and so there\u2019s no question you may see some pressure. ", "But, much like we got out [Colon] I think we\u2019re willing to look at individual markets and make sure what makes sense. You\u2019ve also seen some other carriers reduce the number of frequencies on a weekly basis and kind of cut capacity in that way. We\u2019ll continue to look at all our options though I think we\u2019ve got a very diversified international set of routes and if you look actually Latin America and in some places on the Trans Pac we still see some things we like.", "Europe\u2019s clearly got some challenges and we\u2019ll watch that but it\u2019s uneven across Europe.

Even if you look and say, \u201cWell okay New York didn\u2019t have Ike,\u201d we have so much service between New York and Houston there\u2019s a spillover effect there so I think September data is just a little cloudy for us due to the Hurricane.", "William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Then just real quick Larry, what\u2019s your view on what the industry will do as we look at where fuel prices have gone, what\u2019s the industry likely to do?

It\u2019s very troublesome for our customers, it\u2019s very troublesome for my co-workers that the system doesn\u2019t work well in New York and right now what we\u2019re doing is the government is proposing shifting around who might use some of that as opposed to focusing on fixing the problem we have.", "Clearly, we need to get a clear focus and I hope as we move towards next year we can get that on trying to make real improvements in the airspace in New York through ATC reform. I want to compliment the controllers, I want to compliment the FAA, they\u2019re working hard with the system they have to make it work as efficiently as possible and there have been a number of steps that they\u2019re taking to do that.", "But, we need a new system.

Not in terms of just a level of consumption you\u2019re protecting against but the types of derivatives you guys use. Do you think it\u2019s worth maybe spending an extra few million just to buy simple call options so you can participate on the downside if fuel prices stay low?", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "Let me just start out and I\u2019ll take a minute or two because I think it\u2019s an important topic to address that. We look at hedging for fuel as insurance, not as something where we speculate on the prices so we don\u2019t view it as a debt we win or lose. Much like if you have your car insurance you don\u2019t hope you have a claim during the year, you hope you pay your premium and get nothing for it. ", "So, our general strategy on fuel hedging has always been an insurance strategy. There really are five pieces to that, first is a fuel efficient fleet. Second is that where we\u2019ve already sold the ticket we will tend to hedge for that to lock the fuel in because the ticket price can\u2019t move. Ultimately we\u2019d like to see ticket prices reflect our costs. Third, we look at a level of self insurance where we say insurance costs money so to the extent we can self insure, we do.", "When we see a lot of volatility our first choice is to use calls because then you can protect for the upside and be covered on the downside. Then, you\u2019ll see at the end in periods of high volatility we\u2019ll use more collars simply because the call costs so much you\u2019ve got to do something to offset it. So, you\u2019ll continue to see us take that strategy going forward and we feel very good about kind of where we sit from a fuel hedging perspective in the sense of insurance.", "Again, we\u2019re not trying to be on prices we\u2019re just trying to take some volatility out of the business and make sure we\u2019re protected as well as get the benefit as much of upside as we can when fuel prices come down. But, you do hit a point where it becomes too expensive just to buy calls and you\u2019ve got to use some collars. ", "Hunter Keay \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "With some of the hedges that you guys have that may be deeply out of the money right now have you considered maybe unwinding some of those if it is at all possible? Or, do you feel better just holding on to that just in case because of the volatility component of it?", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "Well, I think there\u2019s two pieces, one there\u2019s a volatility component. Two, where there\u2019s a call that\u2019s way out of the money, there\u2019s not much value to unwinding it. Where there\u2019s a collar that\u2019s way out of the money you are in effect taking a hedge off because as prices go back up you\u2019ll come back on that collar and so we have not looked other than for instance a bankrupt counterparty we have not spent any time considering taking collars off.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan", "Larry, a quick question, Mark [Streeter] and I were actually wondering on the United courtship whether the improved profit outlook has made the waters any more conducive to possibly taking that relationship beyond just the Star participation level?", "Lawrence W.

As you look I think that has forced us \u2013 you believe a route will work at those kind of jet fuel prices, jet fuel under $100 a barrel works a lot better. Fuel is still a huge cost for us.

It is a bit different environment in that we\u2019ve been through round after round after round of cost containment, doing things more productively, using technology more productively and I think we\u2019ve done actually at Continental a fine job of doing that.", "So, I think entering in to this recession is a tad different in that not only have we had capacity come out before the recession but I think we\u2019re entering it with a set of costs that\u2019s lower than we\u2019ve had before.", "Dan McKenzie \u2013 Credit Suisse", "One last very quickie here, can you talk about the flexibility to reschedule debt coming due next year?", "Jerry Laderman ", "The flexibility to reschedule it in terms of refinancing debt?", "Dan McKenzie \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes, the principal debt coming due next year, I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s even something you\u2019re thinking about?", "Jerry Laderman ", "We always think about our debt positions. Some of that debt, just like this year is related to aircraft and this year as some of that aircraft debt matured we refinanced it. Obviously with credit markets the way they are we\u2019ll have to look very closely at what opportunities exist. But, a good chunk of that debt is aircraft related so we would look at opportunities to refinance it.", "Ned Walker ", "I think we\u2019re ready to go ahead and switch over to the media portion of the Q&A.

First, Miss Foxhall. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.", "Nene Foxhall", "", "Thanks John. Good morning everyone. Joining us here in Houston are Continental Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Larry Kellner; President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Smisek; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Zane Rowe; Executive Vice President of Marketing, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President of Operations Mark Moran, and Senior Vice President Finance and Treasurer Jerry Laderman, to discuss Continental\u2019s Q4 and full-year 2008 financial results.", "First, Larry will make some overview comments, after which Jeff Smisek will review our capacity and revenue results. Zane Rowe will follow with the discussion of Continental\u2019s cost-structure and balance sheets. At that point, we will open the call for questions. We have planned about 20 minutes for the executive comments and then 25 for analyst questions. At the conclusion of the analyst questions, we\u2019ll begin a 15-minute question and answer session for the media. We would appreciate it if each of you would limit your questions to one, with one follow-up. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to DeAnne.", "DeAnne Gabel", "Thank you Nene. Earlier today, we issued an update for investors presenting information relating to our financial and operation outlook for the Q4 and full-year 2009 and other information. This investor update was included in a filing with the SEC and can be found on our website under the investor relations section. ", "Please note that today we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures, such as net loss excluding special items. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures to be discussed can be located on Continental's website, at contintental.com under the Investor Relations section.", "Our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements that are not limited to historical fact, but reflect the company\u2019s current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events. All forward-looking statements, involvements and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. For examples of such risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors set forth in the company\u2019s 2007 10-K and its other security filings. With that, here\u2019s Larry.", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "", "Thank you, Nene and DeAnne. Again, good morning and thanks for joining us. I want to start by thanking my coworkers who did a great job operating under some very tough conditions this past quarter. I specifically want to thank the crew of flight 1404 that went off the runway in Denver on December 20th. We\u2019re grateful for the quick actions to safely evacuate all the customers on board with no life-threatening injuries. Our top priority is to continue to work closely with passengers and crew members who need assistance. In addition, we\u2019re cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board in their investigation to determine the probable cause of the accident. ", "Looking back at 2008, the environment was very challenging throughout the year. Crude oil prices were extremely [bubable], peaking as high as $147 per barrel in July, and then dropping to a low of $32 per barrel in December. Add in the revenue environment deteriorating as the economy weakened, and you have an operating backdrop that rivaled any we\u2019ve seen in our industry for many years. ", "However, this backdrop also provided a stimulus for change in our industry. The major network carriers kept their domestic capacity to deal with high-yield prices, which put the industry in a much better position to cope with an economic downturn. ", "We now turn to our 2008 financial results. With the full-year 2008, we reported a net loss of $351 million, or diluted loss per share of $3.32, excluding $234 million of previously announced special items. Including special items, Continental reported a net loss of $585 million, or loss of $5.54 per diluted share.", "For Q4, Continental reported a net loss of $96 million, or a loss of $0.84 per diluted share, excluding $187 million of previously announced special items. Including those special items, we reported a net loss of $266 million, or a loss of $2.33 per diluted share for the quarter.", "Jeff and Zane will talk about our revenue and costs in more detail; however, I want to comment on fuel hedging as there continues to be a lot of discussion and questions about it. Over the last year, we\u2019ve been widely viewed as either not having enough fuel hedges, or having too many. We don\u2019t use hedging to make bets on the price of oil. Instead, we use it to help us remove some of the volatility from our business. We view this cost much like we would view an insurance policy. In addition, our fuel efficiency continues to be our best hedge against future fuel price volatility. ", "Looking to next year, as Jeff will share in more detail, the revenue outlook is not encouraging. However, we\u2019re benefitting from lower fuel prices, and together with the improvements to our cost structure we\u2019ve already made, and plan to continue to make, we remain competitively well positioned. ", "This year, in addition to efficiently managing the business and our cash, and appropriately responding to changes in the operating environment, we will be focused on successfully transitioning from the Sky Team Alliance to the Star Alliance. In June 2008, we announced plans for extensive cooperation with United Airlines and Star Alliance, linking our networks and services worldwide to deliver new benefits to our customers. ", "We want to make our transition from Sky Team to the Star Alliance as customer-friendly as possible, for both our customers and those of the Sky Team Alliance. We\u2019ll be working hard with our partners at Sky Team and our future partners at Star to make that happen. Continental intends to end this participation with the Sky Team Alliance after the last scheduled flight on September 24th of this year, 2009. ", "We continue to work through the details of our planned exit from Sky Team, and entering the Star Alliance, but anticipate that our participation with Star Alliance will begin promptly after we leave Sky Team. We\u2019re committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for our customers and for our airline partners at both Sky Team and Star Alliance. We will keep you updated as we move forward.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff and Zane, to discuss the quarter\u2019s operational revenue and cost performance details.", "Jeffery A. Smisek ", "Thank you Larry. I want to join Larry in thanking my coworkers for their dedication and commitment to running a good operation under difficult conditions. During Q4, our employees earned incentive payments for on-time performance in the months of October and November. Unfortunately, December was another matter. It was a tough month from an operations viewpoint. Not only were we hit with an unusual number of severe storms across the country, we also had to deal with a rare snowstorm in Houston; the severity and duration of which exceeded our planning forecasts. It was the earliest recorded snowfall in Houston since WWII. ", "The weather caused extensive mainline and regional flight cancellations and delays, including numerous lengthy delays on the tarmac in Houston. Our team worked hard to deal with the unexpected storm, but we did not perform to our normal high standard of operational excellence. We apologize for the inconvenience our customers suffered. We have revived operational procedures, and are improving our de-icing capabilities in Houston to prevent this from recurring. ", "Finally, we are implementing a new internal policy for 2009, whereby we will give customers the opportunity to get off an airplane during tarmac delays in excess of 3 hours; subject, of course, to making sure we can do that safely. ", "Unfortunately, difficult weather wasn\u2019t the only challenge we faced during the quarter. Beginning in October, we began to see a negative revenue impact from a weakening economic backdrop. Despite this in Q4, we achieved RASM gains in all our mainline entities. Mainline RASM for Q4 was up 5.9%, driven by yield increases as load factors were just slightly down year-over-year. Regional yield was also up slightly, but those factors were down 2.6 points resulting in regional RASM decrease of 2%. ", "Turning to the first quarter outlook. In general, our close-end bookings inside of 14 days have been softer, as we see a continuing degradation of business bookings. Just a reminder, in Q1 we\u2019ll see an adverse impact in the shift of the Easter holidays to April this year versus March of last year. ", "In addition to weakness in business yield and bookings impacting our mainline domestic operations, we started seeing some weakness in leisure yields as well. During peak periods, leisure yields are holding up relatively well, but we\u2019re seeing negative pressure on leisure yields and traffic in the non-peak period. This is driving deeper industry sale fare discounts in particular markets, as well as sale fares with travel bases extended through May, instead of March like we\u2019d typically see at this time of year. ", "Internationally, we\u2019re seeing a significant degradation of front cabin RASM, with a combination of lower front cabin yields, and load factor. Our transatlantic operation is suffering the most from this phenomenon. The back cabin is holding up much better, as many international business travelers appear to have shifted their flying from the front to the back. That said, the relevant strength in the back isn\u2019t overcoming the weakness in the front. ", "This is a time when we\u2019re grateful for our relatively lower percentage of business first seats, versus coach seats, compared to our competitors. Or put another way, we\u2019re really grateful to be flying so many 757-200\u2019s to Europe. ", "We expect that our load factors will be down year-over-year in all international regions during the first quarter. Again, with our transatlantic operations hit hardest, as we expect load factor there to be down about 6 points year-over-year. We continue to tweak our domestic and international capacity to match the operating environment, and have pulled down, or will be pulling down additional capacity in several markets to reduce frequencies, equipments downgrades, day of week reductions, seasonal reductions, or in some cases, market exits. ", "Fuel surcharges are also dropping considerably from their peak in September last year. That said, fuel is materially cheaper for us now, as well. Our long-haul international flights benefit disproportionately from lower fuel costs, as fuel constitutes a relatively higher proportion of the overall trip cost from those flights. ", "As dismaying as the revenue outlook appears, the cost side of the equation certainly looks a lot better with crude oil about $100 a barrel lower than it was for much of last year. While we would prefer a healthier economic backdrop and stronger international front cabin yields and traffic, as I said earlier, we do have a much smaller percentage of our international seats allocated to the front cabin than our network peers. This should benefit us on a relative performance basis.", "Looking at our 6-week advanced bookings, consolidated domestic booked seat factor for the next six weeks is running one to two points ahead of last year, as we\u2019re being more open with our domestic inventory than we were at this time last year. ", "Mainland bookings are running one to two points behind last year; transatlantic bookings are running 6 to 7 points behind last year, and Pacific bookings are running 2 to 3 points behind last year. For the full first quarter, we expect both our consolidated and mainline load factors to be down approximately 3.5 points year-over-year. ", "As we\u2019ll be reporting our January traffic in just a couple of days, I want to give you a preview of what to expect. We anticipate consolidated RASM will be down 4.5% to 6.5%, and we expect mainline RASM will be down 3% to 5%. We will fine tune these ranges next Monday in our traffic release. ", "For Q1 we expect mainline capacity to be down 7.4% compared to Q1 2008. With mainline domestic capacity down 12.1%, and mainline international capacity down 2.8%, we expect regional capacity will be down 2.6%. For the full year 2009, we expect our mainline capacity will be down 3.5 to 4.5% year-over-year, with our mainline domestic capacity down 6 to 7%, and our mainline international capacity down from 1 to 2%. ", "This includes the effect of our new non-stop service to Shanghai from New York that starts in late March. Whilst it\u2019s only one route, once a day, given the length of the flight, it will add about 2% of system ASM\u2019s on a run rate basis. ", "I want to close by saying that we\u2019ll remain responsive to changes in the demand environment. There continues to be a tremendous uncertainty surrounding the economic environment, and how our industry will be affected. We are blessed to be in an industry where, as demand has fallen, our single largest expense item \u2013 fuel \u2013 has fallen materially as well. ", "That said, times are tough. As Larry mentioned last quarter, we don\u2019t want to overreact by going guard-rail to guard-rail. But we also won\u2019t shy away from making additional difficult decisions if that\u2019s what\u2019s necessary to achieve sustained profitability. We remain committed to achieving sustained profitability as we intend to take whatever action is necessary to deliver that for our shareholders and our co-workers. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Zane Rowe. ", "Zane Rowe", "", "Thanks, Jeff, and again thank all of you for joining us this morning. I join Larry and Jeff in voicing appreciation to the entire Continental team. 2008 certainly seemed to have more than its fair share of challenges, but everyone stayed focused on running the business ambitiously and delivering excellent service to our customers.", "Throughout the year, we continued our company-wide efforts to control costs. For the full year 2008, our mainline CASM holding fuel rate constant and excluding special items was down 1.5% year-over-year. In Q4, with our mainline capacity down 8%, CASM was up 3% year-over-year, holding fuel rate constant and excluding special items.", "While overall, we are pleased with our performance in Q4, we recognize that with capacity coming out, there\u2019s going to be continued pressure on unit costs. Historically, we\u2019ve done a good job at controlling costs, and our emphasis in this area will continue. ", "Excluding special items for Q1 2009, we expect both our consolidated CASM and mainline CASM to be down 6.5% to 7% year-over-year. For the full year 2009, we expect both our consolidated CASM and mainline CASM to be down 10% to 11% year-over-year. ", "Excluding special items and holding fuel rate constant, we expect Q1 consolidated CASM to be up 2.5% to 3% year-over-year, with the mainline number up 3% to 3.5% year-over-year. For the full year, excluding special items and holding fuel rate constant, we expect both our consolidated and mainline CASM to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year. ", "We expect to see some cost pressure on various line items, but the biggest driver from the unit cost respective will be wages, salaries and benefits. This is primarily driven by higher pension expense, which will be about $150 million higher than it was last year, excluding special settlement charges. ", "The pension expense increase is mostly due to the decline in asset performance. On a cash basis, we expect to contribute approximately $125 million this year to our pension plan; $50 million of which we contributed earlier this month. Further details regarding Q1 and full year 2009 guidance can be found in our investor update, published this morning, which is posted on our website.", "Turning to fuel, it\u2019s a welcome relief to be discussing lower fuel prices for a change. Based on the forward curve as of the beginning of this week, and included in our current hedge position, we estimate our fuel expense for 2009 will be about $2 billion lower year-over-year. To put that in perspective, that\u2019s equivalent to about 15% of our 2008 passenger revenue. ", "Based on our current hedge position, we estimate our Q1 fuel price, including taxes, will be about $1.99 per gallon. This includes a negative impact of $0.33 per gallon, driven by our Q1 hedge position. For the full year, we estimate fuel price including taxes will be $2.13 per gallon. This includes a negative impact of $0.25 per gallon, driven by our current hedge position.", "Regarding our fleet. This year we plan to take delivery of 13 new Boeing 737-900ER aircraft, one of which was delivered earlier this month. Next year, we plan to take delivery of two new Boeing 777 aircraft, and 11 new Boeing 737 aircraft. ", "Last quarter we mentioned we were in negotiations to lease 4 additional 757-300 aircraft. We have agreed to take these aircraft at attractive lease rates. We currently expect to place these in service in the first half of 2010. The 757-300 is an excellent aircraft for high-density, low-yield markets, as it\u2019s one of our lowest CASM aircraft. ", "Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We ended 2008 with $2.6 billion of undistributed cash in short-term investments, and expect to end Q1 with approximately $2.6 billion as well. As of January 26, we had $187 million of cash collateral posted with our fuel hedge counterparty. ", "We\u2019re currently working on the financing for this year\u2019s new aircraft. As previously disclosed, 3 of the 13 aircraft will be financed by the WTC transaction we closed almost two years ago. Whilst we have backstop financing available for the remaining 10 aircraft, there appears to be some money available in the debt market to finance new aircraft. ", "Jerry and his team have been traveling the globe searching for alternative financing opportunities. Credit spreads will clearly be higher than we\u2019ve seen in the last few years, although the impact is somewhat mitigated by the low interest rate environment.", "Like every other industry right now, we have a close eye on capital expenditures [inaudible] the business, and in projects that offer a good return. Our current estimate for cash capital expenditures this year will be about $400 million. That\u2019s fairly evenly between fleet and non-fleet. If you include net purchase deposits paid, [rotable] parts and capitalized interests, the total is about $530 million. ", "We do have discretion regarding the timing of several of our capital projects planned for 2009. Should economic conditions warrant, we will scale back our capital expenditures, and can do that without materially impacting our operation. In conclusion, while we see significant benefits in the year-over-year reduction of oil prices, the macroeconomic slowdown is clearly putting pressure on revenue. As we make appropriate adjustments to our schedule to match demand, we will continue to aggressively pursue efficiencies in the business and manage our costs appropriately. While we expect 2009 to be a challenging year, we believe our industry leading product, our revenue premium, and cost control will help us achieve our goal of sustained profitability.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Larry.", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "Thank you, Jeff and Zane. There are many challenges ahead in 2009. There will also be opportunities for us to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. We will continue to make appropriate changes to our network in light of the changing demand environment, keeping in mind that we\u2019re in business for the long haul.", "With the decline in premium yielding business first traffic on our international market, meaning reduced contributions to the system as a whole, these markets remain good businesses and we do receive a significant benefit from lower fuel costs on our longer haul international routes.", "While we continue to lose money in our domestic operation, there is a certain tension between our domestic results and the need to keep a proper balance between the scope and scale of our domestic and international operations. We need a properly sized domestic network to provide necessary fee and schedule utility and have sufficient market presence to make sure that our regular domestic customers choose Continental when they decide to take an international trip as well.", "That said, we\u2019ll continue to examine our options and remain committed to achieving sustained profitability. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities joining Star Alliance presents us. We\u2019re focused on making the transition go smoothly and have confidence as our team as we successfully accomplish the task. ", "Whatever challenges lie ahead, we\u2019re going to stay focused on the basics of our business, providing clean, safe, and reliable air transportation. We\u2019ve got the best team in the business and we\u2019ll work together to succeed in this tough operating environment. ", "I want to close by again thanking my coworkers. They make it happen every day. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to DeAnne to begin our Q&A.", "DeAnne Gabel ", "Thank you, Larry. With that, we\u2019ll begin the question and answer session for the analysts, followed by the question and answer session for the media. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from William Greene from Morgan Stanley.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Larry, I have a question for you on your ASM target growth rates. In the past you\u2019ve said you target 5% to 7% and you're saying that the international now is slowing, and so you\u2019re running a little bit lower than that given what\u2019s going on in the economy and that makes sense. How fast could you ramp that up if you saw a turn and if international really started to slow in a big way, how fast could you pull more out of international? What\u2019s the lead time or I guess the lag time to when you decide and when you can get that in?", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "Let me break that into a couple of pieces. First, we continue to have a long term goal that we should be growing 5% to 7 % a year. We\u2019re the fourth largest carrier in what\u2019s very much a network business and so it\u2019s important that we stay competitive. Having said that, between the delays in the 787 and the economy, it makes sense to put that on hold for not just this year but probably a couple of years. ", "We need to get the balance lag bodies up on a long term basis. We continue to believe in the international markets over the long term, and so we keep that goal for the long term, but I wouldn\u2019t expect to see growth of any substantial amount over the next couple of years based on what we see in the economy or the marketplace and we need to get the 787 to really help us move that plan forward. Clearly we\u2019d expected to take our first 787 next month and so between the delay of those and the economy, that pushes our plan back. ", "As you look at the other side of your question, which is if things got worse, how fast can we pull stuff out of the international markets, they are clearly more difficult because a lot of the markets you only fly once a day. But we\u2019ll continue to look at the markets we fly multiple times, we\u2019ll also continue to look at day of week. It doesn\u2019t make much sense to take something out without at least a couple of months notice because you\u2019ve started to sell it to a point where it\u2019s very difficult to recon it, so there\u2019s clearly a two to three month minimum reaction time to kind of put significant changes in place. If you watched last summer, we announced some stuff in June that we didn\u2019t put in until September, and from a booking standpoint, international tends to book a little bit ahead of domestic, especially in some of the back cabin stuff. So you probably have a little longer lead time than you do in domestic, so it\u2019s not a year but it\u2019s probably a 3 or 4 months on the international front, but again it\u2019s tough because there\u2019s not... Our international business is still pretty solid, it\u2019s just less profitable than it used to be, and so we\u2019ll be very careful at how we look at our adjustments there.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "So if we looked at sort of seat count in domestic versus international, would it show a different picture in capacity because of the stage length for international? ", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "Clearly we\u2019ve got a lot more seats in domestic than we do in international which is much longer haul but we tend to look at the business more on a balanced ASM perspective which we\u2019re close to 50-50 at the moment. But our seats are much more domestic than they are international, especially when you add in the regional flying as well. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "What I more meant was the year-over-year change in seat count. Because you\u2019re cutting a lot of domestic, but not that much international, but I think it\u2019s safe to assume that international is probably going to slow a lot from here, so maybe it\u2019s that the ASM change is sort of skewing that capacity cut. ", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "That\u2019s correct. The ASMs will clearly make it look more international from a seat then it is as you look at the number of seats coming out of those markets because they are longer haul flights, but again, I think we\u2019ll continue to watch as we go forward. What I can tell you is this is at least since 9/11 the most volatile market we\u2019ve seen and the most difficult to predict in, and so I\u2019m going to be cautious about predicting too far forward. There\u2019s a lot of both physical policy and stimulus going on and I think we have not seen the impact of that hit the economy and when you look at scale, when it hits the economy, it could be significant, and so it makes it difficult to see very far out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Stifel Nicolaus.", "Hunter Keay \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Given the continuing fall in energy prices, what kind of demand degradation have you guys seen from your corporate energy customers out of Houston?", "Jim Compton", "We spend a lot of time, the sales force has constantly worked with all of our corporations and so forth, and I think I wouldn\u2019t have an absolute number, so kind of the feedback we\u2019re getting from our travel partners and their managers is a little... it\u2019s somewhat across the board in the sense that quite frankly that some are not flying in terms of policy, some are having to have people sign off, others are saying it\u2019s essential travel and so forth. I think across all sectors we see a little bit of all of that so I would add that even into some of the... typically the oil companies that you mentioned specifically. But across the board, if you weigh it all in, there\u2019s this certain kind of wait and see that both Larry and Jeff talked about kind of in the economy has been watching real time what\u2019s happening in the economy, so it\u2019s really across the board and some are traveling, some you need to get permission to travel, and some are actually holding travel back. ", "Lawrence W. Kellner ", "I would just add to that that the volatility I think for us is a huge problem, as I talked to the oil companies, it\u2019s a huge problem. If they thought they had a stable price going forward, even while $40 seems low in comparison to last summer\u2019s $147, five years ago I think if you\u2019d have told the oil companies you had it at $40 a barrel, they would have viewed that very positively. So I think part of the challenge for everybody, us and the oil companies, is the volatility. Is it going back to $100 or $150 or is it going back down to $20?

You\u2019re getting less bang for your buck probably as you shrink and it could compromise your system.

Let me tell you, we are committed to doing what we need to do to be a successful business and have long term sustained profitability.

We would fully acknowledge that and we gave where we think we\u2019ll be for January.

That said, I just want to make sure that we all continue to focus. Our international business continues to be a very good business.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference call is being Webcast and recorded Tuesday July 21, 2009. I would now like to turn the call over to Nene Foxhall, Senior Vice President of Communications and Public Affairs. Miss Foxhall, you may begin.", "Nene Foxhall", "", "Thank you, Anthony. Good morning everyone. Joining us here in Houston are Continental\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Larry Kellner; President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Smisek; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Zane Rowe; Executive Vice President Marketing, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President Operations, Mark Moran; and Senior Vice President Finance and Treasurer, Jerry Laderman, to discuss Continental\u2019s second quarter 2009 financial results.", "Larry will begin with some overview comments, followed by Jeff\u2019s review of our capacity and revenue results. Zane will follow with a discussion of Continental\u2019s cost structure and balance sheet. At that point we will open the call for questions. We plan 20 minutes for the executive comments and then 25 minutes for analysts\u2019 questions. At the conclusion of the analysts\u2019 questions, we will begin a 15-minute question-and-answer session for the media. We would appreciate it if each of you would limit your questions to one with one follow up. ", "With that, I will turn it over to Deanne. ", "DeAnne", "", "Thanks, Nene. Earlier today we issued an update for investors presenting information relating to our financial and operational outlook for the third quarter and full year 2009 and other information. This investor update was included in the filing with the SEC. ", "Today we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures such as net loss excluding special items. Please note that reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, as well as the Investor Update can be found on our website at continental.com under the Investor Relations section. In addition, our discussions today may contain forward-looking statements that are not limited to historical fact, but reflect the Company\u2019s current beliefs, expectations, or intentions, regarding future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For examples of such risks and uncertainties please see the risk factors set forth in the Company\u2019s 2008 10-K and its other securities filings. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Larry.", "Larry Kellner ", "Thank you, Nene and DeAnne. Good morning and thanks for joining us. ", "I want to start by thanking all of my co-workers for the great job they do every day. The summer load factors have been very high and I know this adds to the daily challenge of running a smooth operation. I appreciate the entire team\u2019s efforts to deliver clean, safe, and reliable air transportation while providing excellent customer service and a high quality product.", "During the quarter we maintained our excellent completion record by achieving a system wide segment completion factor of 99.6% for the quarter. And, we finished first in the DOT on-time monthly performance among the major network carriers in both May and June, earning my co-workers $9 million in cash incentives during the quarter. ", "For the second quarter, Continental reported a net loss of $213 million, or a loss of $1.72 per diluted share. Excluding $44 million of special charges, our net loss was $169 million, or a loss per share of $1.36.", "As Jeff will share in more detail in a moment, these results were adversely affected by significant declines in the number of high yield passengers, as many business travelers curtailed travel or purchased lower yield economy tickets. And unfortunately, while leisure travel remains strong, it was at very low yields.", "While there are indications that our RASM declines have bottomed out, it is at significantly reduced levels. We have benefited from lower fuel prices, but not enough to offset the decline in revenue. We have taken many steps this year to right size the business to better match the demand environment and to maximize revenue and reduce costs. The most difficult of these actions is the elimination of approximately 1,700 positions that we announced today. We will make every effort to minimize the number of involuntary furloughs and reductions in force. ", "For me, this was a very tough, but necessary decision. Our future depends on us doing the difficult things required to remain competitive in the market place.", "In addition to right sizing the business and running an efficient operation, we are focused on maintaining our long-term strategic position. This includes launching service to strategic locations such as Shanghai, and being in a global alliance that is the best fit for us, and we are well on our way to doing just that. We were pleased to receive approval from the DOT of our Star Alliance application earlier this month. This will better position us to continue as an effective global competitor.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jeff and Zane, as we announced last week, at the end of the year I will be returning to private equity and Jeff will be taking the reigns as Chairman and CEO. Jeff is the right choice to successfully lead Continental into the future. He is a strong and effective leader. He has been my partner during my time as CEO and has been key part of every major decision that has taken place at Continental during his more than 14 years here.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff and Zane to discuss this quarter\u2019s operational revenue and cost performance details.", "Jeff Smisek ", "Thanks Larry. I join Larry and the rest of the management team in thanking our co-workers for a job well done. We have been running a very high load factor, which put additional stress on the system and our team has done an impressive job running a good operation and delivering great service. The revenue environment remains challenging. For the second quarter main line RASM was down 16.9% and regional RASM was down 20.5%, coupled with our consolidated capacity decrease during the quarter of 7.8% year-over-year. This resulted in passenger revenue being down 24.2% year-over-year. During the quarter we continue to see industry fare sales designed to stimulate traffic, which they did, resulting in very high load factors. Unfortunately, the high load factors were generated by low fares and thus weak yields.", "The year-over-year drop in business revenue in June was slightly better than what we saw in April and May, although it is still significantly down, with business revenue down 35% year-over-year versus down 38% year-over-year in both April and May. The number of business passengers was down 27% year-over-year in June versus down 36% in April and down 34% in May. So, we do think the drop off in business travel has stabilized, although clearly it is stabilizing at a low level. Slides showing monthly changes year-to-date through June are on our website on the Investor Relations section. ", "We expect to see continued pressure on yields until the industry capacity is appropriately resized to meet the reduced demand, or until demand itself picks up again. Although the economic environment doesn\u2019t appear to be improving yet, it also doesn\u2019t appear to be getting much worse, and there is some good news in that we are seeing international carriers cutting capacity, which didn\u2019t occur at significant levels when the industry was going through its fuel price crisis last year.", "Second quarter main line yields decreased 18.3% year-over-year and load factor increased 1 \u00bd points. Regional yields declines accounted for substantially all of the year-over-year RASM declines of 20.5% year-over-year.", "We estimate that the H1N1 flu reduced second quarter consolidated passenger revenue by approximately $50 million. We are closely monitoring the impact of H1N1 in regions currently experiencing their winter season, such as South America, and in particular Argentina, where we have seen recent outbreaks. We will be responsive should we need to take temporary capacity adjustments in Argentina or other regions as the winter flu season sets in.", "Now turning to the third quarter outlook, across all regions of the business we expect to see pricing pressure similar to what we saw in the second quarter. That is, we expect to see carriers heavily discounting leisure fares to back fill the lack of business traffic with leisure traffic. There have been a lot of industry fare sales so far this summer and those fare sales have been at a steep discount. ", "Some carriers have already announced deeply discounted fare sales for targeted periods of weakness in the fall in an attempt to fill seats that have historically been filled with business traffic. Unless we see a rebound in business traffic, we expect that this trend will continue. ", "We still have a week and a half left in the month and things could change, but based on the data thus far, we are currently estimating consolidated July RASM will be down 16% to 18% and mainline July RASM will be down 17% to 19% year-over-year.", "We don\u2019t know when a recovery will come and there is a lot of uncertainty about the economic environment, however from the RASM degradation perspective, we do think we have hit the bottom. But, we don\u2019t know how long we will bounce along the bottom and what the rate of decline that will be. Our success is highly correlated with the return of business travel and we haven\u2019t seen signs of that yet. So, while things appear to have stabilized, they have stabilized at low levels. We are committed to right sizing our business to match the demand environment. Today we announced the very difficult step of reducing our workforce as part of that right sizing. That tough decision is just one of the many steps we are taking to help mitigate the down side of a continued weak revenue environment. This was a particularly painful decision for us to make, given the tough employment environment out there and we deeply regret that it was necessary.", "In addition to identifying several new cost savings initiatives, we are rolling out some new revenue generating measures. We expect the aggregate annual run rate of these cost and revenue initiatives, once fully implemented in 2010, will be over $100 million. Some of these initiatives, such as an increase checked bag fee and an increased reservation booking service fee, are being implemented as of today, while others are targeted for implementation this fall. Legally, we can\u2019t give you more details on the future items, but we will announce them as we roll them out. The fact is customer preferences for ala carte choice and thus ala carte pricing are growing. As a result, we are changing to match those preferences while preserving our core brand. We expect to see our ancillary revenues grow over the next year. ", "We have continued to adjust our capacity plans for 2009. We started out the year planning for mainline capacity to be down between 3.5% and 4.5%, but as the economic environment weakened, we responded by pulling additional capacity and now expect that our mainline capacity for the full year will be down 5.6% year-over-year with mainline domestic capacity down 7.7% and mainline international capacity down 3.5%. We expect our regional capacity will be down 7.2% year-over-year.", "Most of our international reduction has been in the Trans-Atlantic region. For the month of June our Trans-Atlantic capacity was down 11.4% year-over-year and in October it will be down nearly 16% year-over-year. While the aggregate Trans-Atlantic capacity of our US network peers was only down about 1.5% year-over-year for the month of June, some US carriers have said they expect to pull additional capacity this fall. In addition, the International carriers are participating in Trans-Atlantic reduction as well, which should help the Trans-Atlantic revenue picture. For the full year 2009, we are expecting our Trans-Atlantic capacities to be down 9.1% year-over-year.", "Although as of now we believe we have responded appropriately with our capacity reductions, given the level of demand, we are monitoring the operating environment closely and will make further adjustments as necessary.", "We are in the peak summer travel season now and while the revenue environment appears to have stabilized, it has done so at low levels on peak summer traffic. We really don\u2019t have visibility yet as to how business and leisure traffic will hold up in the fall. When business traffic does return, it could return quickly, and we are well positioned to take full advantage of that opportunity.", "I am proud to have been chosen to succeed Larry as Chairman and CEO next year. I am committed to maintaining Continental\u2019s working together culture and its award winning product and service, while responding appropriately and timely to changes in the market place. I want all of you to know that I am committed to returning Continental to profitability and sustaining that profitability.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Zane Rowe.", "Zane Rowe", "Thanks, Jeff. I wanted to begin by joining Larry and Jeff in thanking the entire Continental team. It remains a very tough economic environment and our team is doing a good job on staying focused and running and efficient airline.", "Controlling costs has been a long-term focus here at Continental and it is extremely important that we continue to do so as we adjust capacity to manage through this weak economic environment. I am pleased at what we have accomplished, but recognized the need to remain vigilant in seeking ways to operate more efficiently and at a lower cost. ", "Second quarter mainline CASM holding fuel rate constants and excluding special items was up 2.8% year-over-year on a mainline capacity decrease of 7.3%. Much of the year-over-year increase in the second quarter was driven by higher wages, salaries, and benefits, primarily the result of increased pension expense and the higher wage rate. For the full year, excluding special items and holding fuel rate constant, we expect both consolidated and mainline CASM to be up 1.5% to 2% year-over-year.", "With regard to fuel, we continue to see volatile fuel prices. Our current projection, it seems we will pay an average cost of $1.92 per gallon of jet fuel for the full year which equates to a year-over-year savings of over $2.7 billion in the fuel line. For the second quarter our average consolidated fuel price per gallon, including hedge impacts and fuel related taxes, was $2.07, nearly $1.40 lower than what we averaged for the same period last year for a savings of $762 million. ", "We estimate our third quarter consolidated fuel price, including taxes and fuel hedge impacts, will be about $1.91 per gallon. We believe our most efficient hedge is our fuel-efficient fleet and our focus on operational efficiencies. We continue to hedge a portion of our fuel needs to mitigate some of the volatility we have seen in the oil markets. A more comprehensive overview of our hedge position is detailed in the Investor Update. ", "Regarding our fleet financing activity and liquidity, during the second quarter we took delivery of two new Boeing 737-900ER aircraft. We took delivery of one aircraft last week and have six more scheduled for the remainder of the year. In June we successfully priced a $300 million EETC transaction in the public debt market. We were pleased with the execution of the offering and are happy that the capital markets have begun to show signs of life. The proceeds will be used to finance five new 737-900ER aircraft delivering this year and for general corporate purposes. In addition, last week we closed on a debt facility with a commercial bank to finance two new aircraft delivering this quarter, including the aircraft we took delivery of last week. As a result of this facility and the EETC, we have now completed the financing for all of our new aircraft this year, without the need to use any back-stock financing. While we do have back-stock financing available for all of next year\u2019s aircraft, we will engage in our typical process of looking at various financing options for the 2010 delivery.", "With respect to liquidity, we ended the second quarter with $2.77 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. As a percentage of the last 12 months revenue, cash was 20% at the end of the quarter. We expect to end the third quarter with approximately $2.4 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments. ", "Now briefly turning to the balance sheet, our cash CapEx for the second quarter was $71 million and our current estimate for the full year is $336 million. In light of the current economic condition, we continue to closely monitor our capital spending and have scaled back some of our projects and deferred others to a later date. Year-to-date we have contributed $120 million to our defined benefit pension plan. We estimate our remaining minimum funding requirements for this year are approximately $30 million.", "In conclusion, an unfortunate consequence of the current economic environment is the need to reduce capacity to match the weak demand. This necessitated making some tough decision so to right size our business as well as identifying further revenue enhancing and cost saving initiatives. We will focus on delivering on these initiatives as we have in the past, in order to help secure our future and remain competitively well positioned.", "With that I will turn the call back over to Larry.", "Larry Kellner ", "Thank you, Jeff and Zane. ", "The operating environment remains challenging, but the good news is that there are indications that the decline in revenue has stabilized. As Jeff and Zane mentioned, we are focused on maximizing revenue, running an efficient operation, and controlling costs. ", "We have many core strengths: great people, our globally balanced network, our fuel-efficient fleet, and a superb product, as well as great opportunities ahead as we transition to the Star Alliance. We will leverage these strengths to maintain our industry leading position and remain focused on achieving and sustaining profitability. ", "With that, I will turn the call back over to DeAnne to begin our Q&A. ", "DeAnne Gabel", "Thank you, Larry, Jeff, and Zane. With that we will begin the question-and-answer session for the analysts followed by the question-and-answer session for the media. Anthony, if you could please review the Q&A process, we are ready to begin.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jamie Baker of JP Morgan.", "Jamie Baker - JP Morgan ", "My first question is for either Jeff or Larry. Has Continental thought through any response it might make should any of your competitors ultimately turn to Washington for assistance, in the sense of a liquidity nature?", "Jeff Smisek ", "I don\u2019t know that that will occur, but should it occur we are really big believers in a level playing field and that is what we would focus on in that eventuality.", "Jamie Baker - JP Morgan ", "That is helpful and I have a second follow up relating to One Pass. Do you think there is any more borrowing power within that relationship in the form of any further contract extension or forward mileage sale?", "Larry Kellner ", "I think, as always, we will look across our business to see where we can generate additional cash. We tend to talk about it once we have done it, so we are always looking at other parts. We are very happy with the many relationships we have in One Pass, but I always think there are other opportunities, but we will talk about them as we are at a point where we have them.", "", "Jamie Baker - JP Morgan ", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Gary Chase with Barclays Capital.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Congratulations and good luck to both Larry and Jeff.", "We are in a situation now where people are just hyper sensitive to this stuff, so Jeff, if I could, if you could just clarify what you mean by you think the RASM declines are bottoming out. Do you mean based on where you came in for June, is that on a quarterly basis? Are there going to be months where the comps are worse? I just think people are incredibly sensitive to what\u2019s happening at the margin. I want to make sure I understand what you are trying to telegraph.", "Jeff Smisek ", "Sure. I think the best way I would phrase it is right now it is clear we are living on the back of a great deal of leisure demand sparked by extremely low fares. As a result, with the very high load factors we are having, and strong bookings from leisure traffic, we are able to revenue manage the flights. ", "It is difficult for us to see, however, going into September post Labor Day when the kids are returning to school and leisure traffic traditionally falls off, what the business demand will be. I would characterize the stabilization as more of stabilization with respect to very current trends. That is June RASM versus the quarter, because in the quarter we had the positive event of Easter shifting into April this year which slightly distorted upwards the quarters RASM results.", "Larry Kellner ", "I would just add on that you were seeing RASM drop off pretty quickly early in the year, especially as we went through like shifting Easter between March and April and we kind of adjusted for that. What we have seen is that flatten out. We are not saying the world\u2019s getting better, but I think if you look at our business traffic slide you can also see that has kind of stabilized where it was year-over-year. ", "I think there are two questions. One is the Fall and where is business traffic, and two is not to get confused by fourth quarter comparisons, because clearly the comps get easier as you start to lap the troubles of a year ago. So, I think what we are seeing right now is some stability in the revenue environment versus what we saw earlier in the year was that it was falling off at a pretty sharp pace. We are not seeing it get worse and I think the other evidence of that is we are not constantly during the month knocking down our forecast to take more revenue out as the month comes on and future months come on. We have seen a little more stability in our ability to predict as well.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Okay and one for Zane. On the $100 million that you are targeting, it feels to me like the headcount is going to explain the vast majority of that. Is that accurate and if not is there a lot more to go on the revenue side? So, you have announced what the cost side is going to be; the revenue initiative you have announced a few of them. Of the few that you have announced, the increased baggage fee and the booking fee, would that explain the bulk of the rest of that $100 million or are there significant new initiatives that we should expect?", "Zane Rowe", "I would say that there are a number of initiatives and each of the points that you mentioned are part of that. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we can\u2019t talk about the revenue initiatives that we haven\u2019t announced just yet, but it is a fairly balanced assortment of details within the $100. We have pretty much gone across the board once again and challenged every department in the Company with coming up with these savings. I think it is a fairly balanced group of revenue and cost saving initiatives.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "But does the $1,700 hedge out? Does that not get you the majority of the way?", "Zane Rowe", "That is included in the number, but not necessarily the bulk of the number.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from William Greene of Morgan Stanley.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "If we look at the Star transition that is coming up, what are the milestones or target dates that we should watch for? Is there some sort of key cut over where there could be a challenge on the IT side and will there be any sort of revenue hiccups associated with this when you think about it?", "Larry Kellner ", "On key dates with our final flight on October 24 we will leave SkyTeam. We will be in Star just as fast as we can be after that and think days, don\u2019t think weeks or months. We will pick up partners as quickly as we can even before we get in Star. We just can\u2019t do anything until we get out of SkyTeam to jointly market with any of the Star partners, or be involved with any of the Star partners. So, it won\u2019t be seamless in the sense that we cut out of Sky Team on the 24th and go to Star on the 25th. It will be a couple of days in the transition.", "I think that from an IT side there are always challenges, but a lot of that work is done and I feel confident about where we will be. Clearly sitting here today, we are always worried about revenue hiccups as you have IT issues and other things, but we have been focused on this. We have had a significant amount of lead time and I feel good about where we are to transition from SkyTeam to Star. ", "You do have the challenge that until after post the 24th we cannot market or book and meanwhile we won\u2019t be marketing any flights in October or November or after the 24th in SkyTeam. So, you do have a period where you are taking bookings for November and December where you are not yet in Star, but yet you are not marketing SkyTeam carriers. Also, our alliance with codeshares with Delta and Northwest, some dropped off already. They all drop off, essentially, here at the end of July and so we do have a little revenue risk. I think we are managing that as effectively as we can.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Are any of the corporate contracts at risk when you transition?", "Larry Kellner ", "", "We have got some joint contracts, but I think, again, we feel from where we are positioned we don\u2019t feel that is a significant risk for us; a very small risk. ", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "If we look at your capacity points, you have sort of altered them ask we have gone through the year. Can you just sort of talk a little bit about the triggers? Like what causes you to want to cut a little bit more? Is it simply a profit metric? Is it a cash flow metric? Also, what are going to be the things you will watch for when you start to think about when it is time to even add back?", "Larry Kellner ", "A couple of things, one it\u2019s more in the short term. It is much more of a cash metric than it is a profit metric, especially in markets where we thinned out individual days of week on the service where it is just clear that the revenue on that flight is not going to cover the cash expenses of that flight. That is the same approach we used in Mexico with the Swine flu. On a longer-term basis, clearly we do look at profitability and when we have made significant market changes, like getting out of Cologne, we\u2019ve said look we just don\u2019t think this market is going to be profitable on a long-term basis. And, we will look at adding back capacity. In a lot of cases we have gone from seven to six, or seven to five, we will add that capacity back where we think that capacity will cover cash.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Is your guess that airlines will be more likely to sort of jump the gun in hopes that things will get better, or will they wait to see if actually things are getting better before capacity comes back?", "Larry Kellner ", "I would go back to our decision that was very tough for us, where we continue to have to reduce staffing here, or eliminate positions. We had held on for a long time hoping that clearly as we kept nicking away at our capacity plans, we were not making staffing adjustments. I think we have concluded that as you look out to the next year it is going to be pretty tough. You\u2019d have to talk to other carriers for their view, but we had hoped we would see some stability sooner than we have seen it, but we are going to continue to take the appropriate actions to make sure that we are positioned for the future. They are tough, but I don\u2019t see a lot of capacity being added back the next year. I think it will take awhile and I think looking at where the economy is we have just got to plan for that.", "William Greene - Morgan Stanley", "All right, thanks for the help.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Hunter Keay of Stifel Nicolaus. ", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus ", "My question is for Jim. I was wondering if you could maybe outline specifically how you think this move to Star is going to impact the operation at Newark? Pricing aside, I guess I am really more talking in terms of flow in connecting traffic. Do you expect to maybe pick up more connecting flights from international feed, or do you think this is going to be more reflective on the domestic network? What do you think are the main things from a network perspective to watch for at Newark?", "Jim Compton", "Obviously we are very excited about the transition to Star and the way we think about it, take specifically the ark that you are talking about, today as Delta is growing their New York presence some of that kind of activity has become redundant within SkyTeam. So for Star they don\u2019t have that New York player. So we are very excited about the connectivity that we are going to be offering our Star partners to New York. As well as, by the way, the larger network that Star provides our customers around the world also.", "Take that same logic into Houston, with our gateway into Latin America both Mexico, Central America and in the southern cone, again, Star doesn\u2019t have a US player partner for connecting in from the US out of Europe, for instance, to Houston and the Latin America area. Again in SkyTeam has dealt against networks and Atlanta has grown that has also become somewhat redundant, but once again, that is from a network point of view, from a connectivity point of view it is just a so much more powerful network for us and it is a great win, win both for us and for our Star partners; so for our customers as well as the Star carriers in terms of opportunity that they don\u2019t have today.", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Okay, great thanks, and a question for Jeff and of course Larry feel free to join in too. Jeff, what are the characteristics in a hypothetical airline that you would look for in assessing a potential merger partner and acquisition target? Maybe just more broadly, maybe outside the lines of just say network implications, what are the characteristics that you look for in terms of what would be a good fit for Continental?", "Jeff Smisek ", "That is a pretty hypothetical question there Hunter. I think that the characteristics of any kind of partner for a merger or for an alliance are actually quite similar. You look for something that adds to your network, because we are in a network business. Ideally you look for a carrier that had costs that were similar to yours, so you wouldn\u2019t have disparate cost differences. Ideally you would look for a carrier that had culture that was similar to our own culture, because we have something that is quite special here at Continental that we think brings enormous benefit to our customers and ultimately to our shareholders.", "Clearly you look at the financing arrangements and the amount of debt on the balance sheet, all the things you would do in any transaction you would look at. But, network complimentarily would be helpful. There is a theory that you would want maximum overlap so that you are taking out capacity et cetera, but that is a little hard to get through the Department of Justice and this Department of Justice appears to be a tad more aggressive than that of the prior administration. Beyond that hypothetical I am not prepared to speak any more, because it is only a hypothetical. ", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Of course, all right, great, thanks guys. I appreciate it. ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mike Linenberg of Bank of America. ", "Mike Linenberg - Bank of America", "I know you have answered several questions on Star. With respect to the four-way JV though, how should we look at when that should be up and running? Is that 2010, and I am talking about you with tons of United, Air Canada, is that something that will be up and running in early 2010, or is that going to take some time? Also, when should we anticipate seeing the benefits from that?", "Larry Kellner ", "I think the key is we didn\u2019t get our Justice Department approval until just a week and a half ago. So, last week we were able to have the first discussions about how we\u2019d roll that out. As soon as we are ready to give you more detail we will. Again, I think we are always careful not to get ahead of ourselves here. We are excited about it. It has got a lot of benefit, but it is also a lot of work and so we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do yet to get that in place, both to agree on exactly how the JV will be structured. We have the framework for it, but we\u2019ve got a lot of details to work out. Then you have all the implementation issues as well. So, I think we aren\u2019t yet ready to project when we will be up and running with the JV, but we are excited to have our approval.", "I want to thank everybody who worked so hard on that. All the congressional support we got and also the Department of Transportation for their efforts. We are very pleased with what they issued. But, again, it took awhile and so I think that puts us in a position where right now we are doing the hard work and hopefully by next quarters call we will have a little better handle on that.", "Mike Linenberg - Bank of America", "Okay fair enough. My second question is when I think about assets that you can ultimately pledge as collateral, if we think about the fact that Newark is now a capped airport. I realize that is on a temporary basis. Is there an opportunity down the road that those caps, whether they are temporary or become permanent, that down the road they may be viewed as slot\u2019s that could be pledged as collateral for financing? Is there an opportunity there or is that just wishful thinking on my part?", "Larry Kellner ", "I think that is hard to answer, because clearly if you look at history, once an airport became fully slot controlled on a long time basis, even some airports in the US those slots were finance able. Since these are temporary camps I really wouldn\u2019t put them in that bucket, but I think what we need to see is, kind of, what is the long-term process. Clearly, we need to fix the air traffic control system in New York so we can get more traffic through there, because right now while our on time performance in May and June among the network majors was first, we still had huge issues in Newark. Newark has been consistently, of the major airports, at the bottom of the list. ", "So, I think our primary focus is to figure out how to fix the airport so it can handle more capacity. If we end up with slots on a long-term basis that is an issue we will address when we get there. Right now they are temporary and I think our number one goal is to get the ATC system.", "Mike Linenberg - Bank of America", "Okay, very good. Thank you. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Bob McAdoo of Avondale Partners.", "Bob McAdoo - Avondale Partners", "You talked some about the Trans-Atlantic capacity being down this fall whatever. Are all those changes in the computers now, have they been for the last few weeks, or are there more changes to be announced in terms of to really get you to the numbers that you gave us today?", "Jim Compton", "All of those capacity reductions would be reflected in the GDSs also.", "Bob McAdoo - Avondale Partners", "Okay and then the 1,700 people that are coming out, are those tied to capacity changes, or are those kind of overhead changes that you are making?", "Jim Compton", "It is a mix of both. There are some management and clerical, there is also across very ford groups in addition. We have had some very difficult decisions to make throughout the year. We have seen a reduction in call volumes and we have made reductions already in our reservation staffing. We have also out [culled] some from our flight attendants. So, some of it is flight volume driven, but there is also a piece of it that is overhead driven. In fact a very important piece of it is overhead driven and we have got to continue to work all fronts here.", "Bob McAdoo - Avondale Partners", "Okay and then educate me a little bit on the anti-trust immunity. We all talk about what it allows you to do internationally. Do you have anti-trust immunity in terms of talking about the domestic issues, domestic schedules, and things like that with United or is this simply limited to international?", "Jim Compton", "Oh we wish. No, no, the anti-trust approval only applies to our international operations and to the domestic portion of international journeys. But we absolutely do not have anti-trust immunity with respect to domestic operations and we are keenly aware of that, and we will of course be very careful to make sure that we don\u2019t go astray.", "Bob McAdoo - Avondale Partners", "So in terms of the value of some kind of merger with United or somebody, the fact that you have got anti-trust immunity from the domestic side doesn\u2019t reduce the beauty of being able to do something with the merger is what you are saying.", "Jim Compton", "Well it doesn\u2019t apply to domestic operation that is correct.", "Bob McAdoo - Avondale Partners", "I understand. Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie of Next Generation Equity Research.", "Dan McKenzie - Next Generation Equity Research ", "Jeff, I believe you mentioned in your remarks that you expect to see some pressure on yields until capacity is right sized or demand comes back. I am wondering what you believe happens first. If capacity needs to be right sized, I am just wondering what kind of right sizing you are thinking might need to potentially take place.", "Jeff Smisek ", "Dan, that is hard to know. I will tell you that we are seeing some good signs. Particularly right now the international operations have been pretty adversely affected. Trans-Atlantic, Pacific, and it has bled into Latin America as well. Last year the international carriers didn\u2019t really participate much in the fuel crisis downsizing. The US carriers, I think, reacted more aggressively. Now we are seeing the global aspect of the recession and we are seeing carriers across the globe cut capacity in many of our international markets and that is a very positive thing. ", "I think people will cut capacity to match the demand and ultimately we all need higher yields than we are getting because of the yields that we are getting, the demand we are getting, most all carriers are losing money and clearly that is not sustainable.", "The way I would best characterize it is we will know it when we see it when it comes to the correct amount of capacity coming out, given the level of demand. Demand is moving. There are some positive signs in the economy that I read about every day. I keep waiting for more and more green chutes and I have no doubt that we will ultimately climb out of the recession and demand will increase and that will be beneficial, but I think all carriers are facing very similar pressures and they are reacting in similar ways, as you would expect, to meet those pressures.", "Larry Kellner ", "I would just add in that while we have known for a couple of months that the sale fare environment was very low, we have seen more demand at that level than we expected. I think the positive is we are at a point where we are running very high load factors here at the end of June and in July and I think that is a sign that the demand is clearly there at the sale fare level we are at and it is more demand than we expected at that level. Our revenue management systems have kicked in.", "I think the big question is we saw this high correlation to schools getting out and that demand level kicking in and so where is demand going to be in the fall? The real big question for us is when does business traffic come back and at what volume? So while it stabilized and was a little better in June year-over-year, we have still got a long ways to go on business traffic and that is the most important element in kind of stabilizing the revenue situation.", "Dan McKenzie - Next Generation Equity Research ", "", "I understand. Okay then there has been so much talk about Star that I will follow up with yet even one more question. I believe you guys previously placed the incremental revenue benefit of joining Star over SkyTeam at $100 million, but if I am not mistaken that was before any trust or JV immunity here. Now that you have that I am wondering how you are thinking about quantifying that benefit.", "Larry Kellner ", "The $100 million is right. That is the benefit we reaped merely from moving SkyTeam to Star without anti-trust or without a JV. Now that we have anti-trust and are working on the JV again, we just got that, so let us see how we end up on the JV. I think we have always been willing, once we have a plan in place, to kind of lay out what we think it\u2019s worth. But, I think step one for us here is to get the plan in place with regard to the JV, all of the details in place, before we start talking about what we think it is worth.", "Dan McKenzie - Next Generation Equity Research ", "", "I understand, of course. Zane, I am just wondering how you are thinking about the opportunity to reschedule debt that is coming due next year?", "Zane Rowe", "As Larry indicated earlier we don\u2019t like to discuss that prior to actually doing anything, but I think you see our actions today. Obviously we are pleased with our success rating here doing $90 million in the EETC transaction, as we have Terry and his team keyed up to look at 2010, so we will leave it at that.", "Larry Kellner ", "Dan, I think in the EETC we have shown we have been effective at refinancing aircraft where the debt was coming due prior to the debt coming due, so we can stay ahead of that with the market understanding where we are at.", "Dan McKenzie - Next Generation Equity Research ", "", "I understand. Thanks a lot I appreciate it.", "DeAnne Gabel", "Anthony, that concludes the session for the analyst\u2019s portion of the question-and answer portion. I will now turn the call over to Nene. ", "Nene Foxhall", "Thanks DeAnne. Anthony, once you have briefly reviewed the process for asking questions we will begin the media session.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Ted Reed of thestreet.com.", "Ted Reed - thestreet.com", "First of all I would like to ask about your 787 order. When do you expect to get those aircraft and do you see the same level of need for them that you did when you placed the order?", "Larry Kellner ", "Right now we would expect to get the 787 in 2011. Clearly we are waiting for Boeing to update its schedule and we will keep everybody informed as we see that schedule updated as to what your expectations are. ", "Yes, I think on the international markets, I think as you look fuel prices, while down from last years high, are still significantly higher than they were in 2004 when we ordered the aircraft. It is a very efficient aircraft. We have a lot of international growth opportunities out of Newark. We also have some out of Houston if you look at our network. We think the plane is a great fit for us and we continue to be excited about getting it.", "Jeff Smisek ", "Ted, Larry had told me he is really looking forward to flying on the 787s as well.", "Ted Reed - thestreet.com", "My second thing is, I read about the ATI application and there was discussion of global extent of the ATI. What does that mean in terms of what you might be able to do beyond the Trans-Atlantic, if anything?", "Larry Kellner ", "It is actually very valuable. What we will be able to do, and obviously this is on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and this is a grant of anti-trust immunity by the US government and doesn\u2019t apply, necessarily, to foreign nations. But, what we believe we will be able to do over time is to enter into arrangements with foreign carriers, for example, in Latin America, also in the Asia Pacific region. Perhaps joint ventures as well, which will permit us to maximize connectivity, maximize flow, coordinate our schedules to provide a very seamless service and frequent service to customers and provide a better product than we alone can provide, and give us, again, competitive heft against the other major alliances; SkyTeam is one of them.", "Ted Reed - thestreet.com", "", "Is there any particular market outside of the Trans-Atlantic that that would have great value in?", "Larry Kellner ", "Well we think there is great value in Asia Pacific and great value in Latin America and we are keenly interested in pursing both.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Shannon Buggs of the Houston Chronicle.", "Shannon Buggs - The Houston Chronicle", "", "I am wondering if you have more details that you can share with us about the 1,700 jobs that you are going to be cutting. How much of that is going to come out of Houston and the headquarters? A very significant piece was related to the management and clerical and I wanted some more details about that.", "Jeff Smisek ", "I think for us the first step will be to make sure we have got all of our team informed here. So we are working through that process now and how we will roll that out. ", "Two, it is a little difficult to predict exactly how it will roll out by city, because we are going to take every step we can just like we did last year to minimize the number of involuntary furloughs or reductions in force. Much like we were out last month with our flight attendants looking for volunteers for leaves of absences, we will work aggressively to minimize the impact on our people. They do a great job. This is in no way related to them, it is simply an impact of the economy and where we are. These are very touch decision and we are going to work through it internally with our folks and do everything we can to minimize it and we want to make sure they have got the details first.", "Shannon Buggs - The Houston Chronicle", "", "Okay, I get that you want to give them the details first, but with this are you also planning on doing a COLA for specific groups like you did with the flight attendants?", "Jeff Smisek ", "We will work with each work group to look for every alternative we can find to minimize against involuntary furloughs or reductions in force. So, there will be some impact on the corporate side, without question, but we are going to do everything we can to minimize the impact of this while making sure we are competitive as we go forward.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Allison Grant of (inaudible).", "Allison Grant", "", "I was wondering if you could be more specific about what was happening here in Cleveland. Also, could you be more specific about the timing of it, when the employees will know?", "Larry Kellner ", "It depends on the group, again, because we will work with each work group to do everything we can to minimize the impact. On the management/clerical side we will move fairly quickly on the individual where we go to kind of on flights and to our schedule clearly we have a busy summer schedule that pulls down at the end of September. So, this is around the last week in September, I think it is the 23rd of September is where we are targeting on many of the work groups to have it resolved. We will look for as many volunteers as we can get to minimize the impact, again, of involuntary furloughs or reductions in force.", "Allison Grant", "Can you tell us anything about any capacity cuts that may be coming?", "Larry Kellner ", "We outlined, and Jeff outlined in his comments, our outlook for capacity and we have also got that out in our Investor Update. We would be happy if you have specific questions you want to talk to on capacity. But, the schedules are loaded for the fall and so it is out there in the public system. We are not announcing additional new capacity cuts beyond what we have loaded in today, so it is out there and in the system.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Richard Newman of The Record.", "Richard Newman -The Record", "", "I wanted to ask about the Newark jobs. It has already been addressed, but I noticed that the Trans-Atlantic traffic was down disproportionately. Should we assume that there will be more of an impact on the Newark jobs picture than in say Houston or Cleveland?", "Larry Kellner ", "Yes, again if you look at our work groups and where they are at, so much of it depends on what we can do to minimize the impact of this and how that shifts among our employees. So, as we have more details we will be happy to fill that in. We just want to be careful not to get ahead. Clearly there is an impact as we are reducing our Trans-Atlantic capacity and so there will be an impact in Newark, but it is difficult to pin down exactly where that will be. With our headquarters here the management/clerical hit will actually be more in Houston and so for different groups it will hit us at different spots in the system.", "Our number one goal is A) to make sure our team knows first what is going on and B) to do everything we can to minimize it.", "Jeff Smisek ", "The one thing that I would add to that is, as Larry said, as we seek to minimize the impact through close and other voluntary programs, although it is hard to predict, I will tell you that should some of those not be successful the work force in Newark tends to be less senior than elsewhere because we have had so much growth in Newark. Then we have a lot of historical growth there and as a result the workforce tends to be more junior. So to the extent that we have to do some furloughs, you have to expect some disproportionate impact on Newark because that would be the sight of furloughs because we furlough in reverse seniority order.", "Richard Newman -The Record", "", "Could you identify flights that have been cut out of Newark? I heard someone mention Cologne is that one?", "Jeff Smisek ", "Well that was last year when we cut back on the international side. That has been out of the system (interposing) of leaving the market. What we have tried to do here in as many cases as we can is not leave markets, but leave them on certain days, especially during the week or season. We have got some other stuff that is seasonal and so we get out of it for the entire winter, things like Newark to Athens or Cleveland to Heathrow. But, on the stuff that is scheduled for the fall, the bulk of the cuts have been day of week cuts, so we will go from flying daily to flying four, five, or six times a week and we are getting out of the softest days.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jake Hahnville with Promedia Travel.", "Jake Hahnville - Promedia Travel", "", "I was hoping for an update on technology. There was some discussion three months ago about migrating to the Star alliance common IT platform. I was just wondering have any decisions been made and what components of the platform would be used if that happened and when?", "Larry Kellner ", "I think what we said and what we continue to be focused on is getting Continental and United on a common platform and so we continue to work on that. Where it is appropriate, when we are ready, we will announce where we are going. But, both United and us share the goal of getting to a common platform. We just think from a customer service side as we move forward one of the challenges we have always had in these alliances is IT. Clearly being on a common platform will solve a lot of customer issues and that is the primary focus. It is flexibility for making changes and things you can do for the customer on the alliance side.", "Jake Hahnville - Promedia Travel", "", "So that includes the reservation system?", "Larry Kellner ", "We would try to get to a common hosting system with United, yes.", "", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Colleen O\u2019Neil of WTAM", "Colleen O\u2019Neil of WTAM", "", "You started to touch upon this, but I am wondering if you can give us an idea as far as how many employees of Hopkins airport in Cleveland may be cut?", "Larry Kellner ", "Again, we just need to work through. Because, as you look at Cleveland, its pilots, its flight attendants, its airport agents, there are lots of work groups in the city and we need to work through with each work group kind of, one, what we can do to mitigate this and two, then when we get the results, as Jeff mentioned earlier, it goes in seniority order so it depends on what programs we are and where we are in place. So, we will be glad to update you as we move forward, but it is difficult at this time to predict, other than to lay out right now. We have a large number of what we need to accomplish and the question is how we go back with each workgroup and accomplish this in the best possible way.", "Colleen O\u2019Neil of WTAM", "", "Also, we have heard that besides layoffs, and I didn\u2019t hear you address this, but from people in this area that are employees say that a lot of workers are going to be cut down to part time hours. Is there any truth to that?", "Larry Kellner ", "Again, I think as you look at the schedule and as we talk about the number of positions, some of those are part time, some of those are full time, you may see some full time people end up going to part time because that is a better alternative than leaving in total. Again, it is very difficult for us, but we have to staff the operation on a long-term basis based on the flight schedule and the block hours we have. So, it is clearly a case where some people that are full time may end up going part time and we will just work through that in the way that has the least impact on our people, but allows us to remain competitive going forward.", "Colleen O\u2019Neil of WTAM", "", "But the way you will make decisions on who goes is going to be based on seniority?", "Larry Kellner ", "First of all we try to find volunteers, but if it was involuntary it would then be based on seniority for every group other than management and clerical which doesn\u2019t have the same seniority systems.", "Nene Foxhall", "Larry, Jeff, Zane, DeAnne, thank you and thanks to all of you on the call for joining us.

First Ms. Foxhall, ma\u2019am you may begin.", "Nene Foxhall", "Thank you, Gilda. Good morning everyone. Joining us here in Houston are Continental\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Larry Kellner; President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Smisek; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Zane Rowe; Executive Vice President Marketing Jim Compton; Executive Vice President Operations Mark Moran; and Senior Vice President Finance and Treasurer, Gerry Laderman to discuss Continental\u2019s third quarter 2009 financial results.", "Larry will begin with some overview comments after, which Jeff will review our capacity and revenue results. Zane will follow with a discussion of Continental\u2019s cost structure and balance sheet. At that point we will open the call for questions. We plan 20 minutes for the executive comments and then 25 minutes for analyst questions. At the conclusion of the analyst questions, we\u2019ll begin a 15 minute question-and-answer session for the media. We would appreciate it if each of you would limit your questions to one with one follow up.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to DeAnne.", "DeAnne Gabel", "Thank you, Nene. Earlier today we issued an update for investors presenting information relating to our financial and operational outlook for fourth quarter and full year 2009 and other information. This investor update was included in the filing with the SEC. Today we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures, such as net income excluding special items.", "Please note that a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures as well as the investor update can be found on our website at www.continental.com under the Investor Relations section. In addition, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements that are not limited to historical facts but reflect the company\u2019s current beliefs, expectations, or intentions regarding future events.", "All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For example of such risks and uncertainties please see the risk factors set forth in the 2008 10-K and its other security filings.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Larry.", "Larry Kellner", "Thank you, Nene and DeAnne. Good morning to all and thanks for joining us. I want to start this morning by thanking all my coworkers for our strong operational performance during the third quarter. For the quarter excluding special items we achieved essentially breakeven results reporting net income of 2 million or earnings per share of $0.02.", "On a GAAP basis including special items, we reported a net loss of $18 million or a loss of $0.14 per diluted share for the third quarter. Achieving breakeven results is disappointing in a quarter that should produce a couple hundred million dollars in profit. However, given the weak revenue environment, our results could have been much worse if not for the diligent efforts of my coworkers.", "That said, we cannot and will note be satisfied with just achieving breakeven results. We must return the business profitability and we\u2019re committed to doing just that. We\u2019ll continue to look for ways to improve our efficiency and maximize our revenue. As I join many in believing that the economy recovery will be a lengthy process.", "We plan to fully leverage the power of Star Alliance, the world\u2019s most comprehensive Global Alliance. We plan to join start next Tuesday, October 27. In preparation for joining Star Alliance, we\u2019ve announced that we\u2019ll begin daily non-stop service between Houston and Frankfurt and from Houston and Cleveland to Washington Dulles International Airport.", "These definitions will provide connecting opportunities for customers traveling via our Star partner hubs. These are just the beginning of the wealth of new opportunities and benefits our membership in Star Alliance will offer our customers. I want to personally thank Glenn Tilton for all his efforts to get us into Star Alliance. We\u2019ve also continued to invest in our product by adding customer amenities such as audio-video on demand on our 757:200 and 777 fleets, installed DirecTV on our domestic narrow-body fleet introducing our flat bed seat.", "The first aircraft outfitted with our business first flat bed seat, which our business customers helped us design is scheduled begin service within the next two weeks. We\u2019re well positioned to take full advantage of the improvements in the economic environment and while we don\u2019t have visibility as to when business traffic will return to normal levels, or even whether are not there will be a new normal, we\u2019re committed to doing what it takes to return to sustained profitability.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff and Zane to discuss the quarter\u2019s operational, revenue and cost performance details.", "Jeff Smisek", "Thanks, Larry. I want to join Larry in thanking our coworkers for running a great operation this past quarter. They earned a total of $11 million in cash incentives for making Continental the number one on time airlines among the major network carriers in August and September and for finishing among the top three major network carriers in July. This on time performance is impressive at anytime, but it\u2019s even more so given the record high load factors we ran in the third quarter.", "During the quarter we also maintained our excellent reliability record by achieving a system mainline segment completion factor of 99.7%. I\u2019m proud of our team of professionals who consistently deliver our high quality and reliable product. Throughout the third quarter our revenue remained weak. Mainline RASM was down 19.1% and regional RASM was down 10.9% year-over-year. We experienced weak yields and high load factors generated by the low fares caused by the recession.", "All regions experienced substantial year-over-year yield declines, which resulted in a mainline yield decline of 21.7% year-over-year and a regional yield decline of 16.8% year-over-year for the third quarter. However, we did see sequential modest improvement in the year-over-year percentage drop in high yield revenue for each of the three months of the quarter. I describe it more as green roots versus green shoots, but nevertheless it\u2019s a move in the right direction. ", "Now turning to the fourth quarter outlook while the steep revenue decline we experienced earlier this year appears to have flattened out and bumping along the bottom. We really have no idea how long the fall off and high yield traffic will last. That said there are some signs that indicate, we maybe seeing some modest improvement soon. There are a growing number of our corporate accounts that tell us that they\u2019re beginning to ease their most draconian and travel restriction and some are even permitting travel for internal meetings again.", "While it\u2019s too early to call it trend we have seen modest improvement bookings within 7 days to 13 days. Although this is encouraging the yields are still pretty tough. On the leisure side we expect to see relatively strong traffic and yields for the peak holiday time period. However, during the non-peak period we expect to continue to see deeply discounting leisure fares designed to stimulate traffic.", "We still have a week and a half left in the month of October and things could change, but based on the data thus far we\u2019re currently estimating consolidated October RASM will be down 13% to 15% and mainline October RASM will be down 14% to 16% year-over-year and looking forward, just a reminder that due to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday this year, we expect to get the benefit of the peak Thanksgiving holiday return traffic in November of this year versus December as we did last year.", "We have much work to do to improve our cost and revenue if we are to return to meaningful profitability. We remain highly disciplined on cost, and Zane will speak more about that in a few minutes.", "On the revenue side, we will continue to work to maximize our total revenue in many ways, including leveraging our new membership in Star Alliance and pursuing opportunities that will open for us and by increasing ancillary revenues. We will continue to implement changes designed to grow our ancillary revenue.", "We\u2019re beginning to offer our customers more control over the product and services they buy from us by giving them a broader rang of choices.

You can expect to see us do quite a bit more of in this 2010 and beyond, while keeping the clean, safe, and reliable service for which we are world renowned.", "Moving on to our capacity outlook, we\u2019ve begun to lap the substantial domestic capacity cuts made last year and expect our mainline domestic capacity for the fourth quarter will be up about 0.5% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter, we expect trans-Atlantic capacity will be down 11.4%.", "Latin capacity will be up 4.7% year-over-year, Pacific capacity will be up 16% year-over-year due to the addition of our Newark-Shanghai service earlier this year. For total mainline, we expect fourth quarter capacity to be down 0.7% year-over-year with our regional capacity down about 1.5% year-over-year. Thus we expect our consolidated capacity to be down about 1% year-over-year for the fourth quarter.", "For 2010, we expect modest year-over-year growth in our consolidated capacity in the 1.5% to 2.5% range with our mainline capacity up 2% to 3%, our mainline domestic capacity about flat year-over-year and our mainline international capacity up 5% to 6% year-over-year.", "The bulk of the international increase is the run rate of our ad this year and the restoration of our full schedule to Mexico following the pull down earlier this year related to H1N1. We will continue to monitor the demand environment closely and if necessary make further adjustments.", "While our team did a great job given the high loads brought about by the weak yield environment, our third quarter results were very disappointing, achieving essential breakeven results in what\u2019s usually one of our peak earnings quarters is certainly nothing to brag about.", "We know we need to do better and we know we owe it to you to do better. We recognize the importance of achieving and maintaining meaningful full year profitability.

This we\u2019ve made a lot of progress with initiatives to combat the difficult economic environment. These initiatives target both costs and revenue, ancillary revenue continues to be a focus of Continental and the industry. We continue to place an emphasis on working smarter, reducing costs, and operating more efficiently and you\u2019ll see that reflected in our cost performance during the quarter.", "Third quarter mainline CASM holding fuel rate constant and excluding special items was up only 1% year-over-year, on a mainline capacity decrease of 4.1%.

We estimate that in the fourth quarter it will be about $2.04 per gallon, again, including taxes and fuel hedge impact. That results in a full year price of about $1.98 per gallon. We continue to hedge part of our fuel needs, which we have outlined in our investor update, that our most effective and sustainable way to manage that cost is through improved fuel efficiency.", "This year alone we have retired 25 of the less efficient 737 classic aircraft. We will end the year with a fleet that\u2019s approximately 38% more efficient on an RPM basis than it was a dozen years ago. That translates into a tremendous amount of savings for us. Just this month, we installed the first pair of blended winglets on the 757-300 aircraft. Once the Fleet Titles complete by the end of the second quarter 2010, all of our narrowbody fleets will have winglets. Our fleet is the most fuel efficient of all the major U.S. global carriers.", "We took the delivery of six new Boeing 737-900ER aircraft during the quarter. We also took delivery of another 900ER earlier in this month and have one more scheduled to deliver before year end. Additional 737 new generation deliveries next year will replace the last remaining 737-300s that retire from the fleet in January. By the end of 2010, we expect to have fewer shelves than we had this summer with a more efficient mix of aircraft.", "Now, turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $2.54 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. As a percentage of last 12 months revenue, cash was approximately 20% at the end of the quarter. In August, we raised $158 million from the issuance of 14.4 million shares of common stock.

I\u2019ll be here until the end of the year, but this will be my last earnings call. It\u2019s been an honor and a pleasure to be part of Continental\u2019s leadership team and to have worked with professional men and women at Continental for almost 15 years. When I came to the company as part of the turnaround team, we had great employees, but they were without the tools they needed to do their jobs. We worked on getting them the right tools and implemented our go forward plan that clearly laid out and communicated our strategic goals and most importantly, made our working together cornerstone a priority.", "I\u2019m very proud of the company that my coworkers have built by working together. My coworkers working together have built the company that is globally recognized for its superior service and products.

Working together, they built a global route network that is soon to be enhanced by the global scope and scale of Star Alliance.", "Working together, they\u2019ve built the company of which they and I are very proud. I\u2019m confident that Jeff Smisek and the rest of our management team, along with our professional dedicated coworkers will overcome any challenges that lie ahead.

With that, we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session for the analysts, followed by the question-and-answer session for the media. Hilda, if could you please review the Q-and-A process we\u2019ll be ready to begin.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Larry, let me ask you since you\u2019re leaving the industry, if you have any thoughts as to what the industry could do? So outside the Mac, although what could the industry do to achieve decent sort of solid returns on capital? What would make this industry investable? Is it just consolidation? Is that the only thing we\u2019ve got left, what do you see?", "Larry Kellner", "No, I think we have looked at consolidation and clearly prefer to remain independent. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just consolidation. Clearly, we need three things. We need a stable economy, which we have struggled with here between all the outside shocks, and well shocks and then the financial shocks, but we also need a more stable regulatory front, and I\u2019d start with that with air traffic control.", "Again, there are just a number of things that aren\u2019t predictable in our business that go up and down. As you look at a little capacity come out, things get better and then some capacity comes back in. I\u2019m not sure consolidation solves that, Bill. If you look back to the mid 80s there were articles talking about, how consolidation could solve that. We still have new startups coming, but I do think we need to look at the regulatory side and specifically focus on air traffic control.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "So it\u2019s an interesting point you made just on the capacity coming in and out. On the margin this quarter we\u2019re actually seeing the updates suggest slightly more capacity for forward periods. It\u2019s just not clear to me, why that is, because everyone is talking about how things are difficult and you\u2019ve expressed disappointment with your results in the third quarter and yet we\u2019re seeing capacity increases. Why is the industry already moving toward that?", "Larry Kellner", "I think there\u2019s two pieces that I think as Zane pointed out, we\u2019ll actually have less aircraft next year than we have this year, but clearly people are working every utilization opportunity they have, because as we\u2019ve taken capacity out and you\u2019re trying to manage your cost to balance that.", "So I think what you\u2019re seeing right no is in addition of new aircraft to people\u2019s fleet, which is really the capacity changes, I worry most about Bill, and I think we see people trying to use the tools they have today as efficiently as possible, because there\u2019s a lot of leisure demand and so load factors have not been issue. It\u2019s been the fare environment and that leads to you look for every marginal opportunity you can find to flight the airplane, but not to go buy new airplanes for growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus.", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus", "So fourth quarter load factor is tracking up three points, looks like you\u2019re going to be paying, assuming all else equal, $0.19 per gallon less than Southwest will for fuel in the fourth quarter. Most airlines balance sheets have been repaired, if you will so to speak or much better shape than a month or two ago.", "So what\u2019s preventing you now from pulling the lever on yields? Is it a visibility question? Is it an elasticity question because I understand the hesitation to attempt fare increases, when you think some of the cash strapped competitors are going to pursue sort of fleet strategy and not match you, but given the recent financing, it seems like liquidity risk has sort of the tabled near term. So what\u2019s preventing the yield lever being pulled?", "Jeff Smisek", "This is Jeff and then I\u2019ll ask Jim Compton to add and if he wants to say, but certainly from our knothole, we have a huge deficit in business travel. So you\u2019ve got a big mix issue. It\u2019s your high yield travelers are simply, either not traveling or they\u2019re traveling more in the back of the bus and there we have to be somewhat dependent on the economy coming back and business travel are doing. So large part of the yield issue is really a mix issue. We\u2019ve got plenty of traffic at low yield for leisure traffic, but its business traffic of that. Jim, do you want to add anything there?", "Jim Compton", "Hunter, I think Jeff said it perfectly. I think that historically, we\u2019ve seen yield comeback and just clearly is a mix issue first, but the leverage is that business traffic coming back first and that\u2019s the piece that obviously, we\u2019re watching very closely, and that\u2019s really a function of the economy. So I think that leverage that you mention on yield is truly a function of how the economy is going to improve going forward and how business traffic moves with that economy.", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess I\u2019m more driving not so much on the high yield side, but more on the leisure side. You talked about in opening comments about peak periods versus non-peak period. Do you think if we get you could be more aggressive now on back cabin peak period type traffic? Because with consumer settlement seems to be improving, albeit gradually and I feel exact that could probably after pretty magnified impact if you got more aggressive on the yield back cabin yields.", "Larry Kellner", "", "I think it\u2019s very difficult for us to comment on future pricing. I just point to actions that have been taken recently. You see in various cases carriers working to say, if we think we\u2019re going to be full how do we maximize our revenue on those individual days, but I will also tell you that you not in once you get past the summer, are you have an awful lot of days that are not peak days as well.", "The Tuesday and Wednesday or every week come to mind and so there\u2019s real challenges in doing that outside of what I would consider peak periods, but I want to be just looking at what\u2019s out there historically, you\u2019ve seen over the last 45 days or so people very focused on anyplace there is peak demand. So, we\u2019ll see where it goes, but it\u2019s all driven by I think the systems always designed, the revenue management systems to look at both demand and what you think the leisure traveler will pay, as you can shut leisure demand of pretty quickly with price.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "In the past, you\u2019ve given updates on where your corporate revenue trends were. I was wondering if you could give us those statistics as they played out during the third quarter and in particular, I\u2019m concerned with whether or not domestic premium is coming back at a faster rate than international or vice versa.", "Jeff Smisek", "I can help you, let me tell you the reason we have done it and the reason that you\u2019re going to see us discontinue doing it going forward what we wanted to demonstrate with the statistics we had before was how the year-over-year declines were bottoming out. That is the business traffic declines were bottoming out. We\u2019re now getting into and will be getting into, fourth quarter comps that are reflective of the significant decline in business travel that occurred after Lehman Brothers went down last year.", "So going forward you won\u2019t see us doing that, but I will tell you what we\u2019ve got for the third quarter. I don\u2019t have it broken down by domestic versus international travel. We could probably figure that out and get back to you we needed to, but the year-over-year drop in high yield revenue for July was 31% for August was 28% and for September was 21%. So you can see the attenuation of the decline.", "Larry Kellner", "I would also point out September, this is Larry, a little messier because you had Hurricane Ike Houston for the last half of the month, which had lots of impact on our statistics, so it\u2019s another reason it gets tougher.", "Jeff Smisek", "It gets tougher going forward, so its comps become essentially less meaningful going forward.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Then, your advances, as highlighted in the investor update are a little bit softer than what we\u2019ve seen in prior periods. I know booking curve has changed a lot. I\u2019m wondering if that is a sign that you\u2019re being less aggressive in filling up as you look forward because you think the close in demand is better or if that\u2019s just, the changes we\u2019re talking about in the booking process just sort of started to develop at this stage last year, so it\u2019s comparison issue.", "Jim Compton", "Building on what Larry and Jeff comments here some of the places we\u2019ve seen some improvement in bookings is in that 7 day to 13 day range. So you\u2019re exactly pointing to the right thing. The revenue management system is anticipating a better build as you move through the quarter and so I think we talk about 2.9 points higher load factor year-over-year in the fourth quarter reflects a building of bookings as we move through the quarter based on our bookings. ", "So getting back to earlier questions, it\u2019s kind of the leverage piece that maybe was referred to a little bit and Larry mentioned the revenue management system, kind of lining up to where we\u2019re seeing some of the demand right now.", "Larry Kellner", "I want to stress, we expect load factor to be up on a system basis almost three points for the quarter. So I think you should view that comment with where the bookings are. You can draw your own conclusions, but clearly we\u2019re in a better spot than we were going into this a year ago.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jamie Baker - JP Morgan.", "Jamie Baker - JP Morgan", "Quick question on Star, you are gaining a strong Japanese partner in the form of A&A, but presumably your decision to move to Star was made without considering the impact of JAL possibly moving into SkyTeam and the potential that Delta could end up serving it down the road. I\u2019m just curious if any of this ongoing courtship of JAL has changed? How you view the potential Star benefit that you have to get in Asia, Japan in particular?", "Larry Kellner", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the JAL courtship in the sense that either JAL is going to end up and stay in one world or go to SkyTeam, so we\u2019re going to compete in Star between united and A&A in Continental with JAL and one of those two Alliances, either staying where they are and moving to SkyTeam and I don\u2019t think as we look the numbers, we think that has a dramatic impact on where we end up. ", "I think the key is, we\u2019re working with United and A&A on a broader relationship in anticipation of open skies treaty with Japan, and I think that\u2019s where the up side is for us.", "Jamie Baker - JP Morgan", "Your optimism that U.S. carriers would see their fair share if any and made a flags with open skies is achieved?", "Larry Kellner", "I think it\u2019s a little early for optimism on that. Let\u2019s just see where the open skies negotiations go.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Linenberg - Bank of America.", "Mike Linenberg - Bank of America", "Two questions, just right off the bat looking at the RASM, when you look at your RASM as reported in the third quarter, if we look at the domestic versus the regional, the domestic piece was down in almost 16%, the regional piece was down a lesser 11%. Yet the capacity declines were similar, what\u2019s behind that? Because, when I think about the regional piece, I know there is some shorter hauled flights to Mexico, but it\u2019s predominantly domestic. Any color that you can give on that would be great.", "Jim Compton", "You\u2019re exactly right, pointing to those numbers. I would point out that if you kind of look on a two year over two year basis they\u2019re behaving very much the same. So that the team has done a great job kind of at the margin right-sizing the regional. So even though understanding the capacity on year-over-year is about the same, but on a two year basis on that RASM lines up pretty well. So I think it\u2019s more than network getting both the mainline and the regional in sync and the regional adjustments kind of lag of what we were doing on the mainline.", "Mike Linenberg - Bank of America", "My second question, this is either to Jeff or Larry, and this just has to do with Emission Trading Scheme. I know recently, there was an ICAO meeting in Montreal. It seemed that the global powers came out with a declaration of how to treat aviation, in advance of the UN Climate Change Conference, which is going to take place in Copenhagen later this year in December.", "I guess the question is that, now that there\u2019s a framework there, does that supersede what the Europeans are trying to do with the ETS, or is there some sort of dual track where all the carriers are still aggregating and calculating what their carbon footprint is what the possibility that whatever may come out in December may not be sufficient and such that Europe still goes ahead with its ETS, which I guess, kicks in sometime and I think it\u2019s 2012. Can you just give us an update on that?", "Jeff Smisek", "Clearly, since we are both a global and mobile industry, having regional regulations relating to carbon emissions, it really doesn\u2019t work well. Since our assets flow across the globe, we need to be regulated in a consistent fashion across the globe for carbon emissions and ICAO is the right place to go. Both ATA and I ought to support that. We\u2019ve been working very hard, lining up carriers across the world and I think most all of us agree that that\u2019s the way to go. If we are however, because the EU, Emissions Trading Scheme is progressing, we are as carriers required to be prepared for that.", "Hope that one or more governments will sue to prevent the enactment of the ETS scheme, because it\u2019s clearly a illegal from an extra territorial perspective, but unfortunately carriers don\u2019t have private right of action, only governments do, but having centralized regulation through ICAO with its expertise and aviation, and the support of the carriers as well, I believe is clearly the way to go for responsible regulation of carbon emissions for global carriers.", "Larry Kellner", "I\u2019d just add, Mike that if you look regional being very specific regional or country-by-country cap and trade does not work for the airline business and will significantly disadvantage the carriers from any country, in which those are enacted, because the way the cap and trade structures are set up. It\u2019s just very tough to deal with that on anything other than a global basis.", "I think the side of that is that ATA, IATA now working with our ICAO have come together to put forward and very meaningful proposals ATA\u2019s proposed in 1.5% per year, increase in efficiency through 2020, very meaningful things around the table, but it\u2019s got to be done globally, and it\u2019s very difficult to find any reasonable solution that will work.", "So we\u2019re going to work hard hear in the U.S. and in Europe to try to get folks that are driving that\u2019s understand, but it\u2019s not a case of airlines not wanting to do their part, it\u2019s a case of we need a global answer and the noise standards were governed by ICAO and I think that work pretty well on a global basis. So I think that\u2019s a great example of the fact that we can make progress, but we need to do with a consistent global framework.", "Mike Linenberg - Bank of America", "Just Larry, last I just want to add, it\u2019s been a privilege over the years and good luck going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Crissey - UBS.", "Kevin Crissey - UBS", "Can you talk about with the online travel agencies getting rid of booking fees awhile back now? Can you talk about, what you\u2019re seeing is in terms of maybe loss of kind of supplier direct website sales, whether you\u2019re seeing any of that and whether you would make any kind of counter off, or whether it be miles or some sort of other incentive to get the website direct bookings?", "Jeff Smisek", "This is Jeff. We are clearly seeing an impact. There\u2019s no question about that. In terms of our response, since that effectively goes more towards forward pricing, our General Counsel never lets us talk about that. So I\u2019m afraid, I can\u2019t talk about that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel McKenzie - Next Generation Equity.", "Daniel McKenzie - Next Generation Equity", "Larry, I echo the congratulations here and you certainly do set a high bar for CEOs. I guess, my first question is really just housecleaning and, Zane I appreciate the cash CapEx for 2010, but I\u2019m wondering if you can provide a total consolidated CapEx number. By that I mean both the cash component, as well as the financing component for new aircraft and then related to that any color on need to tap equity or debt markets over next six months?", "Zane Rowe", "Dan, this is Zane. What we\u2019ve given you today, at least this morning, is all we\u2019re willing to give at this time. We\u2019re in the process of budgeting next year\u2019s capital needs and working on our operating budgets for next year as well. As you know historically, we haven\u2019t given any forward-looking guidance on capital mark activity, either. As it relates to next year\u2019s aircraft coming in, we do have Boeing back stop financing available. That\u2019s pretty much all we\u2019re allowed to say on forward-looking transactions.", "Daniel McKenzie - Next Generation Equity", "I guess, my second question might be a little trickier, but I\u2019m wondering if you can talk just in general, about the labor strategy and just to clarify this, as I understand it, CAL has until December 2010 to implement a JV with Star, but scope clause in the pilots contract from the doing so and then separately, the pilots of course have an open contract, which would mean labor potentially would get two chances to step up to the plate for a raise. I guess, when I\u2019m wondering, are all these negotiations bundled together in one negotiation or two?", "Larry Kellner", "I think two things. One, I think we always think negotiations are best left at the table, but I think in the framework you talk about, we do have a provision in our pilot scope clause about revenue sharing with another domestic carrier. So while we could do a foreign JV, the issue here is we cannot revenue share with a U.S. domestic carrier with united in the JV, that\u2019s the issue there, but I think from our side we prefer to keep negotiations of the table.", "I would just say there\u2019s a lot of ways you can work these out I think we\u2019re all focused. We have an amenable pilot\u2019s contract. We\u2019d like the get that resolved assume as we can to move forward. I think the pilots would like to get it resold. It\u2019s always just a question of trying to find common ground and so we\u2019ll continue work hard to do that.", "We also are open with the mechanics and will be open with the flight attendants the end of the year and so I think as we forward will continue to look to get those results as quickly as we can in a way that\u2019s both beneficial for our coworkers and also allows the company to be sustainable.", "It doesn\u2019t do us any good if we can\u2019t cut a contract that doesn\u2019t do us any good we cut a contract does it work on a long term basis as I think some other carriers of seen. So we need to try fine solution that work for everybody that clearly our people are out there working hard and we want to make sure that we find solutions to the issues.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Helane Becker - Jesup & Lamont", "Helane Becker - Jesup & Lamont", "What if business traffic on flying in the back of the bus or looking for discounts themselves is the new norm? What if business travel as we knew it, in prior cycles just is not going comeback that way and airlines have to really rethink their whole pricing strategy? How does that factor into kind of your thought process looking forward?", "Larry Kellner", "I think two things, Helane. One there\u2019s a balance there, which is I think we look across our large corporate customers and many of them I think their short term actions they can take but the weather you\u2019re global energy company within executive responsible for division in Europe and in the U.S. or you\u2019re an investment bankers.", "The people who are taking 15 and 20 trips a year international which we have a number rather than the corporate side, probably you going to see some return and we already see some change in policy where business first is going to be there.", "Two we have smaller on average business first cabin on international basis and we have never sold leaving us side of the 30s or 40s etc on certain key flights domestically in first class. So we typically been somebody result the economic in the U.S. were have the majority of people sitting in the front they\u2019re on upgrades, and not on a purchase basis. ", "Internationally we have seen significant wants link of the flight and I think we fully recognize there maybe a new normal, which is somewhat better than what we see today, but not as good as what it\u2019s been in the past. ", "However, I think our cabin size, relative on our aircraft in a way we configure which is C-class configuration, actually fit that well. We\u2019ve always been flexible in making adjustments and so clearly if there was a trade-off you can always reconfigure to take a few seats out, put more coach on and look at it vice versa.", "We have been very focused on keeping our international fleet consistent as much as we can, so for instance, all our 777s have 50 seats in the front in business first and I think that\u2019s a key we wouldn\u2019t want to lose going forward because it allows us to flow the aircraft between Asia and Europe and creates quite a bit of cost savings.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "On the ancillaries on the bag fees, I think you talked about it being a $200 million number, given some of the changes it\u2019s higher than that.

Star being the largest global Alliance out there, our customer base in Cleveland is going to have many opportunities to reach out across the world. In addition, as Jeff mentioned in his comments, we\u2019re adding service in Cleveland to Dulles, that specifically is there related to Star to tap into the network United has and Dulles internationally as well as some of the other Star Carriers. So again, I think for all our Hubs, including Cleveland, it really has been expanded world for our customers with great opportunity.", "Alison Grant - Plain Dealer", "Quick follow-up question, if I may. I just wondered if you thought and if there would be any change in flow traffic given the existence now of the large United Hub within Continental\u2019s network in Chicago.", "Larry Kellner", "I think that any time the network is seeing changes, and in this case we are flowing into a different global network that flow traffic will change, and so forth. We\u2019ll be obviously watching that to optimize revenue across our network and so forth, but I think that it\u2019s hard for me to talk about specifics, but clearly flow traffic with new partners will be different. Obviously, different connecting points versus our SkyTeam partners that we had today, there are different connect points with our star partners to flow traffic will move with that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shannon Buggs - Houston Chronicle.", "Shannon Buggs - Houston Chronicle", "As one of you\u2019ve mentioned in your comments that, there were specific requests about the travel from Houston to Frankfurt and the Cleveland to Dulles. Who made those requests to you all to add those routes?", "Jeff Smisek", "Shannon, I don\u2019t think its request. Those were adds in contemplation of joining Star Alliance. As Jim was saying, when you\u2019re changing Alliances and this is usual. There\u2019s not ever been an airline of our magnitude switching global alliances. You clearly have different flows and different natural connecting points.", "So routes like Cleveland and Houston to Washington Dulles, connecting into United Hub, flights like Houston to Frankfurt nonstop which begins November 1 connect at Lufthansa, those are the source of opportunities that global alliances offer a broader range, more planes and more seats, more opportunities, more opportunity to both earn and redeem miles, all the good things that flow from a globally alliance.", "So those route launches that we alluded to are essentially the natural consequence of changing Alliances just like we\u2019ll move in many airports around the world to get closer to our Star partners to make those connections easier because, that\u2019s the key element in the Alliance. As you\u2019ve got to make it, it\u2019s seamless for the customer as you can.", "Shannon Buggs - Houston Chronicle", "So are there other changes that are coming soon related to moving things closer to your partners?", "Jeff Smisek", "Yes, Shannon, there will be other changes. No, we will not be telling you what they are before we announce them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mickey Maynard - New York Times.\u2019", "Mickey Maynard - New York Times", "I wanted to see if you could expand a little bit about the comments made to Bill Greene about what would make the industry investable, because it sounds like what you were saying was essentially airlines have done the job that they can do, now it needs larger solutions.", "Jim Compton", "Mickey, I\u2019ve been out before in the past. I mean the regulatory environment we have, and I\u2019m not talking about of return to CAB Standards of 1978, but the regulatory system we have today isn\u2019t working for employees, it\u2019s not working for shareholders, it\u2019s not working for customers.", "So I think we\u2019ve got to step back at some point and say how do we get a regulatory system that doesn\u2019t allow or doesn\u2019t create the volatility we\u2019ve seen, which if you go back since the beginning of coming out coming of deregulation in the early \u201880s, we have just seen huge volatility in this industry, some driven by the industry itself, a lot of it driven by crises outside of the industry 9/11, the energy run-up the economic industry collapse, but I think we\u2019ve got to step back and say, if you go through a period of 25 years with the amount of turmoil we\u2019ve had in the industry that all came off of a new regulatory set.", "I think the key as you\u2019ve got to go back and look at those regulatory rules and say, what do we need to change? What do we need to fix? Whether it\u2019s about oil speculation or air traffic control or about how the Railway Labor Act works. Again, in a way that\u2019s positive from a shareholder standpoint, positive from an employee standpoint, and candidly positive from a customer standpoint. I just don\u2019t think you can look and say other than from low fares, from an industry stability side, deregulation has not been working. Doesn\u2019t mean we need to go back to where we are, but I do think we need to look at how we adjust what we have.", "Mickey Maynard - New York Times", "So before we get something like, say, the three hour rule or passenger\u2019s bill of rights or those sorts of things, you would rather have a complete look at the whole regulatory environment rather than the sort of patchwork quilt situation?", "Larry Kellner", "When I think the challenge with the patchwork quilt is it doesn\u2019t look at how all the pieces fit together and I think we had a step back and say, whether we\u2019ve had now 30 years, since we\u2019ve passed the Airline Deregulation Act. What have we learned and how do we create a more stable environment? Clearly, it\u2019s done good for growth of the system, but as the system grow the air traffic control system didn\u2019t keep up with it.", "I think we continue to have challenges with the Railway Labor Act that I think we need to address with both labor and management to figure out a better solution from both side, because I don\u2019t think either side would stand up and say its working. I think as you look at the volatility in oil prices and business that burns a lot of well.", "We need to find the way to make sure that speculation is dropping those prices and how we\u2019ve got some stability in the marketplace. So I do think we need a holistic view to say, what have we learned over the last 30 years and let\u2019s not look at one individual piece, whether it would be a passenger bill of rights or anything else, how we have review the industry.", "If we think it\u2019s important to the country, which I should do and I think transportation is key to our future and also fits into the whole cap and trade issue, we\u2019re talking about later in the call. I think there\u2019s just a wide range of issues that will all drive either instability in this industry or stability, and we need to look for a way to find more stability. I think that would be good for everybody.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from David Koenig - Associated Press.", "David Koenig - Associated Press", "I guess this is for Jeff Smisek. I wondered, in light of the October RASM estimate that you\u2019ve offered, are you comfortable saying that the worst of the travel slump is now over, or where are we?", "Jeff Smisek", "David, I would say that we are bumping along the bottom. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball unfortunately or when I have seems to be very cloudy. So I can\u2019t tell you when the recovery will come or how quickly or at what rate business travel will return. I do believe that based on the data we have, we don\u2019t see things getting worse, but the recovery seems to be quite slow, and I think we\u2019ll know when we see it. We\u2019re just not in a position to try to prognosticate on it.", "Operator", "At this moment, I\u2019m showing no further questions.", "Nene Foxhall", "Okay, thank you very much. Larry, Jeff, Zane, and DeAnne, thanks to you and thanks to everybody who\u2019s joining us. Please call corporate communications, if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Welcome to Continental Airlines fourth quarter and year end 2009 financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) ", "I would like to turn the conference over to Nene Foxhall, Senior Vice President of Communications and Government Affairs; and DeAnne Gabel, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Foxhall, ma\u2019am you may begin.", "Nene Foxhall", "Thank you, Christine. Good morning everyone. Joining us here in Houston are Continental\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Smisek; Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Zane Rowe; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Mark Moran; and Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, Gerry Laderman to discuss Continental\u2019s fourth quarter and year end 2009 financial results.", "Jeff will begin with some overview comments after, which Jim will review our capacity and revenue results. Zane will follow with a discussion of Continental\u2019s cost structure and balance sheet. At that point we will open the call for questions. We\u2019ll start with executive comments which will be followed by analyst questions and at the conclusion of those questions he we\u2019ll begin a Q-and-A session for the media. We\u2019d appreciate it if each of you would limit your questions to one with one follow up.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to DeAnne.", "DeAnne Gabel", "Thanks, Nene. Earlier today we issued an update for investors presenting information relating to our financial and operational outlook for the first quarter and full year 2010 and other information. This investor update was included and filed with the SEC. Today we will be discussing some non-GAAP measures such as net income excluding special items.", "Please note that a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures as well as the investor update can be found on our website at www.continental.com under the Investor Relations section. In addition, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements that are not limited to historical facts, but reflect the company\u2019s current beliefs, expectations, or intentions regarding future events.", "All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For example of such risks and uncertainties please see the risk factors set forth in the company\u2019s 2008 10-K and its other filings.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Smisek", "Thanks, Nene and DeAnne. Good morning and thanks for joining us. I want to start by thanking my coworkers for their support and dedication to customer service. They did a great job dealing with the many challenges we faced in 2009 and they did a superb job ensuring that our transition to Star Alliance went smoothly. This was the first ever move by a major airline to a new global alliance. It took tremendous effort and we accomplished it by our coworkers across the company working together.", "Turning now to our financial results, for the full year 2009, we reported a net loss of $295 million, or diluted loss per share of $2.28, excluding $145 million of previously announced special charges and $158 million non-cash income tax benefit. Including special charges and the income tax benefit Continental reported a net loss of $282 million, or a loss of $2.18 per diluted share.", "For the fourth quarter of 2009, Continental reported a net income of $4 million, or a profit of $0.03 per diluted share, excluding $77 million of previously announced special charges and $158 million non-cash income tax benefit. Including those special charges and the income tax benefit, we reported a net income $85 million or a profit of $0.60 per diluted share for the quarter.", "During 2009, the team once again did a great job delivering consistent operational performance. Our system-wide mainline completion factor was 99.5% and we operated 101 days without a single mainline flight cancellation. For the full year, we averaged a record 81.9% mainline load factor. Despite the heavy loads we recorded a DOT on time arrival rate of 78.8%, and our employees earned cash incentives for on-time performance for seven months of the year.", "As Jim will share in a moment, throughout the quarter we saw sequential RASM improvements. Although this was good news, in large part those RASM improvements were the result of very weak year-over-year comps as the economy and business travel began their steep downward slide in the fourth quarter of 2008. Everyone should curb their RASM enthusiasm going into this quarter as we will again benefit from extremely weak year-over-year comps as we lap the steep drop-off in business travel we experienced in the first quarter of 2009.", "We\u2019re a long way from being out of the woods, although, as Jim will discuss, we\u2019re seeing some signs that business travel is beginning to head in the right direction. We are keenly focused on making money again, and we will make many changes as we challenge every aspect of our business to find ways to increase revenue and decrease costs. That said the two things that won\u2019t change are our working together culture and our dedication to operating a clean, safe, and reliable airline.", "We continue to work with our good partner United Airlines to implement our alliance. We\u2019ve begun the process of aligning our gates at key locations, and we\u2019ve already accomplished quite a bit. This is a benefit for both of us as we reduce our costs and enhanced connectivity for our customers. We\u2019ve announced mutual upgrades for each other\u2019s Elite passengers that becoming this summer and our president\u2019s club members now have accessed to United Red Carpet Clubs worldwide.", "Even with just a portion of the customer service benefits between Continental and United having that implemented, we are now connecting as many passengers with United as we connected during the same period last year with Delta and Northwest combined. I think this shows great results already from our new partnership with United. Our teams are working together to find additional revenue generating and cost saving opportunities.", "Our membership in StarAlliance is also off to a very good start. Our new partners want us to succeed, and their support had assistance helps to make our transition go so smoothly. We\u2019ve begun to align our networks to leverage the power of StarAlliance with our New York to Frankfurt service and our recently launched Houston to Frankfurt service we\u2019re already seeing benefits as our customers choose to connect over Frankfurt. This summer we will be adding New York and Munich, which will be add connections for our customers over Lufthansa\u2019s powerful Munich hub.", "Additionally, leveraging our new StarAlliance membership, in December we filed an application with DOT for a grant of Antitrust Immunity to form a trans-Pacific joint venture with United and All Nippon Airways. This joint venture will be the first of its kind between the U.S. and Asia.", "We\u2019ve only just begun to see the benefits to being a member of the world\u2019s most comprehensive global alliance. We like what we see and look forward to capturing future benefits. We have a solid, well balanced network, and we will continue to look for strategic growth opportunities such as New York-Munich, that enhance our overall network in the context of StarAlliance.", "However, let me be clear that we are not looking to grow for growth\u2019s sake. At Continental, we have seen the benefits from and understand the importance of capacity discipline. We have a bias towards capacity discipline, because we are firmly committed to achieving and sustaining profitability. Accordingly, we\u2019ve adjusted downwards our anticipated 2010 capacity from earlier estimates.", "For 2010, we now expect our consolidated capacity will be up only 1% to 2% with our mainline capacity up 1.5% to 2.5%, our mainline domestic capacity about flat year-over-year and our mainline international capacity up 4% to 5% year-over-year.", "As a reminder, the bulk of the international increase is the run rate of our capacity additions last year, which included the long haul roots of Houston-Frankfurt in November, Houston-Rio in August, and New York-Shanghai in March, as well as the restoration of our schedule to Mexico following the large pull down we did last year related to H1N1.", "On the revenue side, in addition to tapping into the power of StarAlliance and optimizing traditional revenue management, overtime you\u2019ll see us offering customers more control over their travel experience. So customers will have more choices regarding the elements of the travel experience they consume and pay for. We will further unbundle our product and also offer new goods and services.", "We believe that this will be good for customer choice and good for Continental\u2019s revenue. One example of these opportunities that we\u2019ve implemented last year is our day of departure upgrade program. On the day of departure if, after all Elite upgrades have been made, there are still first class seats available for sale, we offer customers an opportunity to buy a day of departure upgrade to first class.", "Last year, we generated over $25 million from this program. Before we started offering day of departure upgrades those empty first class seats simply spoiled. We have a lot of ideas for generating additional revenue and offering customers\u2019 choice and we think our passengers and investors will like them as we roll them out in the future.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim and Zane to discuss the quarter\u2019s revenue and cost performance details.", "Jim Compton", "Thanks, Jeff. I join Jeff and thanking our coworkers for running a great operation this past quarter. Thanks to the efforts of our coworkers across all divisions the transition Star Alliance went smoothly and as Jeff said, things are spooling up nicely.", "Moving on to our fourth quarter revenue results, in each of the months throughout the fourth quarter, we experienced sequential improvements in our year-over-year RASM decline. The results for the fourth quarter were that mainline RASM was down 9.9% and regional RASM was down 4.0% year-over-year.", "Fourth quarter load factor was up year year-over-year and we also had improvements in year-over-year yield he declines. However, on an absolute basis, yields remained weak. For the fourth quarter mainline yield declined 13.6% year-over-year and regional yield declined 7.5% year-over-year.", "Our December mainline year-over-year RASM decline outperformed what many were expecting. Part of our performance was related to the spool up of our Star Alliance. Comparing connecting passengers this December, over Frankfurt with connecting passengers last December, over Paris and Amsterdam combined, we have 65% less seats in the Frankfurt market, but we\u2019ve made up 85% of the connect traffic.", "As a result, we are now connecting twice as many passengers per seat beyond Frankfurt than we did last December in Paris and Amsterdam combined. We also saw sequential improvement in year-over-year business first RASM comparisons throughout the quarter, which turned positive in the trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific region in December 2009, mainly driven by increased load factors.", "We believe that some of our corporate accounts are beginning to ease some of their travel restrictions, such as allowing employees to book in the front cabin again. However, part of the December RASM improvement was due to year-over-year comparison issues. We saw significant year-over-year improvement in December 2009 RASM performance on the New York/Mumbai route, largely due to the fact that last year\u2019s results were skewed by the Mumbai terrorist attacks, which occurred in late November 2008.", "As expected, we had relatively strong leaser demand and yields over the peak holiday travel periods and while we\u2019ve also seen some improvements in yields for the off peak periods, when we are more dependent on business traffic, yields are still down year-over-year. In a recovery period, it is typical to see volume comeback first, then yield. We\u2019ve seen improvement in the volume and we are seeing modest improvement in business mix trends as business travelers are slowly returning. However, we\u2019re still waiting to see any real strength in yield.", "Now turning to the first quarter outlook, corporate revenue booking trends are positive, and we are seeing a pickup in bookings inside of 14 days, but even, so yields remain soft. We continue to believe the recovery will be long and slow, but the recent trends are encouraging as they\u2019re at least headed in the right direction.", "On the pricing side, we had some success in the international marks as the industry matched a modest international fuel surcharge increase that we initiated earlier this month. Our corporate accounts are telling that you say travel budgets are still fairly tight. That said we are seeing business travel slowly comeback. In addition to easing restrictions on front cabin bookings, some accounts are permitting travel for internal meetings, which have stimulated a small pickup in our bookings related to group meetings.", "We\u2019ve also seen a pickup in corporate bookings from the financial sector and of course, we\u2019re getting great feedback on our new flat-bed seat. We believe that we\u2019ve been losing some customers, otherwise could have attracted, especially on really long haul routes because we didn\u2019t have flat-bed seats.", "We expect to have our entire 777 fleet retrofitted by the end of this year and we just installed our first 757-200 with flat-bed seats. We will now have a highly competitive product to offer those business travelers who expect a good rest on board our long haul routes. Before I discuss January\u2019s RASM expectations, I want to address a couple of housekeeping items. In the investor update file this morning you may have noticed that mainline domestic will street factor for the next six weeks is running one to two points behind the same period last year and regional book seat factor is also running behind.", "Last year, at this time, due to the declining business mix and weakness in yields, we made the decision to make more domestic leisure inventory available for sale earlier in the booking curve and maximize our revenue. This year we have returned to a more normal management of the domestic booking curve, as we\u2019ve seen a modest improvement in business demand.", "As Jeff mentioned, as we move through the first quarter of 2010, the year-over-year RASM comps get sequentially easier. Last January our consolidated RASM was down 4.8% year-over-year. In February, it was down 11.5% year-over-year and in March of last year it was down 19.6% year-over-year.", "In regards to January 2010 RASM, we still have a little over a week left in the month of January, and things could change, but based on data thus far, we are currently estimating consolidated January RASM will be down around 3% year-over-year, and mainline January RASM will be down around 4% year-over-year. Again, these numbers are preliminary estimates based on the data we have for January thus far and will likely change.", "With that I will turn the call over to Zane.", "Zane Rowe", "Thanks, Jim. I also want to thank the entire Continental team for their hard work in what was a challenging year. Throughout 2009 we saw pressure on unit costs as we pulled down capacity. However, the team did a great job working more efficiently and finding additional ways to reduce costs. That effort is reflected in our cost performance for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year.", "For the fourth quarter, mainline CASM holding fuel rate constant and excluding special items was up 1.4% on a mainline capacity decrease of a half% year-over-year and for the full year, it was up 1.5% year-over-year on a capacity decreased of 5%. Again, the solid CASM performance is largely a result of the hard work of our employees. We\u2019ll continue to see these benefits in 2010.", "For the full year 2010, excluding special items and holding fuel rate constant we expect both our consolidated and mainline CASM to be up about 1% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter consolidated fuel price, including taxes and hedge impact, was $2 per gallon. Given the current forward curve we estimate that including taxes and hedge impact our further quarter consolidated fuel price per gallon will be about $2.13 and for the full year about $2.25.", "We\u2019ve hedged a portion of our fuel needs using a mix of swaps and call options. You\u2019ll find our current hedge position outlined in our investor update. We continue to layer in additional fuel hedges to reduce some of the volatility of fuel expense. We have the most fuel efficient fleet of all the major US network carriers, and we continue to look for ways to further improve our overall fuel burn.", "We will also continue to add modern fuel efficient aircraft to our fleet while retiring older less efficient aircraft. During the fourth quarter, we placed into service one 757-300, and two 737-900 ER Aircraft and retired four 737-300 Aircraft, ending the year with 337 mainline aircraft in systems. On the regional side, during the quarter we reached an agreement with ExpressJet to remove eight Embraer 145 Aircraft from our capacity purchase agreements.", "Two of these aircraft were removed in December. We ended the year with a total of 264 regional jets flown on our behalf. The other six 145 will be removed from the capacity purchase agreement by the end of April. ExpressJet will continue to sublease these eight aircraft from us, but will not be flying them on our behalf; we will also remove seven CRJ-200 from service in the first quarter. By the end of the first quarter, we plan to retire the three remaining 737-300 in our fleet.", "During 2010 we plan to take delivery of 14 new aircraft, including to 777, to 737-900ERs and 10 737-800s. We expect to receive one of these 800s in late December and we\u2019ll pay to the interest service in January, 2011. In addition, during the first quarter we will place into service three leased 757-300s. By the end of June, our mainline fleet counts will be down seven aircraft year-over-year and our regional fleet count will be down 15 aircraft year-over-year.", "Moving onto the balance sheet, last quarter we completed a $644 million EETC transaction. This included an A and B tranche with a blended coupon of 7.5%. $179 million of the proceeds will go to refinance eight aircrafts that unencumbered in the first half of the year. The remaining proceeds will be used to finance 11 of the new aircraft deliveries this year.", "We have back-up financing for the remaining three 737 deliveries in 2010, so we will explore other financing alternatives. In December, we issued $230 million of 4.5% convertible notes. The notes mature in January 2015 and are convertible into common stock at an initial conversion price of approximately $19.87. We ended the year with $2.86 billion unrestricted cash and short term investments.", "As a percentage of the last 12 months\u2019 revenue, cash was approximately 23%. We expect to end the first quarter with approximately $2.9 billion to $3 billion of unrestricted cash and short term investments. For full year 2010, we estimate our cash capital expenditures related to fleet will be approximately $265 million. This includes aircraft, winglets, and our new flat bed business first seats. Our non-fleet cash capital expenditures will be approximately $140 million.", "We estimate our net purchase deposits for the year will be $25 million. Earlier this month, we contributed $34 million to a defined benefit pension plan. We estimate our remaining minimum defined benefit pension funding requirements for this year are approximately $85 million.", "In conclusion, the last couple of years have been a challenge for both Continental and the industry. We\u2019ve taken actions that will better prepare to us meet our future goals and strengthen the airline. We\u2019ve adjusted capacity to meet the new level of demand. We\u2019ve continued to make investments in our products and our fleets. We now offer customers the best network in our history and are now part of the best alliance in the world.", "We continue to better merchandise our product, offering customers more choice while growing our revenue streams, and we\u2019re investing in technology to provide efficiencies and reduced costs. We need to, and we will continue to adapt to the competitive environments on both the revenue and the cost front. Our goal is to deliver a meaningful sustained profitability that benefits our shareholders, employees, and the customers we serve each day.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Jeff.", "Jeff Smisek", "Thanks, Jim and Zane. We\u2019re at the very beginning of the economic recovery, and we don\u2019t know how long that recovery will take, but I suspect it will belong and slow. That said a long and slow recovery is better than what we faced in 2008 and 2009. We\u2019ve seen a lot of changes in our industry as it\u2019s weathered many challenges over the past couple years. I think you\u2019ll see even more changes ahead for the industry. Certainly, you will change at Continental.", "We need to start making money and to keep making money. To do this, we\u2019ll need to take thoughtful and measured risks by trying out some different approaches to the business, and you\u2019ll see a number of changes at Continental as a result. What we won\u2019t ever change, our culture of working together and our commitment to providing clean, safe, and reliable air transportation.", "We have a great franchise. Never in the history of Continental have we had a better fleet, a better network, better facilities, a better product, or better people. I\u2019m confident that my coworkers, working together, can return to us profitability and put us in a position to sustain that profitability. We owe it to our employees to provide a future that is more stable and secure than the past and we owe it to our stockholders to start making money and to keep making money. We are committed to doing just that.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over the DeAnne to begin our Q-and-A.", "DeAnne Gabel", "Thank you Jeff, Jim, and Zane, with that we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session for the analyst, followed by the question-and-answer session for the media. Christine, if you could please review the Q-and-A process, we\u2019re ready to he begin.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "Jeff, I just wanted to ask a question on your last comment there, which is getting back to profitability, clearly that would be cyclical, but to sustain profitability we\u2019d have to argue that there\u2019s been some structural change, because every downturn sees this industry lose money. I\u2019m curious what those changes might be, what structural changes you think you can make to actually sustain it in the next down cycle?", "Jeff Smisek", "I think there are a couple of structural changes. One I think you\u2019re seeing as the industry further, not only unbundled its product, but discovers its merchandising power, and the ability to sell goods and services and generate ancillary revenue that has a very significant margin. I think that\u2019s structural change that unfolding in this industry and will continue for a considerable period of time.", "The second structural change, I think is the transformation of self service in this industry. Customers are demanding more and more and expecting more self service, and we\u2019re investing technology that will permit that throughout the process. That is during the purchase process, post purchase at the airport, after the flight itself and that technology is going tone able not only ultimately better customer service and more consistent customer service, but also I think significant cost savings in the industry.", "So I think the combination of unbundling and merchandising, coupled with more and more customer self service and investment in technology I think is a structural change in this industry that hopefully will lead to sustainable profitability.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "If we look at your ancillary trends, even before bag fees, you guys generated a fair amount of non-fare revenue in the past. So that didn\u2019t drive sustained profitability, so why wouldn\u2019t this just get competed away as well? I would think the industry would need to change more than just get a revenue stream out of fares and into ancillaries.", "Jeff Smisek", "I think that you\u2019re assuming that you\u2019re just fracturing the fares and keeping the fares the say. I think what you are going to see is the ability to merchandise goods and services in addition to what you would expect the traditional fares. So I think its additive.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "One last question is just on your capacity comments. You talked about capacity discipline, but you\u2019d also talked in the past, as a management team, about long term capacity growth rate in the mid single digits. How long do you think it takes for us to get back to those levels?", "Jeff Smisek", "I\u2019m not sure that we have that expectation going forward.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "So that\u2019s a change from before, the fleet doesn\u2019t\u2026?", "Jeff Smisek", "As I said, there are lots of things to need to change at Continental and that\u2019s one of them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus.", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus", "I just want to peel the onion a little bit on the RASM guidance. I think you said it was going to be down 3%. To me, that seems like kind of a sequential step backwards. I think if you adjust for some of the Thanksgiving shift and you look at what the comp did from December \u201808 into January \u201809. I know it\u2019s preliminary, but is there anything in that number that we should be aware of in terms of something that would make at tough comp because I was expecting that to be maybe in positive territory.", "Jim Compton", "Hunter, this is Jim. As you mentioned, we talked about and again, it\u2019s over a week and things will change, but on the consolidated RASM, we\u2019re looking for it to be down around 3%. I think the one thing point to that in the commentary we talked a number of things as to why December outperformed expectations.", "One of those things is the strong leaser period that we had over the Christmas period. Both from a yield point of view relatively to prior to the December period. So think about it. No different than the contribution to RASM from leaser in the summer, historically stronger than in the fall.", "So I think what we\u2019re seeing is some of that affect, when you look at January versus December, that kind of seasonal strength of the leaser yields and the contributions to RASM, coupled in with our commentary that we are seeing business traffic come back slowly, but we\u2019re stressing the word slowly. So I think that kind of smooth the line as how we look at it versus a step function coming off of November, December, and January, but that seasonal factor, that I think we\u2019re seeing on the leaser side.", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus", "Wouldn\u2019t the seasonal factor kind of be washed down if you\u2019re just looking at it on a year-over-year change basis?", "Jeff Smisek", "Yes, but I think again the industry capacity, again, leaser time, at that the margins, both last summer and this December, when you talk about industry capacity those are periods of time where actually capacity is, in terms of the volatile demand out there, i.e. stronger leaser demand, is much more in think than we\u2019ve seen in the past, even a year ago. So I think you do break away from some of the seasonality.", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess quickly, Jeff, your decision to work 2010 pro bono, if you guys don\u2019t make an operating profit, are you trying to send a message to your labor groups that you expect them to take maybe a commensurate, but a higher percentage of risk and they\u2019re on compensation maybe tie more of their salary and their competition to overall company results?", "Jeff Smisek", "No, I\u2019m not, although I am a big believer in incentive compensation as you know. We ever historically had a profit sharing plan in Continental. The reason that I decided not to take a salary or bonus until we become profitable on an annual basis is I wanted to send a very strong sign to the entire Continental team that we really need to focus on profitability.", "I\u2019m not asking anyone else to take a cut, and this is not a signal of bad things to come, but rather it focuses a lot of attention on the need to become profitable, and I think it\u2019s gotten a lot of attention, and that was what I desired.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Chase - Barclays Capital.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Jim, could you walk us through what you think the transition impact to Star Alliance was and how that might have played through months, and how you think, if any about impact it might be having in January. By the way, I think I heard two things in there. I forget who said what, but I thought one of you had said you were connecting as many passengers, and I thought I heard you say twice as many?", "Jim Compton", "Gary, first on that, what we were comparing was the Frankfurt hub to Lufthansa today and what we connect in versus last December looking at Amsterdam and Paris where we were connecting our alliance passengers last year. So if you took the seats in Frankfurt today, compared to the seats in Paris and Amsterdam last year, we have 65% less seats.", "It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have as much obviously seats into Frankfurt as we did last year into Paris and Amsterdam, but we\u2019re already seeing 85% of the connecting passengers, of what we carried across Paris and Amsterdam last year, we\u2019re already seeing 85% of that being connected over Frankfurt into the Lufthansa system. So that translated into twice as many passengers per seat connecting over Frankfurt as were connecting over Amsterdam and Paris last year.", "Again, to answer your kind of the general question, that\u2019s a sign to us that\u2019s really clear that star is pulling up very nicely and I would say better than our expectations, part of star is the relationship with united, and Jeff mentioned in his comments that already connecting passengers to and from united are exceeding where Delta and Northwest were combined, again, another example that it\u2019s spooling up very nicely for us with our partners in star and schools better than our original expectation.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "If I could just follow up, too, on the RASM guidance for January, and just the sequential issue that you were just speaking to, if I look back, I want to say that December comp last year was up some where in the 4% range you noted in the prepared remarks down 4/8 in January. That obviously means the comps getting substantially easier as you move from December to January, yet what you are expecting for RASM seems about the same. Is there something in those comps that, in other words, was there something in the history that we need to understand, or should we really read it as the kind of deceleration that that would imply?", "Jim Compton", "I think it\u2019s a combination of we\u2019re seeing slight improvement in business traffic that we think is going to be a long and slow haul as we go forward and coupled with, what I mentioned is the RASM contribution from leaser in periods, where industry capacity for leaser periods is, on a relative basis tighter, you see that contribution spiking more in leaser periods in this environment.", "As you walk away from that, that\u2019s the piece we\u2019re losing once you get past the New Year\u2019s Day return in January. So the slight improvement that we\u2019re estimating is, again that slow improvement in traffic. Again in terms of what was happening last year, I mentioned that happened at the end of November that affected for awhile as we went through the first half of 2009.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Are your corporate revenues up yet year-on-year?", "Zane Rowe", "Let me refer to a slide that we did in the past and I think in May, we talked about high yield revenue being down about 35%. I\u2019m talking about high yield, so that includes our corporate contract, but we also look at business traffic as fares within seven days. That\u2019s what that slide reports. I thought it would be really clear on kind of what I\u2019m defining. We saw in that December basically down 1%.", "So again, that\u2019s sequential improvement, but I do want to highlight that, as Jeff also mentioned, that last year we began the slide on traffic in fourth quarter of \u201808 and so some of that\u2019s the comps year-over-year that includes sequential improvement. So a good little bit of improvement and favorable comps drove that change from June to December.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Linenberg - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Mike Linenberg - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Two questions here. Zane, if you can just clarify, when you talked about the EETC deal that you did that brought in $644 million, you walked through the airplanes that were securing that. When I look at the press release that you put out today, it looks like there\u2019s some remainder that is the remainder of the proceeds that will be used for general corporate purposes. So I just want know is there a piece and how big is that and does that show up in the first quarter?", "Gerry Laderman", "Mike, this is Gerry. So the press release talked about the use of proceeds that was in the prospectus supplement, as far as general corporate purposes because cash is sort of fungible. From my perspective, from the corporate finance perspective, the reason for raising that money was because we had these maturities on existing aircraft in the first half of this year and we\u2019ll take that when we get that cash, we will pledge those aircraft to the EETC.", "Mike Linenberg - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Then my second question and this is to Jim. I think over the last couple months, we\u2019ve seen some route announcements. In the past you\u2019ve been very good about doing hub flying and the more recent ads have been non-hub flying. I\u2019m referring to some of the West Coast to Hawaii and I saw that you\u2019re adding a segment up to Anchorage out of Portland.", "I\u2019m just curious, number one, are you being opportunistic here and you\u2019re seeing some of the capacity that has pulled out of that market is creating an opportunity? Number two, is some of this begs driven by the fact that now that you\u2019re tied up with united, you as a carrier probably have much stronger brand presence or just presence in West Coast markets, whether it be L.A., San Fran, Denver? Can you just give us some color, insight into your thinking on these addition, these non hub additions.", "Jim Compton", "I\u2019ll start with the partnership with united. We are seeing stronger demand off the West Coast to Hawaii, first of all. That, I think is again, one of the spooling up of our partnership with United, both in Star and obvious well United bilaterally. So we are seeing that increasing demand of the West Coast to Hawaii.", "The second thing is we serve more destinations in the pacific than any other carrier. One of the ways we get people to the pacific is off the West Coast through Hawaii. We have increased demand, West Coast to Hawaii, and we also have demand into the Micronesia Islands that we\u2019re trying to meet and with a nice market like Fiji being served out of Honolulu and Guam that also added to that need for demand.", "So the West Coast to Hawaii is an opportunity for us to make sure that one we continue to meet that demand for West Coast to Hawaii that we\u2019re seeing, as well as support the Micronesia demand that we have going out over Hawaii. That allows us to do that. The Alaska anchorage, the Portland flight, that\u2019s seasonal flying and we\u2019re able to do it using that aircraft really efficiently, and it\u2019s a market we\u2019ve been in before and trying to satisfy the demand out there in the summer.", "Mike Linenberg - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Jim, presumably these flights, will they all ultimately carry the united code? Does that in that\u2019s part of the plan, right?", "Jim Compton", "Yes, I think our plan from a code perspective, is the phased approach somewhat that you can do, but clearly, again their presence out there is helping us in those markets like that. So yes, I think we\u2019ll continue to build on that him relationship.", "Jeff Smisek", "Mike, this is Jeff. I mean, code is important as you know, but the frequent flyer response, we actually drives far greater value than code share.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Christy - UBS.", "Kevin Christy - UBS", "Just to kill the minus 3%, Jim, did you say whether leaning towards 3% domestic or international was doing better or worse than that? If the relative trends from December on international versus domestic would continue into January?", "Jim Compton", "Our commentary in January was consolidated mainline. We don\u2019t break it out and again, it\u2019s too early for know comment on that, we\u2019ll stick with that. As I mentioned, it\u2019s still a week to go and the numbers are changing and so we\u2019ll stick with the consolidated mainline.", "Kevin Christy - UBS", "I think in the past, you\u2019d indicated or management team had indicated losing share to the OTAs through website direct. I imagine that would still be continuing, particularly in a seasonally weaker demand period like January, February. Can you comment on if that\u2019s still happening and whether if it\u2019s a concern and whether ultimately be a reaction to that?", "Jim Compton", "I think what we\u2019ve seen over the past year and we\u2019ve talked about it a little bit is that a couple things. Obviously, the OTAs removable fees, I think there\u2019s a natural behavior change, obviously just to be about place that versus Continental.com or quite frankly any other supplier side.", "I would say also that as we\u2019ve talked through the year and we\u2019ve talked about business traffic declining, that business traffic, quite frankly is fundamentally stronger in your hub. As we optimize revenue, we also begin to carry more flow traffic versus local traffic. Continental.com\u2019s presence is going to be greater in local marks than it would be in slow markets.", "So going forward, I really can\u2019t comment on it, but as to where it would end up, but in improving economy that we\u2019re seeing slowly improving business traffic will translate into local market strengthening and so that effect the elasticity effect I\u2019ve mentioned is real, but that effect of local versus flow should abate that.", "Kevin Christy - UBS", "One last one, do your contracts pay the OTAs less for bookings kind of the back haul bookings rather than out of Newark out of your hubs?", "Jim Compton", "We don\u2019t comment on our contract.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie - Next Generation.", "Dan McKenzie - Next Generation", "I wanted to circle back on the commentary related to the unbundling of the product even further. It sounds like there are a number of new ancillary revenue initiatives in the works. I\u2019m wondering if you can provide some perspective about how investors should think about the materiality of these initiatives. I guess, in particular, some of the other airlines have quantified partly their ancillary revenues today and the incremental revenues they\u2019re targeting. So I\u2019m wondering if Continental could do the same.", "Jeff Smisek", "We\u2019re not going to quantify at this time, but I will tell you that we do indeed have a number of initiatives in the works, and we\u2019ll announce them as we roll them out. In terms of materiality, recognize that there is, I think, somewhat quantitative difference in the margin associated with ancillary revenue versus our core product. So I think that ultimately the ancillary revenues can become a significant portion of our future profitability.", "Dan McKenzie - Next Generation", "The second question here is really more housecleaning. Zane, given where Continental stock price is, I\u2019m wondering if some of the convertible notes have already converted at this point. I guess, what I\u2019m wondering is if the interest expense assumes, for the years, assumes at the converts are, in fact, converted.", "Zane Rowe", "We can\u2019t comment on that, unfortunately. Dan, I will tell you that Jerry is actively looking at how we optimize things, but we can\u2019t comment on forward-looking in that regard.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Helane Becker - Jesup & Lamont.", "Helane Becker - Jesup & Lamont", "Jeff, you guys have applied for HEI with ANA and United for Japanese in Pacific routes. Can you just say what you think the timing own that is going to be? Because, I guess there\u2019s been press reports that the U.S. DOT and DOJ can get it done in less than six months, and yet that hasn\u2019t necessarily been the case in the past. So I\u2019m kind of wondering if you\u2019re thinking in terms of 2010 or \u201811 event.", "Jeff Smisek", "I am not even going to attempt to prognosticate on how quickly DOT and DOJ, I can go through the process. The application Antitrust Immunity with respect to the treaty, I believe were due in February. We would anticipate reasonably prompt review of our application, but I can\u2019t give you a specific timeframe.", "Nene Foxhall", "With that Christine, we are ready to move on to the question-and-answer session for the media, if you could please review the Q-and-A process.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now take questions from the media. (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Ted Reid - TheStreet.com.", "Ted Reid - TheStreet.com", "I have a couple of questions about Star. First of all, in Europe, you\u2019re just saying that Frankfurt just a better hub, it has better connections, more connections than either of the other two? Is that the dynamic there? Secondly, what\u2019s the major location for domestic benefit with United?", "Jeff Smisek", "Ted this is Jeff, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re really weak on the phone. We\u2019re having a hard time hearing you. Could you repeat your question, please?", "Ted Reid - TheStreet.com", "How about now? My first question is you just saying that Frankfurt is a better hub? Is that what the dynamic is? Better than either of the other two hubs with more connections? Is that the dynamic?", "Jim Compton", "It is a better hub, but it\u2019s a better hub for a combination of things. One, Star again is a much more expansive network from where we came from, so the number of destinations that we\u2019re able to offer is much greater is that what we\u2019re able to offer in the past and so forth. So not only is it the terrific facility, the breadth of what we can do out of Frankfurt is very powerful in terms of connecting traffic.", "Ted Reid - TheStreet.com", "Secondly, on the domestic side, what\u2019s the major benefit of the link-up on the domestic side? Is there one particular hub or city? Also, is there any benefit that you\u2019re seeing from linking up with U.S. Airways?", "Jim Compton", "Let me talk about domestic briefly. The beauty of our alliance with United and the beauty of our alliance in Star, first, we have partners who want us to succeed as opposed to want to kill us, and that\u2019s a positive. Secondly, with United, United and we have very complimentary route network.", "United and we are essentially not competitors, although legally my general counsel will tell me, we are competitors, we essential aren\u2019t in the sense that we are very little over that and what you want in the line is precisely is that, you complimentarity so that you provide for your customers a broad array of destinations and connection points. That\u2019s what United and Star Alliance bring us. Our U.S. Airways is helpful as well with us as a partner, but clearly not as important to us as united, given the complimentarity of our network with United.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Newman - The Record.", "Richard Newman - The Record", "I want to ask you if the regional capacity cuts at New York in particular, both in \u201809 and coming in this year, what destinations were to that effect as far as frequencies and or routes.", "Jim Compton", "It really has no appreciable effect on frequency or destinations in Newark.", "Jeff Smisek", "Overtime, what you\u2019re going to Newark is fewer regional jets and more mainline jets as we continue to grow our hub there. We have plenty of room for future growth in Newark it\u2019s a very powerful hub for us. One regional jet takes up the same airspace and slot as one 777 or 787 for the future. So I think you\u2019ll see, overtime, a trend of fewer and fewer regional jet operations in our Newark hub and more mainline operations.", "Richard Newman - The Record", "How might that affect the customers who use those shorter hauls?", "Jeff Smisek", "Well, I think we\u2019ll continue to keep the customers satisfied in the shorter hauls. It\u2019s less as we grow, especially in the StarAlliance, we are also be able to grow the feed, and many of those shorter hauls will be covered, for example, by Q400s, which you\u2019ll see as increasing usage of those Q400s. Candidly, those are great aircraft. They have essentially the same trip cost as of 145 and they have 24 additional seats. They\u2019re very quiet and very comfortable aircraft for those shorter home markets. So they satisfy the customers and they are more efficient operation for us to run.", "Nene Foxhall", "Christine, we have time for one more media questions.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Shannon Buggs - Houston Chronicle.", "Shannon Buggs - Houston Chronicle", "I didn\u2019t quite understand Jim\u2019s answer to the question from the Barclay\u2019s analyst. I thought it was a pretty clear yes or no answer, but I got confused. It was Continental revenues up year-over-year or not?", "Jim Compton", "Shannon, could you repeat the question you broke up on me?", "Shannon Buggs - Houston Chronicle", "I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t understand Jim\u2019s answer to the question from the Barclay\u2019s analyst that seemed like a yes or no question about whether or not Continental\u2019s revenues are up year-over-year or not, the corporate revenues.", "Jim Compton", "What I was trying to explain is that as we\u2019ve gone through the year in 2009 on the monthly basis, we\u2019ve seen the year-over-year trends improve. Back in May we were seeing 38% decline in high yield, which includes our corporate revenue, until December being down about 1%. In December, we\u2019re starting to see improvements in ticketing trends for future travel dates from the corporate side.", "So we think again that potential improvement is a combination of the year-over-year comps from some of the toughness of the fourth quarter of last year with also a modest growing strength in the ticketing going forward on the corporate side.", "Shannon Buggs - Houston Chronicle", "The year-over-year was a 1% decline.", "Jim Compton", "In December, it was down 1%, and it was down 38% in May in 2009.", "Shannon Buggs - Houston Chronicle", "There was a question about the ancillary fees at some of the new initiatives. I know you said you weren\u2019t going to talk about them until they roll out, but for the passengers who are trying to pay very close attention to how all of this is impacting them? What can they start to anticipate that they might see a change in?", "Jeff Smisek", "I think, what we\u2019re trying to do, and I think ultimately will accomplish is to provide our customers with various attributes of their flight that they can pick and choose from and determine what they want. ", "The way I would phrase it, we have historically served sort of a pizza with everything on it, and now what we\u2019re going do is let customers not only build their own pizza, but determine the size of their slice or whether they want the whole part, and some customers want and show reason and other don\u2019t and cannily for the lactose intolerant, if they don\u2019t want cheese they don\u2019t have pay for cheese either. So, what were going to elect people do is choose the level and type of services and attribute they have in travel and pay for those things that they choose and not pay for those things they don\u2019t choose and we think ultimately that is better for the customer and better for Continental", "Nene Foxhall", "Okay. Jeff, Jim, Zane, DeAnne, thanks for your participation this morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Please call corporate communications if any of you have further communications and with that we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Good morning and thanks for joining us. I want to start by thanking my coworkers for overcoming the many operational challenges we had this quarter. Despite those challenges, the remain committed to delivering a high-quality product and excellent customer service that our passengers come to expect from us. I also want to thank our customers and crews for their patience as we work through recover from the operational challenges caused by the volcanic ash plume in Europe. Beginning last Wednesday, the volcanic ash led to the cancellation of some UK-bound flights and most eastbound flights canceled on Thursday, escalating to the cancellation of virtually all our European operations for the next five days. ", "Yesterday, we resumed all our eastbound flights and today we began to operating a full schedule to Europe and have added extra flights as well as larger aircraft. We will continue to look for opportunities to add more seats to help re-accommodate our passengers. We understand how stressful it can be to be stranded faraway from home and also understand the difficulty our customers maybe experiencing in getting re-accommodated. We are keenly focused on getting our customers to their scheduled destination as quickly as possible.", "Now, turning to our financial results, for the first quarter of 2010, Continental reported a net loss of a $146 million, which is a loss of $1.05 per diluted share or a loss of $0.98 per diluted share excluding $10 million of severance and aircraft special charges. On the operational front, twice during the quarter, we had severe winter storms that forced us to suspend operations at our North Liberty Hub. Our team did an excellent job of getting the operation back on schedule and seeing to our customers. Our system wide mainline completion factor was 98.3% for the quarter. ", "Running an airline is a tough business. We have low barriers to entry and high barriers to exit, resulting in a highly fragmented and brutally competitive business, but it\u2019s prone to overcapacity. Notwithstanding this reality, I and my entire management team and my more than 40,000 coworkers around the world are committed to achieving and sustain profitability. To do that, we must increase revenue, decrease cost and take decisive actions to remain competitive.", "We are offering our customers more choice among the products and services they want and they are willing to pay for. And we will be offering additional products and services in the future. We continue to invest in modern fuel efficient aircraft and in our onboard product and are getting very good reviews for our flatbed seats, direct TV and audio/video on demand. We are also investing in self service technology that is better for our customers and less costly to Continental.", "We are changing at Continental and changing at a rapid pace, but two things won\u2019t change. Our commitment to providing clean, safe and reliable transportation and are working together culture of open, honest, and direct communication and treating each other and our customers with dignity and respect.", "Part of change is being thoughtful and responsive to changing industry dynamics. While I will not comment on recent press speculation concerning potential consolidation in our industry, I will say the following: as you would expect of a responsible management team, we are examining Continental\u2019s options and we will take whatever action we believe to be in the best interest of our coworkers, stockholders, customers, and the communities we serve. Neither I nor my colleagues will be commenting any further on consolidation matters at this time.", "In addition to leveraging the power of our membership and Star Alliance, and optimizing traditional passenger revenue, as I mentioned last quarter, we are focused on offering customers more control over the components of travel they select and pay for. We estimate bag fee revenue will be about $350 million this year. ", "Not only do we benefit from additional revenue, we also benefit operationally from not having as many as bags to handle. Of the customers that are subject to the bag fee, on a bags checked per passenger basis, since the fees were implemented. ", "We have seen a 17% drop in domestic first bags checked, a 66% drop in domestic second bags checked, a 52% drop in Latin second bags checked, and a 38% drop in trans-Atlantic second bags checked. Thus, our fees are affecting consumer behavior in a way that\u2019s good for us. In addition to bag fees, we have implemented and continued with floor, a number of other ancillary revenue opportunities. ", "During the quarter, we rolled out the option for customers to purchase premium seat assignments for economy class seats with extra legroom. This is an offering our customers clearly value and are willing to pay for and we are currently generating over a $100,000 a day from this initiative, that\u2019s revenue we never collected before. ", "Other example of expanded choice that we will offering customers this fall is high-quality healthy food for purchase in economy class on many US, Canadian, and certain Latin American routes. We estimate that on an annual basis, this will save us about $35 million, assuming we simply breakeven on food sales.", "Moving on to our network enhancements, at the end of March, we inaugurated non-stop daily service between Liberty and Munich, further enhancing our connectivity with Star Alliance Partners. We also increased our daily flights between New York and London\u2019s Heathrow Airport from three to four and we will add a fifth daily departure in October, bringing our total number of daily departures to Heathrow to seven, including our twice daily service from Houston. ", "London is an important part of our network and we are pleased to be to offer our customers increased schedule utility. In addition, beginning in June, all aircrafts scheduled for Heathrow flights will feature our new flatbed business first seats, a product enhancement our customers who have experienced it, clearly enjoy.", "We continue to believe in and exercise capacity discipline. We have pulled down our estimates for the year yet again as we fine tuned our falls schedule. For 2010, we now expect our consolidated and mainline capacity is going to be up only 0.5% to 1.5% with our mainline domestic capacity down a 0.5% to 1.5% year-over-year and our mainline international capacity up 2% to 3% year-over-year.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Jim and Zane to discuss the quarter\u2019s revenue and cost performance details.", "Jim Compton", "", "Thanks, Jeff. I join Jeff in thanking our coworkers for running a great operation this past quarter, despite a lot of operational challenges. They have also done a superb job implementing and executing on our Star Alliance membership. ", "Throughout the quarter, our mainline passenger RASM, on a length of haul adjusted basis, outperformed the industry average. While it is not unusual for us to run a RASM premium to the industry, for the last six months, our RASM has outperformed the average of the APA reporting carrier by anywhere from six to more than 10 basis points. And for the first quarter, our RASM outperformed the industry by 8.6 points. So we feel pretty good about our relative performance as it relates to RASM.", "In each of the months throughout the first quarter, we experienced sequential improvement in our year-over-year RASM percent changes. The results of the first quarter was that mainline RASM was up 5.4% due to strong load factors which were up 4.3 points year-over-year, while main line yields were about flat year-over-year. ", "Regional RASM was up 16.7% year-over-year, due to both stronger yield, which were up 10% year-over-year and stronger load factor which was up 4.3 points. As the economy started its downturn, regional yields were where we first saw the hit to revenue, as regional markets are more sensitive to business traffic. So it is an encouraging sign to see these markets rebound. ", "That said we are still very early in what maybe a long recovery. But we like the direction of the recent trend. Throughout January, February and March, we saw improvement in leisure yield. So this trend bodes well for the summer. We have also seen sequential improvements in the year-over-year change in high yield passengers. ", "In a recovery, it is difficult to see high yield passenger volumes come back first, so you can begin to manage yields up, which we have begun to do. However, the improvement so far has been modest with high yield revenue in passengers up year-over-year in the first quarter, but still below first quarter 2008 level.", "We continued to see sequential improvement in trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific year-over-year business first RASM throughout the quarter attributable to both load factors and yield improvement. However, the year-over-year comps for the first quarter were pretty easy. On a year over two-year basis, both trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific business first load factors were up several points, but yields were still negative. However, the yield trends are headed in the right direction.", "And Star Alliance continues to pull up very nicely. We are pleased with the revenue result so far from the alliance. On a year-over-year basis, our first quarter total passenger revenue was up 7.1%. But our total partner revenue was up 39%, mostly due to our membership in Star. ", "Granted, last year is a bit of an abnormal comp as the economy and passenger revenue were in the free fall. But the Alliance result versus the first quarter 2008 are very encouraging as well. On a year over two-year basis, our first quarter total passenger revenues were down 13%, but our total partner revenue was up slightly. This is particularly impressive as we are still in the beginning stages of pulling up the Alliance.", "Now turning to the second quarter. Corporate revenue booking trends are positive and we are seeing a pickup in bookings inside of 14 days, so we are managing to a more normal booking pattern. Before I discuss April RASM expectation, I want to remind everyone that the year-over-year RASM comps gets sequentially easier as we move through the second quarter. Last April, our consolidated RASM was down 13.1% year-over-year with both May and June down 19.9% year-over-year. Also, please note that the April \u201909 comp is 6.5 points lower than the March \u201909 comparison. ", "As Jeff mentioned, our European operations were greatly impacted by the volcanic ash plume in Europe. We cancelled 400 flights or approximately 300 million ASM related to this event and estimate the negative passenger revenue impact at approximately $24 million. We still have over a week less in the month of April and things will likely change. ", "But based on the data thus far including the revenue and capacity impact related to the volcanic ash disruption, we are currently estimating consolidated April RASM will be up about 14% year-over-year. And main line April RASM will be up about 12% year-over-year. Again, these numbers are preliminary estimates based on the data we have for April thus far and likely will change.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Zane.", "Zane Rowe", "", "Thanks Jim. I want to begin by thanking the entire Continental team for running an excellent operations despite numerous weather events during the quarter. Our team also did a good job of controlling cost during the quarter. We will look to ways to reduce cost company wide and to operate more efficiently as we focus on achieving and sustaining profitability.", "Our first quarter main line CASM, holding fuel rate constant and excluding special items was up 3.1%. CASM was negatively impacted by the severe winter storms during the quarter including blizzard like conditions in the New York area that caused us to suspend operations twice at Liberty International. We estimate these closures to have negatively impacted the first quarter results by approximately $15 million. For the full-year 2010, excluding special items and holding fuel rate constant, we expect both our consolidated and main line CASM to be up 1.5% to 2.5% year-over-year.", "We are seeing some cost pressure from the lower capacity outlook and increased depreciation expense from the acceleration of certain projects. In addition, we are seeing an increase in our frequent flyer activity with our stock partners, which results in higher expense from higher frequent flyers earning miles in Continental as well as hire reward expense as our one pass members take advantage of our expanded network.", "Our first quarter consolidated fuel price including taxes and hedge impacts was $2.15 per gallon, given the current forward curve, we estimate that including taxes and hedge impacts, our second quarter consolidated fuel price will be $2.28 per gallon, and for the full year $2.30.", "We currently have about 30% of our remaining 2010 fuel needs hedge using a mix of swap and call option. We continue to hedge our field exposure to mitigate some of the volatility of fuel prices. Our hedge position is outlined in our investor update. Our fuel efficient fleet remains our best hedge against rising fuel prices and we continue to add modern fuel efficient aircraft to our fleet.", "During the first quarter, we retired our three remaining 737 300 aircraft and ended the quarter with 333 main line aircraft in service. Our regional fleet decreased to 253 aircraft as we removed seven CRJ-200 and four Embraer 145 from our capacity purchase agreement. By the end of June, our mainline fleet will be down 14 aircraft year-over-year and our regional fleet counts will be down 15 aircrafts year-over-year.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $3.15 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. As a percentage of our last 12 months revenue, cash was approximately 25%. We expect to end the second quarter with between $3 billion and $3.1 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investment. For the full-year 2010, we estimate our cash capital expenditures will be approximately $425 million. This includes both non-aircraft and aircraft related expenditures.", "Earlier this month, we contributed $40 million to our defined benefit pension plan, bringing our year-to-date contributions to $74 million. We estimate our remaining minimum defined benefit pension funding requirement for this year are approximately $50 million.", "In conclusion, our entire team is focused on returning to profitability and sustaining that profitability. We have the best employees in the business and they deliver an industry leading products everyday. We offer customers a globally diverse network, which is further enhanced by being part of the best and largest alliance in the world. ", "We have committed to make smart investments in our products that are customers\u2019 value and are willing to pay for. We are well positioned with our modern fuel efficient fleet, which will be further enhanced by the addition of the 787 next year. We are growing our revenue stream, while offering our customers more product choices and we are willing to challenge the way we have done things in the past and explore new opportunities. ", "With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Thanks Jim and Zane. The economic environment is clearly improving and we are encouraged by that trend. However, we are only in the early stages of the recovery. Business travel is indeed returning, but at a slow pace. ", "A certain amount of caution regarding business trend is warranted as we are uncertain as to the level to which business travel will return. That said, the trends we have been seeing on the leader side bode well for the peak summer season. As always, we will continue to monitor the operating environment and will adapt if necessary to the challenges that arise. ", "We will continue to explore different approaches to the business and are willing to take measured and thoughtful product risk so we can start making money again. We are also well attuned to industry and competitive dynamics and will make changes necessitated by those dynamics. We have a great franchise and many strengths. We remain committed to leveraging those strength to return to and sustain profitability.

(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ", "Jamie Baker \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi. Good morning, everybody. A question probably for Zane. The ex-fuel CASM for the remainder of the year appears to have gone up slightly, basically in line with the amount of capacity that ends now \u2013 have been withdrawn. Makes perfectly good sense. But were there any changes to the underlying profit-sharing assumption, relative to the earlier ex-fuel CASM guidance that you had given?", "Zane Rowe ", "Jamie, unfortunately I can\u2019t comment on that piece in particular. And as you know there are a lot of moving parts. I think I highlighted the critical components of the change, but I can\u2019t comment on our underlying profit assumption there.", "Jamie Baker \u2013 JPMorgan", "Let me ask the question in a slightly different way. When you provided your last guidance update in March, had you already captured the revision to your profit-sharing program that was announced earlier in the year?", "Zane Rowe ", "", "Yes, that\u2019s fair to assume Jaime.", "Jamie Baker \u2013 JPMorgan", "That\u2019s fair to assume. Okay, thanks, that\u2019s it.", "Zane Rowe ", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Hudson Securities. Please go ahead. ", "Dan McKenzie \u2013 Hudson Securities ", "Hi, good morning guys.", "Zane Rowe ", "", "Good morning.", "Dan McKenzie \u2013 Hudson Securities ", "Corporate travel managers tell me that eight frequencies a day between New York City and London Heathrow seems to be the magic number, for when corporate travel managers become indifferent to a carrier's schedules versus the competition. And feel free to disagree with that, but I see you folks are increasing the frequencies to five a day. And I guess my question is how much flexibility does Continental have? And this is assuming Continental ultimately joins the joint venture here to find more Heathrow slots from other JV partners?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Hi Dan, this is Jeff. We were locked out of Heathrow for a long time and it\u2019s taken us a while to build the portfolio we have got and we are pretty pleased with ultimately being able to get five flights a day out of New York and twice a day out of Houston. But we will continue to look for growth opportunities. ", "Heathrow is an important, although from the perspective of our overall ASMs to Europe, relatively modest. At this point, we want to grow that and continue to grow that. So it\u2019s really a function of slot availability, the time of the slots and the price of slots, but we are always interested in additional slots in the Heathrow, it\u2019s a very important market for us and a growing one.", "Dan McKenzie \u2013 Hudson Securities ", "Okay, understood. And then, I guess my second question here is can you talk about the flexibility to reduce regional jets?", "Jim Compton", "", "Hi Dan, it\u2019s Jim. I think the \u2013 we are actually \u2013 right now quite frankly in terms of our capacity, we are rarely comfortable with our regional capacity going forward. We have obviously contractual agreement with our partner, we can work within those contractual agreements. But right now, so there is \u2013 there is obviously flexibility with utilization within those contracts and so forth, but right now we are very comfortable with where we are at with our capacity.", "Dan McKenzie \u2013 Hudson Securities ", "Okay, understood. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Hunter Keay from Stifel Nicolaus, please go ahead. ", "Hunter Keay \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks, good morning.", "Jim Compton", "", "Good morning.", "", "Hunter Keay \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Jim, do you think the industry is spilling business travel right now? I mean load factors are high, CASM has come in a little bit light than most people are looking for this quarter. And we hear continued commentary how close in bookings are gradually improving and the curve is sort of normalizing. And if so, it's a two part question. If you are spilling, are you willing to maybe take some risk to drive your advance bookings down a little bit in the hopes that some of the other business travel will potentially spill under your aircraft? Do you think that's happening right now or is that dynamic you could see unfolding?", "Jim Compton", "", "If I understand I question, we are managing to a business \u2013 different business curve year-over-year as it\u2019s reflected even in our investor update again where we talk about bookings over the next six weeks, for instance, and the domestic being down versus last year. Very similar to what we said in the January investor update, and so continue to look for that. And then if you looked at our actual load factor both that we reported in February, January, February and March, they were all up year-over-year. ", "So what it does is, kind of validates that the booking curve, the way we are managing it has worked for us over the last quarter. And in this investor update we are basically saying the bookings in the first six weeks domestically are down year-over-year. So we will continue to do that, because I do think it\u2019s slowly coming back. Those business traffic balances both I and Jeff mentioned, but it really slow and the absolute value are still down from 2008, getting closer more towards 2007, but on the revenue perspective, still way down from 2008.", "Hunter Keay \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "So I guess, maybe the question, a better way to put it is, would you be willing to take risks in the sense of obviously managing spill versus spoil. There is a sweet spot in there somewhere. Would you be willing to maybe spoil some seats to take the risk that you give yourself the opportunity to capitalize and maybe better than expected bookings?", "Jim Compton", "", "I mean in the sense that by describing that our book load factor, that we are managing back toward a normal book load factor which means you are managing more toward in an environment where you are managing at the risk. I think we have moved in that direction and so we will continue to look like that, because clearly load factors are high and we would like mange up the yields.", "Hunter Keay \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.", "Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes, good morning. Jeff, in the past, I think you've said that Continental would consider or at least reconsider M&A if it found it was losing market share in the corporate market to merge Delta, Northwest. And so you sort of admitted earlier that you are at least looking at all options and Delta said on their call they think they have won about $100 million in business. So should we assume that you have seen a degradation in your corporate share where you are competing against Delta?", "Jeff Smisek", "I don\u2019t know that I would characterize it quite that way. I will tell you that we are a business travel airline and very focused on that and we continue to invest in our onboard product, for example in flatbed seats, AVOD, modern fleet to 787 coming and to attract corporate travel. ", "We are keenly focused on it. I think you could \u2013 I think you need to perhaps at Delta is the source of that corporate traffic, because there are other people that they must be claiming to take corporate traffic from. Clearly, we are in battle with Delta in New York, there is not question about that and in Latin America. I think we hold our own \u2013 certainly hold our own in the product, but I would \u2013 I can\u2019t really comment on Delta\u2019s numbers or where they are sourcing.", "Jim Compton", "", "Hi Bill, this is Jim. And I \u2013 in their commentary, I also know they mentioned that they weren\u2019t sure where it\u2019s coming from. So looking at our data, we actually see pretty consistent share out there versus what\u2019s the \u2013 particularly in New York.", "Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Also, can I ask you to comment a little bit on your updated capacity guidance? I realize some of it in the near term may be related to the volcanic disruptions. But one would think that if you were bullish on revenue, airlines generally would be adding to capacity, not cutting, but you are going in the opposite direction. Does that suggest a more cautious outlook from you?", "Jeff Smisek", "Bill this is Jeff. I am not sure it\u2019s a cautious outlook as \u2013 what it really is, is we are just fine tuning the schedule. Obviously you have got the SM to come out from the volcano and things like that. But we have also had some aircraft delivery delays, because of the \u2013 the issues with the (inaudible) seats. ", "If you go out to Boeing Field, you will see a number of our aircraft scattered around the fields right now. And we are working to get seats on those aircraft and get the aircraft delivered. So it\u2019s really more a recognition of some delivery delays we have got. But I will tell you we are focused on capacity discipline here. We want to make money here. And at Continental, we are probably have committed to the past in terms of spooling up utilization and spooling up capacity little too quickly and relative to demand and pricing. And we are going to be cautious and thoughtful about that.", "Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I would applaud your discipline. I don't want you to think that I want to see you grow too fast. I just was curious if that suggested change in view. Thank you for the time.", "Jeff Smisek", "You bet.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Kevin Crissey from UBS. Please go ahead. ", "Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS", "Hi, good morning. Jim, maybe this is for you. In January, I think you guided January RASM to down, I don't know, was it 3% or 4% and it came in at 1%. What was it that changed in January then? And what would have to happen to your 14%, to get your 14% number to be a percent or two higher than that RASM that you have guided to for April?", "Jim Compton", "", "Yes. Kevin I think the \u2013 right now I think it\u2019s really a function of business traffic and we have certain expectations that we have talked about the rate of growth in business traffic. My guess if we began to see business traffic accelerate versus our expectation that would be obviously trying for higher RASM. But again at this point, what we are seeing is a very slow pace to business traffic coming back.", "Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS", "Okay, and, well I guess I should just follow-up. I mean at this point in the month, I know business traveler books close in, but it's not that much walk-up. And then last week you get maybe 1% of your revenue for the month booked in for travel in the last week. So you got to have maybe 10% of revenues still left for the month. So to be off by a couple percent in January was kind of surprising, maybe it was just conservative guidance and that's what I am really trying to work around. 14%, I don't think is a bad number. I just wanted to assess whether there is a conservatism there.", "Jim Compton", "", "Yes, I mean, again as I mentioned, it\u2019s what we see today and (inaudible) has also ", "mentioned their likelihood change, because it\u2019s the best information that we have as we look at April today.", "Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS", "Okay, and Air Tran mentioned losing some share to the online travel agencies. And I recall, I think in the past you have indicated something to that degree. What are your thoughts these days on that, we will be lapping the booking fee cuts from a year-ago and just want to get a sense for where that stands?", "Jim Compton", "", "Obviously looking back, I think you are right. I think around last May of last year, the booking fees on the online agency they pulled and so we thought that effect our penetration on Continental.com. I will tell you that we see great strength on Continental.com today and we continue to invest in it and the feedback that we get is great. But you are right, we begin to lap that in May, but clearly there was an effect on our penetration rates.", "Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS", "So would you ramp up, I mean to defend your website, do you ramp up your online advertising or whatever, Google and such?", "Jim Compton", "", "The way I would like to think about it is reinvest in our website to bring value to customers, I think the best way to grow it is to increase best value to customers. So whether it\u2019s a fair product, whether it\u2019s some of the ancillary revenues that mentioned this morning that you can check in, take advantage of, as well as quite frankly continuing to add customer functionality to it. There is a lot of noise for instance with volcanic and the more that we can assist customers through the web and build that functionality which we continue to do today.

I wasn't fast enough to do the math on the fly and it was also a news release of interest during your call.

I won\u2019t comment on the subsequent negotiations, but I will tell you that we are treating these negotiations like we have always treated negotiations, which is we are interested in getting deals done, we are interested in getting deals done in a timely fashion, and we are interested in making sure that what we end up was fair to the company and fair to the employees.", "Helane Becker \u2013 Jesup & Lamont", "Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate your help.", "", "DeAnne Gabel", "", "John, we have time for one more question from the analyst.", "Operator", "", "Our last question from the analyst comes from Bill Mastoris with Broadpoint, please go ahead. ", "Bill Mastoris \u2013 Broadpoint", "Thank you. Gerry, I wonder if you could give us a status report on the aircraft deliveries into the EETCs. And maybe if you could just comment on how many remaining aircraft are yet to be placed into those transactions. And I'm specifically referring to really the second half of last year 2009-1 and 2009-2.", "Gerry Laderman", "", "Bill, you are breaking up a little bit, this is Jerry. But I think you are asking about the 2009-2 EETC and the aircraft to go into that. There are some vintage aircraft that roll off an existing EETC in May that we expect to go into that EETC as the prospective outlines. And then with respect to new aircraft, the two 777s and nine 737s that were earmarked to that transaction, we expected this time to take delivery of those aircraft by the end of August, in which case they would go into that EETC.", "Bill Mastoris \u2013 Broadpoint", "Okay, and Gerry, if you could comment briefly on the aircraft deliveries, for 2011. Maybe the financing for those, is that all non-back stop financing from other third parties which have been lined up or is that back stop financing?", "Gerry Laderman", "", "We have no back stop financing for those aircrafts.", "Bill Mastoris \u2013 Broadpoint", "For any deliveries, in 2011?", "Gerry Laderman", "", "For any remaining deliveries at all.", "Bill Mastoris \u2013 Broadpoint", "Okay, thank you.", "", "DeAnne Gabel", "", "With that, I will turn the call over to Nene, we can begin the session with the media Q&A.", "Nene Foxhall", "John, if you can briefly review the process for asking questions, we will begin the media session.", "Operator", "", "Certainly. (Operator Instructions). We have a question from Terry Maxon from Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead.", "Terry Maxon \u2013 Dallas Morning News", "Good morning, guys. Question. We have got the DOT rules on delayed flights and tarmac delays coming up next Thursday. What do you all think the impact will be on your operations and on your general customer service?", "Jeff Smisek", "Well, Terry, we are \u2013 this is Jeff. We are very prepared for that. We had I think a very good program in place for quite a while not even necessarily in anticipation of rules, and I think we have done a good job. We, at Continental, have not had a single long-term delay since last August. So I think we have done a very good job. We are very focused on customer service and we are very focused on taking care of passengers. ", "Many of those delays, as you know, in fact all those delays are outside of our control, but we are keenly focused on the customer service elements of it and we want to get our passengers where they want to go on time. Sometimes we are hampered by the air traffic control system, which is quite antiquated and sometimes we are hampered by weather, but we have got \u2013 we have got plenty of planning and we have got the ability too and we will of course comply with the new regulation.", "Terry Maxon \u2013 Dallas Morning News", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Deepa Seetharaman from Thomson Reuters.

Hi, Jeff, how are you?", "", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Great.", "Deepa Seetharaman \u2013 Thomson Reuters", "I wanted to know at first if you guys had any comment at all on the US Airways statement that came out during the call. Basically, US Airways said they have decided to discontinue merger discussions with United. Do you guys have anything to say to that?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "No we do not.", "Deepa Seetharaman \u2013 Thomson Reuters", "I guess what has changed in the past couple of years since 2008 when you guys decided not to merge with United? I remember those being due to financial concerns, but how have industry balance sheets changed in the past two years and to the point where you are now maybe weighing your options. And I am also referring to some of your comments at a March conference where you said you would bulk up defensively if you needed to. It seemed to be a shift in the common rhetoric about consolidation from Continental?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Nice try, but we will have no further comments. ", "Deepa Seetharaman \u2013 Thomson Reuters", "Okay, and then maybe can you talk a little bit more about the demand environment. Any kind of comment on business traffic and we know that April is supposed to be up 13% but would you expect these kind of double-digit increases to continue for the rest for the next couple months?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Well, let me say, as we said earlier, business travel is indeed coming back, we are coming back slowly. The \u2013 what you are seeing as Jim contemplated out in terms of the unit revenue is remember the comps. The comparables from last year are very easy, because we are going to take this off back in time business travel was falling off a slip this time last year. So the year-over-year comps that you are going to see can be a little misleading, because they are out of a very low base.", "Deepa Seetharaman \u2013 Thomson Reuters", "So might we see a smaller increase in May?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "We \u2013 I am not \u2013 we don\u2019t give forward guidance on RASM or CASM.", "Deepa Seetharaman \u2013 Thomson Reuters", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from David Koenig from Associated Press. Please go ahead.", "David Koenig \u2013 Associated Press", "Good morning. I won't try again on the consolidation thing. I will ask something else. You have talked about some of the steps you are taking to return to profitability. I wondered if there are any recent or future steps that you would highlight that are specific designed to deal with the high fuel costs including your views on hedging.", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Well, I will take a couple of things and maybe ask Zane to jump in. What really focus on from the long-term is we take delivery of and operate a modern and fuel efficient fleet. That is the best hedge, because that\u2019s not a financial derivative, that\u2019s a physical asset that is very efficient. And at any fuel level is beneficial to us. ", "In addition to that, we engage in the \u2013 in typical hedging activities to mitigate again some of the volatility that we see in the fuel market, we use call options, swaps, cost of collars, depending on what we are doing at the time and our hedge strategy is a pretty consistent from year-to-year.", "Zane Rowe", "", "David, this is Zane. Our hedge strategy hasn\u2019t changed and you see us continue to build up our hedge position through the course of the year. If you see our investor update, we have got it well laid out there with all of our current positions.", "David Koenig \u2013 Associated Press", "Okay, do you expect to be raising fuel surcharges?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "We never comment on the forward pricing.", "David Koenig \u2013 Associated Press", "Alright, okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jed Melnick from New York Times. Please go ahead. ", "Jed Melnick \u2013 New York Times", "Good morning everyone. In the past few weeks, we have seen Delta and American kind of talk a lot about New York. And I was wondering as business travelers come back, kid of what are your views about kind of the competitive space in New York? Jeff, you mentioned just a few minutes ago that you are in battle with Delta in New York among other places. So can you kind of maybe just walk me through how you see that particular market?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Sure, it\u2019s a very important market to us. And we are \u2013 we have got a spectacular hub at New York Liberty, it\u2019s a true global gateway and not to be produced by any of our competitors. And so we are comfortable with our position in New York. ", "Obviously, it\u2019s a market that we focus on, we defend, we offer a very good product as I was talking about earlier, we are improving our scheduled utility to important business market like Heathrow, as we have gone into Star Alliance, the breadth of Star Alliance and our \u2013 for example increasing connectivity, our more recent flight inaugural from New York to Munich, a tie in Lufthansa network as well. ", "So New York is a vital market to us. When we focus on heavily, we provide great service, great \u2013 and growing schedule utility and a superb product. So we are pretty pleased in our position in New York market.", "Jed Melnick \u2013 New York Times", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Richard Newman from The Record. Please go ahead. ", "Richard Newman \u2013 The Record", "Good morning. My question is related. I wanted to ask to the last one. Being in New Jersey, how well can you compete going forward with Delta and American, in light of their recently announced expansion plans there?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Well, we \u2013 obviously we draw a lot of traffic from New Jersey through the New York Liberty hub for its geographic proximity and of course for people who lived on the West side or Wall Street we are an extremely convenient airport. So we draw from New York, we draw from Manhattan, we draw from New Jersey. ", "But the New York hub is a well functioning hub with very modern facilities and we can take you pretty much anywhere in the world either directly or indirectly via Star Alliance. So we are comfortable with our competitive positioning.", "Richard Newman \u2013 The Record", "Can you define where you overlap as far as competition goes with JFK and LaGuardia airlines?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Well, that is one \u2013 that is \u2013 JFK and LaGuardia and New York are essentially one market. There are \u2013 we compete for people who otherwise use JFK, we compete for people who would otherwise use LaGuardia. That is clearly one and a single market and I think we are quite competitive. ", "I mean there are people who prefer Continental service, prefer our loyalty program, who have a choice of airports between LaGuardia, JFK, or New York who prefer Continental, happens all the time.", "Richard Newman \u2013 The Record", "All right, sir. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ted Reed from the TheStreet.com. Please go ahead.", "Ted Reed \u2013 TheStreet.com", "Thank you, I have two things. First of all what's so great about Star Alliance that it's producing such fabulous numbers for you, such big increases?", "Jim Compton", "", "Hi Ted, this is Jim. A couple of things; one, it\u2019s clearly the largest alliance and so what you are doing is you are offering your customers significantly more options that they have had in the past, so that\u2019s the main point. ", "I will tell you also that the partnership with these carriers in Star Alliance has been fantastic in terms of focusing on the customer and trying to enhance seamlessness and as well as good things like inventories and access across their networks and so forth. ", "And so the key point though is that it\u2019s a much bigger more expansive network. It\u2019s been around the longest and it\u2019s all working really well for us.", "Ted Reed \u2013 TheStreet.com", "Are there any particular markets that I notice \u2013 I recall you spoke about Frankfurt being a lot of incremental revenue there. Is that the main one that's helping you, Frankfurt in Europe?", "Jim Compton", "", "Well, I think and quite honestly, all the hubs of the partners out there, whether it\u2019s Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Munich, London with BMI our partner, they are conducting a significant amount of traffic. But you know again, also under Alliance, I will tell you that Alliance work when they are win-win, and so that way Continental brings the Star in the New York partner as well as a partner in the US to Latin America. You can see the results, when Alliances are win-win for both guys, you really see \u2013 you will see it in the network and the numbers connecting across and it\u2019s pretty exciting.", "Ted Reed \u2013 TheStreet.com", "Thank you. I have another thing. Jeff, could you repeat those numbers of the percentage of bag check changes due to the fees. And I guess you are saying you have incurred responsible behavior by diminished \u2013 by people carrying stuff they don't need on their flights?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Well, I mean, when you charge a fee, big swings are in the second check bag, right? When you charge a fee, obviously there is consumer response to that fee and that\u2019s good for us, because it\u2019s fewer bags in the whole less on the job injuries from our employees, fewer bags that are misplaced, fewer bags that run out to a customer's hotel and it has changed customer behavior. I will give the stats again. ", "For the \u2013 and this is again \u2013 this is only with respect to customers who are subject to the bag fees and it\u2019s on a bag check per passenger basis, since we started implementing the fees. It\u2019s 17% drop in domestic first bags, 56% drop in domestic second bags, 52% drop in Latin second bags, and the 38% drop in trans-Atlantic second bags. Those are all pretty big numbers and very good for Continental.", "Ted Reed \u2013 TheStreet.com", "", "All right, last thing. Are you seeing more carry-ons?", "", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Of course, we are seeing more carry-ons. ", "", "Ted Reed \u2013 TheStreet.com", "", "All right, thank you.", "", "Nene Foxhall ", "John, we have time for one last question.", "", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Dan Reed from USA TODAY, please go ahead. ", "", "Dan Reed \u2013 USA TODAY", "Hi, guys. Can you put into some sort of analytical terms what you think the competitive impact is going to be on Continental standalone and Star as a grouping of American and BA finally getting their ATI? Assuming it actually does come to pass, especially since they are both big in New York where you were the only big Star member.", "", "Jeff Smisek ", "Dan, this is Jeff. I think we are comfortable with the Alliance to Alliance competition, that\u2019s why we got into Star Alliance. I mean Star Alliance is a superior Alliance to the other two Alliances in terms of scope and scale, connectivity, the technology, it\u2019s the oldest Alliance, it's the most sophisticated alliance, it's a well-functioning alliance and has superb members. ", "So we are very comfortable from an alliance perspective and we have all along been assuming the BA AA tie-up and we have been assuming the Iberia merger, as well, so I think we are comfortable where we are. We without question picked the right alliance. And as Jim was saying earlier in the call, clearly that is working for us and we are pleased with it.", "", "Jim Compton ", "Hi Dan, this is Jim. I would just also add that for us in the Star \u2013 our Star Alliance is so much different too, because what we offer New York is really a breadth of Europe. And so with 30 destinations with the Trans Atlantic, little bit different than the Oneworld, obviously focus the New York to London, not to minimize the importance of London, as Jeff mentioned our growth that we started with our fourth trip and our fifth trip in the fall, very important to us. But I would note that our breadth, we are flying to Copenhagen non-stop, we are flying to Oslow non-stop, we are not connecting in Heathrow in the case Oneworld or so forth. So we think we have a terrific position in New York.", "Dan Reed \u2013 USA TODAY", "Okay, thank you.", "", "Nene Foxhall", "Yes, Jeff, Jim, Zane, Deane thanks and thanks to all of you for joining us.

First, Ms. Foxhall, ma\u2019am you may begin.", "Nene Foxhall", "Thank you John. Good morning everyone, joining us here in Houston are Continental\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Smisek, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer; Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Zane Rowe; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer Mark Moran and Senior Vice President Finance and Treasurer, Gerry Laderman to discuss Continental\u2019s second quarter 2010 financial results.", "Jeff will begin with some overview comments after which Jim will review our capacity and revenue results. Zane will follow with a discussion of Continental\u2019s cost structure and balance sheet.", "At that point we will open the call for questions. And with questions, we will follow the executive comments and then we will begin a question-and-answer session for the media. We would appreciate if each of you would limit your questions to one with one follow-up. With that I will turn it over to, DeAnne.", "DeAnne Gabel", "Thank you Nene, earlier today we issued an update for investors presenting information relating to our financial and operational outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2010 and other information.", "This investor update was included in the filing with the SEC. Today we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures such as net income excluding special items.", "Please note that a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures as well as the investor update can be found on our website at continental.com under the Investor Relations section. In addition, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements that are not limited to historical facts, but reflect the company\u2019s current beliefs, expectations, or intentions regarding future events.", "All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For examples of such risks and uncertainties please see the risk factors set forth in the company\u2019s 2009 10-K and with other security filings.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Smisek", "Thank you, Nene and DeAnne. Good morning and thanks for joining us. I also want to thank all my co-workers. Across the system, they have done a tremendous job managing record high load factors while delivering a great product and excellent customer service, day in and day out. I appreciate all their efforts.", "Continental reported net income of $257 million or a profit of $1.60 per diluted share for the second quarter, excluding $24 million of merger related costs and other special charges. Including these special items, our net income was $233 million or $1.46 per share.", "These results were largely driven by improvement in the revenue environment. Business traffic is coming back, though slowly. Leisure demand has been strong and we expect it will remain so throughout the remainder of the summer.", "This demand strength, together with the capacity reductions over the last couple of years have helped us to manage yields up. Jim has more detail to share with you in a moment, but I think you will agree that the direction of revenue streams is encouraging.", "We have also been growing our ancillary revenue streams, our customers are taking advantage of the additional options we have begun to offer such as day of departure upgrades and premium seating. Together, these two initiatives are currently generating over $200,000 per day in additional revenue.", "On the operation side, we maintained our excellent completion rate by achieving the systemwide mainline segment completion factor of 99.3% for the quarter despite cancellations caused by the Icelandic volcano.", "We achieved a mainline domestic on-time performance of 80% or greater in all three of the months during the quarter and my co-workers earned $6 million in cash incentives for that performance. So, it\u2019s too early to tell what the fall trends will be like, but we are pleased with the revenue and demand trends we have been seeing so far.", "We continue to exercise capacity discipline and for the full year 2010, we expect both our consolidated and mainline capacity will be up only about a 0.5% to 1.5% year-over-year, with our mainline domestic capacity down, a 0.5% to 1.5% year-over-year.", "As for next year it\u2019s too soon to say what the capacity of the merged carrier will be, but I can tell you that I am pleased with the benefits Continental has experienced from capacity discipline. Over the last several years, we have been focused on reducing capacity in the geographic areas that underperformed, to that end our 2010 mainline domestic capacity will be down about 12% versus 2007.", "I expect to continue this rigorous domestic capacity discipline as we look to optimize the merged carrier suite across the combined network. Historically, substantially all of our profits have come from our international operations, so we are highly motivated to achieve an appropriate balance between our domestic and international capacity.", "During the quarter, continental announced that next year it will initiate non-stop service between Houston and Auckland, New Zealand; Houston and Lagos, Nigeria and New York and Cairo, Egypt. Given the combined strength of the Continental and United Networks as well as the breadth of connections provided by our Star Alliance partners, these routes are excellent opportunity to expand our global reach while benefiting our bottom line.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jim and Zane, I want to give a brief update on the progress of our merger. Between the two companies, we have several hundred people divided into about 30 functional teams working on integration planning. We have held a series of joint meetings and the teams are off to a good start in laying the path towards successful integration.", "On the regulatory front, we have made all the necessary DOT and international filings and we continue to work closely with the Department of Justice. As expected we received the DOJ\u2019s second request in early June and we and United are working towards complying with it.", "Continental and United have agreed to provide the DOJ with additional time beyond the statutory 30 days after our compliance with that second request, to complete its review. We expect our separate shareholder meetings will be held in late September. Things are progressing well and I remain confident that we will close the transaction in the fourth quarter.", "In addition, I am pleased that we and United reached an agreement in principal for a transition and process agreement with our two pilot groups which is a good first step on the road to negotiating in a timely fashion a joint collective bargaining agreement and having our pilots to agree on an integrated seniority list.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim and Zane to discuss this quarter\u2019s revenue and cost performance detail.", "Jim Compton", "Thanks Jeff, I join Jeff in thanking our co-workers for running a great operation and delivering excellent customer service. They have also done a great job staying focused on maximizing revenue opportunity, including continuing to pull our participation in Star Alliance.", "In addition to expanding our JV with United, Lufthansa and Air Canada, we have been busy adding codeshare flights with our other Star partners. Since April, we have implemented codeshare relationships with Air New Zealand, SAS, and TAM of Brazil. And plan to implement codesharing with both Brussels Airlines by the end of July.", "In addition, we have completed agreements with Aegean of Greece and Spanair of Spain. And we will begin codesharing with them upon receipt of government approval.", "Moving onto our second quarter revenue results. Our mainline RASM was up 18.8% due primarily to strength in mainline yields, which were up 16.3% year-over-year. We also continue to run strong load factors, setting a second quarter mainline load factor record of 85%, up 1.8 points year-over-year. ", "During the quarter, our mainline passenger RASM, on a length of haul-adjusted basis outperformed the industry average. In the second quarter, our RASM outperformed the industry by 9.8 points.", "So again congratulations to our team on the job well done. Regional RASM for the second quarter was up 23.8% year-over-year due to stronger yield, which was up 19.9% year-over-year and stronger load factor which was up 2.5 points.", "We like the trends we are seeing, but continue to believe this will be a long, slow recovery. We have seen a continued sequential improvement in high yield passengers since the beginning of the year, but their numbers were still down about 20% in June 2010 compared to June 2008 and revenue from high-yield passengers was down about 10% in June 2010 compared to 2008.", "Transatlantic and Transpacific year-over-year BusinessFirst RASM for the second quarter continued to see material improvements attributable to both improved yields and higher load factors. ", "I realize the year-over-year comps for the second quarter were still pretty easy, but on a year-over-two year basis, both Transatlantic and Transpacific BusinessFirst load factor were up nicely for the second quarter. And both Transatlantic and Transpacific BusinessFirst yields were positive in May and June on a year-over-two year basis.", "As I mentioned, we continue to fill up our participation in Star very nicely and are pleased with the revenue results thus far. On a year-over-year basis, our second quarter total passenger revenue was up19.7%, but our total partner revenue was up 73% due to our membership in Star.", "On a year-over-two year basis, our second quarter total passenger revenue was down 9%, but our total partner revenue was up 16%. The value of Star to Continental continues to outperform our expectations and is significantly better for us than our former alliance.", "Last July we, United, Lufthansa and Air Canada received DOT approval to establish the Transatlantic joint venture. We have already implemented many aspects of the JV including joint inventory management and pricing, joint marketing, joint sales and joint corporate contracts.", "As part of the Transatlantic JV, we are in negotiations to implement a revenue sharing structure. As currently contemplated, that structure would result in payments between participants, based on a formula that compares current period unit revenue performance on Transatlantic routes to a historical period or base line which is reset annually.", "The payments will be calculated on a quarterly basis and subject to a cap. Assuming that revenue sharing is implemented and that the revenue sharing formula is applied retroactive to January 1, 2010 as currently contemplated, we estimate that our liability for revenue sharing payments to joint venture carriers, whom we have outperformed with the approximately $40 million for the six months ended June 30 2010. However this estimate of our revenue sharing obligation for the first six months of 2010 is not indicative of our expectations for the full year as we currently expect our net obligation for 2010 to be substantially less than this amount.", "Now turning to the outlook for July RASM, we still have a little over a week left in the month of July and things could change, but based on the data thus far we are currently estimating both consolidated and mainline July RASM will be up about 21% year-over-year.", "Again these numbers are preliminary estimates based on the data we have for July thus far.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Zane.", "Zane Rowe", "Thanks Jim. I want to begin by thanking the entire Continental team for all their contributions to a good quarter. Our team did a great job delivering strong cost performance while running a solid operation. Our second quarter mainline CASM holding fuel rate constant and excluding special item was up 2.2% year-over-year. Revenue related costs such as commissions and reservations and sales expense were the primary drivers of the increase year-over-year.", "We also made an accrual for profit sharing based on our year-to-date pretax income. CASM came in slightly lower than expected primarily due to a security fee refund from the TSA.", "In the second half of the year, we expect to see some pressure on CASM, again due to high revenue related expenses as well as increased variable compensation tied to profitability. We also expect increased expenses related to a higher level of frequent flyer reward activity as our one pass members take advantage of our expanded Star network.", "For the full-year 2010, excluding special items and holding fuel rate constant, we expect both our consolidated and mainline CASM to be at 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year. We continue to work to improve our cost structure and efficiencies across all areas of the operation.", "Our EBITDAR margin excluding special items was 19%, our best performance for the second quarter since 2003. Turning to fuel, our second quarter consolidated fuel price including taxes and hedge impact was $2.26 per gallon. Given the current forward curve, we estimate that including taxes and hedge impact, our third quarter and full-year consolidated fuel price will be $2.21 per gallon.", "We\u2019ve hedged about 50% of our remaining 2010 fuel needs and about 12.5% of the first half of 2011 using a mix of swaps, collars and call options. Further detail of our current hedge position is outlined in our investor update filed earlier today.", "Our fuel efficiency remains our best hedge again rising fuel prices. Our mainline fleet is approximately 10% more efficient than the average of our network peers. We continue to pursue improved fuel efficiency. We have one of the best aircraft order books and as of this quarter, we have all of our narrow body aircraft fitted with fuel saving winglet.", "We ended the second quarter with 337 mainline aircrafts in service, in the third quarter we will place nine new 737-800s and two new 777-200s into service. On the regional side, we ended the second quarter with 251 regional aircraft flown on our behalf under capacity purchase agreement. We will place one additional Q400 into service in the third quarter.", "As Jeff mentioned we are focused on capacity discipline and on achieving an appropriate balance between domestic and international capacity.", "With that in mind, we reached an agreement in principle with Boeing to defer it to 2015, three 737 aircraft originally scheduled to deliver in the first half of 2011.", "Moving onto the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $3.5 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investment. This was our highest quarter-ending cash balance on record.", "As a percentage of our last 12 months revenue, cash was approximately 26%. We also expect to end the third quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. For the full year 2010, we estimate our cash capital expenditures will be approximately $400 million.", "This includes both non-aircraft and aircraft related expenditures. Earlier, this month we contributed $38 million to our defined benefit pension plans, bringing our year-to-date contribution to $112 million.", "Our remaining minimum funding requirement for this year is $33 million. In conclusion in the months ahead, while we work to ensure a smooth merger transition, we will remain focused on running a clean, safe and reliable operation.", "We continue to have many advantages. Our employees are among the most professional and dedicated in the industry. Through Star Alliance, we offer customers access to the world\u2019s leading network.", "We continue to invest in our modern fuel efficient fleet and our award winning products and we are growing our revenue streams by offering our customers more product choices while maintaining costs and capacity discipline.", "All this together with our working together culture provides us the platform to achieve and sustain our goal of profitability. With that I will turn the call back to Jeff.", "Jeff Smisek", "", "Thanks, Jim and Zane. We are pleased with our second quarter results and the demand trends we are currently seeing give us the reason to be optimistic about the outlook. We are committed to focusing on our day-to-day business, while our dedicated team handles merger integration matters.", "Our merger will result in many changes. However, our focus on our culture, our people, our customers and our performance won\u2019t to be changing. I look forward to leading the team that brings together the strengths of each company and creates the platform for achieving and sustaining profitability.", "With that I will turn the call back over to DeAnne to begin our Q&A.", "DeAnne Gabel", "", "Thank you Jeff, Jim and Zane. With that we are ready to begin our question-and-answer session for the analysts, followed by the question-and-answer session for the media.", "John if you could please review the Q&A process, we are ready to begin.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "Thank you we will now begin the question-and-answer Session. (Operator Instructions) and our first question comes from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "", "Jeff if we look at Continental as a standalone, historically you have grown a bit faster on capacity than the industry and your comments earlier in the prepared remarks suggest as you think about being a combined entity with United, that\u2019s changing a bit. So is it fair to say that a right characterization that United as a combined entity with Continental will sort of lead the industry at capacity discipline, is that the way you are thinking about it?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "No, I am not saying that Bill, what I am saying is that we at Continental are very focused on returning to profitability and sustaining it and in our merger with United that is our focus as well.", "We will have the capacity that we think is appropriate to make sure that we maximize our profitability and we will also allocate our capacity appropriately to markets where we are making money and we will be thoughtful about capacity in markets where we are not making them.", "Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley", "As a separate question, we talked with United on their call about sort of where they think they are on the ancillary game, they said effectively there is a lot of upside left. I have often thought Continental is taking more of a wait-and-see approach on some of these items and perhaps been a little bit less aggressive. When you think about even Continental as standalone, sort of I\u2019d kind of ask you where do you think you are in the game, but equally important how do you think about the net impact from this unbundling because obviously you guys have taken the approach in some senses where the fare is actually where you are going to capture that by keeping things in. But you\u2019ve have slowly begun to move away from that. So, how does that sort of balance out and then when you combine it, is it a big opportunity that\u2019s not yet identified?", "Jeff Smisek", "Bill, I think ancillary revenue is a significant opportunity for Continental, and I think that United has done a very good job. There are many issues related to rolling out our ancillary revenue products. There are IT issues, there are global distribution system issues, there are timing issues in terms of where it is in the chain of purchase, whether it\u2019s a prepurchase or day of departure or post purchase.", "So there are many opportunities and I think we are beginning to explore many of those opportunities and we\u2019ll announce them as they come out, but I think that there are significant benefits to ancillary revenues. I think there will be significant future benefits and I think ancillary revenues will be a growing revenue stream for Continental and I believe will be a growing revenue stream for the combined carrier as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Crissey from UBS.", "Kevin Crissey - UBS", "Jim, maybe you could comment about your July RASM number, looks like a pretty good number, I guess, compared to some that we've heard. Was there any change in Latin America that would get you to that number?", "Jim Compton", "Our guidance is really just the consolidate mainline, so I wouldn\u2019t comment on July by entity at all. But if you look at the second quarter that we reported, clearly for us particularly in the month of May HN1N1 last year had an effect, we were an industry leader in pulling capacity out.", "Quite frankly we are obviously large in Mexico where a lot of HN1N1 sit. So really they would clearly impact in terms of our RASM number as kind of moved to the quarterly in the second quarter, but for July, my comments are on the 21% on mainline consolidated.", "Kevin Crissey - UBS", "And Jim, maybe you could comment on your thoughts on Google's attempted acquisition of ITA?", "Jim Compton", "We are actually an early adopter of the ITA software and have a really good relationship and a strong business partnership with ITA. They have a really good shopping solution, that we use on continental.com and it\u2019s worked very well for us, as we have seen some terrific penetration on continental.com in terms of tickets and the growth in terms of our percent of revenue that was falling on continental.com and that shopping solution is a low fare search engine that has served us well.", "That being said, there are alternatives to that shopping solution in the market place, both internally and externally. So to your question as it relates specifically, we are going to watch the business plan at Google and ITA has been a great partner, but clearly way too early for us to comment on that, but knowing that there are alternatives, both internal external to that shopping solution.", "Kevin Crissey - UBS", "But I think you'll have the opportunity to register some sort of complaint as would others who use the software, I imagine, similar to what you're getting with the merger, you'd be able to do something similar with Google. Does Continental have a position on whether you would file a complaint?", "Jeff Smisek", "", "We are not going to comment on that.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Dahlman Rose.", "", "Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose", "", "Two things, one, there were some news reports this morning out of the EU that they're prepared to approve the merger between you and United. Have you seen those, have they given you any indication that they're going to respond to you within the next week or so?", "", "Jeff Smisek", "", "I am not aware of that report sitting here at this point in time. I will tell you that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me because this is a very pro-competitive transaction, so that\u2019s unsurprising to me.", "", "Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose", "", "And then the second question, just with respect to leisure demand versus business demand, last year leisure was very strong and business was not and this year you're saying you're seeing the increases in premium. Are you seeing any signs that leisure is turning down?", "Jim Compton", "", "Obviously with the summer period, seasonally strong demand, the market place has pricing that\u2019s stronger than last year on the leisure fare with some of the surcharges in the industry. So we are seeing strong demand on the leisure side. We talk about the next six weeks being booked on domestically 1 to 2 points. ", "That again is a sign, the booking curve relatively year-over-year has shifted closer in for revenue management to take in opportunities with that. I would also kind of add to that, that once again in the earnings release, it was record load factors both mainline and consolidated. So I think what we are saying is we are seeing really strong leisure demand with yield as well as a continued improvement in business traffic as we have seen it go through the second quarter.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.", "", "Jamie Baker - JPMorgan", "", "It looks like a bit more cost pressure in the second half of the year, particularly when you factor in the cost in the second quarter. I'm curious if you made any material changes in regards to your profit sharing assumptions?", "Zane Rowe", "", "Jamie, what you are seeing there is our updated guidance based on our overall view of what the rest of the year looks like. So as I touched on, you have got revenue-related expenses which would include commissions RASM sales and then obviously along with that we have a number of other expenses that we go up. As our profitability view increases, profit sharing accruals would increase as well and likewise as they come down, they come down as well.", "Jamie Baker - JPMorgan", "And secondly, for Jim you talk about premium yield trends not being fully recovered yet. I think everybody sort of gets that, but I'm curious whether you believe that's more of a volume issue? Are there simply fewer business travelers out there? Or is there any evidence of increased buydown to lower coach fares, maybe the fences just haven't been fully restored yet?", "I guess I'm just trying to understand where the core business travel demand has actually changed that much, or whether business travel pricing might be, what's still different? And lastly, if you're seeing anything different in terms of yield trends in the markets where you've unveiled the new biz first seat?", "Jim Compton", "Yes, I think if you look at our high yield that we referred, I would say it is a little bit of combination of all the things that you talk about, but specifically it\u2019s more the volume, not being back at the levels and, I mentioned 20% decline in passengers with 10% decline in revenue. So the average yields are actually stronger than that (inaudible) period pre-recession, but the volumes are still growing back which of kind ties. We constantly talk about the slow recovery and those absolute volumes building back.", "In terms of buyback, we recently again had a corporate advisory with our corporate travel managers in June, pretty consistent that business is coming back slowly, I would say they talk about less restrictions in terms of travel policy and we haven\u2019t heard anything about more restrictions in travel policies from that advisory group.", "Jamie Baker - JPMorgan", "And in terms of demand trends in the markets where you have unveiled the new product any change there, are you likely to generate a return on the upgrade?", "Jim Compton", "Yes, we are actually having terrific performance where our flat bed seats have gone into the market place. We as of June have scheduled all of New York to London, all of London with a flat bed seat and London performance is doing terrific and so forth. As well as you know we are having strong performance into Asia and we are up to 25 airplanes with the 757 and the 777 with the flat bed seat, the customer reaction has been fantastic to that seat and so yes we are seeing good business traffic because of the seat.", "Jeff Smisek", "So Jamie, just think how great it will be when we got that flat bed seats on an aircraft like the 787.", "Jamie Baker - JPMorgan", "I won't hold my breath, having been on a 787 earlier this week, still looks like they got to do a lot of work. But thank you for that. I look forward to trying the new product.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Hunter Keay from Stifel Nicolaus, please go ahead.", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus", "Is this a new announcement of the I guess you're referring four or three 900 ERs. Is that a new announcement? What drove that? Is it maybe merger-related or maybe can I extrapolate some commentary on how you're thinking about demand levels really next year?", "Gerry Laderman", "That is a new announcement and it\u2019s really just finetuning our mix of narrow bodies and wide bodies. You know just looking at overall, as Jeff said keeping the focus on appropriate capacity.", "Zane Rowe", "Those are three aircrafts that we deferred.", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus", "Three aircraft, and they were 900 ERs.", "Zane Rowe", "We just call them 737.", "Jeff Smisek", "They are the 737.", "Hunter Keay - Stifel Nicolaus", "Ok got it I appreciate that. And just a quick review, Gerry, what is the financed portion of your aircraft CapEx for the remainder of the year?", "Gerry Laderman", "We don\u2019t have that specifically broken out.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank", "Two questions here. Just I guess for Zane, looking at the pension numbers, it looks like over the last month, the cash contribution for 2010 moved up a bit, and I'm curious what drove that especially since I think we got another little bit of helping from the legislation on the pension front. What's going on there?", "Zane Rowe", "We highlighted the minimal obligation that\u2019s not necessarily what we plan on funding and so we funded a little bit more than we needed to through the course of the month that\u2019s the only difference there.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just my second question, and this is to Jim, it was great that you gave us the contribution from your partners, both on a year-over-year and a two-year basis. As you've moved into Star, how much of that reflects maybe a shift in point of sale? Now that you're in Star and you're more heavily involved in this alliance than the prior one, are you having a bit more success in picking up some overseas sales or how should we think about that?", "Jim Compton", "I think that is one way to think about, I will tell you for instance, working with Lufthansa and our placement and working with them on corporate contracts out of Germany is significantly more than what we were doing within the SkyTeam alliance and so forth. So the ability to attract some of that high yield business traffic offshore is one of the benefits that we are seeing given our Star relationship and particularly our JV relationship.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gary Chase from Barclays Capital. ", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "Wanted to have one quick clarification, Jim. When you were referring to this $40 million in the negotiation, there's nothing that's been accrued on that, right? It's not something that would reverse, that's all forward-looking, correct?", "Zane Rowe", "That\u2019s correct. The portion of the contract hasn\u2019t been signed, so we are not accruing anything for that.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "And then could you give us a little bit of color on how domestic versus international profitability looks relative to where it's been in the past? We know it was a wide margin several years ago, but a lot has changed and domestic capacity has been down, revenues recovering internationally, but of course it took a bigger hit last year, so where are we? Is that narrower than it's historically been or is it sort of in a normal place?", "Jim Compton", "I would say that it\u2019s narrower. As I look at the second quarter the thing that you always obviously have to keep in mind is the seasonality of quarters and things like that.", "So we clearly see the relative strength in international, but I think as it refers clearly to the second quarter, we have seen some of that narrowing.", "Gary Chase - Barclays Capital", "And then just one last one. Something that seems a little unusual this earnings season is just there's more confidence seemingly in the September outlook than there typically is. Usually you hear people say at this time of year, Lord knows what's going to happen in September and I'm just curious if you agree with that and, if so, what might be driving the confidence that's higher than at least any time I can remember?", "Jim Compton", "Both from the investor update and then obviously with my comments on July our comments are really kind of the six-week help period and so really don\u2019t have a comment on what other folks are saying on September at this point.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Hudson.", "Dan McKenzie - Hudson Securities", "With respect to the merger, which operating certificate are you planning to operate under? United's or your own? And then related to that, what implications would that have with respect to how the airline would be operated post merger?", "Jeff Smisek", "We haven\u2019t made that decision yet.", "Dan McKenzie - Hudson Securities", "Implications, one way or the other, depending once you do make that decision?", "Jeff Smisek", "There are advantages and disadvantages that are mostly technical under each operating certificate and this is a fairly technical discussion that\u2019s going on currently right now, but I think that in the long run, I don\u2019t think you are going to see material differences in how we operate the businesses as based on whichever operating certificate we got to pick.", "Mark Moran", "At the end of the day, it isn\u2019t that big issue because it\u2019s going to be best practices and a revised certificate with the best of both companies.", "Dan McKenzie - Hudson Securities", "Then the second question is really also a house cleaning question here. Regarding the Pacific JV, does the merger need to be completed by a particular date before the JV grant would be lost?", "Jeff Smisek", "No, the merger and the JV are not related at all. We and the United have applied, we would expect approval of that later this year, but that approval is not related in anyway to whether we merge with United or not merge with United?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Higgins from Soleil Securities.", "James Higgins - Soleil Securities", "Can you comment on thoughts about the impact of the AABA, antitrust JV starting up in the transatlantic? You guys and everyone else really have had a bit of an advantage to them over the past years. Any thoughts on what they're finally getting together mean?", "Jeff Smisek", "We have been anticipating that. We had every expectation that it would be approved, we have a solid competitive position across the Atlantic. We certainly with our merger with United will provide a vast and very attractive global network and as we have also interlines competition, but we are very comfortable with our position. We are very comfortable going forward, we are very comfortable with AABA.", "James Higgins - Soleil Securities", "There was a pretty big negative swing in the non-operating, other non-operating income or expense, it moved to an expense item. Other than the foreign currency charge, anything special going on there?", "Zane Rowe", "The foreign currency was the bulk of it. There\u2019s a small amount of hedging effect in this, but that was it. It was $10 million for the quarter.", "DeAnne Gabel", "With that John we are ready to move to the Q&A session for the media.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And we have question from Ted Reed from the TheStreet.com.", "Ted Reed - TheStreet.com", "My question, we're at the end of the quarterly reports now. It was a pretty sensational quarter. From your position as about to run the biggest airline, is this an industry as you look back on this quarter that's been fixed and capacity restraint has taken out a lot of the historic problems in this industry, and are we in a new era for the airline industry?", "Jeff Smisek", "Ted, I don\u2019t know that we are in new era. I think that we went through some pretty rough times. The economy is recovering, that\u2019s a good thing. Airlines are focused on profitability, certainly we at Continental and we combined with United will be, we\u2019ll take all the actions that we need to take to normally restore ourselves properly, but to be able to sustain those through the business cycle, that\u2019s our goal and we are going to be very focused on that.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Doug Cameron from Dow Jones.", "Doug Cameron - Dow Jones", "You've got six 787s to come next year. You've announced a couple of rates and I know you wouldn't tell me now any other new ones. Can you guide us to whether those aircraft will be split between existing fill in services or there might be some additional new routes to go with the planes?", "Jeff Smisek", "We have announced a couple of new routes that we will fly 787s on, to Lagos and to Auckland. We're going to use those aircraft, both in new routes and also in existing routes and we can also use them seasonally to routes.", "So we will use them in various ways depending on how our profits maximize.", "Doug Cameron - Dow Jones", "I'm looking forward to the Chicago Edinburgh service.", "Jeff Smisek", "I hope you are.", "Doug Cameron - Dow Jones", "Some people, and I won't name names, have been a little bit rude about the sort of forging of the United and Continental liveries, logos, et cetera. Is what you see on the merger website what you're going to see on the side of a plane if it all goes through or do you have a design guru or guress who may be perhaps finessing the branding?", "Jeff Smisek", "I think the branding is just marvelous Doug and we are going to be painting the aircraft promptly. We want a uniform fleet and we will be doing that from the day that we close the merger.", "Doug Cameron - Dow Jones", "My kids say the United name is too big, so there you go.", "", "Jeff Smisek", "Well we may listen to your children Doug,", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Perone from The Star-Ledger.", "Joe Perone - The Star-Ledger", "Can you say what your headcount is expected to be by the fourth quarter?", "Jeff Smisek", "I don\u2019t think that we typically talk about that ", "Zane Rowe", "We can tell you though that we had just over 38,700 as for the second quarter. Those are FTEs, those aren\u2019t headcount.", "Joe Perone - The Star-Ledger", "Another question, you talked about the ancillary revenue opportunities. Can you give an example of some of those opportunities and any dollar amount that you can provide us with?", "Jeff Smisek", "We could, but I am not going to.", "Operator", "At this time I show no questions.", "Nene Foxhall", "Okay, so it\u2019s no more question, we\u2019ll conclude. Jeff, Jim, Zane and DeAnne, thanks for your participation and thanks to all of you for joining us. Please call corporate communications if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

These items are detailed in our earnings release. ", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, President and CEO of United.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, Tyler and Nene, and good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today, we reported a net income of $773 million for the third quarter or $2 per diluted share, delivering a 7.7% pretax margin for the quarter. We closed the margin between United and Continental Airlines a little over a year ago. We are working together to build the world's leading airline, the airline that our customers want to fly, our co-workers want to work for and investors want to invest in. ", "I'd like to thank all of my coworkers for their hard work over the past year maintaining their focus on delivering clean, safe and reliable air transportation to our customers, while we integrate these 2 great airlines. ", "Despite the challenges of integration, we delivered solid operational and financial performance during the quarter. We accrued an additional $152 million of profit sharing during the quarter for a total of $242 million accrued for profit sharing year-to-date. ", "In addition, during the first 9 months of 2011, we paid $27 million in on-time performance bonuses to coworkers. I look forward to distributing profit-sharing payments on Valentine's Day next year based on our 2011 full year earnings. ", "We improved our balance sheet again this quarter, reducing total debt, including capitalized aircraft operating lease obligations by $469 million. We remained focused on derisking the business and improving the strength of our balance sheet. ", "While we are pleased with the results this quarter, we are mindful of the uncertainties surrounding the global economy. Despite the concerns we all read about, we are not currently seeing a reduction in business demand, as Jim will discuss later in the call. ", "Our third quarter revenue results demonstrate the power of our network and capacity discipline. With PRASM up 10.1% for the quarter. Should we see demand decrease however, we will respond nimbly and appropriately by decreasing capacity and taking cost out to help ensure we remain profitable throughout the business cycle.", "The capacity reductions we implemented with our September schedule are paying off. We right sized the airline for the expected reduction in fourth quarter leisure demand due to the higher fares we've put in place as fuel prices rose earlier this year. ", "Our current plans for 2012 reflect consensus expectations for sluggish economic growth in 2012 and our goal of generating sustainable and sufficient profitability.

We will continue to optimize our network, reducing our domestic capacity as we retire older, less fuel-efficient aircraft, reconfigure domestic wide-body aircraft for international service and implement Economy Plus on the Continental fleet.", "United will take delivery of 5 Boeing 787 Dreamliners next year, with the first coming into service in the second half of 2012. As a result, we expect to grow international capacity in 2012, as this game changing aircraft creates new profitable market opportunities. ", "One of the major impediments to creating economic value is the crushing tax burden that the U.S. airline industry faces, with about 20% of the typical ticket price paid in taxes today. And that doesn't even include income taxes. ", "Airlines currently pays 17 different federal aviation taxes and fees in the U.S. totaling $16.5 billion in 2010. Unfortunately, Washington is attempting to make U.S. airlines its piggy bank once again. ", "The U.S. airlines have lost a total of $55 billion over the past 10 years. Now Washington is proposing $35 billion of additional taxes over the next 10 years. We are already taxed more heavily than alcohol, tobacco and firearms. We are taxed as a sin. We are not a sin. We connect people and cultures. We transport cargo. We are drivers of the economy. We bring business and job growth to our hubs and spoke cities. We contribute $1.2 trillion to the U.S. economy each year. If this crushing $35 billion of additional taxes becomes law, we will have no choice but to raise fares, reduce service, eliminate service to some communities and reduce the size of our workforce. Simply put, this tax proposal is a jobs killer. ", "We also face the potential for an additional tax burden in the form of the European Union emissions trading scheme. We are committed to the environment and reducing our fuel burn benefits both our business and the environment. At the new United, we're proud of our combined track record, as we've improved aircraft fuel efficiency by 32% since 1994. ", "The EU emissions trading scheme is an extraterritorial, unilaterally-imposed patchwork tax rather than a unified global solution for aviation emissions. More than 20 countries, including the U.S., China, Russia, India and Japan, have stated their opposition to this tax and reinforced the belief that it violates international law. ", "While these potential taxes and other new challenges threaten our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals, we remained focused on the most significant opportunity currently available to us: completing the integration of our 2 great airlines, and unlocking the full $1 billion to $1.2 billion of annual synergy value. ", "We made progress with our integration again this quarter. We introduced our new loyalty program effective in the 2012 program year. We're very excited about the new program and made a number of changes designed to better differentiate between elite tiers and provide incentives to our customers to earn the great benefits that Mileage Plus offers by engaging in behavior that more directly benefits United.

", "Since closing the merger, we have completed co-location at 53 airports and now have a single point of check-in at 75% of the airports we serve worldwide. We have re-branded our hubs in Cleveland, Denver, Houston, Narita, Newark, O'hare and San Francisco. We've also re-branded an additional 30 stations that we serve. We also recently unveiled our combined airport lounge program, the United Club.

Regional PRASM improved 9.6% versus the third quarter of 2010. ", "Since closing our merger last year, we have often talked about United's unmatched global network and hub structure. And while we are still early in our network integration efforts, we are seeing the significant value of those assets as we generate revenue and yield premiums relative to the industry. ", "As with prior quarters this year, yield growth and capacity discipline drove United's third quarter revenue results. Consolidated yields were up 10.9% year-over-year in the third quarter.

South American demand continues to grow at a quick clip, resulting in PRASM and yield increases of nearly 25% this quarter.

", "Our Pacific network saw a solid yield increases this quarter, with yields up 9.9% and PRASM up 6.5% year-over-year. The Japan market continues to recover from the tragedy last March with PRASM increasing 9.8% in the third quarter. ", "Corporate revenue continued to show a steady improvement. Corporate yields grew solidly, increasing 13% versus third quarter 2010, and increasing nearly 25% versus third quarter 2009. We run our airline with the business customer in mind. We are focused on growing United's relevance and attractiveness to the high-yield business traveler through product investments, improved schedule utility, connectivity options and service to the right markets.", "In order to generate revenue compensatory with service we provide our customers, we must be disciplined in our capacity and asset deployment. We regularly evaluate the performance of each flight and markets we serve, and reallocate assets if a route is not generating sufficient returns. ", "During 2011, we have appropriately reduced capacity to right size our supply for the expected demand. As a result, PRASM for the first 9 months of 2011 increased 9.7% year-over-year, an excellent result during a period of extremely low U.S. and global GDP growth. We continued to refine our 2011 capacity and further reduced our fourth quarter capacity plans. ", "We now expect fourth quarter mainline capacity to be down about 3.5% and consolidated capacity to be down more than 3% versus 2010, resulting in our expected full year 2011 consolidated capacity to be down nearly 0.5%. ", "As Jeff mentioned, we continually evaluate the demand environment. And based on the information we currently have, we expect the demand environment to remain stable. Accordingly, we expect our full year 2012 consolidated capacity to be essentially flat versus 2011. ", "As we've demonstrated throughout this year, we are prepared to respond with further reductions if the demand environment deteriorates. As we prepare for the migration to a single passenger service system in the first quarter of next year, we have slowed the introduction of new ancillary products and services. As we have concentrated our IT resources on making sure the migration occurs successfully and on-time. Our emphasis on driving ancillary revenue growth has not changed, however, and ancillary revenue this quarter grew by 5% year-over-year.

We continue to generate synergies in line with our expectations and eagerly anticipate our transition to a single passenger service system in the first quarter next year. Once we are on 1 platform, we will be able to better market our products, better service our customers, better sell ancillary products and better flow aircraft throughout our global network. ", "As I mentioned, passenger demand remains good and based on our current outlook, we estimate United's October consolidated PRASM will increase a bit more than 10% year-over-year. This PRASM estimate is preliminary based on the data we have for October thus far. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.", "Zane Rowe", "Thanks, Jim. I'd like to start by recognizing the entire United team for all the effort in helping generate strong third quarter results despite high fuel prices and tepid economic growth. ", "United's consolidated operating expense increased approximately 11% or $886 million year-over-year in the third quarter, primarily as a result of higher fuel prices. ", "Excluding the impact of fuel hedges, fuel costs rose $1 billion year-over-year as fuel prices increased 44%. Consolidated fuel expense, including the benefit of our hedges, increased $843 million year-over-year, a 33% increase.

", "Company-wide, we're doing a good job managing cost throughout the year and this is reflected in our quarterly cost performance. During the quarter, we faced some of the same inflationary pressures that we saw in the second quarter primarily in the areas of aircraft maintenance and salaries and related cost. ", "Maintenance cost increased largely due to the escalations in certain engine contracts. Salaries and related costs increased year-over-year from higher wage rates and longevity increases. These were partially offset by reduced management headcount. ", "As Jeff mentioned, our integration efforts and achievements of synergies are progressing well, and we expect to reach our synergy targets for 2011. We accrued an additional $152 million in profit sharing this quarter for a total of $242 million year-to-date. Profit-sharing payout of course, will be based on our full year profitability. ", "Nonoperating expense was $275 million in the quarter, up $46 million year-over-year. Interest expense declined $39 million due to lower overall debt levels. However, this was offset by a $56 million fuel hedge ineffectiveness expense associated with our WTI hedge positions due to the dislocation between WTI and jet fuel. ", "This charge was about $20 million higher than we expected when we provided guidance late last month due to an even further dislocation between WTI and jet fuel towards the end of the quarter. ", "Our third quarter pretax income was $780 million, a 7.7% pretax margin. While this is a seasonally strong quarter for the airline, we are pleased with our performance in light of the weak economic backdrop. ", "For the last 12 months, our pretax margin was nearly 4% and our return on invested capital was 12%. This quarter was another positive step in achieving our long term objective of generating returns in excess of our cost of capital. ", "Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with an unrestricted cash and short-term investment balance of $8.4 billion. Reduced totaled debt this quarter paying $469 million in debt and capital lease obligations, including a $170 million of prepayments. ", "We have reduced our total debt, including capitalized aircraft lease obligations by $2.1 billion year-to-date. During the quarter, we generated $385 million in operating cash flow, and gross capital expenditures were $196 million. ", "As we continue to generate free cash flow, we intend to invest in our business and to strengthen our balance sheet. We expect our fourth quarter consolidated capacity to be down more than 3% year-over-year and we expect our consolidated CASM, excluding fuel and profit sharing, to increase between 1.5% and 2.5% year-over-year. ", "We anticipate our fourth quarter costs will be modestly higher than originally expected, primarily due to a higher year-end liability adjustments related to workers compensation and pilot long term disability, both of which are affected by the decline in treasury rates. ", "Based on the forward curve as of October 20, we expect our consolidated fuel price to be $3.15 per gallon in the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of nearly 30%. We've hedged approximately 56% of our expected fourth quarter fuel consumption at an average Gulf Coast jet equivalent of $3.23 per gallon.

We are prepared to take additional actions, including reducing capacity further should economic conditions warrant it. ", "As we've mentioned previously, a fundamental component of our fleet strategy is incorporating flexibility, allowing us to resize the fleet to best match the demand environment, while continuing to improve fuel efficiency. As we optimize our network, we plan to reduce both domestic capacity and our domestic fleet counts in 2012. We're converting 14 Boeing 767 300 aircraft from the domestic configuration to our international configuration with flat-bed business first seats and Economy Plus. ", "We're also upgrading fuel efficiency of our domestic fleet by taking delivery of 19 new 737-900ER aircraft in 2012. We plan to retire 19 less efficient narrow-body aircraft from the fleet comprised of 14 737-500s and 5 domestic configuration 757-200 aircraft.

", "In addition to the 767s that we will redeploy internationally, we're expecting to take delivery of 5 787 Dreamliners, which will enter service in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect to retire older less fuel-efficient wide-body aircraft, removing additional 767-200s and a 747 from the fleet.

As this quarter's results demonstrate, we're delivering solid financial results while making significant progress integrating our 2 airlines. This is a challenging industry with significant competition and a brutal level of taxation to overcome. That said, we have the right network, the right product and the right people to deliver on the promise of the new United as we work together to create the world's leading airline. ", "I'll now turn it over to Tyler to open up the call for questions.", "Tyler Reddian", "Thanks, Jeff. First, we'll take questions from the analyst community then will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Hey, 2 questions, I guess, maybe -- these both, maybe, for Zane. When I look at your CapEx in the guidance versus, I think, the last time we saw it, it looks like it's down about $100 million -- maybe $125 million. Is that -- does that reflect maybe taking delivery of maybe 1 or 2 less 787s next year? What's behind that decline?", "Zane Rowe", "No, Mike. What -- the only guidance we've given is 2011, and you are correct in that the CapEx has moved down moderately. As we look at the integration and integration expenses and how we spend that money, there's mostly just timing differences there. And we continue to be fairly thorough on how we view CapEx in the company.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then my second question, Zane -- I mean, I really appreciate the fact that you are providing your return on invested capital, I believe, you said 12%. Can you give us a feel for maybe the weighted average cost of capital? Or if we go back, I think, last quarter, you did indicate that the 12% was well in excess of your cost of capital. I guess, I would ask regarding the cost of capital, if you can't give a -- maybe, a range, is the equity piece, is that being calculated based on your book equity? Or is that a function of the market value of your equity?", "Zane Rowe", "Sure, Mike, it's a good question. When we calculate the return on invested capital, we go back to the more traditional sort of textbook approach to calculating that, which is how you derive the 12%. But if you're asking about the weighted average cost of capital, that's obviously as you highlighted driven by a number of variables. We estimate depending on betas and a number of the inputs, but that number is somewhere between 8% and 9% for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Crissey from UBS.", "Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe for Jim. Thanksgiving and Christmas, can you talk about how their booking? Since they have a bit longer booking curve than the other periods, I imagine?", "James E. Compton", "Yes, Kevin. This is Jim. Right now, we're really comfortable with our holiday bookings. And the comp to [ph] the demand is looking good over the holidays, particularly the peak days, which we\u2019re also revenue managing those days. And in addition, and kind of in line with our capacity discipline strategy, we're taking a lot more aggressive approach on kind of day/week cancellations, particularly in the sub UA network this Thanksgiving versus the past. So looking at the holidays, we feel really comfortable with where we're at.", "Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And if we were to think about the year comparisons, I know there were some storms last year such in December, et cetera. But the comparisons get in December are easier from a RASM prospective? I know the revenue growth isn't as high, but is that the way to think about it? I'm trying to see how the quarter might progress from your 10% on, and I know you don't guide to it but just comp wise.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Yes. You're right. We don't really guide to the revenue performance. I think that if you look at the third quarter in terms of where yields are at and I think we see the environment relatively stable. And so we feel really comfortable with kind of where the fare structure\u2019s at as well as bookings.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gary Chase from Barclays Capital.", "Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to ask a couple on the Atlantic. Couple of your competitors, and if I'm not mistaken, you're alliance partner noted that there was a little bit of softness. I know you said that you haven't seen it yet. I'm wondering if -- what your thoughts are there? And if Jeff's comment about acting nimbly can and does apply in the JV structure, can you respond quickly within that construct?", "James E. Compton", "Hey, Gary. A couple of points. This is Jim. First of all, on kind of our performance. Our performance has also been tied to the capacity discipline so we made adjustments obviously even in the third quarter. So our RASM performance in the third quarter trans-Atlantic of the 7.3%, I believe, is actually our best year-over-year of the quarter so far this year. And I think that's a function of reflecting, being ahead of the fact that the demand and some of the economic issues in Europe and everything adjust capacity. So that strategy, that nimbleness, as Jeff kind of mentioned in his comments, will go forward. And then the other piece with the JV, the 2 -- both companies, the structure has both network teams very much in communication with each other. And they look at opportunities. They look at the challenges, right? In the past, we've seen things as -- done some day or week cancellation, and by using our partner Lufthansa over Frankfurt, but still served the markets, right? And so been able to do a lot of things like that. That's an example of how the 2 companies have worked together. And so I think the things that you're reading today of the capacity, the 2 network teams are always in contact with each other to try to kind of optimize the JV across the trans-Atlantic.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And then just other quick clean up. The Middle East and India RASM numbers, you said they were gaining more year-on-year on an absolute basis. So they even close to established Europe right now?", "James E. Compton", "Are they -- what's that? Are they...", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "The absolute performance, instead of the year-on-year -- I mean, are they as profitable?", "James E. Compton", "Yes. Obviously, there's a length of haul and things like that, but I would say, yes, they're relatively close [ph].", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jamie Baker from JP Morgan.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Might as well keep Jim in the hot seat. I'm curious if corporate demand trends are fairly unified or if any standout at the moment. Obviously, your network tends to occupy Wall Street for lack of better term more than most of your competitors. So I'm principally interested in any trends at the financial services firms.", "James E. Compton", "Jamie, this is Jim. Yes, I think on the corporate side, we talked about demand being relatively stable. I would say it's directly also related in to our corporate business overall. We talked about that 13% increase in yield. And so we're seeing kind of that stable corporate demand. And as you know, Jamie, the window is relatively close in because of the booking curve of the corporate demand. As I look through kind of the different corporate accounts, I think, on a relative basis, there is more of softness in the financial services and so forth relative to -- for instance, the pharmaceuticals, which we have a terrific presence over on the Jersey side and so forth, as well as the oil industry and some of the consulting. On a relative basis, yes, I think there -- we can obviously see some of the softness in the financial service.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And as a follow-up to that, Delta's given some examples of where their unified network is attracting corporate share that they otherwise couldn't target pre-merger. Your network integration is obviously not as mature, but some of that share capture is just going to be natural as opposed to marching in and signing up new contracts. I'm wondering what inning you would say that you're in, in terms of capturing your fair share of the corporate wallet. Is the shift just beginning? Is it close to ending? Or kind of somewhere in between?", "James E. Compton", "Yes, I think the team is really on kind of a good timeline. We're in the first phase of really explaining the value to our corporate partners of this new network. And so I think we are seeing some of the initial things that -- Jamie you referred to kind of a natural as you bring these networks together generating corporate share. But we're actually very early on to it and we're getting really good feedback as the corporate team is working with the -- talking about the value. For instance, in New York -- it's more about the local market for us in New York, having the only connecting hub in the New York area. So I'd like to think we always have a seat for our high yield passenger. The RNP manages that. And so we have that high-yield connecting in New York as well as the local. And so the network, the integration brings a lot of that to the table. So we feel pretty good about where we're at.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Zane, will -- should we be thinking about -- as we're modeling out 2012, will there be a timing mismatch between when some of the costs changed? Whether you can start to get synergies? Or you've got to start to pay labor more versus when you kind of get the productivity from that? Is there going to be sort of lumpiness that we should be thinking through?", "Zane Rowe", "It depends on how you're looking at that but on a gross basis, I think, we're expecting moderate improvements and have actually, I think, taken a good first step this year and obviously, we expect further improvements next year. On the labor side, we don't typically get into what we're accruing for or what we're not accruing for. So a lot of that is just based on our sort of gap assumptions at any point in time. So I guess from your perspective depending on how you're modeling it, you may see some lumpiness just on the expense side.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Jim, the Pacific, have we fully recovered now sort of post-earthquake in that region? Or is there sort of more catch-up to go?", "James E. Compton", "Hey, Bill. Yes, this is Jim. I think there's still -- it's performing -- I mean, recovering really well, but there's still more progress to be made on that from the tragedy. And -- but we see kind of the industry where the Japan point-of-sale versus the U.S. point-of-sale is probably recovering quicker than the U.S. point-of-sale. But both are improving and making its way back towards pre-earthquake level.", "William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Are we materially below where we were running? Or is it not that big anymore?", "James E. Compton", "Not materially below. No, not at all.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore Partners.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just taking a step back, as you look at these revenue results. Revenue up, call it 9%, in the third quarter on GDP of 2.5%. This feels well above long run trends. So I'm just wondering how do you typically think about that relationship as we start to think about next year?", "James E. Compton", "Yes, Duane, it's Jim, a couple of thoughts on that. I think that -- I think we're very pleased with our revenue performance given the kind of the weak economic environment. And so if you went back historically, that is actually different than what we've seen historically kind of where you would be in the recovery at GDP growth. Even up 2.5% is relatively soft post of -- where you would be in the recovery. So again, I think our capacity discipline, as well as the industry discipline, what we've seen, I think, we've done a good job of not -- the traffic that we're missing is the low yield price-sensitive traffic and we're doing a good job of not diluting the higher-end traffic. And I think the capacity discipline has allowed us to do that. And I think that's probably the biggest difference in terms of [ph] breaking that GDP versus revenue growth that you mention.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that perspective. And then just to follow-up on the Pacific. Load's down but maybe not down as much as the last update. Wondering if you could give us sort of any qualitative yield commentary on that advanced book load? And if you sort of had to rank your regions right now, which would be weakest?", "James E. Compton", "Well, yes, I'll point to the -- from a book in the investor update in the Pacific. I think, we're talking about 4 points, 12 points [ph] of book load factor down. In that market, we have some new competition in Chicago, Hong Kong that's driving some of that load factor difference. I'll tell you that we're pleased with where our premium bookings are at. And that some of the softness is more on the leisure side, which gets back to my earlier comment on that. The other thing is that the RM team is revenue managing towards that to a certain extent also and just to -- again, preventing the dilution on the high-yield side. And so we're comfortable with where that book load factor is. So a combination of some new competition, revenue managing it, but we're actually feel pretty good about where it's at.", "Operator", "Hunter Keay is online with a question from Wolfe Trahan.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Jim, what were some of the lessons learned with 1 year under your belt with A++. There are obviously a few true-ups that happened each and every quarter this year. And I think, it\u2019s obviously taking a little more time to school also [ph] and I think, some people, including myself, thought it was going to take. So what were some of the key lessons learned? Should we expect sort of a disproportionate outperformance next year, particularly as Lufthansa implements their own RM system? Anything like that? Any color there?", "James E. Compton", "I think the lessons learned are -- there's a familiarity that's building within the JV both from understanding each other's systems, as well as people, whether it's from a -- making sure that the right price products are out there for our customers and they're consistent, as well as communicating back and forth what each airline is optimizing with their different RM system. And then the network group, which from the beginning has been working closely with each other, there's that familiarity. And so I think as we'd think about that, we feel that there's a lot of benefits to build on as we build that relationship going forward. And I think you're seeing some of the capacity discipline that you're seeing both carriers -- all the carriers in the JV showing right now, it's kind of a result of that. So I think the lesson learned is that we'll be more nimble, quicker to react based on getting to know each other.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Okay. And maybe another 1 for Jim, and then Jeff too, if you want to chime out on this. Back to ETS, obviously, your bolder [ph] goal, I think in your policy, illegal issues aside on this, is it possible that ETS is forcing capacity discipline on this industry? Is it factoring in to your A++ planning? Has it already come into the conversation when you're planning for trans-Atlantic capacity for 2012? And is it possible that this could actually be a net positive for the P&L simply because it's keeping a lot of irrational -- otherwise, irrational  competitors from growing into your markets?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Well, it's a curious thesis, Hunter, but one I don't subscribe to. I think that it's like any other tax, right? And then it will size carriers because it's like any other tax. But it isn't sizing for example, through matching capacity demand and being able to appropriately price the product because the price that we have to put in for the tax, of course, we don't receive any component of it. And therefore, it's not the same as a price increase in response to a market demand, et cetera. So in terms of where it impacts the JV, I'd leave that up to -- Jim probably could give you more color. But clearly, Lufthansa has more exposure within Europe, obviously, than we do. But it's -- I think it's a net negative for the industry and it's a particularly difficult thing because it is truly is the beginning -- could be the beginning of a crazy, \u201cpatchwork of regulation and taxation\u201d to try to remedy issues with a mobile and global emissions source such as the airlines and that's clearly much better handled by [indiscernible].", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Glenn Engel from Bank of America.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "You've talked about putting all coach plus in to the Continental side and it sounds like you're also going to be taking seats out of the 767 as you shift them to international flights. What does that do to overall capacity, the reduction of seats?", "James E. Compton", "Well, obviously, the Economy Plus will contribute to -- we're talking about consolidated capacity going forward being flat in 2012. Being down domestically and up in internationally, Glenn. So, obviously, the economy  plus affects that...", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So is this a 1% hit that you offset by growth? Or is it even less than that or more?", "Zane Rowe", "It's about -- it's less than 1%, probably about between 0.5% and 1%. And again, we're working through, obviously, through with our tech ops group on the schedule and it's how quickly we roll it out in 2012. But less than 1%, I think, will be the impact on 2012.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And which categories are the best opportunities on the cost side for 2012 to offset the normal inflation that you have?", "Zane Rowe", "Glenn, this is Zane. We're in the middle of our budget session. So just for all the people at United listening, all categories are good opportunities for improvement. Honestly, Glenn, as we balance between the integration opportunities here, as well as just the normal budgets, we're going really line by line and seeing where we can be more efficient, learn from both subsidiaries and build that into the plan and we're in the middle of that process right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman from Sterne Agee.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about discussions you're having with your corporate travel customers, the RFPs are out there. People are fixing their own capital budgets for travel next year. What industries -- or if you segment it this way, are you seeing some of the strongest RFP activity? Where have you seen a little bit of weakness? And I guess you said leisure was a little bit weak but corporate has been okay. Could you just give us a little bit more granularity on the discussions you're having in those markets?", "James E. Compton", "Hey, Jeff, this is Jim. We have, obviously, been working with our corporate partners in the last month or so for a lack of better word surveying them. And the feedback we're getting ties to that kind of that stable environment for the majority of them. That being said, you're right. They are focused on their 2012 budget. And so -- but I think right now, it's very consistent with what we're seeing in the demand that majority are kind of planning on spending being relatively kind of like 2011 to up slightly, I think, if you kind of -- you get different things all over. And as I mentioned financial services, you get back into what we saw in 2008. Again not the majority but few of them will talk about possibly looking at their travel policies, which really doesn't involve us but it might be folks planning in advance and things like that. So those are the things we watch as Jeff mentioned in his comments that we\u2019ll watch the demand and adjust capacity, but what we want to do is always being kind of dialogue with our corporates so that we can stay on top of it. But right now, we see kind of stable anticipation for 2012.", "Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. You singled out financial services, and I think we read the headlines and understand what's going on there. Are there other industries that weren't really consumers of corporate travel last year that you think are in a stronger position to contribute next year?", "James E. Compton", "It's hard -- the way we look at corporate travel, quite frankly, when we work with our partners is it's less about a deal and it's more about the quality of the deal. And so -- there's nobody that singles out in and what we're trying to do is, again, show the value of this new network that we have and the value we bring with that and have the discussion around that and what they're needs are. And I think overall, that kind of across the industries, we're seeing a kind of a general same feeling about the uncertainty of the economy and so forth, playing as to how they think about that.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Josh Freed from the Associated Press.", "Joshua Freed - The Associated Press", "Just a quick question on the 747. I saw that in the release this morning that there's 5, I guess, that are nonoperating right now. And it sounds like 1 more coming out next year. Is that taking you -- could you say a little bit more of the future of that airplane with your fleet? And are those reductions related to the Japan situation? Or is there's something else driving that?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Hey, Josh, this is Jeff. Look, the 747 has been a good aircraft over the years for United. However, it is a fairly fuel inefficient aircraft. Now overtime, we would like to replace it with more modern technology and we intend to do so. We don't have an aircraft that we can replace it with right now. And for example, we are putting streaming video in the economy section of that airplane to improve the inflight entertainment experience for our customers today. But in the long run, we will be retiring that aircraft from our fleet.", "Joshua Freed - The Associated Press", "Can you give us an idea of how long the long run is?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "It will take many years because we don't have anything to replace it with currently. We've got A350s on order that we begin to take in 2016. So it'll take at least to be in the course. That's just the beginning as we undertake those aircraft. So it will be over the course of this decade as we put those aircraft down and take replacements.", "Joshua Freed - The Associated Press", "All right. And in the short run, is any of that related to Japan demand? Or is that a nonissue for that plane?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "No, it's not related to Japan demand.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mary Jane Credeur from the Bloomberg News.", "Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News", "Speaking of aircraft, can you guys give us an update on when you plan to make a decision on a narrow-body order? And should we look for that before year-end? Or is that more likely in 2012 thing?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Well, Mary Jane, this is Jeff. As you know, Continental had a and has a good aircraft order for its network and United has some airplanes as well on order. But neither carrier really had the right order for the combined network. And as we continue with refreshing the fleet and bringing in modern and fuel-efficient airplanes as we continue to invest in the product, we are going to need some additional mainline aircraft. That's something that we're visiting on right now. And when we're ready to announce something, we will announce it.", "Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News", "And a quick follow-up, we saw your friends in Atlanta scale back their narrow order and went with just a 100 mainline jets. It was a little more conservative than their initial plan of maybe as many as 200, including some smaller -- a smaller jets. What's your bias as you think about that order and approach it? Are you viewing it as a more of a bullish large long-term thing? Or should we be thinking in terms of something more conservative?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Well, what we're looking at -- one of the things we're looking at basically, is just the fuel efficiency of modern aircraft, maintenance reliability, dispatch reliability, customer-pleasing attributes, et cetera. So it isn't so much a bet on growth as much as it is. We have a lot of older aircraft coming off leisure, off finance that are not fuel-efficient that we do want to replace. And we'll also obviously model out where we think the number of aircraft that we will need over the long run and -- but we're not really in a position to discuss that publicly yet.", "Operator", "At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would now turn the call over to Ms. Nene Foxhall for any final remarks.", "Irene E. Foxhall", "Thank you. Thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today.

Please go ahead.", "Nene Foxhall", "Thank you, Michelle. Good morning everyone and welcome to United Continental Holdings full year and fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Zane Rowe.", "Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which Jim will review capacity and revenue results. Zane will follow with the discussion of our cost structure, the balance sheet and guidance. Jeff will make a few closing remarks and then we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We would appreciate it if you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. ", "With that, I'll turn it over to Tyler. Thank you.", "Tyler Reddian", "Thank you Nene. Our earnings release and separate investor update were issued this morning and are available on our website at ir.unitedcontinentalholdings.com.", "Let me point out that information in this morning's earnings press release and investor update and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. ", "A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings, United Airlines and Continental Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.", "Also during the course of the call we\u2019ll be discussing several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the table at the end of the earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website.", "Our full year 2011 results are presented on a combined basis for United Continental Holdings. Full year 2011 results discussed today, including comparisons against prior year will be based on unaudited pro forma financial results for the combined company and include estimates of the impact of purchase accounting. For additional details, please refer to our investor updates issued during 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010, which are also available on our website. ", "Unless otherwise noted, as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter we will be excluding special items, merger-related expenses and/or fuel hedged non-cash net mark-to-market gains and losses. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "In the fourth quarter we reclassified revenue associated with our non-air mileage redemption through our MileagePlus loyalty program from passenger revenue to other revenue in 2010 and 2011 and these results have been adjusted to reflect the change. For additional information, please refer to our investor update issued today.", "And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jeffery Smisek, President and CEO of United.", "Jeffery Smisek", "Thanks Nene and Tyler and good morning and thank you all for joining us for our 2011 full year earnings call. Today we reported net income of $1.3 billion for the full year or $3.49 per diluted share, delivering a 3.6% pre-tax margin. For the quarter we earned $109 million of profit or $0.30 per diluted share. ", "2011, our first full year as a merged airline was a year on many successes for the new United. We received our single operating certificate, made good progress with our labor groups, delivered record passenger revenue, exceeded our goal of achieving 25% of our merger synergies for the year and generated returns in excess of our cost of capital. ", "My co-workers worked together all year to run a clean, safe and reliable airline, while integrating our two subsidiaries. I am proud of the progress we made in 2011 and I thank my co-workers for all they did for the new United this past year. All their hard work paid off as we accrued $265 million of profit sharing for 2011. That represents about 5% of the eligible compensation of each participant in the program. My management team and I look forward to distributing profit sharing cheques to co-workers on Valentines Day, February 14, as we share in the profit that we all helped to create. ", "I\u2019ve been clear that we\u2019re working hard to turn the new United into a real business; that is a business that sustainably generates returns in excess of it\u2019s cost to capital. Sufficient and sustainable profitability will permit us to build the airline our co-workers want to work for, our customers want to fly and our investors want to invest in. ", "There is no doubt that 2011 was a challenging year for the U.S. and global economies, marked by a high end employment, slow GDP growth in the U.S. and across much of the globe, high and volatile jet fuel prices, the debt crises in Europe and the adverse impact of the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. ", "Our ability to generate $1.3 billion of pre-tax earnings in this adverse environment is a testament to our financial and operational flexibility and company wide focus on sustained and sufficient profitability. While we made significant progress integrating the operations of our two subsidiaries in 2011, 2012 is the year that we will become one airline for our customers. We will have one brand, one website, one loyalty program and one name. ", "As I\u2019ve discussed with you before, the key to our becoming one airline for our customers is our conversion to a single passenger service system, which is known as shares and is the system currently used by our continental subsidiary. Our information technology, reservations and the airport services teams have developed and thoroughly tested our conversion. ", "The shares platform is already integrated with continental.com, which will be re-branded as united.com and will be our combined website. We have devoted significant training, staffing and technology resources to ensure the success of our conversion to shares, which will take place in early March. ", "After this conversion, all agents will be able to serve all our customers. We will be able to freely flow all our aircraft across our network and park at all our gates. We will have a single reservation system managing all our bookings and on our website and by phone and we\u2019ll have a single loyalty program and our lead levels for all our customers. The flexibility and functionality of shares are key to achieving our goal of delivering 75% of our annual expected merger synergies in 2012. ", "Once we\u2019ve completed the conversion of shares, we will re-launch united.com, which will provide us with the right platform for innovation as we continue to develop new travel options and products that our customers will value and that will contribute to our bottom line. We will also launch our combined loyalty program MileagePlus.", "We are making significant investments in our onboard product, airport experience and our industry leading loyalty program and I\u2019m excited by what we have in store for our customers this year.", "We began installing Economy Plus on our Continental fleet in December and will complete our entire Boeing 757 fleet by early February. By the end of 2012 we expect to have our entire mainline fleet outfitted with Economy Plus. We continue to install our lie-flat seats on our international aircraft and we expect to have virtually all of our international aircraft reconfigured by the end of this year. ", "We will be the first U.S. airline to offer global in-flight connectivity when we begin our satellite based WiFi installation program in the second half of 2012. We will also begin a complete nose to tail overhaul of the interiors of our popular PS Trans-Con fleet later this year for flights between FJK and San Francisco in Los Angelus and when we\u2019re done, we will have the best Trans-Con product in the industry.", "We continue to invest in a fuel-efficient fleet and expect to bring five Boeing 787 Dreamliners into service in the second half of the year. The Dreamliners will be a game changing aircraft and we eagerly anticipate its induction into our fleet. In addition to the Dreamliners, we expect to take delivery of 19 Boeing 737-900ER\u2019s with the Boeing Sky Interior this year.", "We are also focused on enhancing the customer experience at our airports. Just this past Monday we broke ground on the first phase of our billion-dollar investment in Terminal B at Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. In Chicago, we are installing additional jet bridges for our United Express Operation in O\u2019Hare\u2019s Terminal 2. We are refreshing the interiors of many of our United Clubs around the system and we are building a new club in Terminal 2 at O\u2019Hare. ", "Since we merged a little over a year ago, we\u2019ve already co-located operations at 66 airports and have common gate areas at more than 290 airports, making connections and airport navigation easier for almost 80% of all customers flying on our network.", "MileagePlus is the worlds leading loyalty program and we intend to keep it that way. We continue rolling out new ways for our customers to earn and redeem miles by expanding the number of business partners that participate in the MileagePlus loyalty network. The 2012 MileagePlus program launches in early March and features a new five tier elite program that recognizes and rewards our most valuable customers. We are expanding our customer service resources and the geographic footprint for our renowned global services program, our top elite tier. ", "We are also continuing to integrate our workgroups that have made significant progress to better align the pay benefits and work rules for several of our work groups, on the path to negotiating joint collective bargaining agreements. Our United technicians represented by the teamsters recently ratified a new contract that better aligned their compensation and work rules with that of their continental co-workers and we will soon begin the process of negotiating a joint collective bargaining agreement. ", "We recently reached a tentative agreement with the association of flight attendants for a new contract for our United flight attendants. The contract is currently up for ratification and when that\u2019s done, we\u2019ll begin the process of negotiating a joint agreement for our flight attendants. ", "We began negotiations for a joint agreement with our ramp co-workers and our customer service airport and reservation agent co-workers are currently in an election process to determine whether or not they wish to be represented by a union. Our engineers recently rejected union representation in favor of a direct relationship with the company. ", "We continue to have productive discussions with our pilots. The United Master Executive Council of the airline pilots association recently elected a new leader and we believe that he has a significant opportunity to engage constructively with the company and make progress on delivering a joint collective bargaining agreement that is fair to the pilots and fair to the company. ", "We are making significant strides towards becoming the worlds leading airline, but none of it would be possible without generating sufficient profitability. Returns in excess of our cost of capital allow us to invest in our product, our people, our fleet, our facilities and our technology and ultimately provide rewards to all of our stakeholders. We have much more work to do, but we are clearly on the right path.", "Before I turn it over to Jim and Zane to walk you through the numbers, I would like to extend my thanks to our customers around the globe for their ongoing loyalty and for supporting us as we work towards completing our integration. We are working very hard to continue to earn your business. Jim?", "Jim Compton", "Thanks Jeff. I join Jeff in thanking our co-workers for their hard work this quarter and year and our customers for choosing to fly United. ", "United\u2019s fourth quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue increased 8.2% and mainline PRASM improved 7.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Yield improvements again drove our revenue gains this quarter. For the full year United\u2019s consolidated unit passenger revenue increased 9.2% versus 2010, leading the US network carriers during a challenging economic backdrop. ", "Consolidated yield for the full year increased 10.6% year-over-year. Capacity discipline, fare management and the United\u2019s outstanding route network drove the year-over-year yield in revenue growth. ", "Throughout 2011 we demonstrated our commitment to matching capacity to demand across the network. Our fourth quarter consolidated capacity decreased by 2.5% from the same period in 2010. Domestic mainline capacity decreased nearly 5% and Trans-Atlantic capacity declined 2% in the quarter as compared to last year. For the full year the company reduced consolidated capacity by 0.2% and mainline capacity by 0.3% year-over-year. ", "Fourth quarter domestic mainline PRASM increased 10.3% on a year-over-year yield increase of 9.8% and a capacity decrease of about 5%. For the full year domestic mainline PRASM increased 10.9% and a 10.6% increase in yields and a 2.8% decline in capacity versus 2010. This is an excellent full year result for the domestic mainline entity. Fares throughout the year remain higher due to successful fare increases, industry wide capacity discipline and early network optimization from our merger.", "Regional PRASM grew by 11.3% in the fourth quarter and 9.4% in 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010. International unit revenue increased 4.3% in the fourth quarter and 7.9% for the full year versus 2010. Fourth quarter and full year international yields improved 6.8% and 10.9% respectively. International capacity declined 0.3% in the quarter.", "Latin America again was United\u2019s best performing entity this quarter and holds our top spot for the full year as well. Latin America PRASM drew 11.7% in the fourth quarter and 17.6% for the full year. Yields grew by more than 11% in the quarter and 19.5% for the full year. South America continued to significantly improve on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter with premium and economy PRASM up 17% and 15.5% respectively.", "Trans-Atlantic PRASM increased 3.7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter with yields up 6.5%. For the full year Trans-Atlantic unit revenue grew 5.1% and yield increased by 8.7%. Premium cabin demand to continental Europe and the UK was strong in the fourth quarter, with yields in PRASM up year-over-year. Middle East PRASM increased 5.3% and yields grew 6.4% with double-digit gains in the premium cabin. ", "Our Pacific network generated PRASM growth of 6.4% for the full year, with fourth quarter PRASM up 1.1%. Yields grew 9.3% during 2011 versus 2010 and 4.5% for the fourth quarter. Our pacific presence is unmatched in the industry and it remains one of our most profitable entities. China PRASM end yield in the economy cabin decreased during the quarter, but were partially offset by higher fares yield in PRASM in the premium cabin. ", "Corporate revenue continued to show steady improvement in the fourth quarter. Corporate yields grew 9% versus the fourth quarter 2010 and revenue improved 13%. For the full year our corporate revenue increased more than 14% with double digit yield growth and corporate fares up 9%. ", "Business today is more global than ever and we continue to develop the United network and product portfolio to be a single solution for the corporate traveler. Our corporate customer portfolio is comprised of a diverse group of industries and this diversity provides United a unique hedge against demand volatility in any one sector. ", "We have ongoing conversations with our corporate customers to best understand their near term travel needs and longer term outlook. Based on our most recent discussions, the majority of our global corporate accounts expect 2012 travel volumes to be flat to up and travel spend to moderately increase versus 2011, with first quarter trends expected to mimic the full year.", "Fourth quarter cargo revenue declined 8.1% versus the same period last year. We continue to feel the adverse impact of increased industry cargo capacity, particularly across the pacific. Cargo yields increased 5%, while cargo volumes decreased about 12% year-over-year. ", "During 2011 we generated approximately $250 million of revenue synergies, beating our expectation. We expect to generate significantly more revenue synergies in 2012, enabled largely by our conversion to a single passenger service system. ", "During 2011 we reduced capacity to right size our supply for the expected demand. In light of our latest demand projections and U.S. and global economic growth expectations for the year, we continue to believe that we should hold our capacity flat with a downward bias for 2012. We expect our first quarter 2012 consolidated capacity to be down slightly year-over-year. As a reminder 2012 is a leap year and as a result we expect to see capacity growth in February, which adds more than a point of capacity for the first quarter.", "We look forward to converting to a single passenger service system in early March, which will allow us to optimize our combined network and match the right aircraft with the right markets. While we have already done some modest optimization on a limited basis as opportunities arise, we plan to make more material schedule changes as we move through the year. ", "A single passenger service system is not just about the schedule; however, it also provides us the opportunity to introduce new ancillary products. Ancillary revenue this quarter grew by 5% year-over-year and for the full year we generated more than $2 billion in ancillary revenue. ", "Our existing portfolio with ancillary products and services, led by our Economy Plus seating is well received by our customers. Once we convert to shares, we will harmonize our ancillary product portfolio and begin to roll out new products for the new United. ", "That said, core passenger demand remained stable and solid and based on our latest forecast we estimate United\u2019s January consolidated PRASM will increase approximately 11% year-over-year. Domestic yields continue to show strong improvement year-over-year and we have seen numerous fare actions recently to further improve the yield environment. This PRASM estimate is preliminary based on the data we have for January this far. ", "Looking further into the first quarter, we faced more difficult comps in February and March. Our advanced booked seat factor is solid, up one point domestically, however we do see a reduction in advanced book seat factor in the pacific, primarily due to the shift of the Chinese New Year from February last year to January this year, which moved bookings earlier in the year in 2012.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Zane.", "Zane Rowe", "Thanks Jim.

", "So as we look at December PRASM which was a little softer and January came actually a lot better than I was expecting, so I will mention that, but do you think that its possible or its probable that there was some hiccup on the revenue side because of sort of post SOC, maybe integration, I don\u2019t want to say headaches, but unforeseen difficulties and might the revenue synergies now shift to sort of be a back half of the year, should we expect you guys to think about outperforming in PRASM maybe in the back half of 2012 and may be expect a few more hiccups over the next three to four months. ", "Jim Compton", "Hey Hunter, this is Jim. I think a couple of comments on that. I would first say that I don\u2019t think there was anything that was unexpected. One example I\u2019ll give you is that in early December we moved to a single optimizer in the revenue management perspective. In preparing for that, we tool a little bit more conservative view in how we would handle bookings and so forth and that would have an effect on yield closer in. So not unexpected, so I want to be sure that I\u2019m clear on that. ", "What we wanted to do was make sure that as we move into 2012 with the single optimizer, which is now forecasting from one system that we captured the synergies that we were expecting from that. So to your point, there are things that were happening. Still the other piece is that we are operating on two systems in a number of areas still. ", "As Jeff mentioned in his comments we are really looking forward to the PSS integration in March. That will allow us to begin to capture many of the synergies across the network. So I think your point is a good one, I think the synergies will begin to move quicker obviously after we\u2019re passed PSS. ", "One of the things, and another example in that is that we are moving to the continental.com site we will be renamed united.com. So even through we moved past PSS, what we\u2019ll quickly do is close what we call as some of the PSS gaps, so that on united.com there\u2019s ancillary products such as premier line and other products like that that generate revenue that the continental.com sites did not have. ", "So there will be that period of time that we\u2019ll quickly, working with our technology folks to get those applications on to the new united.com site, which again will give us a little bit of time to recapture that revenue to move on and then at the same point begin to introduce new products.", "So I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful, but I would say things aren\u2019t unexpected, but we realize that for operating under two systems in certain areas, its not only difficult for our customers, our employees, that does create I call it some friction to invest in the network that we\u2019re working through and we\u2019ll get it with PSS.", "Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan", "All right Jim, thanks.

They had a much higher PRASM gain in the quarter. What can you tell us about that? ", "Jim Compton", "Okay Michael. Just a couple of thoughts. I think as you think about China, I think its more related quite frankly to capacity. So for us in Chicago to Hong Kong, Cathay started flying in the market in September and so forth and so there is that increased capacity. ", "We have Shanghai flying, so over the year we started at that, transferring. They operate at really high revenue performances, but I do think those are things that put a pressure on the PRASM in China relative to Japan, because obviously if we look at our Japan versus China we see significant PRASM relative to what we are seeing in China. So I think its more the capacity side than anything.

I just wanted to follow-up to an earlier question regarding your systems cut over here in the first quarter.

I understand there is synergy potential that you can\u2019t realize today that\u2019s on the other side of this, but I\u2019m just thinking, as we think about the cutover, is there a migration period where you might have to not push as hard as you otherwise would.

We are also obviously staffing up for that period of time, we\u2019ve got a large number of people around the system who are experts in shares; they are called success teams around the systems, so we are confident about the cutover, but I think that that portion of it is actually fairly modest in terms of the revenue effect. ", "Jim Compton", "Yes Duane, this is Jim. I\u2019ll just add to it with my comments about moving to a single optimizer right. One of the reasons we wanted to move quickly working with our technology partners and the revenue management folks is so that we can be up and running as quickly as possible. So we are actually, the forecasting we are doing for demand is now an improved system, a one system across the whole network.

So I think in the Trans-Atlantic, really across our whole system, as you think about capacity discipline, we\u2019ve always kind of \u2013 it\u2019s very much adhered to capacity discipline, but also kind of stabled capacity and not having really big swings in capacity, because we think over the long term that\u2019s the best way to manage directly.

", "Its more than just about the local market, right. It\u2019s a terrific connecting hub and most of the connections through our hub are actually international. So we are the only carrier that has really what I call the true connecting hub, single connecting hub in New York, so for us that\u2019s strength. We see steady market share as I mentioned and we think the benefits of the network and as give PS, past PSS we will actually bring more value to the customer in New York. ", "Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News", " ", "So you anticipate that market share is climbing in the next few years? ", "Jim Compton ", "We are about managing towards returns and so I want to be careful when I talk about market share, because what we are really trying to do is generate stable and sustainable profits, right and our New York strategy is going to play in that, just as much as it plays across our whole network. ", "Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News", "Great, thank you Jim.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ronnie Crocker from Houston Chronicle. Please go ahead.", "Ronnie Crocker - Houston Chronicle ", "Thanks. I have a question about Houston specifically. When you talk about the capacity and what happened in 2011 which forecasted in 2012, where does Bush Intercontinental stand and \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Bush International Airport stand and how did the Latin American growth effect that. ", "Jeffery Smisek", "Ronnie, this is Jeff. Our Houston hub is our largest by departures and its an incredibly important part of our network, its our gateway to Latin America. Latin America right now is a very strong entity for us. We\u2019ve had significant year-over-year unit revenue growth. It is an important market for us; it will remain an important market for us. You\u2019ve seen us recently announce a new international service out of Houston. We started Houston Legos (ph); we\u2019ve announced Houston Auckland. I think you will continue to see Houston be very important to the new United. ", "Ronnie Crocker - Houston Chronicle", "And so do you see any flights being cut out of here and when these five new Dreamliners arrive, how many of them will be flying in or out of Intercontinental?", "", "Jim Compton", "", "Hey Ronnie, this is Jim here. A lot of those plans aren\u2019t formalized now, but adding on to Jeff\u2019s points now, we\u2019ve launched Houston Lego (ph). Just last week our Chief Operating Officer there was breaking ground on Terminal B, Phase I expansion. So to Jeff\u2019s point, its our biggest hub. Quite frankly our corporate travel business, the biggest factor is our energy business. So Houston is really important to us and its going to be really important to us in the future. ", "Ronnie Crocker - Houston Chronicle", "Okay, thank you. ", "Nene Foxhall", "Okay with that we are out of time, so we\u2019ll conclude. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Please call me at the relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking with you next quarter. Good-bye. ", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Nene Foxhall and Sarah Murphy. Please go ahead.", "Irene E. Foxhall", "Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone and welcome to United's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us in Chicago to discuss our results are President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Pete McDonald; and Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, Gerry Laderman. Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which, Jim will review capacity and revenue results. John will follow with a discussion of our cost structure, balance sheet and guidance. Jeff will make a few closing remarks, and then we'll open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We would appreciate it if you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll turn it over to Sarah Murphy, our new Head of Investor Relations.", "Sarah Murphy", "Thank you, Nene. This morning. we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Both are available on our website at ir.united.com. Let me point out that information in this morning's earnings release and investor update and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company.", "A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings, United Airlines and Continental Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.", "Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release. Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, President and CEO of United.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, Nene and Sarah, and thank you all for joining us on our second quarter 2012 earnings call.", "Today, we reported net income of $545 million for the second quarter or $1.41 per diluted share,  delivering a pre-tax margin of 5.5%. Based on our year-to-date profit, we've accrued $54 million in profit-sharing for our coworkers so far this year.", "This is our first full quarter operating as a single airline, following our conversion to a single passenger service system. Now, all of our customers can purchase tickets through a single website, united.com, experience a single check-in process through our mobile app, website or at the airport, and earn miles in a single loyalty program, MileagePlus.", "The shares conversion was successful, but following the cutover, we faced a number of issues. As we identify these conversion-related issue, our top priority was to improve the customer and coworker experience by determining the cause and quickly deploying teams to fix the problem. We made significant progress on these issues during the second quarter, and customers calling our reservations line now experience normal wait and handle times, MileagePlus miles for United flights now post within 48 hours of travel, and complementary upgrades for our premier members now clear in a timely manner.", "I'd like to thank my coworkers for working together to promptly resolve the conversion-related issues and for their commitment to taking care of customers during a challenging time.", "Although working with a new system and implementing new processes are not easy, we're excited to begin using the share system because of the power and flexibility it provides. We plan a number of improvements, including an enhanced front-end interface for our airport and contact center agents. This new tool will make fulfilling customer requests and making changes easier and faster for our coworkers. We rolled out a test of the first of several planed releases for our airport agent interface 2 weeks ago, improving the speed and ease of handling premium cabin up-sells, same-day upgrades and standby requests.", "Our next major release occurs in October, which includes a new user-friendly design and experience, easier elite recognition, automatic calculation of service charges and better flight amenity details. In 2013, we will implement a comprehensive new front-end interface for our airport and reservations agents, which will enable us to deliver a higher level of service than we've ever been able to offer in the past.", "Although our financial results this quarter are solid, our operational performance didn't meet our goal of providing the reliability that our customers expect. During the quarter, our performance declined on metrics such as on-time arrival, mishandled bag rates and cancellations. We recognize that we added new stress to the system by simultaneously converting to a single passenger service system, implementing hundreds of new processes and procedures, rerouting aircraft across our network and harmonizing our maintenance programs. Those changes were in large part responsible for the degradation in our operational performance.", "Pete MacDonald, our Chief Operations Officer, is leading an aggressive effort to address these issues.", "In mid-May, we launched our first wave of domestic aircraft redeployment, and we're pleased with the early results on these routes. However, our redeployment strategy brings some complexity to our operations for a period of time, since redeploying aircraft introduces a new aircraft type to a new market or hub. For instance, using Airbus aircraft in Houston or Boeing 737s in Chicago.", "Additionally, that complexity is amplified during irregular operations caused by weather or mechanical issues, and during peak travel times like the summer. To help our airports and manned maintenance stations during this period of change, we're increasing staffing levels to the remainder of the year.", "At our United subsidiary, we had reduced the number of spare aircraft in the system, as we introduced more preventative maintenance visits and aligned the maintenance programs of our 2 subsidiary fleets. We are, however, reversing our spare reduction decision based on the recent increase in long flight delays and cancellations on our United subsidiary fleet. We are returning to our historical level of spares at our United subsidiary, and are increasing our line maintenance touch points and hours, which we expect will quickly improve our schedule reliability.", "Once we are past this period of change, we believe that we'll be able to return to a more efficient spares complement.", "Although we faced challenges this quarter, we laid the groundwork for United's future. I know we caused some customer disservice because of all the changes we've made so quickly, and I apologize for that. We hold ourselves to a higher customer service and reliability standard than we've delivered for our customers lately, and we will return to the level of service and reliability our customers expect.", "Looking beyond that, we're investing across the enterprise to improve the product and services we offer our customers. This will help us reach our goal of achieving sufficient and sustained profitability and generating returns in excess of our cost of capital across the business cycle.", "We continue investing in products that our customers value and are willing to pay for, and are aligning our onboard offerings across subsidiaries and fleet types. To date, we've installed Economy Plus seating on 86% of our mainline fleet and plan to finish outfitting our entire mainline fleet with Economy Plus by January 2013.", "Our Premium Cabin flat-bed seats are now installed on 87% of our international fleet, including our first reconfigured and retrofitted International 767-300ER. We'll complete installation of flat-bed seats on our entire international fleet by the end of the first quarter of 2013. We improved our premium international in-flight dining experience with enhanced gourmet meals and course-by-course meal service in Global First and BusinessFirst. We began installing global satellite-based Wi-Fi in August, introducing the product first on Airbus A319 aircraft, followed by the Boeing 747 and 737-900ERs. Given the size of our fleet, the installation process across our entire mainline fleet will take about 3 years.", "United is committed to investing in a modern, customer-pleasing and fuel-efficient fleet. And 2 weeks ago, we announced a new narrow-body aircraft order for 100 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft and 50 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft. These planes offer a significant improvement in customer experience, fuel efficiency, environmental responsibility and operating cost compared to the aircraft they're replacing. We are replacing our older, less fuel-efficient aircraft types, such as the Boeing 757-200s, which currently fly domestically.", "Together with our existing orders, our new narrow-body order ensures that in the coming years, United will have a highly efficient and flexible fleet that offers customers the amenities they want.", "We expect to take delivery of our first Boeing 787 Dreamliner in September, flying first between our U.S. hubs before moving to international service. The 787 is a game-changer, with unparalleled fuel efficiency and customer-pleasing amenities, such as large windows and a modern cabin design to reduce the effects of jet lag. It gives us the opportunity to operate more efficiently while offering our customers the best airplane in the skies, and is a powerful competitive advantage as we will be the first North American airline to fly the Dreamliner.", "We're improving our global network by introducing new service. During the second quarter, we launched new service route from New York to Buenos Aires, from San Francisco to Washington Reagan National, and from Washington Dulles to Manchester and Dublin. We're also investing in our hub airports. At O'Hare's Terminal 2, we're building a new United Club which will triple the size of our existing club and will feature a modern look and feel and we're installing an additional 10 jet bridges at our United Express gates, enhancing our customers' experience while on the ground in Chicago.", "We continue to innovate our industry-leading Loyalty Program MileagePlus with 90 million members worldwide. We recognize the significant opportunity to create value by building the strongest loyalty currency possible. In addition to offering unmatched opportunities to earn miles, we're committed to offering excellent air and non-air redemption opportunities. United recently earned recognition as the carrier with the most award seat availability among U.S. global airlines. We know how important it is to our members to receive award travel, and we're proud to be the best in the industry.", "In March, we introduced the United Club card, the latest product in the United MileagePlus Chase Visa portfolio. The United Club card is a premium card offering holders a number of options to access United Club lounges across our industry-leading global network, Premier Access, our priority airport experience, a mileage bonus when using the card, and complementary first and second checked bags. Interest in the new United Club Card is very strong, and we're looking forward to growing our card portfolio and other loyalty opportunities in the coming quarters.", "We're also investing in our coworkers by getting them the right tools to do their jobs safely and efficiently, and by recognizing them for their great work. In addition to the upcoming user-interface improvements to shares, in May, we open a new Network Operations Center, or NOC, in downtown Chicago. The NOC is the nerve center for our airline, where we do aircraft routing, load planning, crew scheduling and weather forecasting. United's NOC is a world-class operations center, with the best technology and tools for our coworkers, who manage our round-the-clock global operation. We're also improving coworkers' access to health and wellness professionals by building an employee medical clinic at O'Hare.", "During the second quarter, we introduced our Outperform Recognition Program. The program gives customers the opportunity to recognize an employee for providing outstanding service using our mobile app. Coworkers who are nominated by customers are entered into a drawing to win cash prizes, including a top prize of $50,000. Any MileagePlus member submitting a nomination is also entered into a drawing for prizes such as MileagePlus miles and round-trip tickets on United.", "We continue making progress in bringing our employee groups together. In June, we reached a tentative agreement with our flight attendants from our Continental subsidiary, and that agreement was ratified 2 weeks ago, 3 months ahead of the contract's amendable date. In addition, last week, we reached a tentative agreement with our Continental Micronesia flight attendants. In the last 9 months, we've achieved ratified agreements with 5 of our work groups, including United and Continental flight attendants, United and Continental Micronesia Mechanics and", "Continental Ground School Instructors.", "We continue to make progress in mediated joint negotiations with ALPA, our pilots union. At the request of the National Mediation Board, we won't be giving further details on the status of our pilot negotiations at this time. However, we remain focused on bringing our work groups together as quickly as we can, with responsible joint collective bargaining agreements that pay competitively.", "We're pleased with the progress we've made this quarter, but our operational performance and financial results are not yet where we want them to be. We will work hard to improve our results, and I'm excited by what we'll deliver for our customers and our coworkers as we work together to build the world's leading airline.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Jim and John to go through the results in greater detail.", "James E. Compton", "Thanks Jeff. I also want to thank our coworkers for their hard work this quarter, and our customers for choosing to fly United.", "We remain committed to capacity discipline to generate sustained and sufficient profitability. Our second quarter consolidated capacity decreased 0.6% year-over-year. Although the cost of jet fuel came down, we recognize that jet fuel prices are very volatile, and we continue our commitment to capacity discipline.", "United's second quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue increased 3% and mainline PRASM increased 1.8% versus the second quarter of 2011. Consolidated yields improved 1.8% and consolidated load factor increased 0.9% as compared to the second quarter last year.", "Second quarter domestic mainline PRASM increased 1.1% and yields increased 1.3% year-over-year. Domestic mainline capacity decreased 0.5% as compared to the second quarter last year. Regional PRASM grew by 8.5% while regional capacity declined 3.0% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2011. International unit revenue increased 2.6% in the second quarter versus 2011.", "Second quarter international yields improved 0.7%, while international capacity was roughly flat in the quarter.", "The Pacific was United's best-performing region in the second quarter, with unit revenue up 6.6%, and yields up 4.9% versus the same period in 2011. Our Pacific PRASM results include proceeds United received from a business interruption claim related to the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami. This out-of-period item increased our second quarter Pacific year-over-year PRASM growth by about 2 percentage points.", "Japan was once again the top-performing Pacific country, with approximately 15% PRASM and 11% yield growth versus the second quarter of 2011. Japan premium cabin demand was particularly strong in the second quarter, as PRASM increased 25% year-over-year. Pacific capacity increased 5.6% year-over-year as we began to lap our flight between Los Angeles and Shanghai, which we introduced in May 2011. We continue to strengthen our Pacific route network, and this month announced new service between San Francisco and Taipei starting in 2013.", "Second quarter transatlantic PRASM increased 2.3% and yields increased 1.1% year-over-year. We reduced our transatlantic capacity during the quarter by 4.1% year-over-year, as we trim capacity in the face of Europe's continuing economic challenges. While Europe showed moderate revenue growth in the quarter, India was an outstanding performer, with overall PRASM up 10% and premium cabin PRASM up 14% versus the same period in 2011.", "The Latin America entities faced very challenging year-over-year comparisons this quarter. Last year, Latin America PRASM and yields increased more than 20% versus the second quarter of 2010. This year, Latin America's second quarter PRASM declined 3.4% and yields declined 7.2%. On a year-over-year basis however -- on a 2-year, year-over-year basis, however, second quarter Latin America PRASM and yield are up approximately 16% and 14%, respectfully.", "Corporate customers continue to recognize United's superior network. In the second quarter, corporate revenue improved nearly 16% versus the same period in 2011, driven primarily by an increase in corporate passengers. Second quarter cargo revenue declined 60% versus the same period last year. The cargo business continues to struggle as the market digests increased industry capacity, particularly in the Middle East and Pacific.", "Outstanding Economy Plus and Premium Cabin upsell sales drove second quarter ancillary revenue up 11% year-over-year. Our strong ancillary revenue performance this quarter is largely due to our conversion to shares, which enables dynamic pricing, improved targeting and bundling of ancillary products and services. Economy Plus revenue grew more than 25% versus the second quarter of 2011. As Jeff mentioned, Economy Plus seating is available on 86% of our mainline fleet. And sales of those new seats account for roughly 1/3 of the year-over-year Economy Plus sales improvement this quarter.", "Second quarter sales of Premium Cabin upsell, our products allowing customers to gain access into the BusinessFirst or Global First cabins, increased 20% year-over-year. We know customers value more space, comfort and legroom when they fly, and United leads the industry in innovative seating products. The economic environment remains tepid. And as I just mentioned, the price of jet fuel remains very volatile. We have not changed our expectations for 2012 consolidated capacity, which we expect to decrease between 0.5% and 1.5% versus 2011. We expect third quarter 2012 consolidated capacity to decrease between 0.7% and 1.7% year-over-year.", "In the investor update we issued today, we detailed our third quarter and full year capacity outlook for all of our geographic entities. When we reduced our full year capacity outlook in March of this year, the reduction was weighted towards international flying, most notably, the Atlantic. We expect our transatlantic capacity to decrease 2.7% to 3.7% year-over-year in the third quarter, and 2.1% to 3.1% year-over-year for the full year. We continued redeploying aircraft across our domestic network in May. We are excited about our expanded ability to match capacity with demand on a flight-by-flight basis, and are seeing improved revenue results in a variety of markets. We learned a number of lessons from the first round of redeployments, and will apply them to our second leg, which we expect to implement with the September schedule.", "Turning to our near-term revenue outlook, we estimate United's July consolidated PRASM will be roughly flat year-over-year.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John Rainey", "Thanks, Jim. Today we reported over $0.5 billion of profit for the second quarter, in large part due to the efforts of my coworkers. I want to thank the entire team for working through challenges of our merger integration this quarter.", "For the second quarter, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $546 million and a pre-tax margin of 5.5%. Excluding the impact of our fuel hedges, our pre-tax margin improved 2.7 points year-over-year to 6.2%.", "Before I move to a discussion of second quarter results, I want to address the accounting adjustments to passenger revenue that we disclosed earlier this week. In connection with our conversion to a single passenger service system in March, we also converted to the Continental Airlines' revenue accounting system. During the second quarter, we made additional enhancements to the revenue accounting system, including a systematic reconciliation of open tickets to the general ledger balance of advanced ticket sales.", "These enhancements provide for more precision in the way that we recognize revenue and rely less on estimates. However, the timing of the implementation this quarter resulted in recording some April and May revenue adjustments in June.", "Although the second quarter was not without its bumps, our results are still good by historical standards. I firmly believe the profit we reported today is an endorsement of the structural changes we are making in this business.", "Our second quarter total operating expense increased 3.4% or $303 million year-over-year. Our second quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit-sharing also increased 3.4% versus 2011. On a fuel rate and profit-sharing neutral basis, second quarter consolidated unit costs increased 2.1% year-over-year.", "Non-operating expense for the quarter was $235 million, about $30 million lower than the second quarter of 2011. This decrease was a result of lower interest expense year-over-year as we continue to reduce our debt. In the second quarter, we paid down $258 million of debt and capital lease obligations, including $69 million of prepayments.", "Earlier this month, we also paid off 2 of our most costly pieces of debt on the balance sheet: The $172 million remaining on United's spare parts facility, which carried an interest rate of 12.75%; and the $79 million remaining on United's spare engine facility, with a coupon of LIBOR plus 1,130 basis points.", "These debt instruments were vestiges of a time when airlines needed to borrow money to maintain adequate liquidity. One of our primary objectives is strengthening our balance sheet by paying off costly debt and instead using the capital markets prudently to fund investments in our business.", "We ended the quarter with $8.2 billion in unrestricted liquidity, including an undrawn credit facility of $500 million. We have approximately $710 million of scheduled debt maturities and capital lease payments remaining this year.", "Gross capital expenditures were $500 million in the second quarter, and we continue to expect gross capital expenditures to be $2.35 billion for the full year or $1.25 billion net of expected financing. For the last 12 months ending in the second quarter, our return on invested capital was 10%, which exceeded our cost of capital for that period.", "We continue to emphasize the importance of generating profits in excess of our cost of capital, and that's part of the way that we do business. We use return on invested capital on route analysis, fleet strategy, balance sheet decisions and our compensation programs.", "We still expect our full year 2012 consolidated unit cost, excluding fuel, profit-sharing, third-party business expense, to increase 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year. We expect our third quarter 2012 consolidated unit cost, again excluding fuel, profit-sharing, third-party business expense, to be up 3% to 4% year-over-year. We have a downward bias for capacity in the third and fourth quarter. Any additional reduction in capacity would likely result in some modest pressure to our current CASM expectations.", "Essential to running a great airline, one that customers want to fly, employees want to work for, and investors want to invest in, is running a good operation. To that end, we are making investments in our business to improve our operations, which are reflected in our current cost guidance. We also see some cost pressure in other areas which are primarily a continuation of what we experienced in the first half of the year, such as salaries and related costs, which are up after achieving a number of ratified labor agreements this year.", "We estimate our third-party business expense to be approximately $70 million in the third quarter and $290 million for the full year. We have hedged 48% of our expected third quarter fuel consumption and 45% of our expected fuel consumption for the second half of 2012.", "Based on the forward curve, as of July 17, we expect our consolidated fuel price to be $3.13 per gallon for the third quarter and $3.22 per gallon for the full year.", "Earlier, Jeff discussed the importance of our new narrow-body fleet order, the 100 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft and 50 additional Boeing 737-900ER aircraft are the best aircraft for our network and enable us to replace older, less efficient aircraft over the next decade.", "We continue to improve our fleet, and in the second quarter, took delivery of 6 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft. By the end of 2012, we expect to take delivery of an additional 9 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft and 5 787 Dreamliners.", "During the second quarter, we removed 1 Boeing 737 Classic and 3 767-200s from scheduled service, bringing our year-to-date aircraft retirements to 10. In total, we expect to retire 28 mainline aircraft during 2012.", "Fundamental to our fleet strategy is preserving the flexibility to respond to economic conditions while balancing that with replacing older, less efficient aircraft with new-generation aircraft that have better operating economics. As we evaluate the need to replace aircraft, we do so with an eye toward maximizing return on invested capital over the life of the asset that we are investing in. In this case, up to 30 years, as well as capital market and manufacturer constraints.", "Importantly, we recognize the benefit capacity discipline brings, and we are not going to depart from the strategy. Between our mainline and regional fleet, we have about 1,250 aircraft today. Over our planning horizon of the next 5 years, we intend to keep our fleet count roughly flat. Some of the aircraft we have on order will replace smaller gauge aircraft and we will be installing more economical, slimline seats, both of which we anticipate will result in minimal ASM growth over this time period, around 1% annually.", "Our current expectation for 2013 consolidated capacity is flat to up 1% year-over-year. By preserving flexibility in our fleet, we can also appropriately respond should we need to decrease capacity as a result of macroeconomic conditions.", "I want to close by, again, thanking my colleagues and a team of more than 80,000 at United. We made progress this quarter toward becoming a stronger company. We want to consistently earn a profit in excess of our cost of capital, reduce our debt, and strengthen our balance sheet and take a long-term approach to the investments we make in the business. These investments will allow us to recognize our employees for the job that they do, deliver the type of product and service our customers want and create the type of sustainable value that our shareholders require of us.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, John. This quarter was a time of transition. And we had our fair share of customer service and operational issues. Nonetheless, we earned over $0.5 billion. We have much work yet to do. But United is on the right path, as we work together to build the world's leading airline.", "I'll now turn it over to Sarah to open the call for questions.", "Sarah Murphy", "Thank you, Jeff. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed, one follow-up question. Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg online.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I have 2 questions. I guess and I think actually both of them are for Jim. Jim, when I look at your investor update, and I look at the forward bookings and I look at where the loads are, they seem to be up pretty healthily on one hand, on the other hand you gave us your view for July PRASM. Is there a bit more stimulative type fare activity going on in sort of the August, mid-to-late August timeframe? What accounts for those differences?", "James E. Compton", "Mike, it's Jim. I think, yes, as you mentioned in our investor update, we talked about actually some pretty good bookings, strong demand as we look forward over the next 6 weeks and so forth. The pricing environment, although stable, I think we are seeing some fare sell activity, both in bringing close -- some competitive carriers bringing the AP in closer as well as fare that's putting some pressure on us. But from a demand perspective, we actually feel pretty good. And as a matter fact, we led an increase last week, $2, $3, $5 that had a match. The question on that is always due to sale fares under how much of that you realize given that the sell fare activity is out there. So I think we feel good about demand and managing the yield environment.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, very good. And then just my second question, this is just a data piece. Last year, with the FA shut down, what was the estimate of the benefit, the revenue benefit, that you got over this, I think it was like a 3, 4-week period?", "James E. Compton", "Yes, it was about -- it was a couple week period, I think July 23 to August 8. And we talked about, about a $60 million impact from that last year. And clearly most of that fall in the third quarter.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question for John. Just wondering if you could be any more forthright than your predecessor in terms of addressing whether or not you're accruing for higher labor costs?", "John Rainey", "Jamie, that's a tricky one. And I don't mean to be coy in any way. The way I have to answer that question is to the extent that it's we believe it's going to occur, we're accruing for our expectations. I think you've seen a number of different ratified agreements occur this year. Obviously, those were -- are reflected in our second quarter results. We clearly want to move in a direction where we will have joint collective bargaining agreements, and we have to make some assumption about when those will occur, as well as how much they are. And to the extent that, that's in our guidance then -- to the extent that's in the time horizon that we're guiding to, it's in there.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, excellent. And second, probably for Jim, but anybody can take it, as it relates to corporate contracts, my understanding is that most tend to run on a calendar year. They're typically more than a single year in duration. I'm just trying to assess whether some of the operational difficulties as of late, might have exposed you to any potential loss of corporate customers. Or is that more of a year-end type negotiation. I always tend to consider book a way, to be kind of a short-lived phenomenon, but I do have to wonder if it could prove longer-term, if it does impact the corporate negotiating aspect.", "James E. Compton", "Hey, Jamie, couple of thoughts on that. Corporate deals, I think your general kind of -- the contracts are a little bit different depending on the corporation or when they start up and other things like that. But I think that's a -- your summary's kind of a good general way to think about it. I'll point to the 16% growth of corporate revenue in the second quarter. We have had a challenging quarter. And from an operational perspective, and we don't see loss in share today. I would say that we've been improving our share as people see the value of the network that it brings to them, the great loyalty program and so forth. So my anticipation is that our investment in our operations and reliability that we are doing right now, many of the products that Jeff talked about in his comments that were -- as the operation improves and the power of the network which we can see at -- a market level in the second quarter that we don't anticipate any loss in corporate revenue going forward. And I will tell you this, our salesforce is out there with the corporations all day, every day, working hard. They bring in senior management as the issues come up to work with them. And we're working through that. But I don't see any loss in share today, and don't anticipate any.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "This is Jeff. Let me just add in as well. Look, we know what we did to get us into the operational issues we've had. And we know how to get back out of it. And we will. We've got a lot of focus and attention throughout the organization. And I believe that we'll restore our operational integrity in fairly short order. So we're very focused on it.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Trahan, we have Hunter Keay online.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "I just want to push a little bit on this execution issue that we've been seeing here, and Jeff or anybody, I'm wondering if you can just give us a specific benchmark now that we can look for from you guys to achieve, say maybe before the end of this year, or over the next 12 months. It doesn't necessarily -- you don't necessarily have to answer this question right now on the spot, but maybe at some point in the near future, whether that's PRASM outperformance well over the peers, a joint labor contract from a major workgroup, a target debt level, just something that we can maybe put a marker down and say, \"This is our goal, and this is a reason to be excited about owning the stock right here.\"", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Hunter, this is Jeff. No, I appreciate that. And I'll tell you operationally, it's very clear we have 80% on-time performance as our goal. We haven't made that lately. We're going to work hard to achieve that. We've stumbled a bit on some of our completion factors, as well as we brought down the spares on our United subsidiary, as we were funding some preventative maintenance and we over rotated on that, and we are going to -- and we're reversing that. We're going to add the spares back. That's -- it's more costly to us to do it, but the first thing about running an airline is you've got to run a really good airline, and we've got to restore that, we know how to do that. In terms of debt, I'll put that back to John. But we clearly have a focus on improving our balance sheet, we're overlevered, as this business generally is, and we need to reduce that and reducing debt is a gift that keeps on giving. And in terms of our joint collective bargainings, we're very focused on that. These things do indeed take time. We're in a lot of simultaneous negotiations. I can't talk about our pilot negotiations because of the NMB has asked us not to do that, and I want to honor their request. But as you can see from the individual deals that we've got, and we know how to do them, we know how to get them. Those the cost of those are already in our numbers, and we're very focused on moving forward and getting joint collective bargaining agreements because I think that's -- it's important for our coworkers, it's important for bringing our coworkers together, it's important for developing the culture of the combined airline.", "John Rainey", "Hunter, this is John. I'd just follow up Jeff's comments on the net debt capital structure. I'd certainly want to be a little more transparent, and that's my intention over the course of the balance of the year, is to help let you guys know how I'm thinking about this. But if you look at the progress we've made, just in the last 2 years, and I know there's a lot of people focused on net debt, we've reduced our net debt by $4 billion over that time period. And when you talk about the effect that has on the P&L, that's -- we've got $200 million of interest expense that's gone away over that period of time. And the way that I think about that, those are savings that go to the bottom line that are not dependent upon some load factor assumption or take rate, those are recession-proof savings that are there year-in and year-out. It's the gift that keeps on giving, as Jeff says. So it's clearly what we want to continue to do. If you could at our maturity profile over the next 4 or 5 years, we've got a significant amount, $3.5 billion to $4 billion of non-aircraft debt that we need to pay off. And so I think we can vastly improve the quality of our balance sheet over that period of time by generating cash flows to pay off that kind of debt, and get down to a more reasonable capital structure for our company. I don't necessarily have a target that I want to share with you in terms of debt-to-capital, but I think we all know directionally, that, that number needs to go down.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Yes. Okay. So just to follow-up, and I'll ask a true follow-up, I guess is, in that same vein, John, I mean, if you put out a debt target, or some sort of ideal capital structure ratio, I realize that things change. And I think most people can accept the fact that oil can go up or terrorism can happen or something bad can happen, but why should an equity investor feel comfortable -- your stock is trading at like 4x earnings, why should an equity investor feel comfortable sticking their neck out and saying, \"I'm going to invest in this over the long run. I think that multiple is going to go higher than 3x to 4x.\" If you guys aren't willing to stick your neck out and say, \"Three years from now, if everything kind of unfolds as we expect it to, our net debt level is $8 billion.\" Or something like that. Because I don't think the equity markets will reward you with multiple expansion until you feel comfortable putting that out there yourself. Would you disagree with that?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "No, it's a very fair point, Hunter. I mean, I certainly don't want to put out numbers that I think allow you to back into what we're projecting for our free cash flow and therefore P&L. But I think, being more transparent in letting you guys understand how we're thinking about this, and I think more important, perhaps, prioritizing, how we think about this. I think from an equity investor's perspective, when we talk about multiple expansion, one of the best things that we can do right now is delever and take a lot a lot of the risk out of the business and so, very clearly, in terms of prioritization, that's what we want to do first. Going forward, as our thoughts evolve, and as there becomes more certainty in this business and less volatility, we'll feel more comparable with providing more specific details.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have John Godyn online.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "First, just one for John, and then one for Jim. John, you had this comment in the release about earning a good return on invested capital versus your cost of capital, which is a great result. I know there's a lot of debate out there on how to calculate ROIC in airlines. Just want to get a better sense of how you do it and how conservative you are in it. Do you consider cash as working capital? And do you take into account the unfunded part of the pension?", "John Rainey", "Okay. A lot of questions there, John. Let me first say that we recognize there's a lot of questions in this area. And I think going forward, we're going to just actually put this calculation in our earnings release, and that will address a lot of the concerns. But I'll quickly try to hit on most of your questions there. We take on an invested capital perspective, we simply take the total assets and add back non-interest-bearing liabilities, and then we capitalize our operating leases. Importantly and it gets to your other question, by calculating it that way, that effectively assumes that our pensions are part of our debt, and we treat that just like any other interest-bearing liability that we need to earn a return on. Was there another question you asked that I missed?", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "No, that makes a lot of sense.", "John Rainey", "No, the cash. Yes, so in terms of cash, we think that the right way to think about that in this business is there is not an excess cash that we should not have to earn a return on. Said differently, we need to burden ourselves with earning a return on all of that cash.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And can I just ask a clarification on demand trends from Jim? You mentioned the economic environment remains tepid. But also that demand remains strong. Was the -- so far, throughout earnings, we've heard some airlines calling for continued strength, even in the face of ugly headline macro. But others actually acknowledging that they've seen macro weakness hit the bookings. Just to make it clear, where do you stand on that? And can you give us a sense to what extent July PRASM reflected macro weakness first, maybe one-time? Or it's like July 4th placement effects, any shrinks with tough comps, things like that?", "James E. Compton", "Yes, John. This is Jim. We're seeing demand being relatively stable. But when we talk about the economics -- the economy tepid, we are very much aware of, particularly Europe and so forth and keeping our eyes on that, which is why some of our capacity reductions in the fourth quarter have been a recognition of that already. So that -- the kind of that softness is in the economy is, is some of the things that we've seen. We're obviously watching to see where that turns. But we do see the leisure bookings over the next 6 weeks, which is really still the summer time period being quite strong based in our investor update with book load factor. As in terms of July, the Wednesday Fourth of July that you mentioned is an impact of July RASM year-over-year. We have -- when it's at Wednesday, there is significantly less business traffic that happens, and it's very much a leisure week more so then when that Fourth of July falls more towards the end or the beginning of the week. Also, I mentioned the FAA issues last year where ticket adds at the end, kind of last week of July. So year-over-year, that's a comp. And then lastly, although I will take this opportunity to wish the best to the U.S. Olympic team, which we partner with the United States Olympic Committee, the Olympics are a leisure week. And they're in London, they're a leisure couple weeks. And they are in London, and we obviously have a significant business presence in London, that also is putting pressure on our RASM year-over-year.", "Operator", "From Bank of America, we have Glenn Engel online.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "If I'm looking at your RASM relative to the industry, Latin America, you underperformed 7.5 points this year, after outperforming 2 last year. Domestically, you underperformed 5 points this year after outperforming at 1.5 point last year. Transatlantic, down 3 versus the industry versus flat last year. If you're not losing share, why are you underperforming the industry so much? And in Latin America, is there something about perhaps your mix like Mexico that's holding you back?", "James E. Compton", "Glenn, this is Jim. I think very strong comps last year, and particularly in Latin America beginning in kind of the second quarter period, May period...", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That was true for the industry, and they were up 18 7 so if dilution accounts for a 7-point gap?", "James E. Compton", "Yes. I think that -- I think if you went back last year, with our 20% growth was significantly better than some of our competitors in Latin America. So I think our comps are actually a little -- are stronger. The difficult comps are stronger for us this year in the Latin division. On some of the other carriers actually our length of haul RASM versus the industry on a system basis, kind of at a margin relative to first quarter. We continue to close that, relative to the industry. We actually see good progress. Again, the challenges that we talked about in the second quarter are there. But the network, we see benefits coming from the merger as in the individual hubs, and see them making progress on there. But some of that underperformance, quite frankly is the really strong comps last year.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And within regions, Atlantic, Latin America, is there any -- within region differences among countries and stuff like that from closure performance to be different?", "James E. Compton", "Yes. I think we're seeing a little bit more softness in London, relative to some other parts of Europe and so forth. Latin America, we had some very strong comps, particularly in Central America last year. And so that's where some kind of the waiting down and terms of that you kind of dig into those amenities.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And the other revenues that were so strong, are we going to see continued strength in the second half on that line?", "James E. Compton", "We're obviously we're very optimistic. We're seeing great take on our Economy Plus and the front cabin upsell. We're taking somewhat of a conservative approach of selling Economy Plus, so that as we work with the ops group and rollout that reconfiguration, as we mentioned we're at 86% done. So we actually, given the kind of the trends that we've seen and the acceptance and the value that the customers sees on that are very optimistic, both at Economy Plus and our upsell products.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm sorry, does that show up in passenger revenue or other revenue?", "James E. Compton", "That's in passenger revenue.", "Irene E. Foxhall", "That's in passenger.", "John Rainey", "Yes, Glen, this is John. I would just add to -- in the last call, I talked about the accounting effect of 2008, the IETF 2008-1. That creates a geography issue where some of the, what was formerly booked in passenger revenue is now in other revenue. And that's some of the effect that you're seeing. And you should expect a continuation of that as well. Not to takeaway though, from what Jim was saying that we are seeing, in all aspects of our ancillary revenue, a good uptick.", "Operator", "And our last question, from Barclays, we have David Fintzen on the line.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Appreciate that there's a lot on the plate in terms of integration, but I'm just curious now with Delta now moving to upgauge your regional. I'm just curious, as you look out over the next few years, do you need to rethink sort of the shape and scope of the regional operation? Or are you happy kind of with where it sits?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "David, this is Jeff. We're in negotiations with our pilots, and I don't want to talk about that, but we have said previously that part of those negotiations are having a competitive contract, and competitive contract includes competitive scope. It is the larger regional jets that's on a United subsidiary A, for example, are a very attractive product offering, offering both first class seats, Economy Plus and Economy, and it's important that we have a competitive scope provision, that's part of our negotiations, and that's all I can really talk to you about right now.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And when think competitive, I mean, just given your network and you're less connection oriented, your hubs are in bigger cities, you've -- is it -- what happened at American, that's a little more pressing on the competitive side? Or Delta? Or both?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Well, I view for the competitive landscape across all of our competitors, and when it comes to regional aircraft, that of course is more domestic issue than our global international competitors. But we have to look to Delta, we have to look to American, we have to look to everyone.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And just maybe if I sneak one in on the -- just on the Atlantic book load factor, and a month ago or so was down 2, now it's flat. You have the London commentary, Jim, which I appreciate, but you -- should we read anything into that? Or is that in sort of some of the fare activity in the sales that Jim, you were talking about earlier?", "James E. Compton", "Being flat now versus --", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Being flat versus 2, I mean, is that the margin? Should we read that as Atlantic out a little bit better x London? Or...?", "James E. Compton", "Flight or the adjusted capacity, even as we kind of moved to the summer slightly and so forth. But I think, I would say that the demand's relatively stable and it's kind of, us trying to better match the capacity with demand. There can be -- there's a little bit of fare pressure in some markets, it's a little bit of revenue management looking for opportunity to take some marginal traffic that otherwise, that I think's closed some of that load factor.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions] And from Wall Street journal, we have Susan Carey online.", "Susan Carey", "I have 2 questions. First of all, I wonder if you could run me through this issue of the United spares. You pulled it down to what, and you're bringing it back up to what?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "I'm sorry, Susan. You're very faint, and it's very hard to hear. Could you speak a little more loudly please?", "Susan Carey", "Okay, I'm wondering if you could give me a little bit more flavor on the issue of the United spares being taken down and being pulled back up. Like, how many or what was that all about?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "I'm sorry?", "Susan Carey", "Spares.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Oh, spares, I'm sorry, actually, I'll ask Pete McDonald, who's our Chief Operations Officer, to take you through the details.", "Peter D. McDonald", "Susan, so United, on the United side of the fleet, we traditionally had run with 15 spare aircraft across the various fleets in total. And as --", "Susan Carey", "Mainline?", "Peter D. McDonald", "Yes, mainline. And that's excluding regional. And as part of the tech ops harmonization, as you know, the Continental side had very, very good completion factor, and one of the best practices that Continental had used was this preventative process of the -- preventative service lines where you produce time in the schedule where aircraft will go in there on a preplanned basis and have work done, and that was a big contributor to the high completion factor. United adapted that, and we had to hire mechanics and inventory and so forth to support those lines. And to pay for that, we reduced the spare aircraft on the United side, expecting that we would see similar completion with that process. Unfortunately, the health of the United fleet wasn't ready yet for that kind of reduction in the spare complement. So we have -- we are and have done some of the replacement of those spares. We expect that to continue for some period of time. We don't want that to be the long-term strategy for our fleet, and expect over time to go back down to sort of the 9 level that we had anticipated for this year.", "Susan Carey", "And I'd like to ask one other question. This is sort out of left-field, if you excuse me. Now that Japan Airlines is out of bankruptcy and is in the midst of its turnaround, we're wondering if what its significance is to U.S. competitors and whether it's had any impact on United and its partnership or if the AA joint venture with JAL has had any impact on your operations to Japan?", "James E. Compton", "Susan, this is Jim. Yes, the -- obviously, it's a competitive business, and every competitor we watch and so forth. I will tell you, as we build the joint venture in the Pacific with ANA, a great partner, and our ability to kind of bring more fair product, consistent fair product, better connections in Tokyo using ANA, we actually feel really good with our position to be able to compete in that market with any carrier.", "Operator", "And our final question, from the Associated Press, we have Josh Freed online.", "Josh Freed", "Could you say a little more about the Slimline seats that you're putting in? Which aircraft, and what the timing is for that?", "John Rainey", "Sure. So we're going to -- this is John. We're going to begin installing them on our Airbus fleet. We're actually making a number of investments in the 319s and the 320s, including bigger overhead bins, better lighting, the Slimline seats and ultimately Wi-Fi and NC power. All of which will make that a much better aircraft for our passengers and a better customer convenience. That's where we are starting. I think we'll evaluate that as we look at our other fleets, I don't know that we've committed to anything at this point. But importantly, what that allows us to do, one is it's a much lighter seat, and so we get an appreciable amount of fuel savings and then of course, you're able to put more seats on the plane, which is better from a revenue perspective. But as we begin to get experience with that seat, and install that on the Airbus, we'll roll that out and will give you guys a lot more detail about that.", "Josh Freed", "How many more seats on the plane?", "John Rainey", "About 6? 6.", "Josh Freed", "All right. And is that related at all to the recall issue from a couple of years ago? Or is that a totally separate thing?", "John Rainey", "It's entirely separate.", "Irene E. Foxhall", "Okay, as we're out of time, we'll conclude. Thanks to all you on the call for joining us today. Please call Media Relations if you have any further questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Goodbye.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey; and Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasury, Gerry Laderman. Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which, Jim will review capacity and revenue results.", "John will follow with a discussion of our cost structure, balance sheet and guidance. Jeff will make a few closing remarks and then we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We would appreciate if each of you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll turn it over to Sarah Murphy.", "Sarah Murphy", "Thank you, Nene. This morning, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Both are available on our website at ir.united.com. Let me point out that information in this morning's earnings release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.", "All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings, United Airlines and Continental Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.", "Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, President and CEO of United.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, Nene and Sarah, and thank you all for joining us in our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Today, we reported net income of $520 million for the third quarter or $1.35 per diluted share, delivering a pre-tax margin of 5.3%. We achieved this result despite operational challenges and high jet fuel prices, and I want to thank my coworkers for working together to generate more than $0.5 billion of profit during one of the toughest quarters of our integration. I know it wasn't easy, but our recovery from a very tough summer exemplifies what makes United great: Our team working together to make our airline better for our customers.", "This quarter, we focused on improving our operational performance and investing in our fleet, our products and the tools our coworkers use to do their jobs. While we didn't do a good job with our operations during June and July, we took substantial steps during the quarter to improve our performance.", "On our second quarter earnings call, I told you that we were going to return to running a reliable airline by adjusting our airport staffing levels, returning to our historical standard for spare aircraft, increasing the number of maintenance hours and touch points for our aircraft and rolling out the first release of our new, faster and easier to use interface for SHARES, our passenger service system.", "We did all that and we are now running a reliable airline again. In September, our domestic on-time arrival rate was 82%, exceeding our goal of 80% and triggering an on-time bonus for our coworkers. Between July and September, our mishandled baggage rate declined by more than 30% and our mainline completion factor improved by 1.5 points to 99.4%. In addition to improving operational statistics, our customer satisfaction scores have increased significantly since our operational difficulties this summer.", "We made substantial progress with our integration during the third quarter and continue on the right path today. However, we recognize that some of our customers chose to fly other airlines during the summer when our operational performance degraded. Just like when your preferred road to work undergoes construction, you might choose to take a detour until the road gets repaired.", "Well, the road is repaired. And with our operations back on track, our unmatched global network and our industry-leading product offering, we expect to earn back those customers who took a detour and we expect to attract new customers as well. I am confident that we are building the world's leading airline, the airline customers want to fly, investors want to invest in and coworkers want to work for.", "One of our highlights this quarter was taking delivery of our first Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the first of 5 we expect to receive by the end of this year. We couldn't be more excited about the benefits this aircraft will bring to our customers and the airline. The Dreamliner offers fuel efficiency, noise reduction and a terrific onboard customer and coworker experience.", "We're in the process of completing our FAA proving grounds and certification work and are pleased with the Dreamliner's early operating performance. We will fly our first revenue flight on November 4 from our Houston hub to our Chicago hub. In December, we'll begin flying our first 787s internationally on temporary routes, and in January, we'll place the aircraft on their first permanent routes, Los Angeles to Narita, and Houston to Lagos.", "We continued investing in our onboard product this quarter. We recently completed installation of global satellite-based Wi-Fi on our first aircraft. We're undergoing final quality and acceptance testing and expect the aircraft will be up and flying with Wi-Fi in November. Our new Wi-fi won't be like the prior generation Wi-Fi that you find on our U.S. competitor's aircraft. Our Wi-Fi is modern, global and satellite based, and as a result, will offer speeds consistently faster than what's available in the market today. Because it is satellite based, our customers will be able to stay in touch virtually wherever they fly us around the globe, a key differentiator between us and our competitors.", "In addition to investing in Wi-Fi with better technology than that of our peers, we're taking a different commercial approach to Wi-Fi as well. We own the hardware, purchase the bandwidth and importantly, own and control the portal that customers use to access the Internet in-flight. Ownership and control will allow us to develop a comprehensive and dynamic pricing model for Wi-Fi and onboard streaming video, grant complimentary access to sites of our choosing and establish a wide array of commercial agreements, increasing the long-term opportunities for and value of onboard Wi-Fi to United.", "Since our mainline fleet is so large with about 700 aircraft, it will take us some time to install this industry-leading Wi-Fi product across our entire fleet, but we anticipate completing about 300 aircraft by the end of 2013.", "We continue to invest in products that our customers value and are willing to pay for, including Economy Plus seating and international premium cabin flatbed seats. United has a history of leadership when it comes to innovative seating products. As of today, we've installed Economy Plus seating on 90% of our mainline fleet and we expect to complete our Economy Plus installation in early 2013.", "We've installed more than 6,200 premium cabin flatbed seats on our international fleet. And by February of next year, every aircraft flying over the Atlantic will have flatbed seats in the premium cabin. Moreover, our entire long-haul international fleet worldwide will have flatbed seats next spring.", "We are committed to investing in our coworkers and providing them the tools to give good customer service. As I mentioned earlier, we've recently launched a new interface for our SHARES system with 2 powerful and intuitive apps for our coworkers to use, one for checking in customers and their bags and one for managing departures at the gate. We have a number of additional releases and development. And by next year, we expect to have a fully integrated user interface for our lobby and gate agents that is fast, intuitive, modern and easy to learn and use.", "This quarter, we reached an agreement in principle for a joint collective bargaining agreement with our pilots and are in the process of finalizing the tentative agreement. This will be our first joint collective bargaining agreement and we're eager to make similar progress with our other work groups. We are currently in expedited negotiations for joint collective bargaining agreements with the IAM, which represents our airport employees, reservation agents and stores employees, and with the Teamsters, who represent our maintenance technicians. We've also begun the joint collective bargaining process with the AFA, which represents our flight attendants. We want to bring our work groups together and pay our people competitively, while increasing our ability to respond to market conditions to ensure United can achieve long-term success, regardless of the economic environment.", "We are making these and other investments in our fleet, our technology, our products and our people to provide a better customer experience on United and a better workplace for our coworkers, as we focus on generating sustained and sufficient profitability. This quarter, we announced a target of earning a 10% return on invested capital over the business cycle. While there may be periods during the cycle where we won't hit our target, the entire management team is committed to achieving this goal, and we're embedding return on invested capital in all of our important business decisions.", "While our merger creates the platform for United to generate economic value over the business cycle, we recognize that our future lies beyond the merger. We have many projects in the works that will improve our customer service, add revenue, enhance efficiency, reduce costs and provide the returns our investors expect.", "During the third quarter, we made progress in building the foundation for our future. Although we are focused on achieving much more, we earned a respectable profit despite high fuel prices and complex integration challenges. We had a tough summer. But we're back on track operationally and are again providing the reliable service our customers expect of us and that we want to deliver.", "We have more work to do to secure United's leadership position and achieve our long-term financial goals, but I'm certain that my coworkers are up to the challenge.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Jim and John to go through the results in greater detail.", "James E. Compton", "Thanks, Jeff. I join Jeff in thanking our coworkers for their hard work during a challenging quarter and also want to thank our customers for choosing to fly United.", "We continued our commitment to capacity discipline in the third quarter as we reduce consolidated capacity 1.4% year-over-year. Maintaining capacity discipline is core to achieving our goal of generating sustained and sufficient profitability, especially in an environment of sluggish economic growth and elevated jet fuel prices. And we will continue to be very disciplined in our capacity deployment.", "United's third quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue decreased 1.3%, and mainline PRASM decreased 2% versus the same period in 2011. Consolidated yields were weaker year-over-year, down 1.2%.", "We recognize that while the industry as a whole faces largely the same global economic challenges, some of our recent relative year-over-year PRASM underperformance is related to issues unique to United because of our merger integration.", "Over the past 2 quarters, we converted major IT systems used by both our customers and our coworkers, and redeployed aircraft across our global network. These changes affected our customers, put a great deal of stress on our operation and our people, and our operational and financial performance suffered as a result.", "As Jeff outlined, we are back on track with our operational results and much improved customer satisfaction scores. We expect to continue to run a reliable airline while offering our customers the products and services they want and are willing to pay for. As for our revenue results, we are not satisfied with our relative year-over-year PRASM performance, and we are working hard to return to our industry leadership position.", "Third quarter domestic mainline PRASM decreased 4.2%, and yields decreased 2.6% versus last year. Domestic mainline capacity decreased 1.7% year-over-year. Regional PRASM increased 1.6% while regional capacity decreased 1.1% versus the third quarter of 2011.", "Third quarter international unit revenue was flat versus the same period in 2011, and yields decreased a modest 0.7% year-over-year. International capacity decreased 1.1% versus the third quarter of 2011.", "The Pacific was United's best-performing region in the third quarter, with unit revenue up 9.9% and yields up 7.2% versus the same period in 2011. Pacific capacity increased 1% year-over-year. China was the top-performing Pacific country with approximately 11% PRASM growth and 8% yield growth versus the third quarter of 2011.", "Japan continued to perform very well in the third quarter as PRASM and yield increased 6% and 5%, respectively, on capacity growth of 8% year-over-year. We are excited to start flying our Dreamliners across the Pacific beginning in the first quarter of next year, with Los Angeles to Narita and Los Angeles to Shanghai followed by Denver to Narita. Our trans-Pacific network is unmatched with more nonstop routes between the U.S. and Asia than any other carrier in the world.", "Third quarter trans-Atlantic PRASM decreased 4.5% and yields decreased 3.7% year-over-year. We reduced our trans-Atlantic capacity during the third quarter by 3.7% year-over-year. We've been affected by the economic challenges in Europe, and the majority of our previously announced fourth quarter capacity reduction is to our European service. One of the most important benefits of our merger is our ability to reduce capacity in weaker markets like the Atlantic and take advantage of stronger markets like the Pacific, as economic conditions change around the world.", "Latin America again faced very challenging year-over-year comparisons this quarter. Last year, Latin America PRASM and yields increased more than 20% versus the third quarter of 2010. This year, Latin America third quarter PRASM declined 8.3% and yield declined 9.4% with a capacity increase of 1.6% year-over-year. On a year-over-2-year basis, however, third quarter Latin America PRASM and yield are up approximately 11% and 10%, respectively.", "Third quarter cargo revenue declined 13% versus the same period last year. The cargo business continues to struggle because of increased industry cargo capacity and the impact of our aircraft redeployment, which changes the amount of cargo space available throughout our network.", "Our ancillary revenue increased 1% year-over-year this quarter. As we reduced capacity and in turn have fewer employments, our checked bag and change fee revenues decreased. Counterbalancing that effect is other ancillary revenue. Seat upsell revenue, which includes Economy Plus and paid premium cabin upgrades grew more than 25% year-over-year. Economy Plus sales increased 20% this quarter, in part due to having more Economy Plus seats available on our subsidiary, Continental, aircraft and in part from leveraging our ability to dynamically price Economy Plus using SHARES.", "Third quarter sales of paid premium upgrade, which is our product allowing customers to purchase access to the BusinessFirst or global first cabins, increased about 50% versus 2011. SHARES provides us a much more powerful platform to dynamically price Economy Plus, paid premium upgrade and other ancillary products. We know our customers value more space when they travel, and we're pleased to provide them with the seating options they want and are willing to pay for.", "Corporate revenue increased modestly this quarter. And I'd like to take a moment to thank our corporate customers for their loyalty. Although some customers flew other carriers during the height of our operational challenge this summer, the vast majority of our global corporate account clients chose to stay with United. They had confidence in us, and we work hard to improve our reliability and deliver for them. Now with our better reliability, our unmatched route network and improving product offering, we are confident that United is the best airline for the global business customer.", "In September, we expanded our aircraft redeployment effort across our domestic network, particularly at our hubs in Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, and are encouraged by the early results in a number of these markets. We are phasing in redeployment more gradually than we initially planned to ease some of the stress on our operation and now expect substantially to complete our redeployment effort in the first quarter of 2013.", "Redeploying aircraft not only helps us improve financial performance on individual routes by better matching the right aircraft to demand, it also allows us to initiate new service to a number of destinations that neither subsidiary served prior to the merger. Since the closing of the merger 2 years ago, we've added more than 70 new routes across the globe while reducing consolidated capacity.", "In part due to the slower than expected redeployment rollout, our revenue synergy realization has been slower than we initially targeted. Now that we restored our operational performance to expected levels, we're confident that revenue synergies will accelerate in 2013. And we remain confident that we will achieve the full $800 million to $900 million of run rate annual revenue synergies we identified at the beginning of our merger.", "Based on the latest GDP revisions and global economic conditions, we expect some softening of the economy during the remainder of 2012. And the strength of any recovery in 2013 remains unclear. As a result of this uncertainty, last month, we announced a reduction to our expected remaining 2012 consolidated capacity. We now expect fourth quarter 2012 consolidated capacity to decrease between 2.2% and 3.2%, and our full year consolidated capacity to decrease between 1% and 1.2% year-over-year.", "In September, we also announced a reduction to our 2013 capacity plan. We now expect our full year 2013 consolidated capacity to be down about 1%. Appropriately matching supply and demand is critical in achieving our long-term return target of 10% on our invested capital, and we are committed to maintaining capacity discipline to help us achieve our goal.", "Turning to our near-term revenue outlook. We currently estimate United's October consolidated PRASM will be roughly flat year-over-year. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John D. Rainey", "Thank you, Jim. Today, we reported net income of $520 million and a pre-tax margin of 5.3%. I want to thank the entire United team for their effort and contribution to our results this quarter. An integration of our size and complexity takes considerable time and creates a lot of change for our customers and for our coworkers. That said, we are starting to see many improvements from our merger: a new narrowbody aircraft order, service to new markets, industry-leading Wi-Fi and a new, modern user interface for our SHARES system.", "During the quarter, I announced United's long-term return on invested capital target of 10% over the business cycle. 10% is the right starting threshold for us, as it's above our cost of capital and is a return level we have not consistently achieved at any point in our history. Our goal to create economic value runs throughout the organization. And while it is a challenging goal, we are focused on achieving it by working together.", "Since closing our merger 2 years ago, our return on invested capital has been 10.2%. For the 12 months ended September 30, however, our return on invested capital was 9.3%. We are not satisfied with the recent compression of our financial performance and we are taking action to improve it.", "Moreover, the composition of our shareholders, the owners of our company, has changed over time. Many of our owners today have invested in our stock because they recognize the transformation taking place in this industry and the potential for value creation that exists uniquely at United. They expect us to earn our cost of capital and for us to manage the business accordingly. We are identifying opportunities to improve our cost structure by sourcing services from the best providers, operating more efficiently than we do today, investing in technology that gives our customers more control over their travel experience and resizing our footprint for the airline we are today and will be tomorrow.", "Third quarter total operating expense increased 0.9% or $79 million year-over-year. Fuel costs increased 1% this quarter and accounted for nearly half of the year-over-year increase in operating expense. Cost control and efficiency are essential to our long-term success, and our third quarter performance reflects our efforts in this area. We are becoming less reliant on manual processes and finding new ways to increase revenue and reduce cost through technology and doing it in a way that provides higher customer satisfaction while making the day-to-day work for employees more gratifying and productive.", "Third quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, increased 3% versus 2011 on 1.4% less capacity. On a fuel rate and profit-sharing neutral basis, third quarter consolidated unit cost increased 2.5% year-over-year. The impact of cost synergies can be seen in our CASM performance this quarter. Some examples include facility consolidation and harmonization of engine and component maintenance programs. While we have captured cost synergies faster than we originally expected, we do anticipate a number of headwinds, including the cost of joint collective bargaining agreements that will put some pressure on our unit cost next year.", "We effectively managed cost this quarter while making prudent investments in our business with an eye for improving our customers' experience. In addition to installing Economy Plus, flatbed seats and satellite Wi-Fi, we are adding larger overhead bins on our Airbus aircraft, improving the food, beverages and amenities in our international premium cabins and building a new United Club and adding jet bridges at Chicago O'Hare's Terminal 2. We will make the right long-term investments for our business that will deliver benefits to our customers, coworkers and the bottom line.", "We continue to make progress in strengthening our balance sheet in the third quarter, making $487 million of debt and capital lease payments, including $104 million of prepayments. This quarter, we paid off our 2 most expensive pieces of debt totaling $251 million with an average interest rate of over 12%.", "At the end of the third quarter, our net debt totaled $12.5 billion or $16.7 billion, including our pension liability. Our unencumbered asset base at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2.7 billion.", "In September, we issued a EETC with $844 million of proceeds. This transaction will finance 21 aircraft in total: 3 787 Dreamliners and 18 737-900ERs, which will be delivered between this November and July of next year. The A tranche of this EETC priced at a 4% fixed coupon and the B tranche priced at 5.5%, resulting in a blended coupon of 4.16%, the lowest rate in history for an issuance of this kind.", "While we are focused on reducing our net debt balance, financing aircraft through capital markets remains a prudent and cost effective use of debt. We ended the third quarter with $7.2 billion in unrestricted liquidity, including an undrawn credit facility of $500 million. In the 2 years since closing the merger, we have strengthened our balance sheet considerably, making $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease payments, maintaining a strong liquidity position, including the addition of a revolving credit facility and increasing our unencumbered asset base by $1.7 billion.", "We still have a significant amount of debt maturities and capital lease obligations over the next few years. And while we would like to pay off all the instruments as they come due without refinancing, we will make the right decisions for the business based upon the economic environment at that time.", "Gross capital expenditures were $412 million in the third quarter, and net capital expenditures were $222 million. We are reducing our fourth quarter capital spending from previous expectations and now project full year gross capital expenditures to be $2.25 billion or $1.15 billion net of expected financing.", "During the third quarter, we took delivery of 3 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft and the first of our 787 Dreamliners. We removed 3 Boeing 737 Classics and 1 Boeing 757 from service during the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect to take delivery of 4 more Dreamliners and 6 Boeing 737-900ERs. We expect to end the year with 3 fewer mainline aircraft than we started with the total of 698 aircraft.", "We expect our full year 2012 consolidated unit cost, excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, to increase 2.7% to 2.9% year-over-year. Notably, we have modestly lowered our full year cost guidance, even while twice reducing our expected 2012 consolidated capacity. We expect our fourth quarter 2012 consolidated unit cost, again excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, to be up 3.5% to 4.5% year-over-year. Our third-party business expense was approximately $55 million in the third quarter and is projected to be $250 million for the full year.", "In closing, we made over $0.5 billion of profit in the third quarter with good cost control and a stronger balance sheet, yet our performance fell short of our expectations. We've laid much of the -- we've laid much of the foundation for our future to recognize that we still have a significant amount of work ahead to realize our potential. United has the very best assets in the business, the best network for customers, a strong pipeline of new products and services, efficient aircraft and professional employees dedicated to our customers, from which we will build the world's leading airline that creates economic value over the business cycle.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, John. Our merger has resulted in a lot of change for our customers and our coworkers, and I know that the road has been a tough one. However, we are laying the foundation for the world's leading airline. Many of the investments we've been talking about will become visible to our customers and our coworkers in 2013, and we are very excited about delivering the airline our customers want to fly, our investors want to invest in and our coworkers want to work for.", "I'll now turn it over to Sarah to open up the call for questions.", "Sarah Murphy", "Thank you, Jeff. First, we'll take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Brendan, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A question for Jeff or, I don't know, maybe Mike Bonds, if he's there. It does appear that you're making substantial progress on a pilot contract. Most of the language coming out of the pilots suggest that terms are largely in line with the new Delta deal. But what's unique about the Delta contract is that there are some Delta-specific offsets to what otherwise appears to be an expensive contract, a decline in 50 seaters, subleasing the 717s, more large RJs and so forth. So I'm not asking you to comment on where your wage rates ultimately settle out. I can make my own assumptions. But can you give us some color as to potential United offsets that might benefit you? I mean, you're not looking for 717s. You already have a lot of RJs. What can you pick up to potentially offset a several hundred million dollar dyssynergy?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Hey, Jamie, this is Jeff. Listen, we're subject to a gag order from the NMB, so I can't comment on it. I think that the terms of the contract will be, in their entirety, will be coming out relatively soon. I will tell you, though, that we believe this is a very competitive contract for us.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Well, competitive in what sense? I mean, the NMB doesn't gag you, Jeff, with all due respect, from throwing out a wish list of items that you would like to have.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "No, I'm not -- Jamie, I'm just not going to go there. We're not -- I'm not -- there's no reason for us to get on the wrong side of NMB right now, and we're not going to do that.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, so it comes down to trust us. All right, I'll try to live with that.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg online.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "John, I want to go back to the CapEx number. You talked about that number coming down. What was that number previously? And I do see in the fourth quarter, it does look like that -- some of the net purchase deposits, it looks like they're either being refunded. Is that -- what's that tied to? Have you pushed back some aircraft deliveries? Can you just -- can you run through that?", "John D. Rainey", "You're right. And we did have a swing in purchase deposits in the third quarter. We had almost $200 million there. That's just tied to the timing of aircraft deliveries. In total, I would say that we recognize in advance that this year was a bit of a bow wave with respect to capital spending for us. You'll see some of that bleed into next year. But we certainly want to get back to a more normalized level of capital spending over time.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, good. And then just my second question. I did see that it looks like in the fourth schedule, you're adding some service to some -- it looks like additional service to Heathrow, at least I think it's incremental out of Dulles and Houston, or maybe it's reallocating some other flights. If it is incremental, are those -- are the slots for that -- are those slots -- have you purchased those slots like you have in the past? Or are those slots being leased, if it is incremental?", "James E. Compton", "Mike, in terms of -- in Heathrow, it would -- what -- I guess I'm trying to zero in on what period you're thinking about or are looking at.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I think it's in the spring, where you're adding another flight from Houston to Heathrow and another flight from Dulles to Heathrow.", "James E. Compton", "Yes, so the -- what we have in there incrementally is a third trip on Houston to Heathrow at that time period as we put 3 767s into the market.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Is that an incremental slot? I guess -- because in the past, you purchased slots, and slots typically come...", "James E. Compton", "Yes, it's an incremental slot that we've been able to hold on to.", "Operator", "From Dahlman Rose, we have Helane Becker online.", "Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of points of clarification with respect to -- I think you said on the pilot that you were in negotiations or finalizing language. Do you have a timetable of when that's done?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Helane, this is Jeff. Yes, we're finishing up the wording on the tentative agreement, and we anticipate that the tentative agreement to be out quite soon.", "Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on average fare for the mainline. It's kind of like flattish year-on-year. I mean, are you seeing evidence that you can push that higher looking out to fourth quarter and next year?", "James E. Compton", "Hey, Helane, this is Jim. Obviously, we can't comment on future pricing. Although last week, we did increase domestic fares $2, $3, $5 one way that, ultimately, at the end of the week, the industry matched. So we're always looking at the demand capacity and how that's -- and then pricing relative to kind of that demand capacity level in terms of where it sits.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Trahan, we have Hunter Keay online.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "A couple of questions for John, I believe. John, I appreciate the commentary about your shareholder base. I think that's right in terms of the people sort of waiting around for this transformation. So as your ROIC has started to lag little bit your target, why not give some thought to giving them some money to stick around? And by that, I mean, I understand the value of deleveraging the balance sheet. But if you look at just from an academic perspective, the fact that your cost of debt is about 1/3 of your earnings yield and you have a lot of cash in your balance sheet to play with, why not think about maybe initiating a buyback with, say, 100 -- I mean, $1 billion or so? Because of the simple math that exists between rewarding equity holders and the accretion that should basically impact your EPS from the earnings yield versus the cost of debt, which is now, again, at this point, about 3x higher. Or is it more just let's get the balance sheet in order first before even thinking about returning cash to equity holders?", "John D. Rainey", "Well, Hunter, I think that, first of all, it is something that we think about. We need to get to a point in this business where we are directly returning cash to shareholders. I don't think we're there yet. If you look at the progress that we've made over the last 3 to 4 years, reducing our net debt balance, it's decreased by almost $4 billion. But as pure financial theory would suggest, our equity values probably should've gone up as well and they haven't, haven't for us and they haven't for the industry. And so that suggests that there's still some instability, at least the market believes that, in our capital structure today. So I think, in terms of prioritization, we need to continue to improve our balance sheet. We need to get rid of a lot of the debt that is the chain around our neck, that it's non-aircraft debt. And we've got a significant opportunity at United. We've got about $3.5 billion of debt maturities over the next few years that have nothing to do with financing aircraft. I think as we begin to improve and strengthen our balance sheet, and then I think you should see earnings multiples improve in this business. We  would have hoped we would have already seen it because we think we made significant progress. But once we take care of those things, I then think that you can have a more serious discussion about a share buyback or beginning to distribute a dividend.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Okay. All right. And on fuel, without advocating for a policy, you look at US Airways and they're going to pay the cheapest for jet fuel per gallon, again, for anybody. I think that's like 4 over the last 8 quarters. At what point do you think that stops becoming a fluke? And at what point do you think that, that is a legitimate trend that has a merit, that's something worth considering? I mean, is there going to be a saying like, \"Okay, we need to look at -- we need to make sure this happens for 3 years, or we need to make sure this happens for 10 years.\" I mean, at what point does it stop becoming a fluke, if it continues to happen?", "John D. Rainey", "Well, first of all, let me say I agree with the underlying premise of your question. It would be great if we could get to a point, as an industry, where we could better pass along our cost inputs, particularly fuel being the single largest expense that we have. We're unlike some of the other industries that people are quick to compare us to in terms of rail and freight, in terms of how far out we sell tickets. And we're exposed to that fuel price volatility. I think hedging is one of those things where it's -- there's perfect visibility in hindsight. We had over $500 million of hedge gains last year. I think, if you're comparing to U.S. Airways, a couple of things I'd point out. One is that there are geographic differences with respect to where we buy fuel. We have 50% of our capacity that's international. We buy a lot of fuel on New York Harbor and on the LA, which is much more expensive than Gulf Coast jets. So on just a pure unhedged basis, we're always going to have a bit of a premium to them, but we would think that we would also get a revenue premium by serving those markets. But in terms of what we're doing from a hedging perspective, we are thoughtful about this, and we recognize that, historically, we spent a couple of hundred million dollars a year in hedge premiums. And given what's happened to fuel more recently, we try to achieve the same amount of risk management but by spending less premium, and that's why you've seen our hedge policy or our actual instruments change a little bit over the last few years. But I think it's important for us to continue to protect against some of the short-term volatility. So absent the ability to pass along our fuel surcharge in the very immediate term, we're going to continue to hedge.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have John Godyn online.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jim, as we look forward, I think one of the things that's sort of unique about United is how easy your comp is in December. Is the right framework to be thinking about the world and sort of holding macro constant and so on and so forth? Is the right framework here that as we lap that comp, there's going to be sort of a natural mathematical significant reacceleration in PRASM? Or are there some sort of noneconomic puts and takes that I should be thinking about in December?", "James E. Compton", "Hey, John, this is Jim. You're right. As we -- if you went back to the -- our first quarter earnings call, we talked about some of the issues that we faced in the first quarter and also in December, for instance, as we integrated 2 revenue management systems and we talked about some yield degradation in the month of December. So that, to your point, is clearly out there on a year-over-year basis. I would tell you that those systems have matured now, now that one source of data versus 2 systems beating the demand forecast and so forth. So that has matured and that is operating at a much higher level than what we were talking about in the first quarter. In terms of getting down to other specifically outperform -- I'm reluctant to talk about that. We recognize that we're not satisfied with our revenue performance in the third quarter, that we had dyssynergies. And quite frankly, we know that we're working really hard to get those synergies back. And so there's the timing. We're obviously very confident that we will, but that timing -- so it just makes it hard for me to comment on saying a specific timeline we would begin to outperform. But clearly, the things that you talked -- that you mentioned and I just talked about happened in December and the first quarter.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's really helpful. And John, if I could ask a question about cash flow in 2013. In 2012, you had a number of sort of onetime items that were cash hits that kind of depressed the cash flow profile integration, some of this stuff recently announced with labor. As you look into 2013, it seems like some of these should roll off very naturally and create a pretty big tailwind for cash flow. Outside of the PBGC issue, am I on the right track? Or are there things in 2013 I should be on a lookout for?", "John D. Rainey", "I think you're absolutely on the right track. If you look at our initial guidance with respect to the onetime integration expenses, we've realized a lot of those already, and I think you would expect to see those wind down appreciably next year. That said, we still have to achieve some labor agreements and there are a few other blips out there. You mentioned the PBGC. No, but that's noncash. So I think in a directional sense year-over-year, definitely, you would see a stronger cash flow next year as it relates to some of the onetime items.", "Operator", "From Barclays, we have David Fintzen online.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I have a question for Jim. And I know there's obviously a lot of noise in the data in terms of your on-time performance and some of the systems integration. But I'm curious, as you're starting to put in some of these aircraft -- some of the moving aircraft around is sort of hitting the results, just curious, how do you think about the sort of spool of those benefits? I mean, is there -- is it pretty front-end loaded when you make these network changes? Or is there a time lag we should be thinking about to sort of get some history into the revenue management systems and really optimize the outcomes?", "James E. Compton", "I think the -- it depends on the case that we're talking about. Clearly, if you redeploy and you're putting capacity that's greater than what was in that market before, there's a little bit of a new market spool-up that is applied to that. So there is a timing issue to that. And it's different by every market, David. So it would be hard to kind of talk about it at that one point. On the other hand, obviously, we redeploy aircraft where the demand is not as great and we get the smaller aircraft on that route and the returns are immediate. So it's a little bit mix of both. I think, as I mentioned in my comments, we started to do a nice step-up in redeployment in the month of September. And at the same time, ran an 80% on time with the great work by the operations team in reliability. And so as we kind of -- although we've slowed down that pace of redeployment, as we continue to finish that up in the first quarter of 2013, we do expect those benefits would accelerate in 2013 under redeployment as we've now got the reliability back on track.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the redeployment side, if memory serves, it was -- it started more domestically oriented and that was going to shift more international into next year, is what I recall. I'm just curious, I would presume some of the international would be slowed down as well.", "James E. Compton", "Yes, that's somewhat although we've been doing both, quite frankly. Houston-Lima is a very early redeployment aircraft. New York to Buenos Aires -- we moved aircraft out of Dulles. And so -- but you're right. And then also, there's been a lot of domestic redeployments with the 737-900s and next-gen airplanes moving to the West Coast and getting on some longer haul markets. So it's a little bit mixed bag of both, but there will be more of both as we kind of accelerate in 2013.", "Operator", "From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie online.", "Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "On the corporate travel book away that resulted from the operational difficulty, how much of that impact PRASM exactly in the third quarter? Or if you don't have that, how much are we really talking about? And I was getting pulled away from the call, so I apologize if you already gave that to us.", "James E. Compton", "We haven't put a dollar figure on that. Clearly, internally, we know where we expect to be from a revenue performance point of view. And so really, quite frankly, right now, is our sales force throughout the process and currently is working with our corporate partners, our business travelers to, one, talk about the value of the network in light of the new reliability and so forth. So there's a lot of moving pieces as we move to December. So it would be hard to put a specific number on exactly what that is. But clearly, it was a negative number for us in the third quarter.", "Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And material, I guess, maybe that's the point. The fact that you're talking about it is...", "James E. Compton", "Yes.", "Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Suggests that it's a pretty big number, at least, right?", "James E. Compton", "It was a significant number.", "Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay, fair enough. So I know you're not ready to comment a whole lot on 2013 capacity, but I am seeing seats for the first quarter down significantly more, down -- have been down the 1% that you folks are guiding to for the year. And I'm just wondering, since the data is public, I'm wondering if you can help us understand how first quarter capacity ties to the full year outlook and also just a little bit about the thought process behind that.", "James E. Compton", "Hey, Dan, as we've guided, the full year 2013, we're guiding toward 1% decline in capacity. As we move through the fourth quarter and into December, we'll give a lot more firmer guidance on that first quarter capacity. But at this point, we're guiding towards 1% decline and that's kind of where we're at for the full year and 2013 right now.", "Operator", "We have time for one last question and it comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore Partners.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Question on the operational improvement since July. How do you measure the underlying trend adjusted for changes in utilization? It seems like we've been in a less demanding utilization period here in September, October. So how do we think about the underlying trend as you prepare for a seasonally stronger period late this quarter?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Duane, this is Jeff. No, that's fair. I mean, it's -- it also depends on lots of sort of random events, as well as weather. But we're very focused on making sure that we can maintain our operational reliability during periods of more stress, holiday periods, certainly going into next summer as well. We continue to take actions to make sure that we are prepared for that and that we're prepared to continue to deliver on reliability.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up with respect to systems. I assume no airline is ever truly done with systems upgrades, but in terms of high-profile IT integration projects, what is left to be done? And can you give us a sense of timing?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Sure. We have a very big project that will come up in terms of integrating our aircraft maintenance systems. We're going to do that over -- on a fleet-by-fleet basis over a considerable period of time. It's a monumental project, and it's a multiyear project. We also have to integrate our HR systems as well and we have other systems that, as you said, they just continue on and on. So we'll continue to have it. None of those systems, however, has the high profile of our passenger service system, our SHARES system, which powers not only everything that the customer does, but our website and our loyalty program as well, which is a massive system, nor does any of those require the level of retraining that the SHARES system did. So my judgment, we're over the really tough hurdle of IT, but there's a considerable amount of IT. And I will tell you that putting the 2 maintenance systems together is going to take a considerable period of time, and it is a monumental task. But that can be staged on a fleet-by-fleet basis over a considerable period of time, that's a multiyear project.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Carey from Wall Street Journal.", "Susan Carey", "I'm not sure who might want to answer this question. Just wondering if you guys can walk me through the $454 million special item relating to the pilots' tentative. I'm just trying to understand what that is. Is that just like a date of signing lump sum payments? Because you're mentioning $250 million in late this year or in early '13 as a starter. So I'm just trying to understand what exactly this is.", "John D. Rainey", "Susan, this is John Rainey. As Jeff mentioned, we have a gag order imposed on us by the NMB, so I can't speak with a lot of specificity to this. What I can tell you is that it's, I would say, common in agreements like this to have an upfront payment. Some of that is contingent upon certain hurdles that will be achieved after the contract is signed. And we would expect the cash flows actually come towards year end and into next year.", "Susan Carey", "Depending on hurdles achieved by the company or by the pilots?", "John D. Rainey", "By the pilots, just in terms of getting the contract done and integrating.", "Susan Carey", "Okay. And can I just ask then, are we going to be seeing accruals for other unions in subsequent quarters?", "John D. Rainey", "To the extent that we think we're going to have a labor agreement, that will be -- and there's a cost, upfront cost to that, that will be built into our forward-looking guidance. But I will say, Susan, that this is a significant step forward for us. The pilots are a very visible group and they're a very important part of our airline. This is a group that's gone some period of time without getting a pay increase, and I think paying our labor groups competitively is important to our philosophy as a company. And we're actually pretty excited about the significant step forward.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Josh Freed from the Associated Press.", "Josh Freed", "Can you say anything more about what your plans are for getting back travelers after the hiccups this summer? I mean, do you have sort of specific, targeted, I don't know, promotional-type things that you're planning to do? Or is it more sort of cross your fingers and hope that they're expected back by the things that you're obviously hoping to make  here [ph] and attract? Or do you have something that's really specific that you can call out, that you're hoping will sort of get you back on the good side?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Josh, I'll let Jim join in a minute. But I will tell you, no, it's not cross your fingers. We're being very active. We're making -- all of our sales people are deployed and making sure that our customers understand that our reliability is back. We're making sure they understand the product investments were making because we've been talking about product investments, but these product investments take time to put on all these aircraft and a lot of our customers will see that for the first time in 2013. And they'll notice significant improvements in our product offerings. We're doing all we can to get our customers back. We're having -- we've got dinners around the system with our global services customers. I mean, we're being very active to make sure our customers understand that United is back. We're back on track. We continue to invest, and we're the airline for them to fly. And I'll ask Jim to add anything he'd like to add.", "James E. Compton", "Josh, the only thing I would add to Jeff is that, one, obviously, we don't -- it's not about hope, as Jeff mentioned, it's about what we -- the network is actually the one sustainable differentiator we have versus our competitors because it is the best network. And so as Jeff mentioned, it's about communicating to our customers, both our high-level customers, our corporate customers, all those things are going on right now. But at the bottom of it is it's back to talking about the great value that this network brings to our customers, and that's the differentiator for us. That's sustainable. It can't be replicated and that's why we're very excited about where we're headed.", "Josh Freed", "Okay. I mean, did you end up having to offer any concessions on corporate pricing as a result of the trouble over the summer?", "James E. Compton", "We won't -- we don't comment on pricing, but the conversation's about the great value of the network.", "Operator", "We do have time for one more question from The Street, we have Ted Reed online.", "Ted Reed", "So I just want to clarify, the PRASM declines in every region are because massive numbers of passengers booked away to another airline because of the reliability, and now the reliability is back.", "James E. Compton", "Ted, this is Jim. That was one component of our RASM decline. There's yield pressures. There's competitive pressures. There's pricing pressure from competitors, all the standard things that are out there that can drive -- there's economic slowdown. There's high comps from last year. But clearly, what we want to do is focus on that piece of it that we consider revenue dyssynergy and work our way back. But there's a number of pieces that drive into what our performance would be year-over-year.", "Ted Reed", "Can I ask this? Do you think that the migration of passengers was so great that it benefited other carriers' RASM noticeably?", "James E. Compton", "I mean, I don't -- Ted, it would be hard for me to -- obviously, I don't see the other carriers' data and so forth. So what we're focused on is getting back to our leadership position in terms of RASM performance, and that's what we're really focused on right now.", "Irene E. Foxhall", "Okay, we're out of time. So we'll conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call Media Relations if you have any further questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Please go ahead.", "Nene Foxhall", "Thank you Brandon. Good morning everyone, and welcome to United's fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings conference call. Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chairman, President, and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey. Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which Jim will review operational performance, capacity, and revenue results. John will follow with a discussion of our cost structure, balance sheet, and guidance. Jeff will make a few closing remarks, and then we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We would appreciate if you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll turn it over to Sarah Murphy.", "Sarah Murphy", "Thank you Nene. This morning, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Both are available on our website at ir.united.com.

These items are detailed in our earnings release, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, Chairman, President, and CEO of United.", "Jeff Smisek", "Thanks Nene and Sarah, and thank you all for joining us on our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 earnings call. Today, we reported net income of $589 million for the full year or $1.59 per diluted share delivering a pre-tax margin of 1.6%. 2012 was the toughest year of our merger integration, and it wasn\u2019t an easy year for our co-workers or our customers. Despite our integration pains, we accomplished an enormous amount and we are now in a position to go forward as a single carrier and compete effectively on a global scale. Our operations are running smoothly where many product improvements are rolling out and our customer satisfaction scores are climbing. I want to thank all of my co-workers for working together during 2012 to help build the base for United\u2019s future. I\u2019m pleased to recognize my co-workers\u2019 hard work with a $119 million of profit sharing which we will distribute to eligible co-workers on February 14.", "I also want to thank our customers for choosing to fly United. We\u2019re working hard every day to make your travel experience a great one, and you\u2019ll see continued improvement in our product and service as 2013 unfolds. In 2013, we will move beyond our merger; we will continue to deliver on our go-forward plan, the annual operating plan we use to guide our efforts and investments company wide.", "Our top priorities this year include running a consistently reliable airline, providing great customer service, bringing the rest of our work groups together, continuing to invest in our people, our technology, and our product offering, and running United as a business to achieve our return on invested capital target of 10% over the business cycle.", "We did not achieve our return on invested capital target in 2012, and we\u2019re absolutely not satisfied with the financial results we produced last year. We need to generate better unit revenue and operate more efficiently, and we\u2019re taking actions to address both of those areas. Leadership starts at the top, and in December we reduce the number of our officers by 7%. Today, we internally announced the difficult but necessary decision to reduce our management and administrative staff by 6% starting next month. We have many other actions planned to increase efficiency and increase our revenues throughout 2013 and beyond.", "I want to thank my co-workers for their professional response and empathy towards customers and fellow co-workers in the aftermath of super storm Sandy, which reduced our fourth quarter earnings by approximately $85 million. Our operations substantially improved in the fourth quarter triggering two on-time bonus payouts for our co-workers. I would like to thank my frontline co-workers for doing a great job managing high loads during the holidays, made more challenging by snow storms that hit a number of our hubs.", "We\u2019re back on track running a reliable operation, and we\u2019ll continue to support our operations through higher than normal staffing at airports, spare aircraft levels, and maintenance programs over the next few quarters to ensure that our operation performs as we and our customers expect it to.", "Customers are noticing our improved operational reliability, and as I mentioned earlier, our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve as does feedback from our corporate customers. We\u2019re keenly focused on improving our customer service, and we\u2019ve begun a comprehensive customer service training program for our airport agents, contact center agents, and flight attendants worldwide. By the end of January, all airport contact centers, in-flight supervisors, and peer leaders will have completed training on how to lead their teams to provide great service. As we finish training the leadership, we will train all of our airport and contact center agents and flight attendants across the globe on our new customer service standards, and we\u2019ll complete all of this training this year.", "United is committed to providing great customer service each and every day, and it is the responsibility of every co-worker to do so. At our internal leadership conference next week, we will roll out, It\u2019s Our Job,\u201d a company-wide integrated approach to customer service. It's Our Job includes training that clearly explains our customer service standards and expectations for frontline co-workers.", "The program also includes an expanded outperform recognition program that rewards more employees for outstanding service and a broad based quarterly bonus program tied to improvements in customer satisfaction scores. This year, we will collect more detailed customer satisfaction data and begin customer service quality reviews across the system improving the quality and quantity of service delivery data that will help us identify areas of opportunity and future training needs.", "Importantly, our co-workers want to provide great customer service; they take pride in it and we in-turn take pride in their efforts. This year, we\u2019re making sure they will have the tools that help them do their jobs. Throughout the year, we\u2019ll be rolling out a modernized fully integrated suite of tools for our airport agents that expands on recent enhancements and allows our agents to provide better and more efficient service to our customers.", "We\u2019ll first implement these new tools at the gates to assist with the departure management process and improve the boarding experience for our customers. Later in the year, we\u2019ll expand these tools to include ticketing and check-in functions in the lobby.", "We\u2019re also investing in our customer relationship management technology to better understand our customers\u2019 individual preferences when they travel. The more we understand our customer\u2019s preferences, the better we\u2019ll be able to design and offer tailored products and services that meet or exceed their expectations and improve our profitability. Last year, we made substantial progress bringing our work groups together, an important step in building our working together culture. In December, our pilots ratified our first joint collective bargaining agreement, a four-year contract that marks to market the pay of our pilots while increasing their productivity and our scope flexibility.", "Additionally our subsidiary United, subsidiary Continental, and Continental Micronesia flight attendants, and Continental Micronesia technicians ratified a new collective bargaining agreement during 2012. Toward the end of last year, our negotiations for joint collective bargaining agreement with our airport and contact center agents represented by the IAM gained significant traction and continued on a good path early on the New Year.", "We\u2019re in expedited discussions for joint collective bargaining agreement with our technicians represented by the Teamsters, and we\u2019re also in discussions for joint collective bargaining agreements with our flight attendants and our dispatchers. We understand the importance of marking to market, the wages and benefits of our people, and we\u2019re committed to reaching competitive joint contracts with all of our work groups.", "In addition to seeing improved customer service this year, our customers will begin to experience the many product improvements we\u2019ve discussed since our merger. By the end of the first quarter, 96% of our mainline fleet will have our very popular economy plus seating. Additionally, we have installed over 6800 flatbed seats in the premium cabins of our international aircraft, more than any of our U.S. competitors. In February, we will finish modifying our domestic Boeing 767 aircraft to an international configuration with fully flatbed seats in the business first cabin, seat back audio/video on demand, and power outlets throughout the aircraft.", "Customers today are using the new larger overhead bins on 70 of our airbus aircraft, and we\u2019ll finish installing those bigger bins across the rest of that fleet this year. We\u2019re installing global satellite based Wi-Fi across our mainline fleet with a modest number of aircraft outfitted to date, including our first Boeing 747.", "We\u2019re ramping up installation and expect to install global satellite based Wi-Fi on 300 of our mainline aircraft by yearend, and we will continue installation next year until substantially all of our mainline aircraft have this industry-leading Wi-Fi product.", "We took delivery of 25 new aircraft last year including six Boeing 787 Dreamliners. History teaches us that all new aircraft types have issues, and the 787 is no different. We continue to have confidence in the aircraft and in Boeing\u2019s ability to fix the issues just as they have done on every other new aircraft model they have produced. Safety is of course our top priority, and we\u2019re working closely with the FAA and Boeing to safely return our 787 aircraft to service. In 2013, we expect to take delivery of 26 new fuel efficient and customer pleasing aircraft including two more Dreamliners in the second half of the year. At the end of last year, we opened our first completely redesigned and expanded United Club at Terminal 2 of O' Hare International Airport, and we\u2019re receiving outstanding feedback from our customers on the look, feel, and usability of the club.", "If you\u2019re passing through O\u2019Hare, I encourage you to drop by the club for a glimpse of the future. This year, we will renovate four additional United Clubs around the network with this superb new look and feel. As with our operations, our service standards, and our people, we will continue to make substantial return-oriented investments in our product and customer experience this year. I\u2019m confident that our focus on operational reliability, customer service, product improvements, and our working together culture will put United on the right track for creating economic value in 2013 and beyond as we become the world\u2019s leading airline. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim and John to go through the results in greater detail.", "Jim Compton", "Thanks Jeff. I would like to take a moment to thank my co-workers for their hard work in 2012. Our operational performance and revenue results last year did not meet our expectations or our potential, but we built the foundation for United from which we\u2019ll provide consistent reliability, a competitive product offering, and a great customer service in 2013. I would also like to thank our customers for choosing to fly United. We appreciate your business and our working together to make United the best airline for you.", "Our operational performance improved in the fourth quarter, and we delivered 80% on-time performance for the quarter despite severe weather including super-storm Sandy and snow storms. In 2012, we paid out six on-time bonuses totaling $26 million to our co-workers for achieving monthly on-time goals including two pay-outs during the fourth quarter.", "Our fourth quarter mishandled bag ratio improved nearly 10% from the summer lows. It takes team work, reliable fleet, and the right processes and procedures to run a consistently reliable airline, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in those areas this year. Running a reliable airline is highly correlated with customer satisfaction scores and passenger revenue results. As we improved our reliability at the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter, our customer satisfaction scores improved nicely, and we have recently seen encouraging progress with passenger revenue. I look forward to more closely integrating the way we manage both operations and revenue in my new role.", "Our full year consolidated capacity declined 1.5% year-over-year in 2012 demonstrating our continued commitment to capacity discipline. In the fourth quarter, consolidated capacity was 4.2% lower versus 2011. Our approach to capacity deployment remains the same, met supply with demand on a market by market basis. Through this approach, we\u2019re confident we can optimize our broad network and generate returns in excess of our cost of capital.", "As we experienced merger-related operational issues last year, we took actions to support our integration and our operations that did not optimize our network or revenue and that added to our cost. Examples include higher staffing levels at airports, carrying a higher level of spare aircraft, and modestly increasing our block and ground time. During 2013, as we streamline our boarding process, deliver on our new easy-to-use and more intuitive technology for our co-workers at airports, and consistently deliver reliable operations we\u2019ll begin to unwind these actions.", "Now turning to our revenue results, consolidated passenger unit revenue increased 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 1.7% for the full-year versus 2011. These results include $140 million of loss revenue due to super storm Sandy. The Pacific was our best performing geographic region in the fourth quarter and for the full year. As PRASM increased 5.9% and 5.8% respectively. Both higher yields and loads contributed to the solid performance. China continued to be a highlight in the fourth quarter with PRASM increasing 9% and yield increasing 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.", "Our ancillary revenue increased 2% and 3% respectively for the fourth quarter and full-year 2012 compared to 2011. Our fourth quarter capacity reduction resulted in fewer [employments] (ph) and in turn lower checked bag and change fee revenue. During the fourth quarter, we implemented a second bag fee for travel between the U.S. and Japan and are the only U.S. carrier to apply this important cost recovery mechanism across our entire transpacific network.", "We have heard from our customers how much they value more space to work and relax when they travel, and we\u2019re pleased to offer the seating products that they value and will pay for. Economy Plus continued its outstanding performance with 33% sales growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 25% growth for the full-year 2012. Sales of paid premium upgrades increased 58% in the fourth quarter and 34% for the full year versus 2011.", "A significant portion of the increase in economy plus and paid premium upgrade sales is due to pricing optimization permitted by our powerful SHARES platform. While our corporate revenue for the full year increased modestly due to higher yields, we\u2019re dissatisfied with the 2012 results. The operational challenges we faced last summer impacted our corporate customers, and our corporate revenue and share premium performance lagged our expectations.", "Put simply, some of our corporate customers took a detour while the road was under construction, and we suffered for it. We\u2019re confident, however, that in 2013, we will win back those corporate customers and attract new corporate customers with our significantly improved operational reliability, our improving customer service, our competitive product, and our industry-leading network.", "We aspire to be the travel partner of choice for our corporate customers. A partner that helps them reach their goals. We also know how important it is to listen to our customers, and we have an ongoing dialogue with many of the travel managers at our top accounts throughout through our corporate advisory board. Through frequent conversations with our corporate advisory board members, we keep our finger on the pulse of our customers\u2019 expectations, experiences, and aspirations for United. From our most recent conversations, we know our corporate customers are experiencing firsthand the improvements in our reliability, customer service, and product offering.", "Route network and schedule convenience may be the most important factors when many business customers choose an airline , but we recognize the importance of running an on-time airline and offering great service with a competitive product as well.", "United\u2019s best in class global route network is ideal for business travelers through our international gateways in New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.

Beginning this quarter, our customers are going to experience many of the product investments we have been talking about for some time. United offers travelers the best options on board from more room to work and relax. Today, we have a 176 wide-body aircraft outfitted with our comfortable, lie-flat flat seats in the premium cabins. In February, every wide-body aircraft flying across the Atlantic will have lie-flat seats in the premium cabins. Our entire long-haul wide-body international fleet will have lie-flat seats by the end of the second quarter.", "Our industry leading Economy Plus seating is available on nearly our entire mainline fleet and on almost all of our larger regional aircraft. As just mentioned we\u2019re installing global satellite based Wi-Fi across our entire mainline fleet and early customer feedback is very positive.

They are the face of United to our customers and bore the brunt of the integration challenges last year. And I want to thank them for their work. We\u2019re all glad to have the heavy lifting of a merger integration behind us. For the fourth quarter and full year 2012 our consolidated operating expenses increased 1.1% and 3.2% respectively. Full year 2012 CASM excluding fuel, third party business expense and profit sharing, increased 3.4% year-over-year on 1.5% lower capacity. On a fuel rate and profit sharing neutral basis full year unit cost increased 2.5% versus 2011.", "Fourth quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel, third party business expense and profit sharing increased 6.5% versus 2011 on 4.2% lower capacity. Holding fuel rate and profit sharing constant our fourth quarter consolidated unit cost increased 4.8% year-over-year. In 2012 we continue to make progress improving our balance sheet making $1.5 billion of debt in capital lease payments including $265 million of prepayments. We ended the year with $6.5 billion of unrestricted cash.", "One of the real opportunities we have to provide value to our shareholders is to reduce the level and type of debt in our business and the cost associated with that debt. We\u2019re paying down high coupon, non-aircraft debt and reducing our reliance on debt financing to run the day to day operation instead accessing the capital markets to fund long term investments in our business. We continue to make progress in this area in 2012 paying off about $340 million of non-aircraft debt with an average coupon of over 11%.", "Our full year 2012 interest expense was $122 million lower than it was in 2011. At the end of the year we reached an agreement to amend the terms of two series of notes held by the PBGC, that the old United issued in its bankruptcy. The first series were 8% unsecured notes that the company was obligated to issue over time as certain EBITDA thresholds were met.", "The maximum amount which could have been issued was $500 million with $188 million already incurred. The second series with a 6% unsecured notes also held by the PBGC due in 2031. A recent agreement reduced the principal amount of the 8% notes to $400 million in return for issuing them now and removing the contingency and shortened the maturity of the 6% notes.", "For the last three years our return on invested capital has been 10.7% above our 10% target. However for the full year 2012 our return on invested capital of 8% was below our target. We\u2019re committed to achieving our return on invested capital goal and we\u2019ve taken a number of steps to ensure we do so in 2013. First and foremost we have addressed the operational issues we faced last summer. Given our improved operations and increasing customer satisfaction scores we expect our revenue performance to improve this year. We also need to become more efficient. We\u2019ve a number of initiatives planned for 2013 that will increase our efficiency and mitigate some of the cost pressures we face. As Jeff mentioned we recently reduced our officer headcount by 7% and are reducing our management and administrative overhead by 6% to a mix of voluntary and involuntary reductions.", "As Jim explained we took a number of steps to address the operational issues we faced last summer and some of these actions resulted in higher cost as we consistently demonstrate our ability to run a good operation we will increase our efficiency and we will remove the cost associated with these actions. ", "We did a good job in 2012 in achieving cost and other revenue synergies but clearly underperformed from a passenger revenue synergy perspective. We\u2019re confident though that we will achieve the full merger synergies and look to get back on track on our passenger revenue synergies in 2013. ", "Turning to 2013 unit cost, we expect full year CASM excluding fuel, third party business expense and profit sharing to increase between 4.5% and 5.5% year-over-year on lower capacity.", "This is higher than our CASM performance in past years and higher than what we expect on a normal run-rate basis. Approximately 2.5 points of the year-over-year CASM increase for 2013 is due to labor agreements. A significant portion of our co-workers had not received a pay increase for a number of years and we\u2019re committed to paying our employees competitive market wages. The wage pressure in 2013 is effectively a mark to market adjustment that is larger than the ongoing normal year-over-year labor cost pressure we expect to incur in future years.", "An additional 1/3rd of point of year-over-year CASM pressure is due to increased pension expense which is largely a result of a lower expected discount rate. We have a $2.4 billion unfunded pension obligation and while this is a long term obligation that needs to be managed just like debt the accounting cost of that obligation can change significantly from one year to the next.", "The remaining approximately 2% year-over-year increase in CASM is what we consider core CASM growth and is much more in line what we would expect in our normal year and include some improvements in efficiency. Despite our higher CASM growth in 2013 we remain committed to achieving a return on invested capital goal of 10%.", "Because of the timing of some of the cost pressures I mentioned our year-over-year CASM increase in 2013 is not evenly distributed among the quarters and is skewed heavily toward the first part of the year.", "We expect first quarter CASM excluding fuel, third party business expense and profit sharing to increase 8% to 9% versus the first quarter 2012. We\u2019re projecting a consolidated capacity decline of between 4.1% and 5.1% in the first quarter which also puts additional pressure on our first quarter CASM.", "We expect CASM growth to moderate significantly in the second half of the year with an increase between 2% and 3% year-over-year. We took delivery of 25 aircrafts in 2012 including six Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 19 Boeing 737 900ERs and removed 23 aircraft from service in the year including 19 737 Classics, 3 767 200s and one Boeing 757.", "We also sold or returned to lessors 37 aircraft that had been parked in the desert. In 2013, we expect to take delivery of two more Dreamliners and 24 Boeing 737 900ERs which will replace older less efficient aircraft in our mainline fleet. We expect to end the year with 10 fewer mainline aircraft than we started the year with a total of 692 aircraft.", "Our 2013 scheduled debt and capital lease principal payments amount to $1.9 billion, $600 million of these obligations are the secured notes that carry interest rates of 9.875% on the first lien and 12% on the second lien. These instruments mature in the back half of 2013 but allow for prepayment without penalty next month which we intend to do.", "We expect 2013 gross capital expenditures including purchase deposits of $2.5 billion or $1.4 billion net of expected financing. ", "Earnings instability and liquidity issues prior to our merger resulted in chronic underinvestment in our business. To provide the product we need to achieve our earnings and return on invested capital targets we played catch up with capital investment for the last two years. Of the 1.4 billion in net CapEx in 2013 approximately 40% to 50% is for items that are more one time in nature that we don\u2019t expect to incur on a consistent basis. For example we\u2019re building a new data center and two new maintenance hangers and installing new overhead bins, slim line seats, winglets and Wi-Fi.", "We have the need and the intent to get to a more balanced approach to cash flow allocation as we complete the integration and harvest the benefits of our merger.", "Lastly as we move beyond the peak of our integration we expect integration related cash special charges to abate significantly in 2013 to approximately $250 million. In closing, 2012 was the toughest year of our integration but it's behind us. That said our disappointment about reporting almost 600 million of profit for the year is a clear sign of the increasing health and stability of our industry and of United specifically.", "It shows the progress we\u2019re making towards becoming a real business that provides consistent returns for our shareholders. As I talk with many of our customers and co-workers they are encouraged by the significant progress we\u2019ve made since the depths of our integration issues last summer. They like many of our investors recognize the potential that United has in 2013 and beyond. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeff Smisek", "Thanks John. We\u2019ve a lot of momentum now and in 2013 we\u2019re going to run a reliable airline and provide great customer service. We\u2019ll deliver on our go-forward plan and use our ever improving fleet, facilities, technology, product, network and customer service to become the airline customers want to fly, investors want to invest in and co-workers want to work for.

First we\u2019ll take questions from the analyst community, then we\u2019ll take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Brandon, please provide the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank", "", "Two questions here and maybe the first one is for Jeff. You have the pilot deal, you have that all set up but now you have to go through the seniority integration process, what\u2019s the timing on that and at what point if an agreement is not reached between the two groups would we go to binding arbitration, if you can just update us on that.", "Jeff Smisek", "Well we expect, Michael, we expect the seniority list integration to be accomplished this year and we currently see no issues in them reaching their agreement at a timely basis.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank", "Okay good, and then just my second question and this is for you Jeff as well. You know 2012 indicated was a tough year, you did about 600 million of net and I look at a company like Delta who has roughly the same size as you on a revenue basis and they were 1.6 billion of net, when you talked earlier about the momentum you felt like that things were really starting to turn. Is that a gap that you think that you can close this year or is it more like a multi-year process to catch up with them. How quickly can things improve now that you\u2019ve gotten over the big hump?", "Jim Compton", "I think as you mentioned obviously a tough year and the biggest, I think I talked about in this way I think the biggest disappointment from my perspective was the revenue, the synergies we faced last year and you know I think expectations I think you can think of one to two points in RASM that we under performed and you know and so my confidence is as John mentioned at close is that given the stability of the operations because I really believe predictability is important, when you\u2019re predictable things just operate so much better across the system and revenue flows with that. So you know we\u2019re excited about 2013 given the initiatives that we have in place and you know we feel that we will certainly close that gap and but we\u2019ll work our way through the year but we\u2019re very optimistic.", "John Rainey ", "", "Mark I would just add to that, this is John. 2013 is clearly a year where we\u2019re focused on execution and proving our operational reliability. We think though that with the route network that we have and efficient fleet, the employees that we have, the results will take care of themselves if we do the blocking and tackling.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Trahan, we have Hunter Keay", "Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan", "Congratulations on the second bag fee of Japan I think that\u2019s great news, Jim but I noticed correct me if I\u2019m wrong I don\u2019t think ANA has a second bag fee to the United States so it's two part question, did you coordinate with them you know with regard how the JVs has functioned and if they don\u2019t have a second bag fee for the US, are you just going to collect the second bag fee revenue and just give half to them as they don\u2019t have to necessarily deal with the bad publicity associated with the second bag fee.", "Jim Compton", "Hunter I won't get into specifics of how that work. I will tell you that obviously we work very closely with ANA, they are a terrific partner and you know the JV has mechanisms to work through all kinds of different things that come up and that\u2019s what we will do working with them but again we\u2019re seeing the JV quite frankly is delivering terrific results as we\u2019re seeing connections over Narita using ANA and also both of us are partnering with each other in the Trans-Pacific.", "Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan", "And as it pertains to the January PRASM number if you look at the bookings that were up 400 basis points weighted average coming into the month and that was capacity down maybe 400 \u2013 500 basis points. I\u2019m curious to know why the yields came in where they did in January, and is the strategy right now to just to sort of fill the flights and sort of focus on yields as the operational improvement gets better. So you\u2019re just focusing more of load factors in that regard or I guess the real ultimate question is how do yields start to go up again because that\u2019s probably going to have to provide the next leg of PRASM.", "Jim Compton", "That\u2019s a great question, from my perspective the way I look at it is somewhat as you described, right, I think our challenges last year from the management\u2019s perspective is that we actually manage less flights that we underperformed in load factor and so as that load factor comes in what happens is we begin to manage more flights and [revenue manage analyst] [ph] begin to manage the buckets and so forth. So not talking too much about yield going forward but again as our corporate customers recognize what we\u2019re doing from a reliability point of view as those, as the demand continues to grow we will manage the inventory to optimize that revenue.", "Operator", "From UBS we have Kevin Crissey online. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS", "", "So is there - can you talk about maybe if not the exact percentages but the progression of capacity, because 2.5% I think is lower than where people would have thought given the capacity cuts for the quarter so maybe there is something unique about January capacity relative to the rest of the quarter if you can talk about that.", "Jim Compton", "So I think the way to think about the quarter for us that 4.1% to 5.1% down in the first quarter is February even adjusting for leap year will be the most significant capacity cut month followed by not as much but March. So January is the least capacity year-over-year reduction of the quarter.", "Kevin Crissey - UBS", "And then just looking at the numbers you guys overall, I mean so I would hope that then you would have a pick up from here because if you look at I don\u2019t think your comparisons are more difficult than say U.S. airways or Delta but you\u2019re, there seems to be quite a bit of continued under improvement unless you have a significant pick-up from in February and March given where their guidance is for RASM, is that fair?", "Jim Compton", "I think again the when I talk about January, one data point for us is January is a little bit more difficult comp for us on a, if we went on a two year over two year just kind of put a framework reference in December we\u2019re 8% up over 2 years that 2.5% represents a beat of that 8% on the two year basis. So any given month I guess it's hard, things can fluctuate and change. I think the investor updates were very feel good about the demand, the booking curve that we see going forward.", "", "Kevin Crissey - UBS", "And I guess similar to Mike\u2019s question I guess, the way I\u2019m thinking is laborers gotten their pay increase. I know they didn\u2019t had in a while but you bought them a car, the pilots a car and then effectively with the amount of back pay and then you\u2019re buying them a car each year in terms of forward pay. The customers are getting a better product hopefully they will get a better operation as we move forward and yet the financial returns aren\u2019t improved, they have diminished. So what I\u2019m trying to understand is whether this is a function of the challenges uniquely to your integration or if you rethink the timing of the synergies overall and whether they are more back loaded the benefits of the mergers in general, thanks.", "John Rainey", "I think speaking to synergy achievement, we targeted about to achieve 75% of the 1 billion to 1.2 billion last year and we did a good job in terms of other revenue and cost synergies. Those two combined amounted to about $650 million but as I said in my remarks earlier we clearly underperformed from a passenger revenue perspective. We have every bit of confidence that we will achieve the full run-rate of the 1 to 1.2 and we\u2019re actually are optimistic about that. In terms of the timing, getting back to Mike\u2019s question. We love to get that in 2013 but it's also reasonable to assume that that could be a difficult bar and it could slip into 2014.", "Operator", "JP Morgan we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Baker - JPMorgan", "Jeff you and I sparred a little bit on the last conference call on the subject to pilot costs and to your credit the deal did come shortly thereafter so looking back I respect your decision to remain tight lipped, but you can\u2019t blame me for trying the same approach as it relates to mechanics and flight attendants. So, if we set aside wages, are there any competitor work rules incorporated into the contracts that are already out there that could afford you some greater flexibility or should we simply view this exercise as one of increased expense?", "Jeff Smisek", "Jamie, we\u2019re trying to make sure that in return for marking the market with wages and the benefits of our co-workers, in return we get good productivity from them and flexibility because this is an industry that requires flexibility and you know we\u2019re making -- very good progress with the IAAM. We\u2019re also making good progress with our teamsters and I hope to be able to announce some new deals as we go forward in time this year.", "Jamie Baker \u2013 JPMorgan", "Excellent and for my follow-up obviously unit margins lagging those of the industry you know I\u2019d argue and I sense you to agree that the only thing standing between you and margin parity is execution as opposed to being anything structurally wrong with the franchise but as we think about closing the margin gap what are the key drivers, what is the waterfall chart look like. Does fleet optimization drive a quarter of the gap and improve customer service another quarter, sending the management rank a few points do you have to buy an oil refinery, I mean what gets you from where you are today to where you know Delta already is.", "John Rainey", "I think you know clearly we got to make up a big part of that gap in terms of our revenue performance and some of that will come through corporate shares, some of it will be harvesting the benefits of the mergers through redeployment of aircraft in that nature but we also have a significant opportunity in terms of becoming more efficient., We have attacked some of our operational problems with, call it a blunt instrument and we have thrown head count at it and I think that we can be a lot more efficient. We can better deploy technology, put it in the hands of the customer and I think overtime we can actually see significant savings in other areas on the expense side.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley we have John Godyn online. Please go ahead.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Just a follow-up on some of the questions on closing the margin gap, as you know one of your competitors is very focused on announcing a plan for returning capital to shareholders this year. Once you do close the margin gap it's moving in that direction the next step?", "John Rainey", "Clearly, we have the aspiration of getting there, I would remind you that Delta is two years ahead of us in their integration and you know that the way that we have framed this internally is I would prioritize as we want to get the operation running like it needs to be and then we want to continue to pay down a lot of the non-aircraft debt, we got a significant amount of non-aircraft debt that\u2019s coming due in the next few years and then I think we can have a very healthy discussion about returning cash to shareholders. Now I would say I don\u2019t think all those have to happen in a serial fashion but clearly in terms of how I prioritize those that\u2019s what it would be.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Jim just a follow-up on some of the PRASM questions which I guess suggest that maybe Jan was a little bit weak, I know you can\u2019t give numbers for all the sort of comps issues but is it fair to say that it sounds like the completion factor that you\u2019re looking at for Jan and shift in Chinese New Year or maybe bringing Jan a little lower than maybe people would have expected and as we look into February certainly again the shift in Chinese New Year the easy comps perhaps depending on how the completion factor fairs and maybe some accounting adjustments are actually going to just naturally create a very big bump to PRASM, is that a fair way kind of framework for thinking about it?", "Jim Compton", "It is understood John. First of all the completion factor is exceeding our expectations, the operations has been stellar this month from a completion and so we\u2019re generating the ASMs from a completion factor point of view. The second point is on the Chinese New Year\u2019s a little bit is a good point also, a little perspective is January last year we cancelled 25 round trips because of the New Year and TransPac to support what become very much not a business travel period. That is shifted to February and so is a specific capacity you know is running kind of a more normal time with the Chinese New Year been in there. So both of those things affect exactly what you\u2019re talking about.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Okay thanks and I couldn\u2019t help to notice that the advance book factor for the pacific was up meaningfully. Is it fair to say that you\u2019re seeing evidence of some of those easier reacceleration that we might be seeing in other date and other companies we track?", "Jim Compton", "In terms of leisure in general John?", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "I just mean in terms of traffic levels and demand.", "Jim Compton", "I think what we\u2019re seeing is kind of ongoing, we\u2019re seeing the ongoing kind of general economic environment that we saw in 2012 and seeing still good demand really in all the booking windows going out.", "Operator", "From Barclays, we have David Fintzen on the line. Please go ahead.", "David Fintzen \u2013 Barclays", "You know you mentioned I think as Jim mentioned sort of corporate customers around a bit of detour, I\u2019m curious obviously there is a lot you can do to improve the operation, but if (inaudible) find someone else, how do you make sure they know what you\u2019re doing and the piece of that is if you\u2019re hitting sort of your on-time performance targets, is it really your target that matter or do you think you have to make sure that you are towards to the top of the industry, so you can maybe show a customer who has gone somewhere else that your competitive in terms of the operation. I\u2019m curious how you think about that both in terms of the outreach and in terms of the absolute performance and the relative performance on the on-time side.", "Jeff Smisek", "It's a combination of things, it's not just the on-time performance and you need to be reliable and different levels of reliability above 80% have diminishing returns, but it's really also -- it\u2019s many different factors, it's also very important as the customer service and which is why we\u2019re focusing so heavily on customer service this year as you know I mean you all fly. A good customer service can take even delayed flight or a flight where there is an issue on-board the aircraft, a broken piece of IFE (ph) or something.", "And good service can turn that into a really good flight, you can also have a perfectly on-time flight on a brand new airplane everything works and if you\u2019re not getting good service it's going to be a crappy flight. So you know we\u2019re also focusing very, very heavily on customer service both at the airport, on contact center agents with flight attendants and I think that\u2019s and I think you can see that in our improving customer satisfaction scores and I believe those scores will continue to improve. We have enormous amount of folks on it including we\u2019re going to have a broad-based quarterly bonus program for all of our co-workers based on improvements in customer satisfaction scores.", "So we\u2019re going to focus heavily on that and as people fly as the word does get out and we\u2019re significantly better today for sure than we\u2019re in the summer and I believe this time next year we\u2019ll be significantly better than we\u2019re today and with that I would take it over to Jim.", "Jim Compton", "I think as we mentioned kind of in the comments that the last duty integration put a lot of stress on our employees and our customers. I\u2019ll tell you that in that group of employees that a lot of stress was on with our sales force. And our sales force literally was always out there with our corporate partners and travel managers. The difference is the conversation was a little bit different than what we had hoped for. The conversation was about some of the integration issues and so forth.", "What\u2019s happened with the on-time performance in the fourth quarter, the improvements we\u2019re seeing now they have really -- the sales force has always been very present with our corporate travel partners and now what they are doing is again talking about the network, the value of the network that it brings to them, what it can do for them in their travel needs. So I guess the point is how did the awareness that things are back. I think the awareness is driven by the fact that they have the sales force is out there communicating, I mentioned a couple of forms we do with advisory boards but really every day they are calling on their customers and letting them know where we\u2019re are at and how we can help them in their travel needs.", "David Fintzen - Barclays", "I appreciate that and maybe just a quick one now that the pilot contracts done and you have the scope really on the RJs, and is that something that we should look for reasonably large changes in \u201814 or is that a smaller component trying to get a sense of what your opportunities does that some of these higher labor cost down the road with similar to what Deltas did.", "Jim Compton", "The new contract as it relates to regional does present us with a tremendous amount of flexibility to be competitive in the 70 seat market. Really, the first phase of this year quite frankly is with the new agreement is being able to redeploy the current 70 seaters that we have across the system to optimize the network, some of the things we talked about in terms of synergies for the first year. But as you\u2019re moving to 2014, then we will be able to kind of take that second phase, but this year will be about using the aircrafts that we have and redeploying, but that contract does create tremendous amount of flexibility for us to be competitive in that space.", "Operator", "We\u2019ve time for one last question from Evercore Partners, we have Duane Pfennigwerth online. Please go ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners", "Just wondering when you think you will be able to expand margins year-to-year with this first quarter CASM guidance, do you think revenue can be good enough to start that process this quarter?", "Jim Compton", "I don\u2019t want to comment on revenue Duane, I think you know as I alluded to earlier in response to Mike. We\u2019re extremely focused on execution we have a plan, we\u2019re following that plan I think that if we execute on that and we do the things that we\u2019re capable of and you combine that with the product that we\u2019re providing, the network that we have, I think that you will begin to see margin expansion clearly. We wanted as badly as our investors, our employee\u2019s want it and I think that 2013 as I said is an important year for us as we\u2019re beginning to put all these different items in place to enable us to achieve that.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners", "And then just I will ask one follow-up just in terms of your difference between your first quarter CASM guidance and your full year what are the things that sort of drive that moderation other than just more ASMs?", "Jim Compton", "You\u2019re right, ASM is a significant piece of that but probably two thirds of the cost guidance in the first quarter or the cost increase is related to labor and that\u2019s simply the anniversary effect of lapping some of the labor agreements of last year, results were put in the place during the year. So labor is a piece of that, the only other thing that I would call out as significant as we have got a higher than normal volume of engine events in our V2500 engines in the first and second quarter. So I would expect maintenance expense related those items will be up $30 million to $40 million each quarter, but that tells often back half of the year we actually see some improvements.", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Josh Freed from the Associated Press. Please go ahead.", "Josh Freed - Associated Press", "Has either Boeing or the FFA given you any guidance at all on when you can expect to get your 787s flying again?", "Jim Compton", "No.", "Josh Freed - Associated Press", "Okay and are you, what are you hearing from your pilots on the subject of the 787, Are they seeking any additional safeguards it might be in addition to whatever the FAA comes up with, is there any push back from them at all on 787?", "Jim Compton", "Look, Josh, safety is obviously very important than and I\u2019m confident that when the regulatory authorities and Boeing working together determine the cause of the battery issues and the [fixed] board that we will implement whatever that fix is under the (inaudible) permit us to fly the aircraft safely again.", "So there is no distinction between us and our pilots with respect to safety.", "Josh Freed - Associated Press", "Very, very quickly, can you put any numbers on the head count reduction? I know you gave in terms of percentage can you say any numbers on the number of people you expect to end up cutting?", "Jim Compton", "Sure it's over 600.", "Operator", "From Wall Street Journal, we have Doug Cameron online. Please go ahead.", "Doug Cameron - Wall Street Journal", "Just going up on Josh\u2019s question, Jeff and you won't be surprised, but as often no one is going to buy the 787 from (inaudible) 100% safety\u2026.", "Jim Compton", "Doug, we\u2019re having a hard time hearing you from this end.", "Doug Cameron - Wall Street Journal", "I mean this is for Jeff and Jim, obviously the industry is not going to fly the 787 until the industry, (inaudible) 100% confident in safety \u2013so, but how do you and other operators start going about convincing the traveling public if that\u2019s the case?", "Jeff Smisek", "Once the NTSP, GTSP together and FA work together to [determine causality] and Boeing fixes it or done because look the aircraft is a terrific aircraft and customers love the airplane and I have no doubt that customers will flock back to that airplane as soon as we get it back up again.", "But this is a problem that Boeing and the regulatory authorities need to deal with, they should deal with it, we support them, we will give them every bit of assistance that we possibly can because we too want to get the airplane up and flying safely and I\u2019m confident that will occur. I don\u2019t know when that will occur but we will learn more with time.", "Doug Cameron - Wall Street Journal", "What gives you that confidence though?", "Jeff Smisek", "Well in terms that they will find a fix, I mean in history.", "Doug Cameron - Wall Street Journal", "No, the confidence that customers will flock back.", "Jeff Smisek", "Look it's a terrific airplane, I mean ask anybody who has flown that airplane it\u2019s spectacular and once this particular issue is solved it's solved and it's just a matter of whatever time it takes to solve it.", "Sarah Murphy", "With that we\u2019re out of time. We\u2019ll conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call Investor Relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.", "I'll now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Nene Foxhall and Sarah Murphy. Please go ahead.", "Irene E. Foxhall", "Thank you, Larissa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chairman, President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey; and Senior Vice President and Treasurer, Gerry Laderman.", "Jeff will begin with some overview comments. After which, Jim will review operational performance, capacity and revenue results. John will follow with a discussion of our cost and capital structure and guidance. Jeff will make a few closing remarks, and then we will open the call for questions, first, from analysts, and then from the media.

Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, Chairman, President and CEO of United.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, Nene and Sarah, and thank you, all, for joining us on our first quarter 2013 earnings call Today, we report a loss of $325 million for the first quarter or $0.98 per share. Although we're unhappy reporting a loss, we're encouraged by the progress we're making. Our operational performance, customer satisfaction scores and unit revenue results all significantly improved this quarter, thanks in large part to the efforts of my co-workers.", "Our top priorities for 2013 remain the same: operate a consistently reliable airline, provide great customer service and run United to achieve our return on invested capital target of at least 10%. United's operational reliability is back on track. Our first quarter reliability was the best in a decade, with our mainline on-time performance, which includes both domestic and international flights, averaging 81%.", "We've gotten back to focusing on the basics. We are starting off right in the morning, getting the first flights of the day out on time. We are beginning the boarding process at the right time, so we can close the aircraft door and depart on schedule. We are continuing to invest in preventative maintenance, spare parts and ground-handling equipment to improve the reliability of our aircraft. We are enhancing the tools our co-workers use at the airport to make the check-in and predeparture processes easier for them and for our customers.", "This quarter, we began the rollout of Aero [ph], our new easy-to-use interface for our passenger service system. Aero [ph] is an integrated front end for our airport and reservations agents, and Jim will speak about some of its benefits in a moment. Investing in modern, efficient and intuitive tools for our co-workers is core to United's technology strategy, and launching Aero [ph] is another step forward in our plan to improve the systems our airport and reservations agents use.", "In addition to providing better tools to our co-workers, we're investing in customer-service training for all of our airport and reservations agents and flight attendants worldwide, including the flight attendants and airport agents at our United Express partners. To date, more than 14,000 of the 48,000 co-workers we will train have completed this interactive customer service training program. Feedback about the program has been excellent, and co-workers who participated in the training have found the material useful and directly applicable to their work. We expect to complete this important training by year-end.", "We're already seeing positive results from our efforts. Customer satisfaction scores climbed in the first quarter, as customers experienced noticeable improvements in United's reliability, customer service and product offering. At the start of the year, we implemented a new customer satisfaction bonus program for our co-workers. Each quarter, we'll set a goal for customer satisfaction scores, and if we achieve that goal, our co-workers will earn a $50 bonus. I'm pleased to say that my co-workers achieved our customer satisfaction goal for the first quarter, and we look forward to delivering even better customer service for the remainder of the year. With the improvements in our operational processes and our investments in aircraft reliability and in the tools our co-workers use to do their jobs, we're confident our operational reliability and customer service will continue to improve and make United the best choice for customers.", "During the first quarter, we reached tentative agreements for 3 joint collective bargaining agreements with the union representing 28,000 of our passenger service, fleet service and storekeeper co-workers. We were disappointed that the agreements were not ratified by those workgroups, and we'll be in discussions with the union and the National Mediation Board on a schedule to resume talks. Meanwhile, we're in discussions with the unions representing our technicians, our flight attendants and our dispatchers and hope to be in a position to reach one or more additional joint collective bargaining agreements later this year.", "During 2013, our customers will experience even more of our product investments. Our onboard experience is now more consistent and comfortable, with over 7,000 flat-bed seats in our premium cabins and Economy Plus seating on almost every mainline aircraft. Today, we offer Wi-Fi with in-seat power on 51 aircraft, including global satellite-based Wi-Fi on 8 of our Boeing 747s, and we've installed larger overhead bins on 60% of our Airbus fleet.", "We're in the process of completely revamping the interior of our p.s. aircraft, which fly between JFK and San Francisco and Los Angeles.  We're installing flat-bed seats, economy-plus seating, Wi-Fi and in-seat power throughout the aircraft, and initial feedback from our customers has been terrific. We're investing in new airplanes and took delivery of 6 new fuel-efficient Boeing 737-900ERs in the first quarter.", "We're pleased that, late last week, the FAA gave the greenlight to Boeing to retrofit the battery system on our Dreamliners, and we currently expect to begin to fly them again domestically in May, with our first international 787 service being our new nonstop service between Denver and Narita on June 10. The grounding of the 787s disrupted our flight plans and had an impact on our bottom line, and we're eager to get this remarkable aircraft back up and flying.", "We're also improving our customer's experience at our airports. We're rolling out a simplified and intuitive boarding process that's gone through extensive testing and will be in place at all of our hubs and many of our larger stations by the start of the busy summer travel seasons. The new simplified boarding process will reduce the congestion and stress at the gate and improve our ability to depart on time. Our customers are now enjoying the modern features, additional space and functionality of our newly-redesigned United Club in Chicago O'Hare's Terminal 2. We plan to completely renovate 3 more United Clubs this year. We recently unveiled the first phase of our new Terminal B at Houston intercontinental airport. The facility is customer-pleasing, with comfortable space, efficient gate layout and great concession options for our customers at our important gateway hub in Houston.", "While we've been spending money on projects that drive returns, we need to do a better job of controlling our costs. We must become more efficient throughout our business in order to be globally competitive. With the distractions of our merger integration declining significantly and our operational performance and customer service improving, we're working to become more efficient and cost-effective while still maintaining solid operational performance, delivering great customer service and increasing our revenue. John will give a few examples of steps we're taking to reduce our costs, and Jim will talk about the actions we're taking to increase our revenue.", "Some of the costs our industry faces are outside of our control. The U.S. airline industry is irrationally taxed. And together with our customers, airline pay nearly $19 billion annually in 17 different taxes and fees, excluding income tax. The federal government recently proposed a budget which would cost the U.S. airline industry an additional $5.5 billion per year in taxes and fees, which is more money than the amount of profit the entire industry earned in 2012.", "In addition to heavy taxation, our government recently implemented broad-based furloughs for air traffic controllers, which have disrupted air travel across the nation. We are disappointed that the FAA chose this path that maximizes customer disruptions and damage to airlines instead of choosing a less disruptive method to comply with its budget obligations. Our top priority is to minimize the effect of the air traffic controller furloughs on our customers. Our professionals in our network operations center are working literally around the clock to minimize the impact of the FAA's irresponsible actions on our customers. And all of our co-workers are doing what they do best, safely managing our operations while delivering great customer service despite the government-imposed challenges we face.", "This year, we're finally moving beyond our merger and our customers are seeing positive results from the hard work we've all put into building United. Consistently achieving our operational, customer satisfaction and financial goals will allow us to invest in our product and service for our customers and in tools and training for our co-workers, with the goal of providing appropriate returns for our investors. We are running United like a real business for long-term success.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim and John to go through the results in greater detail.", "James E. Compton", "Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to join Jeff in thanking my co-workers for all their efforts this quarter. We made significant progress on operational reliability and customer service this quarter, and we couldn't have done it without the hard work of the entire team. I also want to thank all of our customers for choosing United. We are working hard to win your business each and every day.", "2013 got off to a strong start operationally, with the team achieving its best first quarter on-time performance in a decade despite significant storm activity. United averaged 81% in on-time performance in the first quarter, and we paid out $22 million to our co-workers for domestic and international on-time performance exceeding our monthly goal.", "Our operational performance was particularly strong during the busy spring break travel period, which overlapped with the Easter holiday. During the last 3 weeks in March, load factors were 87.9%, nearly 2 points higher than the comparable period a year ago. Over this period, the United team worked together and achieved an 82.1% domestic on-time performance, an improvement of 4.5 points versus the same period in 2012. This was the first true test of our operations since last summer, with an extended period of high load factors and not only met our goal, we exceeded it.", "One initiative that will support our operational performance is the new passenger service system interface called Aero [ph], which we rolled out to our gate agents in March. Aero [ph] is an integrated user interface which has intuitive and practical navigation to make the functions our agents perform easier and quicker. Hundreds of our front-line agents were involved in the design and development of Aero [ph], and it equips our co-workers with more accessible information and intuitive point-and-click access and also brings them added functionality. By June, gate agents will be able to perform all aspects of departure management within Aero [ph] at airports across the system. Later this year, we'll begin rolling out Aero [ph] to lobby agents, and then we'll roll it out to reservation agents beginning in early 2014.", "Moving to capacity. Our first quarter consolidated capacity decreased 4.9% year-over-year. This was at the low end of the range we guided to in January, in large part due to higher-than-expected winter storm activity. Capacity discipline remains a key tenet of our strategy, and the trans-Atlantic region is a good example where we reduced capacity 10.2% year-over-year in the first quarter as we rightsized our footprint in response to the economic weakness we continue to see in Europe. One of the benefits of having a balanced global network with strength in each entity is that we're better able to respond to any change in economic conditions in a particular global region.", "We expect second quarter consolidated capacity to decrease between 1.7% and 2.7% year-over-year and expect full year 2013 capacity to decline 0.75% to 1.75% versus 2012. Full year capacity guidance was lower than we guided to in January primarily due to the effect of the grounding of our 787 Dreamliners. We've made some schedule changes because of our inability to put the Dreamliners into service, and we expect to resume 787 domestic flying in May, with Denver to Tokyo, Narita scheduled to begin on June 10.", "We expect to begin flying 787s from Los Angeles to Tokyo, Narita; Los Angeles to Shanghai; and Houston to Lagos in August and have delayed the launch of our San Francisco to Taipei route on a 777 from 2013 to 2014. These flights represent a substantial amount of ASMs. And while the delays lower our 2000 (sic) [ 2013 ] capacity outlook, they will increase our expected 2014 year-over-year capacity.", "Turning to our revenue results. First quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue increased 5.9% year-over-year. A few items positively impacted first quarter PRASM results, including Easter shifting into March and overlapping with spring break this year and higher-than-expected weather-related cancellations, which lowered capacity. In 2012, we underperformed our peers by 1 to 2 PRASM points, and we're beginning to close that gap with our first quarter revenue results.", "The depreciation of the yen reduced first quarter passenger revenue by approximately $20 million, and we expect the year-over-year yen pressure to continue throughout 2013. Despite the negative yen impact, the Pacific continued to perform quite well for us in the first quarter. Pacific PRASM increased 7.2% year-over-year due to both higher yields and loads. China was again a standout, with first quarter PRASM increasing 13% compared to the first quarter of 2012.", "Corporate revenue began slowly recovering in the first quarter, increasing approximately 4% versus 2012. Despite the momentum we've seen with unit revenues since the start of the year, we are facing some headwinds. Certain economic indicators, including U.S. GDP outlook for the second and third quarters, have weakened since the start of the year. We have seen some impact on our April business mix, and we'll continue to monitor the outlook closely and make appropriate adjustments necessary. Also impacting business mix, government contract travel declined approximately 25% in the first quarter year-over-year, and we expect this trend to persist in the near term. Government contract travel, while an important piece of business for United, represents only about 2% of our overall passenger revenue.", "Competition has increased in the transcon markets, and the associated pricing actions have stimulated demand on New York to San Francisco and Los Angeles routes. This month, a competitor introduced new service on Newark transcon routes and lowered fares by more than 20%, which will negatively impact our second quarter PRASM. With lower fares, demand between Newark and San Francisco and Los Angeles has increased, and we've shifted some capacity from other markets to this market to add frequencies and strengthen our position as the New York area's leading airline. These added frequencies supplement our existing service between these hubs, as well as our popular p.s. service between JFK and our hubs in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Like any other company, large or small, that faces a new competitor, we will make sure Newark transcon customers can find a seat at a competitive price on a United flight.", "Part of our business plan at United is the continuous assessment of economic and demand trends. And as I mentioned, the latest macroeconomic outlook for the remainder of 2013 has softened. We'll continue to evaluate the demand environment as the year progresses, and we'll respond appropriately should conditions change.", "Turning to our near-term revenue outlook. Yields have softened as a result of the factors I've just discussed, and we currently estimate United's April consolidated PRASM to be flat to down 1 point year-over-year. This PRASM estimate is preliminary based on the data we have for April thus far. Ancillary revenue continues to perform very well, with first quarter ancillary revenue up 13%, and ancillary revenue per passenger up 14% versus the same period in 2012. Our goal is to grow ancillary revenue per passenger by at least 9% in 2013, and our first quarter performance positions us well to achieve that target.", "Improvements in Economy Plus and paid premium upgrades continue to drive much of the year-over-year growth in ancillary revenue. Sales of both Economy Plus and paid premium upgrades increased more than 40% year-over-year in the first quarter. A portion of the increase in preferred seating sales is due to more of our customers using direct channels for booking. The shift towards united.com and our mobile app allows our customers to take full advantage of our product and services that they value and comes at a lower cost to United than other distribution channels.", "We relaunched our Premier Access product in the first quarter, which allows customers to enjoy the convenience of priority security and check-in lines, as well as priority boarding. Service charges related to ticketing and itinerary changes grew about 10% in the first quarter due in large part to our improved operational performance, which reduced the need to waive these service charges. This is an example of how running an on-time, reliable airline directly benefits the bottom line.", "In addition to improving our network and ancillary product offering, we are upgrading United's product on the ground and in the air. We expect to open a new United Club in Seattle in the second quarter, with a similar modern look and feel as our new United Club at O'Hare's Terminal 2, offering comfortable space for our customers to work or relax.", "We're investing in our onboard products as well, with Economy Plus on nearly all of our mainline aircraft and most of our larger regional aircraft and lie-flat seats on 182 aircraft. In addition, as Jeff mentioned, we have 51 aircraft with Wi-Fi today, 38 of which have global satellite-based Wi-Fi and 13 of which have ground-based Wi-Fi. With the world's best network, our modern fleet and leading product offering, a great team of co-workers and a significantly improved operational performance and customer service, we are well positioned to drive strong revenue results going forward. We're encouraged with the progress we've made this quarter, but we're not yet where we need to be.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John D. Rainey", "Thanks, Jim. I'd like to start by thanking my co-workers for all of their hard work in the first quarter. By working together, we made significant progress in building the infrastructure we need to produce the level of returns our investors expect. Today, we reported a first quarter loss of $325 million. But during the quarter, we made significant investments in our operations, our fleet, our product offering and our people, and these investments are the right ones to make for the long term.", "We have also significantly improved our balance sheet since the merger and made more progress this quarter by paying down high coupon debt, reducing the size of our term loan and doubling the size of our revolving credit facility. Our first quarter consolidated operating expenses increased 2.1%. We made a number of decisions to accelerate certain expenses into the first quarter, including preventive maintenance work as we prepared our operations for the summer peak.", "First quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, increased 11.1% versus 2012 in large part due to a 4.9% reduction in our consolidated capacity. Holding fuel rate and profit sharing constant, our first quarter consolidated unit cost increased 7.2% year-over-year. The increase in first quarter CASM, again, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit-sharing, is slightly below the guidance range we provided in our March investor update.", "At the end of the quarter, we signed a contract extension with a maintenance provider that resulted in more favorable terms and muted some of the increase in first quarter maintenance expense. Our cost increase in the first quarter was higher than what's acceptable, and we are committed to becoming more efficient in every aspect of our business. The achievement of our long-term financial goals relies on providing the best product and service to our customers and doing it in a far more cost-effective manner than our first quarter results reflect.", "As we previously announced, we are in the process of reducing management and administrative workforce by 6% and are about 2/3 through that process. We now expect our full year capacity to decline further than we had anticipated due in part to the grounding of the 787, and we need to reduce our cost commensurate with that additional capacity decline. As our operations continue to improve and become even more stable, we will run them more efficiently, which will permit our people to focus even more on delivering great customer service every day.", "Concurrently, we are investing in technology for our customers like our mobile app and tools for our co-workers like Aero [ph], the enhanced front end to our passenger service system, to make the airport experience easier and more efficient. Another example of our commitment to efficiency is fuel consumption. In addition to operating a fuel-efficient fleet, we have several operational initiatives underway to reduce fuel consumption. We are constantly looking for opportunities to improve in this area because even small improvements have a meaningful impact on the bottom line. For example, this quarter we became the launch customer for the new Split Scimitar Winglet, built by Aviation Partners Boeing, which will help us further reduce fuel burn on our Boeing 737 Next-Gen fleet by up to 1.8%.", "For the second quarter, we expect CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit-sharing, to increase between 6.7% and 7.7% year-over-year. We expect full year CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit-sharing, to increase between 5.5% and 6.5% year-over-year on lower capacity. Our full year CASM guidance is higher than our original expectation at the start of the year because of a lower capacity outlook and the impact of accelerated depreciation from an agreement to sell aircraft to FedEx.", "We reached an agreement during the first quarter to sell up to 30 Boeing 757-200 aircraft to FedEx and delivered the first aircraft to them this week. We had planned to retire these aircraft in the coming years, and this agreement will permit us to accelerate the elimination of older, less-efficient aircraft from our fleet. As a result of this agreement, we accelerated the depreciation of some of these aircraft, which will increase depreciation expense by approximately $80 million in 2013, $12 million of which was in the first quarter.", "While the accelerated depreciation will adversely impact 2013 earnings, this agreement results in a positive economic outcome over the time period that these aircraft are replaced and provides a better product for our customers. It's another indication of how we are managing the business with a focus on creating long-term shareholder value. During the first quarter, we took delivery of 6 new Boeing 737-900ERs and retired 2 Boeing 757-200s and 3 Boeing 737-500s. In the second quarter, we expect to take delivery of 6 more new Boeing 737-900ERs and retire 12 mainline aircraft, including the last 5 Boeing 737-500s and 5 Boeing 767-200s.", "We made substantial progress in strengthening our balance sheet in the first quarter, and our capital structure is the best that it's been in years. We made $1.3 billion of debt and capital lease payments in the first quarter, including $1 billion of prepayments. During the first quarter, we took 2 actions that significantly improved the health of our balance sheet: first, in February, we redeemed $600 million of secured notes with interest rates of 9 7/8% on the first lien and 12% on the second lien; second, we replaced our $1.2 billion term loan that was due in February 2014 with a $900 million term loan due in 2019. The interest rate of this new financing is LIBOR plus 300 basis points, subject to a 1% LIBOR floor.", "In conjunction with our term loan transaction, we replaced our $500 million revolving credit facility with a new $1 billion revolver. The combined term loan and revolver transaction improved our unrestricted liquidity position by $200 million and resulted in a more efficient source of liquidity. We closed the first quarter with an unrestricted liquidity position of $6.4 billion, including the new $1 billion dollar revolver.", "In addition to our strong liquidity position, our unencumbered asset balance has been increasing as we pay off the related secured debt. We estimate our current unencumbered asset balance to be in excess of $4.5 billion. Improving our balance sheet is good for all of our stakeholders. It lowers our interest expense, allows us to focus on long-term investments that improve the experience for our customers and co-workers and makes us a better, less-risky investment for our shareholders.", "As we look at our debt maturity profile over the next 5 years, we are confident in our ability to manage our annual debt service. We have approximately $1 billion of debt and capital lease maturities remaining in 2013, with approximately $500 million due in the second quarter. We have a 1.1 -- we have $1.1 billion of maturities due in 2014 and $1.9 billion due in 2015, which includes $800 million of 6 3/4% secured notes, which become prepayable at par in September of 2014.", "We expect approximately $530 million of gross and $340 million of net capital expenditures in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect gross capital expenditures of $2.5 billion, $1.7 billion net of financing. Our full year CapEx guidance is consistent with prior guidance from a cash flow perspective but reflect change in the way we account for the return of purchase deposits based upon how we finance aircraft.", "While we reported a loss for the first quarter, our plan for 2013 remains the same, to generate a return on invested capital of at least 10%. We intend to recover the revenue we temporarily lost last year, strengthen our balance sheet and aggressively manage our costs. We are running this business to consistently create economic value for our shareholders and make United a great place to work and an even better airline to fly.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, John. None of us is happy with our first quarter financial results, but all of us believe that our operational and customer satisfaction results for the quarter offer proof that we're taking the right steps in building the foundation for our future.", "We have high aspirations and the focus and determination to achieve them. Not only do we want to create the world's leading airline, but we want to create an airline that is actually a real business, a business that consistently invests in its product and customer service, a business that invests in tools and training for its co-workers, a business that competes and wins against its competitors and a business that consistently earns a sufficient return on its invested capital. We still have much work ahead of us before we can achieve these goals, but we're confident we're on the right path.", "I'll now turn it over to Sarah to open up the call for questions.", "Sarah Murphy", "Thank you, Jeff. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Larissa, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from David Fintzen from Barclays.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A question for Jim. You kind of walked through some of the moving parts of RASM in the quarter from comp to sort of weather and the like. I'm curious sort of on 2 pieces potentially. One of is, can you quantify what you think the weather -- I wouldn't want to say benefit, but the weather impact to RASM in 1Q was? And then is there anything you can disclose in terms of corporate share and sort of how much corporate share gain? Or do you think there's corporate share gain that's happening as you start to bring some of that business traffic that was on detour back on to the system?", "James E. Compton", "David, this is Jim. Weather-related capacity was down about 1%, and so we haven't assigned a RASM contribution to that. But clearly, that was one of the pieces of it. We've talked about the Easter shift, and we estimate that to be about 0.5 to 1 point of that RASM so that piece, we feel pretty comfortable with identifying. In terms of corporate, what I'd like to say is that what we're hearing from our corporations, first of all, and from our corporate travel managers is they're clearly recognizing the work the team has done in operations to bring back reliability. We're getting that feedback as we continue, as always, to have dialogues with them through the quarter. From a share perspective, though, I'd like -- we're seeing that recovery of the revenue that we lost last year. And so when you ask, where is that share gain, I'd say that share gain is positive versus where we're off last year, but we still feel we have a lot of work to do and to upside in terms of regaining what we lost last year. As well as by -- again, as I've talked to before, the dialogue with the corporations is not about the operational difficulties that we had last year. It's really about how we can bring value to their travel needs, and we think that has upside to us in the future also.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a quick one for John. Just you -- we have the CapEx guidance for this year. But just any sense how we should be thinking about CapEx kind of beyond this year?", "John D. Rainey", "Well, David, we talked about when we gave our CapEx guidance at the beginning of the year that there was a disproportionate amount of onetime items in this year. I think we said it was roughly half of our CapEx was more anomalous, sort of once-in-a-generation type items like building a data center or 2 new maintenance centers or maintenance hangars, like we are this year. Going forward, just sort of  from a run rate perspective, we're going to continue to focus on our fuel-efficient fleet. We've got 700 planes, and if we fly those planes 25 or 30 years, we're going to replace 25 to 30 a year. So from a fleet CapEx, that's what a normal run rate will be. That's going to be a little bit lumpy from one year to the next. I think the real area of improvement is in the non-aircraft CapEx, and I would expect that to come down appreciably. We still do have some CapEx needs related to this integration, I mean one of the things we're doing is sticking 2 airlines, putting 2 airlines together. So it's not going to just plummet next year, but we do hope to see that come down in the very near future.", "Operator", "John Godyn from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jim, I just wanted to follow up on some of your PRASM commentary there, just clarify 2 things. I think you just mentioned that you weren't quite at that sort of 2% run rate even though we've seen some of these months show very strong PRASM, like we did in March. That's not representative of yet being at that 2% sort of gap that you're looking to close. And secondarily, when we think about the nature of that 2% that you estimated for last year, I think not all months are created equal. As we look into this summer, isn't that gap -- I mean, is it fair to assume that, that gap that could be closed could be significantly more than 2% just because that period was particularly soft last year? Just curious what your thoughts are.", "James E. Compton", "John, I think it's a good point that you allude to. I think looking at RASM month-to-month basis, there's all kinds of things that can affect any individual month. So that when we talk about the 1 to 2 points last year, it's really a smoothing over the year of what we thought we lost, right? And so we talked about a year ago at this time, the first quarter with some items related to our cutting over to our revenue management system to a single optimizer, and we've talked about that, as well as some conservative booking around March 3 in PSS, that's attributing to about a 1-point RASM negative to us. And as you went through the year, I think different issues came up for the company. As you run into the second quarter and some of the stress that we put on our customers and our employees through the integration, the complication of the integration also affected our performance. And to your point, in the summer, particularly in July, our operational reliability hit its lowest level. So I think getting back to where I started, I think that we really feel that the 1 to 2 points in lost RASM points in the revenue associated with that was with a number of things last year, with the integration of the airline. And we feel comfortable we're on track in terms of regaining that, as first seen in our first quarter RASM performance. But still, we know we have a lot of work to do and really focused on getting all that back and again, building on the strength of the network.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And John, just one on cost. I know that this year is sort of a transition year with some CASM x fuel and inflation. But when we just sort of take step back and think about what a normalized CASM x fuel growth rate trend should be in a flattish capacity environment, how should we think about that?", "John D. Rainey", "John, probably 2/3 of our CASM increase on a full year basis is related to the some of the mark-to-market on our new labor agreements, and that is clearly more one-time in nature. Going forward, you'll see more normal sort of standard yearly increases, and so I think this is clearly a blip for us. I think in a flat capacity environment, we ought to be trying to maintain our unit cost to something at an inflation level or below.", "Operator", "Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank is online with a question.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I have a couple here. A couple of carriers around the world who fly the 787 have publicly indicated maybe what the impact was to them. I suspect that, that's not your style. Some of these are much more aggressive in going after the manufacturers for penalties. When we think about the March quarter, how much of an impact did the 787 grounding have? And I mean, you've already given us the capacity, a revised number which, for the year, it's a 75-basis-point hit. But is there anything else you can say about maybe additional costs incurred carrying a core of 787 pilots not being able to fly in some of these markets, maybe some revenue impact. Anything that you can give us on that front would be great.", "John D. Rainey", "Mike, this is John. In terms of the costs that we can specifically ascribe to the grounding of the 787, we took a special charge in the quarter, which included about $11 million related to the 787. Clearly, there's some other kind of revenue impact, if you will, which is much smaller and is not necessarily included in special charge. But we're excited to have the plane back and get it back flying next month. It is a great airplane. And Boeing has been a great partner with us, and we fully expect them to continue to be.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great, John. And then just my second question, and this is to Jim. We have the capacity plan, which is -- which has been revised lower. As we look at the business that you have tuned from Japan, you to do carry a fair share amount of Japanese leisure traffic. I know we are heading into the peak summer season. But is -- the bias, with respect to capacity, is it to the downside when we think about where the yen is, where the forecasts are for the yen later this year and as a result, what that will do to the demand from Japanese travelers to U.S. dollar-denominated destinations like Guam?", "James E. Compton", "Mike, Jim. The -- I think our capacity and guidance is right in line with kind of -- with where we expect the yen to be and the demand associated with it. The Japanese -- those packages, particularly the Guam, are baht- and yen-denominated, and so we think our capacity is lined fairly well in terms of the demand, in terms of the passenger traffic through there. But to your point, as always, when I make the macro assumption that we'll monitor the environment and so forth, we'll do that at a regional level also and make sure that we adjust capacity based on the demand that we're seeing.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Jim, just asking it another way. Is it -- does the fleet forward schedule actually already incorporate some drawdown in capacity in some of those markets?", "James E. Compton", "No, no. At this point, it's still our -- it's our plan that we've had for this year.", "Operator", "Hunter Keay from Wolfe Trahan is online with a question.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "John, correct me if I'm wrong, I may be looking at this table wrong, so please, first of all, tell me if I'm incorrect. But it looks like if Brent goes up by $40 per barrel, you're only saving $0.09 on your hedge book. And when I look at $110 million of hedge losses being run through the P&L, it just -- I think it begs some questions on sort of the strategy between keeping premium costs down and hedging against sort of these spikes that may be sort of exogenous-driven. So I guess the question here is, what is the hedging strategy? And when I see stuff like this, should I maybe think that it's open to changing?", "John D. Rainey", "First of all, Hunter, I'd say that we always look at what's going on in the oil market, and we are -- we take into account changes in the oil market with respect to our hedging strategy. What we've done, over the last year, probably is more what I would describe as hedging with a range bound mindset in terms of what happened to fuel. If you look at 2008, 2009, fuel ran up to $140 or whatever it was. Jet fuel, I think, was at the $170 level, and clearly, that created some demand distraction and you saw new sources of supply come on. And it appears now that the range that oil is trading in is much closer in. And so what we've done with our hedge book is reflect that, and so you see us taking these 3-way positions where we might buy a call at, say, for example, $110 Brent and then sell it at $125. And so we're protected in that range from $110 to $125. And so in your question, your example, yes if it goes to $140, we're not protected at that point. But I think what we've seen is that there's a certain amount of demand distraction that occurs at that point, and that's not something that can be sustained. And I think to insure for that is very expensive. Our hedge book today, we're about 34% hedged over the next 12 months, and we've spent $11 million or $12 million on the hedge premium. So I think it's a prudent use of our cash, considering that this is almost $13 billion of our cost structure, and it's something, I think, we're pretty thoughtful about. What you're seeing, in respect to the possible hedge loss, that's simply a mark-to-market swing from one month to the next, and we've seen prices come down appreciably here in the last week or so. And so as we mark-to-market that hedge position that doesn't get hedge accounting, that's going to swing the other way. We had a $50 million positive swing, a gain, this month and that could bounce back. But this is one way that we try to minimize and mute the volatility. As I said, fuel efficiency is another way. We spend a lot of capital and focus on that. And then lastly, I think we continue to believe that as an industry, we need to be able to price through our cost inputs. And that's one of the benefits, I think, that we've seen with some of the consolidation is a healthier, more structurally sound business.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.", "Okay, John. That's helpful. In terms of -- another question maybe for Jim or Jeff even. I'm a little surprised to hear you guys mention specifically the Newark, San Francisco route. Given that -- I kind of thought that it would be -- your network would be big enough to absorb sort of turf defenses like this without it showing up. And some of the pushback that I get a lot when I push a bull case for airlines is this whole concept of barriers to entry and airlines defending turf. With the realization that this is obviously a trunk route for you and it's of utmost strategic importance for the long term is clearly not helpful for your ROIC right now. And I guess, the question is how long are you willing to defend this turf? How willing do you think Virgin is to stay here and bleed losses for an extended period of time before something actually has to give?", "James E. Compton", "Hunter, Jim. So the way we think about the market is, obviously, it's -- when we've seen competitors come into a market and lower prices significantly, it generates a lot of demand. And it's unique to us because we have such a great presence in both the L.A. basin, the San Francisco Bay area, and we've talked about our great presence in New York. But prices that have been lowered as much as 20% -- starting at 20% down, when you have great presence in those markets is going to generate a lot of demand. And so the way we look at it is that we want to make sure that as we generate significant demand, that customers that want to fly United have a seat and they can get it. I will say that we don't -- we think about that in terms of also our kind of overall strategy right, our overall strategy of capacity discipline. And so as you can see, as we manage ourselves in that market, we haven't changed our guidance, our capacity, and we find ways to do it across the network that, quite frankly, every day what we're trying to do is optimize the network. and I think that's what our goal is and that's what we're trying to do, when someone stimulates that much demand is make sure that we have a seat for our passengers.", "Operator", "Glenn Engel from Bank of America is online with a question.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you talk about labor? There was a flight attendant agreement that didn't end up happening. Do you end up keeping that in your accruals anyhow even though the agreement was rejected? And where are we in terms of which groups have had their wages harmonized, which still have left? And where are we on integrating contracts?", "John D. Rainey", "Glenn, this is John. The agreement that there was a TA for, tentative agreement, that did not ratify was for the employees that are represented by the IAM, which is our customer contact and airport agents. That did not ratify, to your point. We're still's optimistic that we will get a deal there. I think that any time that there's -- something like that is voted down, we want to take into account the reasons why it was voted down and see if we can reshuffle the deck chairs and get something that is good for our employees and good for the company. So to the -- we still are optimistic about that and there is still some amount of costs in our guidance for the full year for that. With respect to...", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Is that not reflected in the first quarter as well?", "John D. Rainey", "It was reflected in the first quarter because we had an expectation that it would ratify. That's one of the reasons our cost guidance came in slightly better than what we expected when it didn't.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And the rest?", "John D. Rainey", "Yes, with respect to the other labor groups, obviously, we got -- made a significant achievement with our pilots in getting a JCBA there. We still need to get -- while we've had individual labor agreements with each of the 2 sides, on the flight attendant side as well as the mechanics side, we are working through the joint collective bargaining process there. I don't really -- I can't really give you an idea in terms of timing, but it's something that we clearly recognize our employees want and we want. I think all being part of one team and being under -- all rolling together is an important aspect of getting these 2 groups together.", "Operator", "Jamie Baker from JP Morgan is online with a question.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question relates to H7N9. It doesn't appear that the virus has driven any revisions in your schedules or your business plan. But in the event we have a repeat of SARS, could you remind us as to what your network options are? What level of capacity can you pull down before you start jeopardizing slot and route rights? Would capacity more likely be grounded? Or should we assume it's redeployed? Just what's -- wondering what sort of network contingency you might be thinking about.", "James E. Compton", "Jamie, this is Jim. Similar to H1N1 years ago, we actually have good flexibility in order to adjust our capacity. To this point, as you mentioned, the current flu, we're not seeing any significant booking away or any significant impact due to it. We, obviously, watch and monitor the CDC very closely and work with the field and so forth. But based on past experience, we've had tremendous flexibility to adjust, and I think, obviously, with the breadth of the network now, the flexibility is more enhanced in today's environment than even years ago.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, that's a good point. It was a pre-merger phenomenon. Second question for Jeff, if air travel didn't take so long, I'd do more of it, and I'd be willing to pay more for it. The most recent and best example of an initiative that actually improves the value proposition of air travel is PreCheck, and that's not even an airline idea. It's a government program. It isn't perfect, but it does make things faster. And I would argue that, that's the -- speed is the business that you're in. So programs like global services, concierge key, very lavish benefits. They make the time allocated to air travel more pleasant, but they don't decrease the time that it takes. So here's my question, do you think there's an opportunity for an airline to ever come up with a program that actually improves on the amount of time travel takes? Or do we have to rely on the government to take this out for us?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Well, there's a couple of things, Jamie. First of all, as you probably know, we've -- since 9/11, we've been working with the government to have a more logical and layered approach to security, and you recollect the old \"trusted traveler\" idea. Well, precheck is essentially that, finally. It's taken the government a long time. As you know, we do not control the TSA and we -- all we can do is talk to them and plead with them. But I must say I commend the TSA for coming up finally with PreCheck. It's an excellent product, and I would encourage every traveler who qualifies for it to do because it's superb. It's like the good old days, and it does indeed save time. We do offer Premier Line and Premier Access to our customers, which speeds them through, our Premier Lines, through security and also boarding at the gate. So we are very conscious of our customers' time. We do -- that's why we also do our very best to run a reliable operation to minimize the delays and to get people where they want to go on time.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We'll now take calls from the media.", "[Operator Instructions] Mary Jane Credeur from Bloomberg News is online with a question.", "Mary Jane Credeur", "[indiscernible] situation. And can you quantify how many flights you're seeing delayed on any given day, what it looks like at peak time versus nonpeak? And what's going to happen when we get a big nasty thunderstorm on a Monday morning?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Mary Jane, I'm sorry, you faded out. But I assume you're talking about the air traffic control furloughs?", "Mary Jane Credeur", "Yes, sir.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Yes, sure. Right now, let me -- first of all, let me tell you that I think everyone knows that this is very frustrating for everyone, for our customers, for our co-workers, and we're doing our best to help our customers. As I mentioned earlier, we've got great folks not only at our network operation but our airports, working to minimize the impacts on the customers. And so far, we've been able to limit the flight cancellations to our regional operations, not the mainline. That's affects fewer passengers because the regionals carry fewer passengers than the mainline. But the delays are indeed affecting our mainline operations. At United, we -- this is so far affecting, on average, about 20,000 passengers a day, and of course, all of our competitors are experiencing similar effects because this is a network business. We're working with A4A, Airlines for America, which is our industry association in D.C. And this is clearly a network business, and the cancellations and delays will be cumulative. The longer this goes on for us and for all of our competitors and for all of the customers nationwide, it's going to have -- if it continues on, it will have an average effect on the industry and the economy as well. And at both of those, there's got to be a better way. Look, there are very good folks in Washington who understand what's happening and they want to fix it, and we're working with them in every way we can. But one thing I just want to make clear to you is that this isn't the fault of the air traffic controllers. I mean, they're doing their very best to manage flights under really difficult circumstances, and I want them to know that we support them. And we appreciate all they're doing to minimize the impact of the furloughs.", "Mary Jane Credeur", "And do you think that we'll have -- there's talk just this last day or so of a legislative solution possibly percolating. Do you think that, that will come to fruition?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Well, we're certainly hopeful that -- well, we're certainly working with the good folks in Washington to make that happen. I mean, this is really important for our nation. This is something that, if it continues, it will damage our economy, it will damage jobs. This cannot continue, and I hope the good folks in Washington that we're working with will get that legislation drafted and passed and on the President's desk.", "Operator", "Josh Freed from the Associated Press is online with a question.", "Josh Freed", "Further on the air traffic control situation, do you get any kind of heads up or guidance from FAA on where they should be? I mean to what extent are you able to plan ahead? I mean, do you get 6 hours' notice, 24 hours' notice on furloughs? Maybe you can tell us a little more about that.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Well, we obviously are in contact within as much as we can be, and we have morning calls with them. But these are a bit like sort of pop-up thunderstorms, they are not predictable. The problem is there's no consistency to it, and it's very hard to plan for, Josh. The result of that is you can't effectively pull down schedules like you could in a storm system, where you can see it coming and then you can take action ahead of time. This is -- this pops up around the country fairly randomly, and that's what makes it so difficult and that's what makes it candidly so much harder on our customers.", "Josh Freed", "All right. And do you think it will continue that you'll be able to prevent cancellations on the mainline? Or is it doubtful that, that will -- do you think eventually this will start to hit the mainline more?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Josh, I don't know. It just depends upon how this falls out. I think we'll be a lot smarter over time. I hope that we don't have to be smarter over time. I hope that our -- the folks in Washington will realize how severe this is. I believe they are realizing it and will take action to stop it.", "Sarah Murphy", "Okay. With that, we're out of time, so we'll conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today.

Smisek", "Thanks, Nene and Sarah, and thank you, all, for joining us on our third quarter 2013 earnings call.", "Today, we reported a profit of $590 million for the third quarter, an improvement of 13.5% year-over-year or $1.51 per diluted share. I want to thank all of my co-workers for running a reliable airline and delivering great customer service. I'd also like to thank our customers for choosing to fly United. We appreciate your business.", "We also appreciate the positive feedback we've been receiving from you about the significant improvements we've made to our operations, customer service and product.", "Although our third quarter earnings marked our highest level of quarterly profits since the third quarter of 2011, our financial performance this quarter did not meet our expectations and fell far short of what we can and should deliver. We are committed to achieving the full potential of United.", "As we've said before, our 3 goals for 2013 are to deliver solid operational performance, to deliver great customer service, and to beat our financial plan.", "We've made meaningful progress on 2 of those 3 fronts this year, but our financial results remain unsatisfactory. We need to accelerate our revenue growth and improve our efficiency in the coming quarters and years. There are several key drivers for our lower-than-expected passenger revenue results this quarter. The first is related to the demand forecast we input into our revenue management system, which was biased toward accepting too many low-yield bookings early in the booking curve. This resulted in very high load factors and a weak yield mix. Another involves suboptimization of our fleet. A third factor is increased competitive pressure in the Pacific entity, particularly, in China. Jim will explain in more detail these items and the prompt actions we are taking to improve our revenue and yield mix.", "We have a lot of work ahead, but our team knows what we need to do to address the revenue and cost issues we have and to accelerate our improvements in financial performance. In a few minutes, I'll turn the call over to Jim and John to provide details on the specific actions we're taking on both revenue and costs. But first, let me briefly update you on our progress on our other 2 goals of delivering solid operational performance and great customer service.", "We ran a solid and competitive operation in the third quarter, with a mainline on-time arrival rate of 78.9% and a mainline completion factor of 99.2%. September was our best month of 2013 and our second-best month since 2010 for domestic on-time arrivals, at nearly 85%. Our team's performance year-to-date demonstrates that our operations are, once again, stable and reliable. And with the peak travel season behind us, we can now begin to run our operation with far more efficiency than we have in the past.", "We also continue to make progress on our goal of delivering great customer service. This is evidenced by our customer satisfaction scores for September that were 37% higher than they were 1 year ago at this time. In addition, the number of written customer compliments we've received about our co-workers has increased 45% year-to-date. So far, more than 40,000 of our agents and flight attendants have participated in our customer service training program. We've made great progress in customer service and are committed to building upon and improving the skills our coworkers have honed this year. We plan to continue to invest in customer service training and standards, and we believe that great customer service at United can become a powerful competitive differentiator.", "During the third quarter, we also made significant progress bringing United's work groups together. In early September, we accepted an integrated seniority list from the Airline Pilots Association. This list allows us to bring together our more than 12,000 pilots to form one pilot group, which will allow us to fully integrate our flight operations. In addition, we offered a recall to all pilots who remained on furlough and are in a good staffing position as we approach the implementation date for the new flight duty time rules of FAR 117 in January of next year.", "Also in September, we announced tentative agreements with the International Association of Machinists for joint collective bargaining agreements for the work groups represented by the IAM. These tentative agreements cover 28,000 of our customer service representatives, ramp agents, storekeepers and customer contact center representatives, and are currently in the ratification process. We continue in joint negotiations with our other work groups, as well. Bringing our work groups together is important and we continue to work closely with our unions to reach responsible joint collective bargaining agreements. As we do so, we continue to build our working-together culture, which will help us improve our customer service and, in turn, our profitability.", "In addition to investing in our customer service and our people, we are investing in our product with the goal of offering our customers a comfortable, consistent and personalized flight experience every time they travel with United. We've made substantial improvements to our onboard product. This month, we unveiled our new economy seat design, focused on customer comfort, revenue generation and fuel efficiency, all with a sophisticated, modern look. This seat has a slimmer, more ergonomic design, providing more customer comfort while allowing us to improve the operating economics of the aircraft on which it's installed. Over the next few years, our customers will experience this new seat on more than 500 mainline and regional aircraft.", "United has the industry-leading portfolio of preferred seating options, including the most extra-legroom economy seats and the most premium-cabin flat-bed seats of any U.S. carrier. We are making strides in modernizing our in-flight entertainment, as well. Today, we have over 115 aircraft flying with Wi-Fi and are installing our satellite-based global Wi-Fi product on our remaining mainline fleet at the rate of about 1 aircraft a day. We're also preparing to launch a new streaming video in-flight entertainment product beginning later this year, which will allow our customers to view a variety of on-demand entertainment options on their own devices.", "Our digital channels are critical to our strategy of providing personalized experiences, real-time information and more control over the travel experience to our customers. And during the third quarter, we updated the functionality of our mobile app. In the fourth quarter, we will be launching a significantly enhanced version of our mobile app and I expect that our customers will appreciate its design, functionality and ease-of-use. Our customers can now purchase most of our ancillary products directly through the United app. While ancillary sales through our mobile channel still represent a small portion of our total ancillary revenue, we've seen tremendous growth in this space, with the year-to-date mobile channel ancillary sales having more than doubled year-over-year.", "Our improving product aligns with our business-centric global network. Our growing fleet of highly efficient Boeing 787 Dreamliners enables us to fly new routes that would not have been feasible without these aircraft. Thanks to the considerable progress we've made in our operational reliability and our customer service, along with our significant investments in our people, our product, our technology and our network, we were ready in September to launch our new ad campaign centered around United's iconic \"Fly the Friendly Skies\" tagline and Rhapsody in Blue theme song.", "Our new ad campaign redefines what it means for an airline to be friendly in our modern era. To our customers, friendly now means being user-friendly throughout the entire travel experience, from shopping and booking, to check-in, to boarding, to in-flight, to retrieving bags. We are working hard to give our customers the operational reliability, customer service, network, convenience, options, technology and product they need to have a consistently enjoyable travel experience and to deliver on our promise of being flyer-friendly. We're also working hard to deliver to you, our shareholders, the financial performance that our strong assets and team of over 80,000 co-workers can generate. Improving our financial results is an absolute priority.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim and John, to go through, in greater detail, this quarter's results and the actions we're taking to improve our future results.", "James E. Compton", "Thanks, Jeff. I'd first like to thank my co-workers for running a reliable operation and providing steadily improving customer service this quarter. I also want to thank all of our customers for choosing United. We are committed to being flyer-friendly in every aspect of your travel experience.", "We continued to improve our on-time performance in the third quarter, with a mainline on-time arrival rate of 78.9%. Our operational performance, relative to our peers, improved with only 1 percentage point of on-time performance separating us from top-tier performance. We're pleased to have recognized our co-workers for their accomplishments this quarter with incentive payouts of $9 million. And this month, we're on track to exceed our on-time arrival goals for another payout in October.", "We've seen clear operational benefits from many of the actions we've taken over the last 18 months, all of which contributed to our solid operational results. As we move past the summer peak, our focus has shifted to running a more efficient operation while delivering reliability. We are taking every opportunity to reduce the amount of time it takes to taxi an aircraft into the gate, to bring a jet bridge up to an aircraft to begin deplaning, and to turn an aircraft between flights. We're improving our efficiency through enhanced tools for our co-workers, more powerful self-service technology for our customers and a more appropriate matching of staffing with demand.", "Our third quarter consolidated capacity declined 1.1% year-over-year, driven by capacity decreases in the domestic and Pacific entities. Our network planning team continually analyzes new opportunities to redeploy current aircraft to new markets in order to make United even more attractive to our customers and to improve our return profile.", "We expect fourth quarter consolidated capacity will increase between 2.5% and 3.5%. Approximately half of this increase is due to our reduced flying as a result of Superstorm Sandy in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect full year 2013 consolidated capacity to decrease between 1.2% and 1.4%.", "Moving to our revenue results. Our third quarter total revenue of $10.2 billion reflects many of the improvements we've made in our operations, customer service and merchandising capabilities. Our third quarter consolidated PRASM increased 2.7% year-over-year, which was lower than our original expectations for the quarter. Although we did improve our third quarter PRASM versus 2012, our revenue results were not at the level we expected or deem acceptable.", "As Jeff noted, there are several key drivers for our lower-than-expected passenger revenue results. The first is related to the demand forecast we input into our revenue management system. Another involves the suboptimization of our fleet. A third factor is increased competitive pressure in the Pacific entity, particularly, in China. Let me assure you, we are taking aggressive action to fix the causes of our underperformance and, in turn, grow our revenue at a faster rate.", "First, we have determined that the demand forecast we were using to manage our inventory underestimated the level of close-in booking demand. That erroneous demand forecast biased our revenue management system to open lower-yield inventory buckets further out in the booking curve. As a result, while we ran very high load factors this quarter, our yield mix was lower than it should have been, had we used a more accurate demand forecast. The impact of this issue intensified in mid-September as we shifted from the more leisure-centric summer period to the fall, when there is more business travel and more close-in booking demand. What's key going forward is that this month we implemented the first of 2 significant recalibrations to the demand forecast we are using for future bookings. The first recalibration adjusted our forecast to shift our booking curves toward more close-in bookings. This will reduce the number of low-yield bookings we accept further out from departure and maintaining of seat availability to maximize close-in higher-yield bookings.", "The second recalibration to our demand forecast will occur in November and will update the demand forecast to be more weighted to recent demand trends than prior-year history. Together, these changes will enable us to capture more higher-yielding traffic than we have recently. Since we accept bookings up to 11 months before departure, it will take some time to see the full effect of this recalibration. However, we anticipate realizing accelerating yield improvements during the first half of 2014.", "Second, to ensure we minimize any operational challenges during the peak summer travel period, we took a more conservative approach to revenue management by limiting the booking levels we would accept on a given flight. That was the right thing to do then. Today, however, as we are running a consistently reliable operation and have a longer history of booking data and traffic flows across our network, we are moving away from those tactics. We have a more accurate assessment of customer behaviors such as no-shows and cancellation rates across our system, than we did at this time last year, and have adjusted our inventory availability and booking levels accordingly to drive incremental revenue.", "Third, while our global route network is the best in the industry, we still have opportunities to optimize our footprint and choose the best aircraft for a particular route. For example, last summer, due to operational reliability issues we were experiencing with our Boeing 747 aircraft, we moved our entire 747 fleet to San Francisco to increase our maintenance touch points and provide better spares and swap capability to minimize operational issues.", "While this was not a revenue-maximizing decision in the short-term, it was important that we quickly improve the reliability of the 747 fleet. Now that we have improved the reliability of those aircraft, after putting them through an intensive preventive maintenance program, we're comfortable returning the 747s to their optimal routes. That includes the routes originating in Chicago. We expect this change will drive around $40 million in additional benefit next year.", "Although what I have been talking about constitutes just some of the many actions we are taking to improve our passenger revenue, they are among the most critical and impactful ones. I want to assure you, we will remain vigilant and flexible as we implement these actions and will consider others to improve our performance, all while continuing to run a competitively reliable airline delivering great customer service.", "We are facing a challenge in the Pacific region. During the third quarter, our Pacific unit revenue declined 9.4% year-over-year, driven by capacity growth from domestic and international competitors in China and by an additional headwind of $55 million in the quarter due to yen weakness. As you know, we are the largest U.S. carrier to China, with more than twice the capacity of our next largest U.S. competitor. Demand for travel to and from China continues to grow at one of the highest rates globally, and in response, there has been a flood of new competitive capacity into that market. In total, in the third quarter, competitive industry capacity between the U.S. and Beijing and Shanghai increased 20% year-over-year, and we see that trend persisting in the fourth quarter.", "As we moved from the summer into the shoulder period in September, we saw our yields and load factor on flights to China deteriorate at a rate over and above what we originally anticipated. Despite the year-over-year Pacific PRASM declines, the region remains a critical asset for us and a key differentiator. We operate ideal Pacific gateways in San Francisco and Los Angeles, the 2 largest local markets on the West coast, and offer our customers an unmatched level of service to China. While our offering between the U.S. and Asia is unrivaled, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our presence while maintaining overall capacity discipline.", "As you may know, we will soon start selling tickets on our new nonstop service from San Francisco to Chengdu, China. The 787 makes this service viable and enables United to be the first mover among domestic carriers to serve such important markets in Asia.", "We're also working to provide our customers a consistent, user-friendly travel experience from end to end. We're doing this by offering great seating options, providing a comprehensive portfolio of ancillary projects -- products, rolling out global satellite Wi-Fi across our mainline fleet, improving our self-service technology and delivering excellent customer service. We now have Economy Plus seating installed on nearly all of our mainline aircraft and on many of our larger regional aircraft. Further, we are the only U.S. carrier to offer flat-bed seats on every long-haul international flight from the U.S.", "Ancillary revenue continued to show strong growth in the third quarter, as ancillary revenue per passenger grew 16% year-over-year to over $20 per passenger. Economy Plus upsell was, once again, a primary driver of this growth, increasing 19% year-over-year in the third quarter. We further enhanced our ability to dynamically price Economy Plus in the third quarter by migrating Economy Plus to our merchandising platform, which enables us to easily adjust pricing based on load factors and forecasted demand.", "We also saw substantial growth from paid premium cabin upgrades, with a 27% increase year-over-year. With our strong ancillary revenue growth in the first 3 quarters of 2013, we are well-positioned to exceed our 2013 goal of increasing ancillary revenue per passenger by 9%.", "We're continuing to invest in the technology our customers want and use. This quarter, we enhanced our mobile apps, which now offer functionality for customers to modify their flight itineraries in the case of a delayed or canceled flight. We've also installed global satellite-based Wi-Fi on more than 115 aircraft to date and are installing the product on about 1 aircraft per day.", "Turning to our near-term passenger revenue outlook. Many of the recent pressures we experienced in the third quarter persist in October and the fourth quarter, which is a quarter during which we will also be growing our consolidated capacity between 2.5% and 3.5%. We currently estimate our October consolidated PRASM to decrease between 2.5% and 3.5% year-over-year. This includes an approximately 1.5-point negative PRASM impact due to the government shutdown.", "We estimate our fourth quarter consolidated PRASM to be flat to down 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We are working hard to provide our customers the network, the product and the service they desire when they travel. While we're disappointed in our revenue results, we're making the right adjustments and have the right plans in place to address the issues and profitably grow our top line in the quarters and years to come.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John D. Rainey", "Thanks, Jim, and thanks to our co-workers for working together to deliver great service and reliability for our customers this quarter.", "Today, we reported over $0.5 billion of profit for the third quarter, but our financial results are not yet where we expect them to be.", "We're making tremendous progress operationally and in our customer service, supported by feedback from our customers and co-workers. But we now need to translate that into better financial results than we are reporting today. The entire team is working hard to accelerate the achievement of our financial goals.", "This quarter, we earned $590 million of net income, resulting in a 5.8% pretax margin, a 0.5-point improvement year-over-year. So far this year, we have increased our pretax margin in 6 of the 9 months and expect our fourth quarter pretax margin to increase year-over-year also.", "Our third quarter CASM, excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, grew 6.4% versus 2012, at the low end of our guidance range. Our better operational reliability was the primary contributing factor to the improvement in the third quarter CASM versus our guidance. Running a solid operation results in lower overtime expense, maintenance expense and re-accommodation expense. In each successive quarter this year, we have reduced our nonfuel CASM year-over-year increase, and we expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter. We expect our fourth quarter CASM, excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, to increase about 1% versus the same period in 2012. And for the full year, we expect it to increase between 6% and 6.5% year-over-year. Our increase in nonfuel unit costs this year will be the high water mark for United and we are targeting an annual nonfuel CASM increase lower than inflation for the foreseeable future.", "Running a reliable operation is fundamental to our company-wide cost reduction efforts. In the fourth quarter, our productivity will improve year-over-year. We're investing in tools that will make our co-workers more efficient and provide self-service capabilities to our customers. These investments, among other initiatives, will enable us to further increase our productivity over time and allow our co-workers to provide even better customer service. With better reliability and customer service, we are experiencing lower call volumes to our reservation and service centers, and issuing fewer travel vouchers than last year. Beginning with the November schedule, we've reduced scheduled block times and plan to continue to schedule the airline in a more efficient manner next year.", "Importantly, though, our commitment to lowering our costs goes well beyond returning to prior levels of efficiency. This summer, we embarked on a comprehensive company-wide effort to improve the efficiency and quality of everything we do. Improving our fuel efficiency is a top priority and we continue to demonstrate progress in this area. Our third quarter capacity declined 1.1% year-over-year, but our fuel consumption declined 2%. The incremental 1% improvement in fuel efficiency is primarily due to replacing older aircraft with highly efficient new Boeing 737-900ERs and 787 Dreamliners, and we expect this trend to continue as we further improve the efficiency of our fleet.", "In September, we reached joint tentative agreements for the work groups represented by the IAM, and these agreements are currently up for a ratification vote with the membership. Earlier this year, we offered eligible employees in those workgroups an Early Out program, contingent upon ratification of the joint collective bargaining agreements. More than 1,000 employees have expressed interest in the Early Out programs and if the tentative agreements are ratified, we will begin the separation process for those eligible employees who choose to be part of the program.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect between $730 million and $750 million of gross capital expenditures. During the quarter, we plan to take delivery of 6 new fuel-efficient Boeing 737-900ERs and 1 Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and we expect to retire 12 domestic 757-200s. We expect to end the year with 693 mainline aircraft, 9 less than last year. We make our fleet replacement decisions with the goal of maximizing return on invested capital over the life of the asset. In the case of the 737-900ER and the 787, these are great additions to our fleet that help deliver better returns.", "In the third quarter, we continued to install slimline seats and global Wi-Fi on our Airbus fleet. This is part of an initiative to refurbish the interiors of that fleet and improve its profitability. This investment significantly improves the onboard experience for our customers and, at the same time, results in a better return for our shareholders as we defer capital investment. By investing a modest amount of capital in this fleet, we will be able to fly these aircraft years longer than we originally intended.", "We ended the quarter with $6.7 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our $1 billion undrawn revolving credit facility. We made $253 million of debt and capital lease payments in the third quarter. As we continue to pay down debt, our pool of unencumbered assets continues to grow. As of the third quarter, we had approximately $5 billion of unencumbered assets, which includes more than 90 unencumbered aircraft. We expect to make approximately $250 million in debt and capital lease payments in the fourth quarter, bringing our total debt and capital lease payments this year to $2.3 billion.", "Our maturity profile for the next 4 years is much lower than the last 4 years, with an average of $1.2 billion in annual scheduled debt and capital lease payments. This reflects the significant progress we've made in improving our balance sheet and reducing our outstanding debt and, as a result, decreasing the financial risk in the business.", "We've made progress in improving our financial stability this year, but our financial results do not reflect our full potential. We're committed to expanding our margins each year through both revenue improvements and cost reduction. Our goal is to create economic value each and every year, and the foundation we've laid over the last year positions us well to achieve these goals and push them higher over time. We expect more from ourselves than the financial results we are reporting today and are taking aggressive actions to address the factors that contributed to our financial underperformance. I am confident that we will be able to deliver financial results that provide a better return for our shareholders, a better career for our employees and a better overall product and experience for our customers.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, John. Our operations, our customer service, our product, our technology, our network and our culture have all clearly improved in 2013, and I'm proud of our team's work to create the airline we are today. We are, however, underperforming financially. We know it and we are fixing it. I look forward to reporting to you on our progress and continuing improvement in the quarters and years to come.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Sarah to open up the call for questions.", "Sarah Murphy", "Thank you, Jeff. First we'll take questions from the analyst community, then we'll take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] From Deutsche Bank, we have Mike Linenberg online.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a couple questions here. John, I just want to go back just to the commentary you mentioned about the margins in the fourth quarter. So I think you indicated that your pretax margin would be better in the fourth quarter year-over-year. Did you mention -- did you say the same about the operating margin?", "John D. Rainey", "We've made no comment on the operating margin, but there's not a lot of noise in the non-op area. We gave guidance with respect to what we would expect the mark-to-market hedges to be as of -- the fuel curve as of October 17. So there shouldn't be a disproportionate relationship between the 2.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just the -- I guess, maybe as a clarification on the improvement in the pretax margin, can you give us a sense, I mean, are we -- when we say improvement, are we talking about 10 basis points here or something that would suggest that things are definitely moving in the right direction, something maybe more material?", "John D. Rainey", "Mike, if you took the midpoint of our guidance, along with Jim's commentary on revenue, that would guide you to something close to breakeven. Obviously, we'd like to see better financial results than that, and we're not letting off the accelerator here. We think that there's opportunity to improve both in the fourth quarter, as well as going into next year. And we're quite optimistic about where we're headed. This is disappointing, in the sense that this quarter we think we should be doing better than what we've reported, but we've got a lot of things identified that we're very encouraged about and confident that we can deliver as well.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, very good. And then just jumping over, just a quick one on labor, maybe this is to Jeff, on the pilots. So we have the seniority integration list done, how quickly will we see the mixing and matching of the pilots across the fleet? And then the IAM vote, when is that taking place? What's the time frame?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Sure. I think you'll see, fairly quickly, the mixing and matching. Recognize that we're not going to do a flush bid. What will happen is as vacancies on different pieces of equipment open, then the integrated seniority list takes over from there in terms of pilots from each former subsidiary bidding into those aircraft. So that takes some degree of time, but that's already occurring and it will begin to occur in November. The -- in terms of the vote, the vote for the IAM will be concluded by the end of this month.", "Operator", "From Cowen Securities, we have Helane Becker online.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division", "Just on the revenue improvements that you're going to strive for over the next, say, year or so, who takes ownership of that?", "James E. Compton", "Helane, this is Jim. I take ownership of that. And as I mentioned in my comments, disappointed in our results, but I am -- as soon as we understood the contributing factor, we took that swift action to adjust the forecast going forward. And I described the 2 recalibrations that -- one that we've already accomplished and the second one that -- coming in November, that will take the seasonality more into this year and have recent trends drive the forecast, versus relying on past-year experience.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then just can you say -- you said, I think, 1 or 1.5 points due to last year. Did you say whether it was due to Sandy? I mean, due to the shutdown, right? 1.5 points in unit revenue or something? Could you say what the impact on unit revenue in the quarter is going to be as a result of the hurricane? Because I think you're probably impacted more than some of your peer group.", "James E. Compton", "Helane, so in terms -- just for clarification, the 1.5 points was due to the government shutdown, that affects the October results that I guided to. Hurricane Sandy was approximately 1 point of RASM impact in terms of the hurricane.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "So you guys talked about the suboptimal demand and the yield curve and fleets, but what I didn't really hear, other than the 747 example at SFO, was how do we know if you guys have the right capacity in the right markets? Should we expect to see material shifts in your capacity between hubs? And can you firmly say that all of the hubs that you operate as hubs right now deserve to be hubs?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Hunter, this is Jeff, let me take that question. Every hub has to earn its right to be a hub every day. And that's all I will comment on that.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. So as you talk about closing the margin gap to the industry, can you help me -- I know you gave us some color in terms of CASM inflating at a rate less than inflation. I'm assuming that's about 2%. But can you help me understand how much, on a scale -- on a percentage basis to 100, how much of the margin gap closure next year is going to come from revenue and how much is going to come from costs?", "John D. Rainey", "Hunter, this is John, I'll take that. I think there is an equal opportunity for both. In addition to the aggressive efforts that Jim is leading up on the revenue side, we've got a significant opportunity on the cost side, and we're going to be rolling out at our Investor Day next month a lot more specificity with respect to what those efforts are. But we talked about, all year long, that we can be much more efficient than what we're doing. And I'll give you an example. We're beginning some efforts to implement lean initiatives in many of the operational aspects of our business. And right now, we're piloting a program in Newark, where we're looking at the ticket counter, as well as the bag areas, in terms of how we can run what is a lean operation. And that's something that you can't do across the board all at once. We'll do this in certain areas, learn from our mistakes and what we can improve upon, and then roll it out to other areas. But this is an example of something that we can do to be much more efficient with respect to our cost structure.", "Operator", "From Barclays, we have David Fintzen online.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Maybe one for Jim. I just want to get sort of some added color on some of the demand forecasting commentary. I mean, obviously, we've -- Delta had sort of similar problems in the sense that they -- earlier in the year, I think they were holding out for too much inventory and it didn't happen, and they kind of solved that problem and unwound it in a couple of months and it didn't really have this kind of long-lasting or dramatic impact. So I'm -- what I'm not hearing is sort of some structural issues. I mean, it sounds like a lot of tactics to fix these revenue problems. But if I look at a market like Newark, is it just revenue management that kind of explains some of the lagging in, say, Newark RASM? Or are there some structural initiatives that we should be thinking about that roll out into next year that start to address some of these issues in some of these hotspots?", "James E. Compton", "Hey, David, this is Jim. Now here's how I would think about it or how I think about it. If you took our September PRASM, we underperformed the industry by about 4.5 points. And we also said in our traffic release in September, the results reduced by more than 1 point as we adjusted our estimated yields on certain interline tickets from prior periods. So the remaining gap that -- as it relates to September, was due to the competitive capacity between the U.S. and China and from competitive capacity in the U.S. domestic, particularly in transcon, to your point on Newark, as we've seen the capacity growth, particularly in the LAX-to-Newark and San Francisco-Newark, with the increasing capacity brought in by Virgin America and the lower fares and our capacity to match the demand to that lower fares. So if we kind of -- if you step outside the interline yield adjustment, the early estimates are somewhat weighted between the China capacity and what I'm talking about, the domestic capacity and the forecast.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And the way I think about it, when we go -- so when we take a step back and go sort of prior to September, if we go back and look at some of your summer performance, is that more indicative of the kind of performance we should -- relative RASM performance, we should be seeing as we -- as you get past some of these -- some of the revenue management issues? I mean, I guess, China sounds like it's going to linger for longer. I'm just -- I'm trying to sort of weigh sort of tactics versus sort of structural issues here.", "James E. Compton", "Yes. I mean -- so we think there may have been modest impact to the summer, prior to -- with the revenue management impact that I'm talking about. But we clearly saw it accelerating in September and made swift actions to adjust for that. We have a really strong network with really key hubs and we have a lot of opportunities to leverage the hubs going forward that we're not capturing today or in the past summer. So what we're focused on here in United is correcting for the challenge we have due to the demand forecast that I talked about, and then continuing to build on the assets that we have, particularly in our key hubs. Examples of that are our recent announcement in San Francisco, for San Francisco to Chengdu, on the 787. We're going to continue to work with our JV partners. If you remember, last year, working with our partner, ANA, we reduced our flying between Narita and Taipei. And this spring, we'll start San Francisco to Taipei. The point being, we have all kinds of examples where we have a lot of opportunity to leverage the network that we have out there and build on our key hubs that we have. So we're disappointed in our performance. We're quickly adjusting for it and we obviously think we're going to build on the steady state that we've seen this past summer.", "John D. Rainey", "Hey, David, I just want to add to Jim's comments, to his point. Yes, I think people tend to focus a lot on year-over-year results and, particularly, we've seen the -- a little bit of softness in the year-over-year results with -- as it relates to the Pacific. But that continues to be a terrific part of our network. We love our footprint there. And the example that Jim talked about, about expanding to Chengdu from San Francisco, is another way that we'll continue to benefit going forward there.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have John Godyn online.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jeff, I remember, a few years ago, you made headlines by not taking a salary or bonus until Continental made a profit, which, at the time, was really a big deal. As we look into 2014 and all the goals that we're hearing about today and, I guess, what we're likely to hear about at the Investor Day, what's on the line for you and the team? And how can we have confidence that we're really turning a corner here and we're going to hit these targets?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Well, we have a lot of confidence, John, in what we're going to be able to deliver in 2014 and beyond. And I'm personally really excited about what we can do. We have -- we, as the management team, obviously have a lot on the line because our incentives are performance-based. And those are important to us to hit those targets going forward. And trust me, we've got plenty on the line, and my own stock ownership, I think, has demonstrated that, and my own stock purchases have demonstrated that. I'm a big believer in the future of this company.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And we've heard sort of some incremental kind of ideas for improvement today. Of course, I can imagine that you wouldn't want to steal the thunder from the Investor Day, but when I think about other airlines that have had some hiccups in the past, Southwest, at a time, announced kind of like a $1 billion revenue program. Delta announced, at a time, a $1 billion cost structure improvement program. It seems like $1 billion is the number everybody wants. Should we expect kind of a large program? Is that the way that you guys kind of look at the challenges in front of you, that there is a very large gap here that really needs some structural change? Or is it going to be a combination of these kind of incremental opportunities?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Well, John, look, we have, clearly, some very good revenue opportunities ahead of us, and Jim's been talking about that. There is no question that our costs are too high. And we have significant opportunities to run a quality operation with quality customer service and be far more efficient than we are today. And I'll have -- I'll ask John to talk about our sort of internal project on getting our costs more competitive.", "John D. Rainey", "John, you're exactly right. And I appreciate that when carriers throw out a lot of these big numbers, that there's a tendency for one to roll their eyes at it and they want to see it in the results. And what we've elected to do is wait to disclose that until we can provide you an opportunity to give you some specificity and transparency into what those initiatives are, so that there's not that jaundiced view of what that number is. But you're right, it's a significant number, it's in the billion-dollar range, and we think that we have that kind of opportunity on the cost side going forward.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Jeff, one area of differentiation that I think may explain some of United's return metrics is your philosophy on aircraft, notably, your preference to pay up for the newest and the most fuel-efficient and to reap the operating benefits down the road. But given the availability of slightly used aircraft and also end-of-life options, it's not clear to me that your aircraft CapEx plan actually maximizes return on invested capital. In fact, I don't think that it does. So I'm wondering, as you look around for ideas in addition to what we've heard today, is there any chance that you kind of might revise your thinking on fleet, your philosophy on fleet?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Let me take a piece of that and I'll turn it over to John. I think, Jamie, that, and John mentioned it, I think, in his script, we were going to retire the Airbus fleet that we have, which are 152 airplanes, and we determined that we could make an investment in slimline seats, in bigger bins, in Wi-Fi, streaming video on those airplanes, and make them not only a comfortable airplane for our customers and, actually, very, very -- a very good product, but also, because of the ability of the additional seats -- by adding additional seats through the slimline seats, which are very comfortable seats and good for the passenger, but really improve the operating economics. And we made that determination. So we do, indeed, take a look to make sure that we're confident that our aircraft decisions are [indiscernible] maximizing. But I'll turn any other comment over to John, if you want to say something.", "John D. Rainey", "Sure. Jamie, I would say that we are not necessarily philosophically opposed to buying older planes at all. In fact, there have been cases in our past where -- you might remember the 757-200s that we acquired several years ago, where it makes sense. It's really done on a fleet-by-fleet basis. If I look at like, for example, the used market for the 737-800 right now, that plane is still priced pretty high, and so we look at this individually. Jeff gave the example of the Airbus fleet, where it absolutely makes sense to keep that fleet longer and utilize it more and not replace it. The opposite of that is a good -- an example would be the 757-200s on the United side that we're replacing with 900ERs. For each one of those planes that we replace, it's an addition of about $2 million to $2.5 million to the bottom line each year. So it's not as if we've got, I think, a huge philosophical difference so much as we think that this, in many times, comes down to the actual aircraft that you're replacing. But it's important for us, and getting to the crux of your question, we want to have metered, disciplined capital replacement in a manner that allows us to eventually be able to return cash to shareholders and de-risk this business.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And for my second question, to Jim, on corporate share in New York. New York has become significantly more concentrated over the last decade, especially on my side of the river. And the facilities at LaGuardia and JFK are no longer third-world in quality. So from my perspective, both as an analyst and a passenger, this represents a structural change that's independent from any underperformance or pressures United might have been experiencing more recently. So as you think of your revenue forecast in 2014, are you modeling for share recapture here in New York? And if so, doesn't that somewhat fly in the face of the fact that, at least east of the river now, I mean, things are better and we don't need to schlep to Newark in order to get a good product the way that, clearly, we had to back in 2005.", "James E. Compton", "Hey, Jamie. Yes, I agree. It's obviously more concentrated than in the past. The way we approach it is that we are really focused on the share that we have there and maintaining that share premium, which we've done a really terrific job of doing over the course of the last couple of years. Do we think there's opportunity to grow it? Yes. I always want to put it in context, that when we think about corporate share and where we're headed in the future, we also think about it in terms of quality, right? And so our corporate programs are actually running at the highest, what I would call, efficiency rate that we've seen since the merger. In other words, when you would come up with a deal and you work with your partner and we talk about what a discount would be versus what the traffic they're going to give us, people are delivering on it. And the efficiency of those contracts are working. When they're not win-win, we actually feel we have an advantage. We have the advantage of the only true connecting hub in New York, where, that if there's lower-yielding corporate traffic that really doesn't make sense for a corporation that's not going to manage its traffic very well, we have the opportunity to always balance the flow of traffic over Newark with, for instance, higher-yield flow from Europe into the U.S., as well as using our partnership with Lufthansa. Because also in those corporate deals, what we also bring to the table that is really a JV, where we're able to work with our Lufthansa partner, Air Canada partner and so forth, and really bring in an overall deal to the corporation. So the point is, all of those aspects are really talking about quality. And yet, when we look at the numbers, we have -- we see our share premium that we have. But we're always going to -- as we think about, going forward, how do we keep those to be a quality type of corporate deal.", "Operator", "From Bank of America, we have Glenn Engel online.", "Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A couple questions. One, on the labor front, could you tell us whether there's lots of issues left or just a few big, tough issues left to get this deal done? Second question, on the revenue side. It seems like, every quarter, you have this decent-sized revenue adjustment and I don't really hear that from other carriers. So why do you seem to have these changes in retroactive payments to partner airlines that others don't have? And finally, on the yield management side. I would have thought that if you sold too many seats early, it would have had a bigger impact in the peak months when you -- the extra seats you had at the end, you could have gotten a better yield, than in September when you've got plenty of extra seats to sell. And so if you sell seats too early, it's much less of a risk, yet you seem to feel that you had a bigger impact in September from that.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Glenn, let me take the labor question and I'll ask Jim to answer the other 2. I'm not quite sure what you mean by big issues. We have the pilots done, the IAM is out for vote right now, that's 28,000 folks, pilots are 12,000 folks. The 2 big groups we have are -- left are tech ops, our maintenance folks represented by the Teamsters, and our flight attendants represented by the AFA. We're in negotiations with both of those workgroups. In any kind of negotiation, it's hard to know a specific time in which you're going to get a deal. And that's just a matter of the negotiations and timing and all kinds of things. But we're -- I think we're making good progress. I'm confident we'll reach deals, it's just very hard to know when. Now recognize that in both those cases, both of the sides from the former subsidiaries, the old Continental and the old United, they have contracts and they have new contracts, so that's not really the issue.", "John D. Rainey", "Glenn, this is John. With respect to the revenue adjustments, I'll hit that really quickly then turn it over to Jim. This issue in the last quarter was really something that related to agreements that we have with -- interline agreements we have with other partners. And, a lot of times, there's a certain type of fare that they will sell which we don't have transparency into, and we have to make an estimate about what that yield is on that ticket. And this was simply a case of our estimate was too high and we adjusted it after the fact. That said, we certainly appreciate and desire to have less volatility in some of those estimates and it's something we're striving for, going forward.", "James E. Compton", "And Glenn, this is Jim. As it relates to the impact in the past versus what we're seeing now, we obviously saw the issue -- mix change for us very quickly as we moved into September. From a revenue management perspective, you're always providing an input to the forecast. And what we have found is that the input to the forecast that was related to what we would've expected in the fourth quarter, basically, was erroneous. And so we put that input into the system, and that erroneous input drove us selling inventory earlier than we otherwise needed to, based on what would've been the close-in bookings coming into the fall. So at this point, that's where we've seen the biggest impact, and it accelerated into September. And that's the piece that we've reacted to and adjusted, based on the 2 recalibrations that I've talked about.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions]", "From Wall Street Journal, we have Susan Carey online.", "Susan Carey", "I'm just wondering, in your special charges in the latest quarter, you have $34 million due to recent potential adverse developments in certain legal matters. Could you just tell me a little bit more about what that is?", "John D. Rainey", "Yes, Susan. This is John Rainey. That is something that is related to a litigation dispute that arose back during the bankruptcy time period with United, and it's an estimate about that.", "Susan Carey", "Can you be a little bit more specific?", "John D. Rainey", "Unfortunately, I cannot on this matter, Susan.", "Operator", "From the Associated Press, we have Josh Freed online.", "Josh Freed", "You mentioned that you're working on doing faster turns and shorter taxi times and that kind of thing. Can you give more specifics on that? I mean what kinds of things are you changing to achieve those goals?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Josh, let me give you -- this is Jeff. Let me give you an example. Right now, when you have aircraft arrive at the gate, it's very important that the area be cleared, the aircraft be marshaled in promptly. You don't want to have things like something in the way or the jet bridge driver not there to meet the aircraft. There's nothing more frustrating to -- well, there are things that can frustrate passengers in various ways, but nothing that frustrates me, personally, more than when the aircraft arrives and the jet bridge driver isn't there and the jet bridge doesn't meet the aircraft within our 120-second requirement, that's our internal requirement. Well, we're doing -- we're focusing much more heavily on that because every minute counts in on-time performance, and every minute counts in making sure that you're minimizing misconnects of passengers, that you're having good utilization of your assets, that you're satisfying your customers, that you're getting them to their destinations on time or their connections on time. So we're focusing on lots of what you might view as small tactical elements. But when you put them together, that has -- they result in running a really good on-time operation, which results in not only far better customer satisfaction for your customers, but also decreases your costs. Because you have just much lower costs in terms of re-accommodating passengers, overnight accommodation for passengers, all sorts of things that -- and more maintenance touch time for the airplanes, which means you have much more reliability and schedule reliability, as well. So these are all important things to do, we're keenly focused on them. And you've seen the results in our on-time results. We have materially improved our on-time and our consistency of performance and consistency of reliability. And you also see it in our materially increased customer satisfaction scores. We're doing just a terrific job improving customer service. And you're going to see us continue to do that in the future.", "Operator", "And from Bloomberg News, we have Mary Schlangenstein online.", "Mary Schlangenstein", "I wanted to ask if you could provide any specifics on what the maintenance issues were, and the reliability issues, with the 747s?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Yes, I'll speak briefly to that. Look, the 747s were aircraft that were good solid, safe airplanes. But the old United had under-invested in what I would call preventative maintenance. That is, looking at the data and determining what things were causing maintenance issues with the aircraft fleet repetitively. And what we've been able to do is to take those aircraft and put them through a check cycle for preventative maintenance. It's fixing things before they break and predicting which things can break, which would cause an aircraft to be delayed. And recognize, when a 747 has a maintenance issue, that's typically a pretty high-profile event because there are hundreds of passengers. Typically, those aircraft are flying very long distances and they can break in foreign destinations, so it's really important to have reliability. So what we did with those airplanes is we concentrated them all in San Francisco, where we have terrific technicians and have really, really a solid maintenance base there. And that permitted us to not only put them through the preventative maintenance, but to have lots of technicians there to assist us, to have lots of parts there and to make sure we had good swap opportunities as well. Now that clearly was not revenue-maximizing in the long term, but in the short term, it was important for us to return those aircraft to reliability. We've done that now and we have the confidence in those aircraft today to start flying them where they really want to fly, for example, out of Chicago, versus necessarily all concentrating in San Francisco. We're also, Mary, investing in those aircraft. Those are aircraft -- in fact, we've got a prototype streaming-video aircraft up and running right now. We're putting power throughout that aircraft and streaming video and global Wi-Fi. This is going to be a terrific product for our customers when we're done with it. So we're excited about what we've been able to do with the 747. And it's really important for us, from a maintenance reliability and, certainly, from a customer-satisfaction perspective.", "Sarah Murphy", "Okay. We're out of time now, so we'll conclude.

Today, we reported a full year profit of $1.1 billion, an 84% improvement year-over-year, or $2.84 per diluted share.", "At the beginning of 2013, we outlined 3 goals for United: run a reliable airline, improve our customer service and achieve our return on invested capital goal of 10%. We achieved all 3 goals for 2013 and I'd like to thank our employees for working together to make that happen. We ran a reliable operation in 2013. We improved our on-time performance year-over-year in every quarter and achieved top-tier on-time performance among our peers in the fourth quarter. Our entire team worked together to minimize the customer impact of the severe winter weather we experienced in December and again this month.", "We made tremendous progress on our customer service in 2013, including improving our customer satisfaction scores significantly. We continued to invest in our onboard product as well, outfitting our aircraft with the best seating options for our customers. We now have more than 35,000 Economy Plus seats installed in our airplanes and offer flat-bed seats on every long-haul international aircraft. We also began installing lighter-weight next-generation slimline economy seats on a number of our narrow-body and regional aircraft, providing a good product for our customers while improving our operating economics.", "In addition to improving our seating options, we've also installed Wi-Fi on nearly 170 aircraft, added larger bins and refreshed the interiors on the majority of our 152 Airbus aircraft and installed in-seat power on more than half of our mainline fleet. We completely retrofitted the interiors of all of our p.s. aircraft, which fly between New York's Kennedy Airport and our hubs in San Francisco and Los Angeles.", "We also recently launched our in-flight streaming video product, which will allow our customers to view a variety of on-demand entertainment options on their own devices.", "We made a number of improvements at our airports as well. This year, we opened a new terminal at our hub in Houston, made significant enhancements to our hub in Newark and unveiled 3 new modern United clubs. We also began piloting new self-service technology, such as self-bag tagging and self-boarding gates and will roll out more of this efficient customer-pleasing technology this year.", "During the second half of 2013, we released the first phase of our enhanced digital channels. We introduced new airport kiosk software that improves customer functionality and our ancillary revenue sales opportunities and launched an entirely new version of our industry-leading mobile app on iOS and Windows platforms. Customer feedback on our new app has been fantastic, and we'll roll out our new app on the Android platform this spring. We'll also be releasing our new united.com in phases this year.", "For the 10th consecutive year, our MileagePlus program was named the Best Frequent-Flyer Program in the world by readers of Global Traveler. We're moving further down the path of aligning our loyalty program rewards with customer value.

Our members can now track their Premier qualifying dollars on united.com and our new mobile app.", "In 2013, we invested in our employees, enhancing the tools they use to do their jobs such as Arrow [ph], the new intuitive front end of our airport system and provided new customer service training to more than 45,000 of our frontline employees.", "Our customers are noticing the improvements we're making in our operations, product and service.

By working together, our team met our 10% return on invested capital goal for 2013.", "2013 proved to be a pivotal year as we moved past integration and focused on building a strong foundation on which to grow. With the accomplishments of 2013 behind us, we've raised our goals for the quality of service we provide and the level of efficiency throughout our business for 2014 and beyond.", "This year, we'll build on our employee service skills with our next phase of customer service training and new measurements of our service consistency. We will continue to install satellite-based Wi-Fi on our mainline aircraft at a rate of 1 aircraft per day. We'll also continue installation of our onboard streaming video on mainline aircraft that don't have seat-back in-flight entertainment.", "Our customers will see the results of more investments at our airports this year as well. Tomorrow, we'll celebrate the opening of our ultra-modern Boarding Area E at our powerhouse West Coast hub in San Francisco. And later this month, we'll open a new global services lobby at Newark. In the second quarter, we'll move into our brand-new concourse B in Boston and the new terminal 2 at London Heathrow. Our customers will enjoy new United clubs in both Boston and London, and we'll continue to renovate other lounges across our global network as well.", "We are also installing power poles or power bars in the gate areas at all of our domestic hubs this year as so many of our passengers are now traveling with personal devices that they like to charge up before or between flights. Later this year, we'll begin a major multiyear renovation at our Los Angeles terminals which will improve our customers' experience and make our operations more efficient.", "We'll further improve our fleet by introducing 63 new highly efficient and customer-pleasing mainline and regional aircraft this year. These new aircraft will not only improve our customers' onboard experience and our reliability, but will also improve our fuel efficiency and, in turn, our bottom line.", "We are also going to improve the quality of our processes and procedures with the goal of making United much more efficient. Now that we have solid operational performance and improving customer service, we're taking a careful look at each aspect of our business to improve the quality and efficiency of everything that we do. To that end, we've launched an internal program called project quality to identify and implement leading techniques and continuously improve the processes throughout our operations and management functions. As we outlined at our Investor Day last November, our goal is to reduce our annual cost by $2 billion and generate at least $700 million of additional annual ancillary revenue within 4 years and the dedicated project quality team will lead that multiyear effort.", "In 2013, we worked hard to give our customers a reliable and flyer-friendly travel experience and to improve our financial results. This year, we'll continue to focus on operations, with the goal to be top tier in reliability. We will focus on deepening the level of customer satisfaction and aim to improve our customers' experience on United at every stage of their travel.", "Finally, we'll continue to focus on expanding our earnings materially and exceeding a 10% return on invested capital. We have a lot of work ahead of us to deliver the financial results we are capable of, but I'm confident that we have the plans, the people and the focus to reach our long-term potential.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim and John to go through our full year and fourth quarter results in greater detail and the plans we have in place to grow our earnings in 2014.", "James E. Compton", "Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to take a moment and thank our employees for all they did to improve United's performance in 2013. We ran a good operation and delivered better customer service, both of which are critical for our customers and for our success. At United, we strive to be flyer-friendly by running a reliable operation and giving great customer service.", "I'd also like to recognize the men and women on the front line, who managed through the extreme winter weather earlier this month. The storms and subzero temperatures that began on January 1 and lasted 7 days were among the worst weather events in our history and resulted in more than 6,300 canceled flights. Thank you for taking care of and re-accommodating our customers and taking care of each other during a very tough operational period.", "2013 was a foundational year for United, and we made solid improvements in our operations and revenue results. We invested in our people, operations, customer service, technology, product and network. This year, we will continue to invest and we will further leverage our existing assets to improve the quality of our airline. We are already seeing early returns from many of our investments, but we have much more work to do to reach our full potential.", "We ran a consistently reliable operation in 2013. We exceeded our goals for on-time performance in 6 months of the year. Our fourth quarter mainline on-time performance was 80.6%, which was top-tier among our peers. We recognized our employees' great work with $19 million in on-time incentive payouts for the 4th quarter and $54 million for the full year. We are also improving our customers' experience by reducing controllable delays and cancellations. For example, in the fourth quarter, we reduced maintenance cancellations by 14% year-over-year.", "In 2014, we are focused on running a highly reliable, yet much more efficient operation. Our goal is to deliver top-tier reliability for our customers, while improving the processes and procedures that we used throughout our operations. We are modernizing airport infrastructure to better accommodate today's traveler, enhancing the tools our employees use and, more appropriately, matching staffing with workload throughout the operation.", "For the full year, our consolidated capacity declined 1.4% year-over-year. 2013 was the third year in a row where we reduced capacity. Let me assure you that we will continue to be disciplined in how and where we deploy capacity. Over the next 4 years, we expect our consolidated capacity to grow less than GDP. In 2014, we expect our capacity to increase between 1% and 2% year-over-year. And this new capacity will be highly efficient. Our modest capacity growth will come from replacing older aircraft with new, fuel-efficient and larger gauge aircraft and by adding slimmer, next-generation economy seats.", "Our global network breadth will grow as we add new service in 2014, making United even more flyer-friendly. We will enhance our leading route network in 2014 by adding nonstop service on international long-haul routes such as San Francisco to Chengdu and Taipei, Houston to Munich, Chicago to Edinburgh and Washington to Madrid.", "San Francisco is the continent's premier West Coast gateway to Asia. This year, we will serve 8 Asian destinations nonstop and provide one-stop connectivity from over 80 cities to Asia.", "Our new Boarding Area E in San Francisco will be customer-friendly in every sense of the word. It will offer an up-close view of the airfield and the Bay Area from a 23 foot-high window wall, state-of-the-art workstations, healthy and local food offerings and enhanced seating options.", "Our 2 new nonstop flights from San Francisco to Chengdu and Taipei are good examples of the second phase of our Pacific network strategy. First, we built the best trans-Pacific network by flying to the most cities in Asia with the most nonstop flights of any U.S. carrier. We've launched those nonstop flights out of business-centric hubs like San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Washington, D.C. Now we are beginning to introduce nonstop service to secondary cities in Asia, making travel even more convenient for our business and leisure customers alike.", "We expect first quarter 2014 consolidated capacity will increase between 0.3% and 1.3%. The severe weather -- the severe winter storms in January reduced first quarter capacity by approximately 0.6 points, and this impact is included in our current guidance.", "It is important to note that this year, the industry will face operational challenges due to FAR 117 and the new 1,500-minimum-flight-hour rule for new pilots. FAR 117 is the FAA's new regulation regarding flight time and duty rules for pilots. This new regulation decreases the utilization of pilots and hour flexibility in managing irregular operations.", "Our flight operations and network operations teams are working together to reduce the potential impact on our customers by adding buffer to crew schedules, enhancing tools to monitor schedules and hiring additional pilots. We expect that the combination of these new regulations will have a disproportionately greater impact on our regional partners, as mainline carriers hire regional carrier pilots due to the decreased productivity required by FAR 117. We are working to adjust our planned schedules to compensate.", "Shifting to our revenue results. Our fourth quarter consolidated PRASM increased 3.2% year-over-year. Our revenue results improved throughout the quarter, particularly as we captured strong traffic and generated high yields during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday periods. Part of this strong performance is due to flexing our capacity up more than 20% on the peak days during these holiday periods and flexing down our capacity more than 40% on the off-peak days. We also coordinate closely with our joint venture partners on holiday schedules, providing more options for our customers while producing a better financial outcome for the JV.", "Corporate revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter, continuing our 2013 trend of steady year-over-year improvements. As I explained on our last earnings call, during the fourth quarter, we implemented 2 significant recalibrations to our demand forecast. These adjustments were made to shift the booking curve towards more close-in bookings and improve the yield mix. We are starting to see the intended results from our actions and expect our yield mix improvements to accelerate through the first half of the year.", "We currently expect first quarter consolidated PRASM to be between flat and up 2% year-over-year. This includes a 0.4 point negative PRASM impact due to lost revenue from the severe storms in early January and approximately 1 point negative PRASM impact due to Easter shifting into April this year.", "Ancillary revenue continued its strong growth in the fourth quarter, increasing 18% year-over-year, led by Economy Plus sales, which increased 31%. On a per-seat basis, Economy Plus revenue increased 36% as we leveraged our pricing tools to better adjust our pricing based on the demand forecast. At our Investor Day in November, we outlined a goal of exceeding $3.5 billion in annual ancillary revenue by 2017. We're positioned well to achieve this goal as we generated $2.8 billion from ancillary revenue in 2013 and expect to grow this by approximately 8% in 2014.", "We also fine-tuned our ability to provide our customers with an ancillary product offers most relevant to them based on factors such as customer and trip attributes. We saw increased ticket penetration through our direct digital channels in the fourth quarter, in part due to the enhanced functionality introduced throughout 2013. We've received excellent customer feedback on our new app and it is already having a positive impact on ancillary revenue. Ancillary sales via the app nearly doubled in the fourth quarter versus 2012. We're excited to roll out the first phase of our new website in the second quarter, which will provide improved ancillary opportunities, a better customer experience and lower distribution cost.", "We are also increasing our customers' access to ancillary products by distributing the content in the channel where some of our most valuable customers shop. We expect to begin offering our Economy Plus product through all 3 major GDS providers in the first half of 2014. This will allow our travel management company partners to fulfill Economy Plus transactions through their normal processes. Importantly, we'll be able to utilize the same dynamic pricing and offer the same rich information through the GDS providers as we do on united.com.", "We made good progress in 2013 and ended the year stronger. We have now shifted our focus to being an even more flyer-friendly airline for our customers in 2014 and beyond. United has an unmatched portfolio of assets, great employees, an unrivaled global network, an excellent fleet of aircraft and a customer-pleasing product offering. This year, we are excited by our opportunities to leverage these superb assets to satisfy our customers, drive efficiencies in our operation and improve the quality of our revenue results. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John D. Rainey", "Thanks, Jim. I also want to thank our employees for their great work in 2013. Due to their efforts, we made substantial improvements in our operational reliability and service that we deliver for our customers.", "Today, we reported $1.1 billion of net income for 2013, generating a pretax margin of 2.8% for the year and a return on invested capital of 10%. We made significant progress in 2013 in building the foundation for sustainable profits in excess of our cost of capital. We invested further in our people, product, technology and fleet. We strengthened our balance sheet and we laid the groundwork to become much more efficient in 2014 and beyond.", "For the fourth quarter and full year 2013, our consolidated operating expenses increased 2.3% and 2%, respectively. Fourth quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, increased only 0.6% year-over-year. For the full year 2013, our consolidated CASM, again, excluding fuel and third party business experience and profit-sharing, increased 6.3% year-over-year on 1.4% lower capacity. In each successive quarter in 2013, we slowed our year-over-year nonfuel CASM growth, an early sign of a cost discipline we're instilling throughout the business.", "For the full year, our operating margin increased by 1 percentage point to 4.6% in 2013. Our fourth quarter operating margin improved by more than 4.5 points year-over-year to 4.3%, marking our best fourth quarter operating margin since 2010. While we made meaningful strides in performance as the year progressed, we are not yet even close to where we want to be. Our team is committed to increasing returns and reducing cost for the long term. As Jeff mentioned, we are focused on improving the efficiency and quality of everything we do through project quality. This effort is designed to make fundamental, permanent changes to the way we do business.", "At our Investor Day in November, we outlined our plans to create sustainable long-term value for our investors while providing a great experience for our customers. In addition to the improvements we expect in passenger and ancillary revenue, we are implementing a $2 billion annual cost-saving initiative. These savings are comprised of $1 billion in annual fuel savings and $1 billion in annual nonfuel cost savings that we expect to achieve over the next 4 years.", "We will make meaningful progress in this initiative in 2014, particularly in the areas of productivity, maintenance and fuel consumption. We expect productivity to improve approximately 3.5% in 2014 through improved tools for customers and employees, reduced overtime and modifying layouts and processes at our airports, among other initiatives.", "In addition to achieving greater operational efficiency, in 2014, we also expect to have a cost tailwind related to pension and postretirement benefits. As interest rates have risen, we expect the discount rate used to calculate our liability to increase. We also modified these programs in the last year, which when combined with the increase in the discount rate and an updated experience study related to planned participation and retirement rates will reduce the expense associated with these 2 liabilities by over $100 million in 2014.", "The actions we are taking to become more efficient and reduce our costs, combined with the impact of lower discount rates, will help offset some of the other inflationary pressures we face in 2014 such as escalations in labor contracts, increases in airport rents and landing fees and higher engine overhaul volumes.", "We expect CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit-sharing to increase between 3.5% and 4.5% for the first quarter and between 1% and 2% for the full year.", "The investments we're making in our fleet, product and technology are critical to achieving the cost savings we'd outlined and the returns our shareholders and management team expect. In 2013, we took delivery of 26 new highly efficient and customer-pleasing aircraft, consisting of 24 737-900ERs and 2 787 Dreamliners. We also retired 36 older, less-efficient aircraft in 2013.", "We ended 2013 with 693 mainline aircrafts, 9 fewer than we started the year with. And over the long term, we intend to keep our mainline fleet size roughly flat at about 700 aircraft. To that end, in 2014, we expect to take delivery of 36 mainline aircraft, consisting of 30 737-900ERs and 6 787 Dreamliners, 2 of which will be the dash 9s.", "We also expect to introduce 27 Embraer 175 regional aircraft. These 76-seat aircraft are far more fuel-efficient and provide a superior customer experience and ancillary revenue opportunity versus the 50-seat aircraft they'll be replacing.", "We will also begin installing Split Scimitar Winglets on our 737-800 and 737-900ER aircraft in 2014, which will reduce fuel consumption by approximately 2% more on those aircraft.", "By replacing older, less-efficient aircraft with more fuel-efficient planes, installing winglets and implementing operational initiatives to reduce fuel consumption, we expect our fuel efficiency to improve by approximately 1.5% in 2014. At today's prices, that equates to approximately $200 million in annual cost savings.", "For 2014, we expect between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion of gross capital expenditures, including purchase deposits. In addition to new aircraft, which I mentioned earlier, much of the remaining 2014 capital spend is technology and customer-facing product investments. These investments will enable many of the efficiency improvements we've outlined, as well as provide a better experience for our customers.", "In 2013, we made substantial progress improving our balance sheet, with $2.3 billion of debt and capital lease payments, of which approximately $400 million represented prepayments of debt maturing beyond 2013. Additionally, we redeemed approximately $240 million of convertible debt and ended the year with $6.1 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our $1 billion undrawn revolver.", "We took a number of actions in 2013 to strengthen our balance sheet. We issued 2 tranches of unsecured debt, $300 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2018 with an interest rate of 6 3/8% and $300 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2020, with an interest rate of 6%. Importantly, these benchmark transactions will allow us to opportunistically pay off higher coupon instruments such as the $400 million of 8% unsecured notes due in 2024, which we prepaid earlier this month. We continue to make good progress on our goal of reducing non-aircraft-related debt and using our balance sheet to efficiently fund investment in our business.", "In addition to paying off the 8% notes, earlier this month we called for redemption of the remaining $156 million of the UAL 4.5% convertible notes due in 2021.", "Our balance sheet improvements resulted in our 2013 interest expense declining by $52 million year-over-year. Excluding non-cash mark-to-market fuel gains and losses, we expect full year 2014 nonoperating expense of approximately $700 million.", "Lastly, we continue to face headwinds from Washington increasing taxes and fees on air travel. Recently, Congress more than doubled the TSA security fee. For United alone, the net annual run rate impact from this increase is over $100 million. To make matters worse, a significant portion of the security fee increase will be used to pay for deficit-reduction rather than aviation security. There are now 16 different taxes and fees on air travel, representing a tax of approximately 21% on a typical domestic round-trip ticket, a rate that is higher than tobacco and alcohol, items which are taxed to discourage consumption.", "Our government should not be discouraging air travel as it's a powerful economic engine that accounts for 5% of this country's GDP. Instead of increasing our federal tax burden, Washington should recognize the need for a national airline policy that promotes a successful U.S. airline industry and helps grow jobs in our nation's economy. Our industry is taking a number of substantive, self-help measures to fix itself, increase taxes and fees from our government and a lack of coherent national airline policy represent one of the most significant threats to the long-term success of this industry.", "Despite the actions of Washington, we at United are eager to demonstrate our continued progress in 2014. Our financial priorities for 2014 are clear: significantly improve our efficiency, expand earnings and return on invested capital, make high return yet disciplined capital investments and further improve our balance sheet to reduce the risk in our business. We have a lot of work to do to achieve these results, but I'm confident that we have the right plan, the right people and the unwavering dedication to deliver for our employees, our customers and our investors.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "While I'm pleased with our accomplishments in 2013, I and my management team are far from satisfied. We know that we can produce better operational and customer service results and far better financial results from the terrific people and assets at United. And we're very excited about 2014 and beyond. Our goal is to make United employee-friendly by being a great place to work, customer-friendly by offering top-tier reliability, a competitive product and consistently strong customer service and investor-friendly by delivering improved financial results. We are dedicated to doing just that.", "I'll now turn it over to Sarah to open up the call for questions.", "Sarah Murphy", "Thank you, Jeff. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask their question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "John, question for you. So you got about $3 billion of CapEx scheduled, you got about $1.5 billion sized in debt maturities. That's $4.5 billion right there between the 2 of cash obligation. How much of that $4.5 billion -- you can talk directionally if you want. How much of that $4.5 billion is going to come from cash from operations or cash on hand versus new debt you're going to raise?", "John D. Rainey", "Hunter, we're optimistic about 2014 in what we can do in terms of operating cash flow. We've -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we issued 2 unsecured notes last year, each of $300 million, which in part are intended to provide a little bit more liquidity as we look at some of the refinancing opportunities that we have in the back half of the year and, specifically, I'm referring to the $800 million of notes that we can prepay beginning this September. And with respect to CapEx, the guidance that we've given of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion certainly puts pressure on free cash flow. But I want to emphasize that those are the right investments for our business. Those investments are going to enable us to achieve the returns that we expect over time.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Sure. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is there a scenario that you might possibly not raise debt this year?", "John D. Rainey", "Yes, there is a scenario, absolutely.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Great.", "John D. Rainey", "Hunter, other than aircraft debt.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. A question on the JV. You guys have a revenue share, Delta has a P&L share. I'm talking specifically on the trans-Atlantic A++. Lufthansa runs A380s on that route and I think that's a big CASM tailwind that they get but it's probably dilutive to yields because it's such a big plane. So I guess it's a 2-part question. One, has there been some talk of maybe down-gauging some of the A380s on Lufthansa's side? And, two, is there a possibility that you guys may shift to a full-scale P&L share as opposed just revenue share to maybe capture some of those unit cost savings from the 380s that they're running?", "James E. Compton", "Hunter, this is Jim. A couple of points. One is without specifically I will tell you that the network teams from both sides clearly talked in great detail about capacity and what's best for the JV, as well as delivering a great product for our customers. And I'll use an example of the holiday period, which is a great example, where, in the past, you might find both carriers canceling on the same day and then you look up and the next day both carriers are flying. Well, this year, with that coordination, what you do you is you work with each other to make sure that one cancels on one day, one flies and the other one -- and vice versa, all delivering a great product and things like that. So that's just an example that says how detail a level of conversations and how we manage that capacity and understanding what our partners' needs are and the challenges that they face as they try to place capacity around their network. As it relate, again, the second phase is that we're always working with our JV partners about how to improve the JV. And so, we, right now, think the revenue share model is the one that works for us. We actually think that within that we have a lot of work to do to again make the product much more transparent to our customers and drive results on that. So we're comfortable with where we're at. That being said, we're always discussing kind of what's the JV look like in the future.", "Operator", "From Evercore, we have Duane Pfennigwerth on line.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just in terms of your stronger margin improvement in the fourth quarter, of that 4 points, how much would you say is a result of nonrecurring accounting true ups and can you talk about was there any region in particular that drove that acceleration in margin improvement?", "John D. Rainey", "Duane, this is John. Very little of what I attribute to nonrecurring items within the quarter. There's obviously some lumpiness from one month to the next. But we're really pleased with how it closed out the year. We had -- we're pushing hard internally to achieve some of the goals and we had broad support from all the divisions. And I think it's an early indication of what we expect for 2014 and why we're pretty optimistic looking into the year. And as far as regional strength, Jim might want to chime in, domestic continues to be a pretty good balance between supply and demand as that was stronger, particularly in December. But other than that, nothing really stands out.", "James E. Compton", "Duane, I would add just a little detail. The team did an amazing job of managing the holiday period, both from a capacity side, as well as managing the yield and the mix. So just a terrific job that exceeded our expectations on the top line.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And then just a little detail. I may have missed it in the release. What was operating cash flow in the quarter?", "John D. Rainey", "Operating cash flow -- I don't have that. Let's see, it was -- for the fourth quarter, it was negative 3 34.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg on line.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just 2 here. On the pension piece, John, you talked about how the expense, you have a bit of a tailwind. At your Investor Day, I think at the end of the third quarter, the liability was $1.8 billion. Where was that liability at year end? How did that settle off?", "John D. Rainey", "Just our pension? It was around $4 billion of the -- just the liability. Obviously that's offset by the plan assets. So the net liability was a little more than $1.5 billion.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Nice, a few more hundred million of improvement from the third quarter.", "John D. Rainey", "Right. I'll just add that we also saw a fairly significant decline in our other postretirement benefit obligation as well.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Good. And then just my second question. When we look at the CASM guidance, we have a little bit of a bump up in the March quarter and then it looks like it moderates through the year and it looks like it's a bit of a repeat from a year ago. And I'm just curious, is that weather? Is that cost maybe associated with some of these employee buyouts or potential furloughs? What's driving that bump in the early part of the year?", "John D. Rainey", "Mike, I'd probably point to 3 things. One is we have a fairly significant escalation in one of our labor agreements at the beginning of this year that was hitting us in the first quarter. We also have more lumpiness than usual, and I'll give you an example of that with respect to some of our other cost items. Our maintenance expense, a significant portion of that is airframes. Well in the first half of the year, we're going to spend twice as much on airframes as we will in the back half of the year. And a lot of that is just driven by the timing of checks. But the third thing, and perhaps most importantly, is there's a ramp-up to a lot of the efficiency initiatives that we have in 2014. As you can appreciate, not all of those begin on January 1. But we're excited about the early returns there. I think our fourth quarter results give you some indication about the progress and we're optimistic for how that rolls out in 2014.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have John Godyn on line.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jim, I just wanted to follow up on the PRASM guidance. Just given the strong fourth quarter result versus your guidance, the optimism that we're hearing on the turnaround, your comments about accelerating improvement in yield mix, I can't help but wonder if some of the choppiness we experienced last year has caused the team to maybe add a bit more of a layer of conservatism to the PRASM guidance? Your thoughts?", "James E. Compton", "John, I think that's a fair assessment. As we look at our first quarter guidance, a little bit of color around it. As we guide to that flat to 2% up, last year, we ran a 5.9% RASM growth in the first quarter and far exceeded our peers in the industry on average. And so we are up against a little bit more difficult comps versus how we performed last year. The second piece is, as I mentioned, the weather impact of about 0.4 points of RASM to the downside to us. What we found is, in this weather event that was severe and of the 6,300 cancellation, a majority of those happened to be in Chicago. Normally, with a short weather event in a leisure period, you pretty much capture the traffic. But this is the time of year that we did recapture leisure traffic coming home from the holidays, but a lot of the business traffic that historically starts that first week of January heading out, particularly in Chicago, we didn't see the mix that we would have expected on a normal year given the severity of the weather. The third piece to our first quarter and maybe different from what other carriers are talking about, we actually see a point shift of RASM from March into April given the Easter effect and how our network operates within on that Easter so moving into the second quarter. And then the fourth piece maybe kind of tied to your comment, John. The team is really, really focused on the booking curve right now. I will tell you that on the revenue side, whether in it's any division, it's always about how do you better and how do you beat and so forth. But we are seeing the benefits of the mix change there and we do expect that to accelerate as we move through the first half of the year. So when you put it all back together, what we really see is terrific momentum coming off of the fourth quarter and a lot of excitement about 2014, but capturing some of those realities around the first quarter that leads to our guidance.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's really helpful. And John, if I could actually ask a question about costs. Some of the commentary that you gave on productivity improvements that are sort of being driven through the organization sounded pretty impressive. And when we think about the sort of walk in CASM x fuel throughout the year and where we are starting at in the first quarter and what the full year guidance looks like, I wonder, as we look towards the end of the year, could we actually be seeing flat to down CASM x fuel given the productivity improvements? Anything you can offer there?", "John D. Rainey", "Yes. I think that's a very reasonable assumption. As was mentioned in an earlier question, there's a lot more pressure in the first quarter. But we're pretty excited about the productivity improvements we're seeing. In the fourth quarter alone, we saw a 5.5% improvement in productivity with our labor forces. And as we continue to improve our operations, reduce our reliance on overtime, reduce call volume, things of that nature, we'll see those improvements bleed through into 2014. And you might remember, at our Investor Day, we talked about a multiyear goal of a 15% to 20% improvement and we are targeting a 3.5% improvement in 2014.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker on line.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Jim, a follow-up to what you're saying just now about RASM. I certainly understand the point you're making about business travel getting off to a slow start in January because of the weather. But my view, which isn't necessarily correct, but my view nonetheless has always been that most business travel does get recaptured within a month or 2, perhaps not if you just missed the annual auto show, but if the role was to visit clients or do whatever one does for a living, you've still got to do that meeting in Chicago. Did you not incorporate any recapture in the guidance or did you incorporate that in the guidance? In other words, is it gone for good?", "James E. Compton", "Well, that's a great question, Jamie. I think what we do with our guidance is we take the information that we have at hand and try to make some assumptions to -- does business traffic that we would gone that first week of January or some portion of that start up later on in the quarter, I would agree with you, I think it does and so forth. And so it's a matter again to your point of what percent of that happens. We've tried to incorporate that in there. If that traffic is coming, it may or may not be seen in the yields that we see right now because it's still to be booked. But we clearly try to anticipate for that and our guidance kind of reflects our best look at what that data is saying right now.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Sure. And a follow-up to the question that I actually touched on I believe last quarter, maybe it's the third quarter. But the New York market, Delta's indicated they hope to bring JFK up to a profit for this year. And it sounds like aircraft gauge and transcon flying are the driving factors for them as opposed to just a rising industry tide. I'm wondering how your Newark plan compares to this? I realize that hub is already profitable, but is the rate of improvement in Newark for 2014 consistent with your consolidated outlook or possibly the hub becomes a little bit less profitable as others improve their corporate share here in New York? Any updated thoughts on this topic?", "James E. Compton", "Jamie, so for us, New York is obviously a terrific profit center for us. It has been a while. We think that as we've talked about in the past, the advantage for us is that true connecting hub. So if something is changing in the local market, we have the ability to connect high-yield flow across that. But that being said, I'll point to our 7% corporate revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That was our strongest growth of any quarter during 2013. It gets back to why we're excited about the momentum as we head into 2014. So whether it's New York or across the system, we think that what we're seeing is great momentum across the system. I will add that in the transcon, we see some of our pressures, particularly in Newark, began last April with Virgin America's entry in [indiscernible]. And so, as we kind of manage and try to optimize revenue around that, we actually see upside as we go through the year as we lap some of that experience that happened in 2013. So we're very excited.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. If I could just quickly squeeze in something for John, just on the fuel efficiency. Based on the consumption guidance that you gave, it looks like ASM's per gallon will improve this year by about 1.7%. You indicated 1.5%. So it sounds like we're on the same page. But as we look at the 2015 fleet plan that you provided, should the rate of improvement slow or stay roughly the same?", "John D. Rainey", "Jamie, when we talk about the $1 billion in nonfuel cost savings, I've been asked this question quite a bit, most of that -- sorry, fuel cost savings -- most of that is through the efficiency of new planes. There are some operational initiatives that we have. But I think it's a fair assumption for your modeling perspective to assume that the savings are fairly ratable with our delivery of airplanes over that period of time.", "Operator", "From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker on line.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. One, what is the amount of cash you have trapped in Venezuela? And have you been able to shift point of sale away from that market? What's your thought about that given today's devaluation?", "John D. Rainey", "Yes. It's a very topical question, Helane. We've got about $80 million of cash that's trapped there in Venezuela right now. Obviously, we, along with other carriers, have had trouble repatriating that in a timely fashion. In terms of point-of-sale shift, I'm going to turn that over to Jim.", "James E. Compton", "Hey, Helane, Jim. This is one where John and I are connected at the hip, because what we do is obviously manage the economics, so as the devaluation effects the overall results of the economics, the team understands that and tries to make the correct point of sale from a revenue management and a network perspective. It's a very strong point of sale out of Venezuela, but we do try to adjust for the impact of things such as devaluation. We work very closely with John's team on that.", "John D. Rainey", "And I would add, we are still waiting to hear based upon yesterday's announcement from the government if the cash that we have there can be repatriated at the older rate or the -- it's got to be repatriated at the new rate.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Right. Okay. And then can I just ask about the San Francisco hub? I think I read that they're closing the runways this summer like on an alternating basis to do maintenance. So can you just talk about that and how that's going to affect your operation and from an on-time perspective and so on?", "Gregory L. Hart", "Sure, Helane, this is Greg. Obviously, we're aware of the impact that's going to have in San Francisco and we a proactively gone out and reduced our schedule a little bit to help facilitate better performance of the hub in anticipation of some issues related to the runway closures.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Great. So that's all included in the full year guidance?", "James E. Compton", "Yes, Helane, this is Jim. Our guidance incorporates the runway closures.", "Operator", "From Goldman Sachs, we have Thomas Kim on line.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "What are your thoughts about industry capacity continuously ramping up in Asia, particularly in the view of the soft yield environment? For example, are there any signs of demand accelerating or should we be concerned here at all about further headwinds with regard to the overall impact on PRASM?", "James E. Compton", "Tom, this is Jim. A couple of comments. One, it's a very strong performing part of our network and continues to be, so given the economic growth in China in particular. We're excited about here is that we know the competitive challenges out there and, for instance, 20% growth of capacity we've seen in China, most of that -- really that capacity growth is into Beijing and Shanghai, which is why we talked about a second phase of our Pacific strategy of secondary cities, so the San Francisco-Chengdu point. The other piece is as we move through the year, we have a lot of initiatives in terms of getting the right aircraft on the right market. If you remember, we've talked about our 747 in the tech ops team has built back in tremendous reliability into that fleet. Whereas last year, we concentrated in San Francisco, this year we'll be able to place it in markets that better fit the demand. So for instance, Chicago to Shanghai and Chicago, Tokyo will be on the 74 and one of the 74s will actually go Chicago-Frankfurt. So the point being was from us, we have many initiatives to kind of optimize the network out there, and that's in kind of understanding the competitive pressures that are out there and working with what we think is the best footprint, the conversation about San Francisco earlier, there is no better gateway in terms of serving the Pacific. And we think with the moves we're making with the fleet, with our second phase of our Pacific strategy of secondary cities, we are well-positioned in an entity that operates at a really high level.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. What is your capacity growth plan for trans-Pac this year?", "James E. Compton", "We don't break out the entities. So all we've guided to is that system of 1% to 2% for 2014.", "Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And John, can I ask you just a question with regard to GAAP-based taxes. How shall we be thinking about how that's going to be evolving as earnings continue to improve?", "John D. Rainey", "Sure, Tom. There's not a bright line test on when we begin booking taxes. At the end of 2014, we'll get with our accountants and we'll look at the various metrics that they evaluate. And for example, one of the things that looked -- that is evaluated is a cumulative 3-year earnings on a GAAP basis. And as we had a significant number of special charges in 2012, that actually put us into a GAAP loss position. But it's something that we'll evaluate at the end of 2014. And it would be a few years likely before we would pay cash taxes because we do have significant NOLs.", "Operator", "This concludes our investor analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Bloomberg News, we have Mary Schlangenstein on line.", "Mary Schlangenstein", "I just wanted to see if you had any impact during the quarter or the full year from the valuation changes in the yen?", "John D. Rainey", "We did. We've had the depreciation of the yen hurt our results. In fact, in the fourth quarter, it resulted in about a half a point decline in our consolidated RASM because of what happened there with the yen. We are hedged a little bit more into 2014. We've got about 30% of our exposure hedged at a little bit less than where the market is today. So it's a slight gain position.", "Operator", "And from the Associated Press, we have Josh Freed on the line.", "Josh Freed", "You'd mentioned a little bit earlier about the storm impact in January. Did you give that in dollar terms and if you didn't, could you?", "John D. Rainey", "Sure, Josh. This is John Rainey. The storm impact on a revenue basis, gross revenue, was about $80 million. Obviously, as we canceled over 6,000 flights, we didn't consume as much fuel and we had some cost savings, which muted that impact. So the net impact to us in January was about $60 million.", "Operator", "And that is our final question, I will now turn it back over to our speakers for any final remarks.", "Sarah Murphy", "With that, actually, we're going to conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call media relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thanks.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Please go ahead.", "Irene E. Foxhall", "Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining us in Chicago to discuss our results are Chairman, President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey; and Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart. Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which, Jim will review operational performance, revenue and capacity. John will follow with a discussion of our cost, fleet and capital structure. After which, we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. [Operator Instructions]", "With that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan Ireland.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thanks, Nene. This morning, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Both are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in this morning's earnings release and investor update, and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.

For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the table at the end of our earnings release and investor update, copies of which are available on our website. Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, Chairman, President and CEO of United.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Thanks, Nene and Jonathan, and thank you, all, for joining us on our second quarter 2014 earnings call. Today, we reported pretax earnings of $921 million, an increase of more than $300 million year-over-year. We earned $2.34 per diluted share, a 49% increase, versus of the second quarter of last year. We're pleased that our second quarter unit revenue performance exceeded our initial guidance, and that our quarterly nonfuel unit cost decreased year-over-year.", "Our second quarter financial performance reflects the progress we're making on initiatives we've been implementing over the last few quarters. Our revenue management and network improvements are delivering as expected. We're exhibiting excellent cost control. We're making disciplined aircraft investments that are improving our fuel efficiency, and we're continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. While we're pleased with the progress we made during the quarter, our entire management team is focused on continuing to improve our overall financial performance. We have a strong plan in place and our team is committed to executing against it. We are working to accelerate our revenue growth. We have a tremendous set of assets, and we'll take the appropriate actions with our network and fleet to maximize the revenue we produce from those assets.", "In a few minutes, Jim will walk you through the steps we're taking to optimize our network, regional operation and revenue management, all with the goal of improving our revenue and margin performance. At the same time, we continue to execute on Project Quality, our $2 billion annual cost savings program, to make meaningful gains in quality and efficiency. Our employees have played a large part in this initiative, and I thank them for identifying and implementing durable, high-quality improvements across our business. I ascribe much of our excellent second quarter unit cost performance to the progress we're making in this area, and I'm confident that our team will continue to execute at a high level going forward.", "In what is perhaps the clearest demonstration of our confidence and our ability to achieve the goals of a long-term plan we laid out at our Investor Day last fall, we announced this morning $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete within the next 3 years. We've made significant progress improving our overall capital structure, and initiating a shareholder return program is another step towards achieving a more balanced allocation of cash flow. We are firmly committed to increasing the value we create for our shareholders, and our share repurchase program is indicative of that commitment. John will walk you through this program in greater detail in just a few minutes.", "During the second quarter, we faced difficult operating conditions, particularly due to multi-month runway closures at our gateway San Francisco and Newark hubs. Our team stepped up throughout, demonstrating their professionalism, running a solid operation and providing good customer service. We're focused on running a more reliable and efficient operation with a consistently high-quality product and service offering, and are confident in our ability to continue to improve in these areas.", "We made significant strides in the second quarter towards our goals, but recognize that we have much work ahead to achieve United's full potential. We have very experienced, highly skilled employees who are committed to our success. We'll continue to take the appropriate actions and make the necessary changes to get us to the level of earnings our shareholders and this management team expect. Now I will turn the call over to Jim and John.", "James E. Compton", "Thanks, Jeff. First, I'd like to reiterate Jeff's recognition of our employees for running a reliable airline this quarter, while continuing to operate more efficiently. I'd also like to thank our customers for choosing United. We are working hard every day to improve the flyer-friendly experience we deliver and we appreciate your business.", "In the second quarter, United's consolidated PRASM grew 3.7% on approximately flat capacity year-over-year, above our original PRASM guidance range of 1% to 3%. The improvement, relative to guidance, was primarily driven by better-than-expected performance in the Pacific and domestic regions.", "We've been on a path to optimize our Pacific footprint, and we're beginning to see benefits from the changes we've implemented. We're restructuring our Asia flying to leverage our West Coast hubs, flying west from Tokyo to Asian destinations; and instead, flying directly from the West Coast to secondary Asian cities. We've recently added 2 new Pacific routes, San Francisco to Taipei and San Francisco to Chengdu, and they are both performing better than expected. We've also optimized our 747 deployment after investing in the fleet's reliability last year. As part of the 747 optimization, we've more appropriately matched capacity with demand in Australia by downgauging our flying to 777 aircraft, and we saw a double-digit PRASM increase in Australia in the second quarter.", "In addition, we experienced better-than-anticipated yields this quarter in China, despite the added competitive capacity, with yields in China slightly positive year-over-year. We expect this positive trend to continue through the peak summer months. Although we anticipate that accelerating industry capacity growth in China will put pressure on yields after the seasonal peak. That said, we are seeing the benefits of the actions we've taken to grow our leading Pacific franchise, and we'll continue to take the appropriate steps to build on this area of strength for United.", "In the second quarter, our consolidated domestic unit revenue grew nearly 6%. The largest unit revenue gain of all entities, driven by a solid demand environment, as well as strong execution on our revenue management initiatives. The improvements we've made to optimize our booking curve, taking fewer early bookings and holding more seat inventory for later, higher-yielding bookings drove approximately 0.75 point of consolidated PRASM growth in the second quarter. We expect to drive 1 full point of year-over-year PRASM growth in the third quarter. Additionally, we recently restructured the premium cabin fares on many of our domestic and short-haul Latin flights. This initiative drove our consolidated paid premium-cabin load factor up 5 points, to 47%, and it resulted in approximately 0.5 point of consolidated PRASM growth in the second quarter.", "We continue to make gains with our corporate partners. In the second quarter, revenue for large corporate accounts, which is what we've typically reported, grew by 3%, despite decreased year-over-year corporate revenue in April due to the Easter holiday shift. Additionally, we're seeing good growth from the rest of our corporate portfolio, primarily from our PerksPlus product, which is a points-based loyalty program for small- to medium-size businesses. Our overall corporate portfolio, inclusive of PerksPlus, grew approximately 6% in the second quarter.", "Ancillary revenue grew at a solid clip in the second quarter, increasing 7.9% per passenger. Our paid premium upgrade product performed extremely well in the second quarter, with a 28% revenue increase year-over-year. In alignment with the domestic premium cabin pricing at the time of booking, that I spoke about earlier, we've taken a similar approach with our premium cabin upgrade product. We're restructuring the prices and improving the targeting of our product and customer marketing, and are seeing a material increase in take rates and revenue as a result.", "As Jeff said, while we are pleased that we exceeded our guidance for the second quarter, we have significant opportunities to improve on these results. My team is intent on doing just that. We have a comprehensive effort underway to improve our revenue and margin performance. The initiative falls into 3 broad categories: network and scheduling, our regional operation and revenue management. We have identified meaningful areas of opportunity in each of these areas. And while many of the changes we'll make in these areas will yield near-term benefits, several of the changes will take a period of time to implement and drive results. I'll highlight a few of the examples of these initiatives, but be assured that we have identified and will continue to identify additional opportunities.", "First, in the network and scheduling area. We plan to redesign the flight bank structure at our Chicago hub, as well as at our Denver and Houston hubs, which we announced last quarter. We will implement these changes between the fourth quarter of this year and the spring of 2015. These changes will allow us to build more efficient, directional flows and shorten connection times.", "Beginning this fall, we are adding more seasonal shaping to our schedule, increasing the amount of flying we do in the seasonal peaks and decreasing our schedule during the trough periods. For example, in 2015, we expect to fly approximately 25% more capacity in July versus February, compared to just 13% in 2012. We will accomplish this by more optimally timing our maintenance visits, flight crew training and flight crew hiring.", "We will continue to make disciplined and thoughtful decisions regarding the comprehensive structure and performance of our overall network. As we've consistently said, each hub has to earn its place in the network, and we will make return-driven decisions regarding the optimal hub network for United. Further, we are working to maximize the utility of our gate and slot portfolio to increase the scale and operability of better performing hubs. We are excited about the long-term revenue opportunities these network and scheduling initiatives will drive. It is important to recognize that changes in this area, by their very nature, are more strategic and will take more time to implement than some of the other areas of our business.", "We also have a significant opportunity to optimize our regional operations. In particular, continuing to reduce the number of 50-seat aircraft in our fleet and improving the reliability of our regional flying. Over the course of this year and next, we will remove the equivalent of more than 130 50-seat regional jets from our schedule. We will replace 70 of these with 76-seat Embraer 175s that we are now taking delivery of. And many, we will not replace at all. At the beginning of this year, we flew approximately 8% of our overall capacity with 50-seat and smaller aircraft. But by the end of 2015, we expect that to decline to only 5% of our total capacity.", "We are also taking a number of actions to improve the reliability of our regional operation beyond simply flying fewer 50-seat jets. One particular area of focus is reducing the complexity of our regional flying by consolidating the number of regional flying partners we utilize in a given hub. We are also reducing the number of hubs from which we -- which regional partners operate. For example, today, we have 8 express operators flying out of our Washington Dulles hub, and we will reduce that to just 4 partners by this September. By concentrating on our regional operations with fewer regional carriers in a hub, we will reduce complexity and variability, and thus drive improved reliability. We expect the changes we'll make in our regional operations will have a revenue benefit, as we improve our predictability and our onboard product; as well as a cost benefit, as we'll be flying much more efficient E175s instead of 50-seat aircraft.", "These examples illustrate only a few of the opportunities we have to grow United's revenue. Through the enhancements we'll make to our network, our schedule, our regional operation and our approach to revenue management, we will significantly improve our revenue performance over the next 18 months. We'll provide more detail on our progress in the coming quarters.", "For the third quarter, we expect PRASM to grow between 2% and 4%, on capacity growth of between 0.2% and 1.2% year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect capacity to be between flat and up 1%, 1 full point lower than the guidance we provided at the beginning of 2014.", "In conclusion, I'm pleased with our improved performance. However, we still have significant runway ahead. My team and I are committed to improving our revenue growth, and we are very optimistic about our strategy to do so.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John D. Rainey", "Thanks, Jim, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I would also like to thank our employees for their efforts in the second quarter. Throughout the company, we are making long-term, sustainable improvements, and I appreciate everyone's hard work in developing and implementing these important initiatives.", "Today, we reported $921 million of pretax income for the second quarter, generating earnings per diluted share of $2.34. This represents a pretax margin of 8.9%, an improvement of nearly 3 points year-over-year. Additionally, in the second quarter, we generated $1.5 billion of operating cash flow, and nearly $600 million of free cash flow. While we are pleased with our improvement, we have significant opportunity to expand upon these results to generate the level of earnings we expect.", "Second quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, was 0.2% lower year-over-year, much better than our initial expectation for the quarter. Results from our cost-saving initiatives during the quarter exceeded our expectations, and we also renegotiated certain maintenance contracts. Additionally, some expenses we originally anticipated to incur in the second quarter shifted into the third.", "Year-to-date, our CASM performance have exceeded our expectations, despite the fact that we reduced our capacity by more than 1 point in the first half of the year from our initial plan for 2014. We expect this strong performance to continue in the second half of the year, with third quarter and full year nonfuel CASM each increasing between 1% and 2%.", "I attribute much of our good cost performance to outstanding execution of our Project Quality initiative. This initiative is designed to generate $2 billion of annual cost savings by 2017. Through Project Quality, our team is making fundamental, permanent changes to how we do business. For 2014, we expect to achieve nearly $200 million in fuel efficiency savings, and approximately $300 million in nonfuel savings from this initiative, which is at the high end of the range we previously provided. The progress we're making in this area is clearly evident in our second quarter CASM performance.", "One area in which we're seeing meaningful gains already is productivity. In the second quarter, we improved our productivity by 3.9% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement. For the full year, we are on track to improve productivity by 3%, versus 2013.", "Since our merger, we have evolved how we allocate capital at United. And today, we announced the next phase of our capital allocation plan with a $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete within the next 3 years. This amount represents approximately 6% of our market cap. In conjunction with this announcement, we have initiated a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program, which will be completed within the next 3 months. In addition, during the second quarter, we spent $62 million to retire convertible debt, which would've converted into 1.5 million shares of United stock.", "Over the last year, I have consistently talked about 2 gating items prior to initiating a shareholder return program. First, we wanted to address the $800 million, 6 3/4% secured notes, for which we now have a plan in place, and I'll speak to the details shortly. And second, we wanted to have a level of earnings and cash generation that supported the capital distribution to shareholders, and our earnings outlook does just that.", "At this time, we believe the best method to distribute capital to shareholders is through a share repurchase program. We have confidence in our earnings potential and believe that we are trading at a discount to our intrinsic value. As we continue to demonstrate progress against our plan, increase our earnings and further pay down debt, we will evaluate if and when we should complement our share repurchase program with a dividend.", "In addition to returning cash to our shareholders, our long-term capital structure goals include reducing our non-aircraft-related debt and managing total debt at approximately $15 billion, while maintaining an unrestricted liquidity balance of $5 billion to $6 billion.", "In the second quarter, we made $333 million of debt payments; and for the second half of 2014, we expect approximately $575 million of scheduled debt payments. We are seeing a clear benefit from the balance sheet improvements we're making. We expect our 2014 interest expense to be approximately 30% lower, versus just 4 years ago. In keeping with our goal of reducing non-aircraft debt on our balance sheet, we intend to redeem the entire $800 million of 6 3/4% secured notes. We expect that this redemption will occur this September when the notes become pre-payable at par.", "Also in September, we expect to close on a transaction under our existing $1.9 billion credit facility, in which we will increase the size of our undrawn revolving credit facility by $350 million to a total of $1.35 billion, and issue an additional $500 million tranche of term loan debt. These transactions will allow us to reduce our balance sheet debt and interest expense, while continuing to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity. As we look forward, our debt and capital lease payments over the next 4 years are approximately $1.1 billion annually, about half of what our annual maturities have been over the last 4 years.", "In addition to reducing our debt, we are making high return investments in our business. In the third quarter, we expect approximately $650 million of gross capital expenditures. We plan to take delivery of 4 737-900ERs and 2 787s, including our first 787-9 during the quarter. We introduced our first 7 highly efficient Embraer 175s in the second quarter and we expect to take an additional 12 in the third. We expect to have 70 of these operating by the end of 2015. Additionally, we are working to meaningfully reduce our capital expenditures over the next 4 years by working with the aircraft manufacturers and continuing to explore opportunities in the used aircraft market.", "I'm encouraged by our second quarter financial performance and by the progress in our Project Quality initiative. We expect to expand earnings year-over-year in the third quarter and to continue this momentum as we move forward. We are pleased to take an initial step toward returning cash to our shareholders, and we'll continue to make prudent, return-driven investments in our people, fleet, product and technology. Through the actions we've taken, and will continue to take, to improve our revenue and operations, our efforts to improve the efficiency and quality of everything we do and a more balanced allocation of cash flow going forward, we're creating a great foundation for increasing shareholder value.", "I'll now turn it over to Jonathan to open up the call for questions.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thank you, John. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "So, John, a little bit more on the cash discussion. If we think about your CapEx being about $3 billion a year as of today, next year or in the year -- a couple of years after that, and then you got $1.1 billion in debt payments and then some degree of repo, obviously, going on, how should we think about how much debt you're going to raise, right? So I mean, are you just going to be paying down these -- the $1.1 billion of debt maturities as they come due? How much of the CapEx do you see yourself financing? How much cash comes in that you're going to raise in the capital markets? On a steady-state scenario.", "John D. Rainey", "Well, Hunter [ph] -- yes. As a general rule, we would expect to finance aircraft with debt. The efficiency in that market right now is outstanding. When we can raise debt at 4% to purchase assets, that's a very good use of cash, that also lowers our overall cost of capital. Where we will be opportunistic with paying down debt is in some of the non-aircraft debt categories. We still have the term loan, as well as several tranches of unsecured debt, which happens also to be at all-time low rates for the airline industry. But the key thing here, Hunter, is balance. We've evolved how we allocate cash flow since our merger. Initially after our merger, the best way to create shareholder value was to continue to delever and derisk this business. We've also made a lot of core investments in the company and in our infrastructure. And we're at a point now where we've complemented that with the first phase of capital distribution to shareholders. And going forward, we will be opportunistic in terms of paying down debt, overfunding our pension, investing in our business and continuing to deploy cash to shareholders.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay, and is Greg Hart there?", "John D. Rainey", "Yes.", "Gregory L. Hart", "Yes, Hunter.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Greg, I have a question for you on the regional side and, Jim, you might have some color on this, too. But I was going to ask you, and Jim, you answered a lot of it, is -- obviously, you're kind of consolidating the regional footprint a little bit. And I think a lot of United's problems over the last couple of years can be really tied back to the regional operation, whether it's just basic operational reliability, on-time performance or fleet type, whatever you want to call it. But my question is really, how much of that can you actually control? I mean, if your regional providers are showing up late or behaving badly, how much control do you really have over that? Obviously, you can fire them. But in terms of what you can do to fix it in the immediate term, what can you control and what can you not control on the regional side?", "Gregory L. Hart", "That's a good question, Hunter. And I think there's certainly lots of things we can control and there's investments, for example, we can make on our end that'll provide a better environment for our regional partners to operate in. For example, as a result of our experience in the first quarter with all the weather, we've invested in a quite a bit of technology that's going to provide the opportunity for us to better cancel flights and provide the regional operators a better chance to recover much quicker than what they have historically been able to do. So that's an example of some of the things we're doing to better facilitate their operations, both in wintertime as well as summer storm times. So there's lots of things we're doing along those lines to help the regional carriers perform better.", "Operator", "From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker on the line.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Can I just ask Greg a question, actually? How -- or somebody said 8% of your operation is regional, and that's going to be declining. Is there a way to determine what percent of your cancellations and, therefore, some of the reliability issues are actually weather-related versus operational difficulties?", "Gregory L. Hart", "Helane, I think what Jim mentioned, as it relates to the 8%, was 8% of our flying is on 50-seaters and that's declining to...", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Oh, got you.", "Gregory L. Hart", "5% over the course of the next 18 months or so. Obviously, we track our regional carriers' performance each and every day, and understand each and every flight that is either delayed or canceled and the reasons why. It's something we've got laser-like focused on, and are focused on not only taking advantage of the opportunities that, that data provides, but building better flexibility within the schedule to provide better opportunities to recover. Jim talked about consolidating the number of operators in Dulles, for example. As you can imagine, as we built schedule depth for those operators in Dallas, they've got better capabilities to recover themselves.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, but there's no way to know how much is weather-related, how much is pilots, because of weather, not being available, there's no way to actually determine that?", "Gregory L. Hart", "Well, for us, we have that data and we measure it every day. It's not anything we talk about publicly, but we have contractual relationships, actually, with our providers that account for weather-related delays differently than mechanical or pilot-driven delay or cancellation.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then could I just ask John a question? I think you mentioned that you thought your shares were -- I think he used the word intrinsically undervalued relative to your peer group. Do you have like an amount that you think you're undervalued by?", "John D. Rainey", "Nothing that I would want to disclose, Helane. The point being, though, is that we have a lot of confidence in our plan and in our ability to execute on that plan. And if you believe that the preferred method of deploying capital to shareholders is through a share repurchase program, you want to do that at a point where you're trading at a discount to that future earnings potential. We believe that's the inflection point that we're at. We've got a lot of confidence in our plan going forward. And we'll -- we believe that now is the right time to do this for United shareholders.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have John Godyn on the line.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "John, I wanted to follow up on the repurchase a bit. You described it as sort of the initial step, and I think it's great to see an industrial company do a buyback before they hit their inflection. How do you think about sort of a more steady state return of capital, assuming that all the initiatives play out over the next kind of 18 months or so?", "John D. Rainey", "Well, you're right, John. This is a first step, and I will add that I think it's a watershed moment in the airline industry, where you have the largest 4 carriers returning cash to shareholders. I think that, that speaks volumes about how this industry has changed, how it's de-risked the business and the sustainability of those earnings going forward. One way that we look at this is the amount of cash that we're deploying relative to our market cap. Today's announcement is about 6% of our market cap. We're going to -- as we begin to act more like an industrial, I think we should begin to measure ourselves more against industrials and have returns of capital that aspire to be similar to those.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's very helpful. On a separate topic, I'm very interested in the fact that you guys are on the cusp of some major upgauging here, and you have been doing some replacement of aircraft as well. Are there any anecdotes, numbers, sound bites that you can give us in terms of the differential in the economics of different aircraft just to help us kind of model the impact over the next 18 months or so of some of these initiatives, because they sound like they could be meaningful?", "John D. Rainey", "Are you referring specifically to the used versus new market? Or just in terms of the CapEx materiality, the reduction?", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Two things I'd be interested in. Number one, when you think about, perhaps, the per seat CASM x fuel differential, approximately, some of the larger-gauge aircraft you're bringing in versus the 50-seaters that you're swapping out. And secondarily, in the past, you've offered some thoughts on sort of replacement economics and talked about how 737s save you quite a lot of money versus 757s. I'm just trying to kind of put the whole picture together and looking for some more of those data points.", "John D. Rainey", "Sure. Well, the 70-seater obviously is appreciably better from a CASM perspective than the 50-seat product. Equally, it puts some pressure on the revenue side. Now I think balancing that on the revenue side, just to go there for a second, is that it's a much better product for our customers. And where we're flying a 50-seat RJ today, wingtip to wingtip, with a competitor that's flying a mainline jet, it's an inferior product and customers book away from that. So I view that more as a kind of a scratch on the revenue side, and it provides a fairly material improvement on the cost side. With respect to replacement economics, we've often talked about the fact that for each 757 that we replaced with a 900ER, it's a couple of million dollars to the bottom line each year. One of the things that we're looking at right now is the used aircraft market. And that market varies widely, based upon which aircraft type you're talking about. And I'll give you an example. The 737-800, a 10-year-old 800 is not priced as low, relative to a new 800, as like an Airbus or some of the other older-generation planes. So we need to be opportunistic with respect to which particular aircraft types we look at if we're looking at the used market. But while we do trade maybe some of the operating economics for a plane that's not newer generation, as we've consistently said, one of the ways that we look at returns in this business, and a very important way, is return on invested capital. And where we may be trading the top line, the numerator, the notepad, we're actually benefiting it by the lower invested capital. And so that's one of the factors that we will take into this decision.", "James E. Compton", "John, this is Jim. I would just add to John's comment on the revenue side. The [indiscernible] of the 50-seaters with the 70-seaters also presents a first-class cabin and Economy Plus cabin. We're excited about the ancillary opportunities. I've mentioned a little bit about what we're seeing on upsell, as well as first-class pricing in the premium cabin domestically. So we're excited about the opportunity that as those 70 airplanes come into the system over the next 18 months, what that will drive on the ancillary side.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Jim, Delta made the point yesterday about their long-standing relationships with -- in United's JV partners within the context of trans-Atlantic pricing and scheduling. Lufthansa has announced some capacity cuts, but apparently -- at least not yet in the Atlantic. I know you don't have veto power over your partners' schedules, but how closely do you coordinate? I mean, can you influence, can you compel more capacity discipline at the Star Alliance level? Or you just -- only at the United mainline level?", "James E. Compton", "Jamie, so we have a great working relationship with our JV partners. And whether it's Lufthansa, ANA, Air Canada, all of our JV partners, we coordinate very closely on capacity, as well as the pricing and sales -- and the sales agreements that we have in the marketplace. You are right, though, at the end each carrier is free to make decisions that they feel best for them. But I will tell you that the relationships that we have with our JV partners and our coordination is very tight. As we look at the trans-Atlantic capacity, we're relatively flattish in the second quarter. Some of the seasonal shaping that I mentioned in my comments have a direct impact on the trans-Atlantic, in that you'll see our capacity relatively flat in the winter 2015 off [ph] season. But to your point, we work really closely with our JV partners.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And I assume that means you share schedules, plan schedules well before they're loaded. You're not like us where you have to rely on monitoring schedule tapes and stuff?", "James E. Compton", "Absolutely. There's -- the network teams have far-out looking discussions in terms of what capacity and what works for each carrier.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. That's what I figured. And a question for Greg. When we think about the first quarter's unprecedented meteorological mayhem, if we were to repeat that in winter 2015, are there any particular initiatives you can point to that would make the outcome less severe for you guys? Or, I guess, I don't know, put differently, were there operational takeaways? Or do you just treat last winter's weather as a one-off, sort of Chicago's own, well, Super Typhoon Paka, if you will?", "Gregory L. Hart", "Jamie, great question, and we are certainly not treating first quarter's weather as a one-off. We are expecting more of the same moving forward, and are preparing for that. And we've got a lot of things ongoing to help us better manage weather events at the airport. And a couple of examples I can point to. One is we're working on a tool that's going to provide the opportunity to better rebook our passengers over our network. Today's tool isn't that sophisticated when it comes to being able to rebook our passengers over every itinerary we can provide in our network. And obviously, with the 7 hubs here in the Continental U.S., we've got a lot of different itineraries that we can put people over. So we're working on a tool that's going to better do that. We also are working on a tool, that I mentioned earlier, that's going to help us better get the airline back on its feet after a winter storm. We're going to cancel flights such that we're going to better understand where our crews are, where they have time, and where the airplanes are to help the airplane recover much quicker than what we have been able to do historically. And there's several other examples I can point to across all of the divisions that we're working on to better provide the opportunity to get our passengers to where they want to be much quicker than what we have historically.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg online.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "John, the question about exploring opportunities in the used aircraft market, where do you see a need? Is it -- are you looking at widebodies, narrowbodies? What's behind that?", "John D. Rainey", "It's on the narrowbody side. We are making some investments in our fleet on the widebody side to prolong the life of those planes. But this is more about being disciplined and balanced with respect to CapEx. And as we shift from relying less on the 50-seat RJs and more on the regional fleet, we need to do that in a financially disciplined way. I'm a big believer in the new aircraft that the manufacturers are putting out, but there's a limit to what we should go out and spend, and we need to be balanced with our capital, balanced with the amount of debt we're putting on and actually do this in a way that enables us to return cash to shareholders.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And then just my second question, and this is -- it's probably a question for Jim. I think there was -- it was an article in some of the -- it seemed like some of the papers picked it up not that long ago about maybe United should shut down its Dulles hub. And I guess the question is, as I recall -- I don't know, this wasn't even that long ago, I recall hearing where, I believe, the DC and Northern Virginia area had one of United's highest concentrations of 1K and Global Service members, and some of the average one-way fares out of Dulles, at least on mainline, were among some of the highest in its system. And I don't know if that's changed. Maybe that has changed with the merger and the integration. But historically, I actually thought that, that was a very profitable operation for United. I realize you don't get into profitability of hub-by-hub economics, but is there anything that you can say to, I don't know, refute that or just give us some color?", "James E. Compton", "Mike, this is Jim. I think my comments would be that we have, as I talked about, our revenue initiatives and the 3 areas that we're focused on: network and schedule, the regional operations and revenue management. Within network and schedule, we're very focused on how our traffic flows across all our hubs, and how each hub participates into the overall network performance. Within that, the team -- very granular analysis, and the granular analysis includes many of the things that you just mentioned in terms of where our most loyal customers are, the lifetime spend and our expectations with that going forward. So I think I would just summarize by saying that we are very much focused on revenue initiatives that we've implemented, that we're going to implement, and those that we're researching, and that includes the overall look at the network.", "Operator", "From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie on line.", "Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Jim, I guess, if I could just follow-up on Mike's question. I think one of the comments I heard is that each hub, pardon me, has to earn its way into the network and sort of alluded to the fact that maybe more decisions could be on the way. I know you're not willing to make any announcements today as, of course, these are long-term strategic decisions you have to live with. But I wonder if you can provide some perspective about when you might expect to reach a decision first? And I guess secondly, from where you sit today, does any potentially required surgery seem extensive or perhaps more modest?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Dan, this is Jeff. Let me take that question if I could. I would say that nothing is off the table, and we'll take the actions that we need take to maximize the value of our enterprise for our shareholders. We have demonstrated an ability and willingness to take tough actions. Cleveland's a good example of that. We have a lot of initiatives underway, and we're taking a lot -- a look at a lot of others. I'm not going to put a timeframe on that, nor will I talk about, nor will we as a company talk about directionally where we'll go until we're ready to talk about something. But I want to assure you that this team is committed to improving our margin performance, to improving our value for our shareholders, to improving our product, to improving our operational reliability, and we will take whatever actions are necessary to do just that.", "Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Understood, I appreciate that. And then I guess just -- if I could follow up with one more question on the capital return. I appreciate the perspective you guys have already shared. And I guess, just going back to the original goal, it was initially to return it in 2015. And so, I'm wondering if you can -- and maybe you've already shared this, but provide some more perspective on what led you to conclude that it made sense to bump it up by 1 year. So I guess, in particular, is it really just the intrinsic value of the stock? Or is there a view, perhaps, that the core business is on track to recover more quickly than you previously anticipated?", "John D. Rainey", "Well, it's absolutely both those, Dan. I would emphasize that when we first articulated our plan to return cash to shareholders last fall, we were deliberately vague with the timeframe, and we said by sometime in 2015. And at that point, we were very early on in several of the key initiatives that we're working on right now. We now have a few quarters underneath our belt, and you can see the results of those performance in our financial and cost performance this morning. We have a clear line of sight into the cash flows that exist out into the timeframe that we talked about and we've got a lot of confidence in our plan, and that's what this action today reflects.", "Operator", "From Evercore Partners, we have Duane Pfennigwerth online.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Jim, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about rebanking, specifically. I don't know if it was just Chicago or a number of hubs. When we look at your connecting RASM, it actually appears pretty good. It's running ahead of your existing primary competitor. So it looks like, philosophically, you already appreciate the value of connecting revenue. Can you talk about what's actually changing and what revenue you feel like you're leaving on the table and maybe how large this opportunity is?", "James E. Compton", "Yes. The opportunity is, obviously, to improve that. The -- and what we're focusing on is, beginning in the fourth quarter in Denver and beginning in Houston towards the end of the year and into the first part of the year, and then Chicago by spring of 2015, looking at rebanking those 3 hubs. What it will do is it makes -- what it does is it reduces the connection time, and the opportunity to drive more connections at a higher yield than what you're already seeing today. So yes, we do really well in the connecting business today, but we think it's an opportunity to drive it even higher as we tighten those things up and driving more connecting opportunities for our customers.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "And also, the one thing I would add, Duane, is that as we have had a lot of focus on improving our operations, we have more confidence in our operational reliability going forward to permit those connections to occur without undue misconnects.", "Operator", "From Stifel, we have Joe DeNardi online.", "Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Jim, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about on the commentary you provided on the Pacific, maybe quantify or put into context kind of how the initiatives that you've put into place on that market should help alleviate some of the capacity growth that you're seeing kind of going into fourth quarter, maybe on a year-over-year basis.", "James E. Compton", "Joe, yes, the Pacific performed better than our expectation in the second quarter, so we're pleased with the progress that we're making on our Pacific initiative. But it kind of falls -- it falls into 4 categories. Restructuring our Narita flying, working with our ANA -- with our JV partner, ANA, to do that. Which means, for instance, in March 2014, we no -- we suspended flying Narita to Bangkok and are now connecting that traffic that we carry over the trans-Pacific, over ANA, to Bangkok. The tech ops team, the maintenance team invested in a great program in the reliability of 747. Last year, we talked about that. The second quarter was the beginning of the repositioning of those 747s, and allowing those airplanes to fly the missions that, from a network perspective, from a revenue perspective, they want to fly. That has a lot -- in addition, our secondary Asian city strategy really is exceeding our expectations in new routes from San Fran to Taipei and Chengdu are exceeding our expectations, is that third prong of the strategy. And then the last one is rightsizing the missions with the 787. We used to fly San Francisco to Osaka on a larger airplane, it's now on the 787 and the economics are significantly better, as an example of the flexibility of our fleet that we have as we take deliveries of 787s to optimize the network going forward. So in the context of the competitive pressure that you talked about, we're actually -- we're building on the great footprint we have in the Pacific, and the uniqueness that we can bring to the market allows us to manage against that pressure that we see as the capacity, particularly into China, accelerates through the rest of this year.", "Operator", "And from Raymond James, we have Savi Syth online.", "Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to ask about what you're seeing in the Latin America region. It looks like your capacity has been increasing, but it's seen a bit of recovery and maybe not similar to what we have seen elsewhere. And I'm just wondering if what you're seeing? And maybe, where the growth is being concentrated?", "James E. Compton", "And we are seeing increase in Latin -- in our investor update we actually talked about over the next several weeks, we're booked up about 4.5 points in the Latin America division. And so we're confident with our capacity growth in the market. We're seeing strong growth looking forward in the leisure beach destinations, as well as into Mexico -- the business markets. And I will tell you that a lot is driven by the Houston hub. It's a great connecting point, it's a great facility as a gateway into Latin America. So as we -- again, as we face competitive pressures, we'll monitor what's happening in the marketplace and make sure that we keep capacity in line with the demand. But we're really confident where we're at and the results that we're seeing in Latin America right now.", "Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then just as you look across your hubs, I was just wondering, we've seen a lot more of Frontier adding a lot of capacity into more of your markets. And I know that's a very different product, but I -- just wondering what the impact has been and what your response has been.", "James E. Compton", "Obviously, we compete amidst many carriers across our system. And we think that we have a terrific product, it is a different product than the ultra-low-cost carrier product. And we view that as we build our operational reliability, as we improve on the predictability of product that we have in the marketplace, we're well-positioned to compete, really, against anybody, including Frontier.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions] From The Street, we have Ted Reed.", "Ted Reed", "I have 2 questions, one's easy and one's hard. The easy one is about Chengdu. You said the flights are doing well. I'd like you to say a little more about that, and the reason for it and might you increase frequencies. And secondly, to Jeff, there's been a lot of complaints a couple of months ago about -- from the pilots. I haven't heard you address that. But have you been listening to that, consulting with them? Does that explain any of the improvement?", "James E. Compton", "Ted, this is Jim. The first question on Chengdu. Relative to our expectation, what we're really pleased with is the point of sale out of China exceeding our expectations. And so that's where we've seen most of the upside versus what our initial forecast said. So we're looking forward to that continuing. We work really closely with the officials in Chengdu and have developed great relationships, and we're seeing the fruit of that bear out. But again, like any route, we'll monitor capacity and demand. And if the demand is there to warrant increase in frequency, we clearly have the opportunity again. And I'll go back to the 787, it's really a terrific airplane that allows us to do many things in the Pacific and across our network. So we'll continue, like we do in every market, monitor the capacity and demand and react to that appropriately.", "Ted Reed", "This must give you a lot of faith that you can continue to do great things with the 787 in China, open more cities.", "James E. Compton", "That's exactly right. I mean, China is a market that -- is an economy that continues to grow at a very strong pace. And there are many opportunities in China that you can develop markets with, particularly with that 787.", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "And Ted, this is Jeff. In answer to your second question, certainly, at the beginning of the year, with moving everybody to a single crew management system and FAR 117, the new flight duty time, we had some hiccups in some of those implementation, which adversely affected some of our pilots. But we've certainly also allow [ph] an enormous amount of focus to that. All our folks in ops and our technology worked together hard to make sure to make their lives more predictable and reliable. And certainly, the amount of focus we've had and investments we've had in improving our operational reliability makes the pilots' lives better, makes the flight attendants' lives better, makes our passengers' lives better. I think we have a good relationship with ALPA, in the joint collective bargaining agreement. We are in close consultations with our pilots on many matters. And we continue to develop that relationship, and we expect that relationship will continue to improve over time. We want to make sure that we have the right culture with everybody at this company, including our pilots, and I think we're making good progress.", "Operator", "We have time for one more question. From The Associated Press, we have David Koenig on the line.", "David Koenig", "I wanted to ask about the Tel Aviv flights. And did you plan to resume those all along as soon as the FAA lifted the NOTAM? Or did you conduct your own assessment? And if it is the latter, can you please explain your decision, what went into it?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Sure. Well, first of all, the safety of our passengers and crews is paramount, and we don't fly missions that we don't have confidence are safe. We have consulted extensively with the U.S. government, as well as our own people on the ground in Tel Aviv, and that is -- and we believe it's safe to fly and that's why we're commencing -- recommencing our flights.", "Irene E. Foxhall", "Okay. With that, we're out of time, so we'll conclude. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Please call Media Relations if you have any further questions.

They did a great job responding and handling the effects on our customers, and I'm proud of them.", "So far this year, we've made a number of improvements to our operations, and we'll continue to focus on our reliability and product. Our goal is to deliver flyer-friendly service, a competitive product and competitive margins. We're continuing to take steps to improve the customer experience for our passengers, including installing in-flight satellite-based WiFi and streaming video on our mainline fleet as well as adding WiFi and streaming video on our 2-cabin regional fleet. As of today, we have WiFi in more than half of our mainline aircraft, nearly 200 of which are equipped with streaming video. By the end of the year, 2/3 of the mainline fleet will have WiFi and we will have begun installation on our 2-cabin regional fleet.", "Our progress this quarter shows that our plan is working. We're excited about the opportunities ahead, and this management team is committed to executing in each area of the business to realize this company's potential. We will continue to make progress against our plan and will take all appropriate actions to generate the level of earnings we and our shareholders expect.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, Greg and John.", "James E. Compton", "Thanks, Jeff.", "First, I'd also like to recognize our employees for running an ever-improving airline this quarter. I appreciate our employees' commitment to providing great service to our customers. I'd also like to thank our customers for choosing United. We are making strides each day to improve your flying experience, and we appreciate your business.", "In the third quarter, United's consolidated PRASM grew 3.9%, on capacity growth of 0.5% year-over-year. The improvements we've made to our Pacific network continued to pay off. Our new routes to Chengdu and Taipei have both performed better than expectations. We also continue to see strong results from transforming our Narita flying and regauging our Australia routes. Additionally, high demand for our China service during this -- during the peak summer travel season helped offset pressure from the continued industry capacity growth.", "Our trans-Atlantic flying was also able to absorb the additional competitive capacity and performed better than expected in the third quarter, largely driven by strong premium cabin bookings, particularly in London. Although the trans-Atlantic entity has experienced several recent pressures, including Middle East unrests; the Ukrainian conflict; and more recently, concern about Ebola, we have not seen any meaningful impact on bookings to date. In the Latin America markets, particularly deep South America, we exceeded our expectations, recovering more quickly from the World Cup slowdown than we initially anticipated.", "In the third quarter, revenue from our total corporate portfolio, including our rapidly growing PerksPlus product, grew approximately 5%. Ancillary revenue continued to grow in the third quarter, increasing approximately 11% per passenger and keeping us on track to achieve $3 billion in ancillary revenue in 2014.", "During the quarter, Economy Plus revenue increased by double digits due to enhanced pricing optimization and a lower refund rate. We decreased the refund rate by implementing an improved solution for reseating customers during aircraft swaps. Additionally, we recently began to sell Economy Plus through the Amadeus and Sabre distribution systems, allowing our travel management partners and travel agencies to seamlessly book extra-legroom seats for our customers, further driving additional Economy Plus sales. We are pleased with the progress we're making on improving our revenue thus far, and we still have many more opportunities to optimize the value of our network.", "On the last earnings call, I introduced our three-pronged approach to growing passenger revenue: enhancing our revenue management processes, optimizing our network and schedule and improving our United Express operation. I'd like to provide you with an update on each of these areas.", "First, in revenue management, our booking curve optimization initiative increased third quarter PRASM by 1 point. Additionally, our recently restructured premium cabin fares on many of our domestic and short-haul Latin flights added 0.5 point of PRASM in the third quarter and increased the premium payload factor on these routes by 12 points year-over-year to 40%. Second, our recent changes to the network and schedule are improving the bottom line as well. In the second quarter, for example, we significantly reduced flying from Cleveland and realized the full effects of this change to the network in the third quarter. We expect the run rate annual benefit of this change to be approximately $60 million.", "We are making progress on other network and schedule initiatives, including our redesign of the flight bank structure at our hubs in Chicago, Denver and Houston. We implemented the newly rebanked schedule in Denver at the end of September, and we'll follow with Houston late this year and Chicago in March of 2015. This phased rebanking will allow for optimal peaking across the network during the high-demand summer period next year. Additionally, we continue to increase the seasonality of our flying. We view seasonal shaping as an additional step in our commitment to capacity discipline. By adding more flying to the peak summer travel period and reducing flying during the lower-demand shoulder period, we expect to improve our yield over the full year. This will be most notable in the trans-Atlantic markets. For example, in July 2015, we will fly over 40% more trans-Atlantic capacity compared to February 2015, while we expect our full year trans-Atlantic capacity in 2015 to continue to reflect appropriate capacity discipline. We expect this seasonal sculpting of capacity to generate almost 0.5 point of PRASM improvement in our trans-Atlantic entity for the full year of 2015.", "This quarter, we launched a new initiative to consolidate departure frequencies throughout the network. Frequency consolidation will reduce costs, improve reliability, improve the product offering and provide more premium seating. As an example, in January, with our Denver-to-Minneapolis route, we are reducing service from 5 flights per day, comprised of a mix of express and mainline aircraft, to 4 flights per day, comprised exclusively of mainline flying on weekdays. In this example, we are only increasing our daily seats by 3% while increasing seats per departure by approximately 30%. We've already implemented similar changes in other routes in Chicago and Newark. The effect of these changes will be seen throughout the network, as we plan on increasing gauge by 5% in 2015 while reducing departures by 3%. The effect will be most pronounced in Chicago, which we will -- which will see average daily departures drop approximately up to 8% and seats per departure increase up to 10% in some months. This not only drives efficiency-related margin improvement but also helps to better manage the congested airspace around O'Hare.", "Third, we continue to make good progress on improving our United Express operation. This quarter, we announced that we will add 50 incremental 2-cabin E175s to our fleet and we will remove 31 Q400 propeller aircraft, beginning in 2015. Including these regional fleet changes, we expect to have 85 E175s in our fleet by the end of next year. Our continued progression to more modern, consistent, fuel-efficient and larger-gauge regional aircraft will improve the operational and revenue performance of our express operation while substantially improving our product offering. For each 50-seat aircraft an E175 is replacing, we expect to generate over $1 million of annual improved profitability.", "In summary, we are pleased with the initial progress of our three-pronged revenue initiative, but we recognize that it will take some time before we realize the full benefits.", "Before turning to fourth quarter revenue guidance, I would first like to remind you of a 1.5 point PRASM tailwind we received in the fourth quarter of 2013. As we explained in our fourth quarter 2013 traffic releases, this tailwind was due to certain interline ticket reconciliations. As this was onetime in nature, we will be facing a 1.5 point PRASM headwind in the fourth quarter this year. Taking this into account, we expect our unit revenue to be essentially flat in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.", "The domestic entity continues to display strong demand in the fourth quarter. Continued capacity discipline has supported consistent unit revenue growth in the last several quarters, and we expect domestic strength to continue into the fourth quarter.", "The Atlantic region is demonstrating improved capacity discipline in the winter period. In the Atlantic, we expect that the United joint venture with Lufthansa and Air Canada will reduce trans-Atlantic capacity by approximately 0.5% this winter, with United down 3%.", "As previously mentioned, our Pacific strategy is yielding solid results. However, we continue to see roughly 20% competitive capacity growth between the U.S. from both Shanghai and Beijing, which is putting pressure on our unit revenue performance as peak summer demand tapers off. Additionally, the weakening yen is applying renewed pressure on our Narita flying. We expect the combination of these 2 factors, as well as increasing stage lengths due to our newly launched margin-accretive Pacific routes, to provide approximately 1.5% headwind to our consolidated PRASM performance for the fourth quarter.", "In spite of these challenges, the Pacific remains a solidly profitable entity for United and continues to be one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. United is the best-positioned U.S. carrier to capitalize on this growth in the future.", "In the Latin markets, we will grow our capacity in the fourth quarter, along with many of our peers. We expect to grow our seasonal capacity by double digits in the high-demand fourth quarter, driven primarily by capacity expansion in the beach markets. This fourth quarter, seasonal growth allows us to more opportunistically and efficiently redeploy marginal capacity from elsewhere in the network on a seasonal and day-of-week basis. However, as is often the case with significant capacity additions, we expect to face PRASM pressure in the Latin entity in the fourth quarter but believe these additions will be profit maximizing for the overall network.", "Turning to our consolidated capacity. We expect our consolidated capacity in the fourth quarter to grow 0.5% to 1.5% year-over-year. As we look toward 2015, we expect to grow consolidated capacity by 1.5% to 2.5% for the full year, with 0.5% to 1.5% growth in our domestic entity. This growth will be very efficient. Approximately half of this growth will come from the installation of slimline seats and up-gauging of aircraft. The remaining growth will come largely from increasing the utilization of our fleet as our improving operation permits us to reduce spares and the completion of aircraft modification programs allows us to return aircraft to regular service. At United, we remain committed to growing capacity below GDP, as we believe this strategy will generate the best opportunity for margin expansion.", "In conclusion, I am pleased with our continued improvement in revenue management, network planning and our express operation, and am excited about the many significant opportunities we have ahead of us.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.", "Gregory L. Hart", "Thanks, Jim.", "I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their tremendous efforts in the third quarter. This quarter presented many unexpected operational challenges, like the fire at the FAA facility in Aurora, and we appreciate their hard work and dedication to transforming United into a more efficient flyer-friendly airline.", "At United, we are reinventing the airline from an operational standpoint and are focused on becoming better and more efficient in everything we do. Over the last year, we have transformed our approach to the business. We don't take past practices as a given. Instead, we challenge ourselves to find new and better ways for everything we do each and every day. When we talk about reinventing the business from an operations perspective, we think of it in 3 broad categories: reducing variability, leveraging technology to improve our handling of irregular operations and streamlining and simplifying our operations.", "We have many initiatives underway to reduce the variability in our operations. One example is more effectively positioning spare parts into the appropriate stations where they are needed. Through this effort, we've reduced spare parts-related cancellations in the third quarter by more than 20% year-over-year. This improvement in reliability allows us to reduce the number of spare aircraft, which in turn improves fleet utilization and revenue.", "We are also taking steps to improve our reaction to and recovery from irregular operations, which are largely driven by weather and air traffic control delays. Our goal is to more effectively run the operation during irregular events and then rebuild our airline as soon as the event passes. To improve the operation during such events, we are deploying technology solutions to more strategically cancel flights in more opportunistically route passengers around impacted regions. We are also developing new mobile tools for our airport agents to more quickly assist passengers during irregular operations. For example, these tools will allow roaming agents to scan boarding passengers in order to quickly assist passengers in determining optimal rerouting opportunities.", "We also have significant opportunities to streamline and simplify our operations. There are numerous initiatives underway focused on driving efficiencies through simplification. As mentioned on the previous earnings call, we are reducing the number of express carriers operating in each hub. At the same time, we are reducing express fleet combinations in several airports. As an example, in Washington Dulles, we are going from 8 express aircraft types down to 5. These simplification efforts allow us to reduce the number of express maintenance spaces by nearly 25% through base consolidation.", "While we are proud of the improvements we are making in the operation, we're excited about the many opportunities we have to make us a more reliable and efficient airline. With our assets, dedicated employees and ability to execute, we expect to continue to improve our operation over the coming quarters.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John D. Rainey", "Thanks, Greg. And thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning.", "I want to reiterate my appreciation to the United team for their hard work this quarter. Throughout the company, our employees are making meaningful improvements to United, and I appreciate their efforts.", "Today, we reported $1.1 billion of pretax income for the third quarter. Our third quarter earnings per diluted share were $2.75, nearly double our earnings per share in the third quarter of last year. Our return on invested capital over the trailing 12-month period reached 12.3%, the highest result in the last 3 years. Our operating margin was 11.7% and our pretax margin was 10.2%, both more than 450 basis points higher than last year. We're pleased with the continued financial improvement we've made, and we're excited about our opportunity to significantly grow earnings. We are all working hard to increase our revenue and improve our efficiency to generate the level of earnings we and our shareholders expect.", "Our third quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, increased 1% year-over-year. We are continuing to make good progress on our Project Quality initiative. This year, we expect to achieve nearly $200 million of fuel savings and now expect over $300 million of nonfuel savings. Our full year estimate for both of these numbers has increased with each quarter this year as we continued to perform better than our original expectations.", "A key component of the nonfuel savings is productivity, and we continue to make great progress in this area. This quarter, we improved productivity by 4%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter in which our productivity has increased, keeping us on track to achieve our 2014 goal of a 3% improvement. We expect fourth quarter nonfuel CASM to increase between 1.25% and 2.25%, resulting in a full year CASM estimate in line with our original guidance despite a 1 point reduction in our capacity projection that we provided at the beginning of the year.", "In the third quarter, we returned $220 million to shareholders through a combination of an accelerated share repurchase program and open-market transactions. We are pleased with the early progress we've made on our $1 billion share buyback program, and we will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares over the coming quarters.", "We're making good progress improving our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we redeemed the entire $800 million of our 6.75% secured notes. At the same time, we closed on a transaction under our existing $1.9 billion credit facility, in which we increased the size of our undrawn revolver by $350 million to a total of $1.35 billion and also issued an additional $500 million tranche of term loan debt.", "We've also made meaningful progress in reducing our convertible debt. Earlier this month, we retired all $248 million of our 6% convertible preferred securities due in 2030. We also issued a redemption notice for the remaining $56 million of our 6% convertible debt due in 2029. Furthermore, in January 2015, the $202 million outstanding of our 4.5% convertible notes will mature. Following that maturity, we will no longer have any outstanding convertible debt. This represents a $1.9 billion reduction in convertible debt since the merger.", "These transactions are representative of our stated long-term goal to reduce gross debt to $15 billion while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity.", "Our capital expenditures in the third quarter were $493 million, and in the fourth quarter, we expect to spend approximately $1 billion. We plan to take delivery of 5 737-900ERs, 1 787-8, 1 787-9 and 11 E175s in the quarter. Apart from the additional E175s that Jim already mentioned, earlier in the quarter, we announced an agreement with Boeing to convert 7 787-8s delivering between 2017 and 2018 into larger, more efficient 787-10s that will be delivered in 2022 and beyond. In addition, we recently decided to retain 11 767-300ER aircraft that we had originally planned to retire and will invest in these aircraft with new interiors, winglets and reliability modifications to extend the useful life of these aircraft into the next decade.", "In addition, we continue to explore the used-aircraft market to find suitable aircraft that will allow us to reduce CapEx and rightsize our fleet without substantially increasing fleet complexity. For example, we recently reached an agreement to purchase 2 used 737-700s to backfill flying as 50-seaters exit the fleet. These changes to the fleet plan demonstrate our discipline in managing our capital allocation.", "I'm encouraged by our third quarter performance and the progress we're making to expand revenue, reduce costs, improve the balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. Through these actions, we're expanding earnings and demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.", "I'll now turn it over to Jonathan to open up the call for questions.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thank you, John. First, we will take questions from the analyst community. Then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker on the line.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "GDP forecasts keep changing on an almost daily basis. Can you just talk about the leverage you have to adjust capacity either if GDP slows from current forecasts for next year, or accelerates?", "James E. Compton", "Helane, this is Jim. We have a history of creating a flexible fleet plan. And that is, clearly, as we head into 2015, we have the ability to adjust our capacity to economic changes. We kind of gauge GDP forecast based on consensus out there, so you're right, it does move around, but we do have the ability, with utilization of the aircraft, working really closely with our tech ops team to more finely tune when we can do work on airplanes, to also adjust to that. So the history of a flexible fleet plan continues for us, and we have great flexibility to adjust to the economic environment, and we will. We'll -- it is about keeping demand and capacity in line, and that's what we're really focused on.", "Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up question to that capacity comment you made about Chicago going to more seats per departure and fewer departures per day. Are you worried that competitors will come in and backfill what you're doing with additional capacity?", "John D. Rainey", "Helane, it's really -- it's obviously a very competitive business that we're in. And so that schedule that we'll be building in Chicago will be a very attractive schedule to the business passenger as well as the leisure passenger. So we're confident with the seat growth that we applied by up-gauging that we'll be very competitive in the market.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker on the line.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "You basically halved the operating margin deficit relative to Delta, but it looks like you're guiding for a bit of slippage in the fourth quarter. You have explained why. That's fine. If we'd set aside the first quarter of next year, where we at least hope that you're going to have ridiculously easy weather comps, in what quarter next year do you expect the initiatives that you've been talking about here to be showing the most relative momentum to the industry? And furthermore, do you have an internal target as to where you'd want your relative margins to be by the end of next year? And I'm not trying to pry guidance out of you. I'm just curious as to whether you believe you can achieve margin parity with other best-in-class operators. If you think you can, when?", "John D. Rainey", "Jamie, this is John. I'll tell you I can't predict necessarily what other carriers are going to do. I'm going to tell you that we're focused on United Airlines and what we can do to create value for our shareholders. We recognize we have some further improving to do. This was a record profit for us this quarter. Our guidance in the fourth quarter would lead you to what is also a record profit for United in the fourth quarter. We talked about our desire to make money in the first quarter, and we want to continue to expand earnings. We are only about 25% of the way through our Project Quality initiative. We're in the very early stages of our revenue initiative. And so we think that we've got a lot of improvement, a lot of opportunity in front of us. We would all like to close that margin gap as soon as possible. I promise you that the team here is extremely focused on it. We don't like our relative place in the industry. That's a fact. And we think that we've got a lot of opportunity to improve.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Excellent. And a follow-up for Jim Compton. Ultimately, Jim, what solved the China problem? And I only ask because, again bringing up Delta, I think they have a decent solution for Tokyo longer term. It's called Seattle. But in your case, it's tough for me to see what you can actually do about China until such time that your competitors there suddenly wake up and choose to focus on returns. I mean, is there a better Chinese strategy other than simply hope?", "James E. Compton", "Jamie, we're -- obviously, China is a big part of our network and very profitable part of our network. It's a very strong, growing part of the world. From a demand perspective, we continue to expect that. So our footprint there, we think, is the best positioned. I'll tell you we don't -- our strategy is well beyond hope. And if you think about the things that we're doing with the flexibility of our fleet, the 787 San Francisco to Chengdu is a perfect example of that, that we're tapping into that growth in China in ways that, quite frankly, our competitors can't as we continue to match capacity and demand. So we call it our second phase of our Pacific. That's combined with what we're doing in Tokyo with our JV partner to put the flying out of Narita, work with them much close down [ph] the connections, but as it is in China, we're well positioned. And we feel we have lots of opportunity to do well as that market continues to grow.", "Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Is there much regulatory appetite for potential JV immunization with Chinese carriers?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "Jamie, this is Jeff. We're not going to be able to get JVs with, for example, our partner in China until China goes open skies, as that -- but with whatever period of time it takes. Clearly, that's something we would be keenly interested in were we do have the regulatory authority to do that, but we don't have that yet.", "James E. Compton", "And Jamie, I would add to Jeff's comments. Working with their [ph] China, some of the success of Chengdu being ahead of our expectations is the connections that they're building for us in Chengdu. So we'll continue to work that from an alliance perspective with our Star partners.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "A question for John. I don't mean for this to sound antagonistic at all, I don't, but I can't think of another way to ask it. So if a company doesn't qualify for hedge accounting, doesn't that mean that the company is just speculating with commodity derivatives that don't correlate to the price of the commodities that they use?", "John D. Rainey", "Not necessarily, Jamie. The accounting rules around getting hedge accounting treatment, I'll give you one example. If you don't have an equal number of bought and sold call and put positions, that doesn't allow you to get hedge accounting. You have to -- so for example, if you did a caller -- a bought call and a sold put, you get hedge accounting, but if you were to then go out and mitigate the costs of that by selling a call at the high end, say, a $140 Brent [ph], that precludes you being able to get hedge accounting. I'll tell you that our hedge philosophy here is one of risk management. This is our single largest expense. It represents $12 billion to $13 billion for us annually. We think that taking some risk off the table in the near term is a prudent thing to do. We've -- I -- we've had this discussion before with you. I know that, philosophically, we agree that, long term, the industry needs to be able to adjust capacity and, therefore, its prices to compensate for its price inputs. Given the nature of our business, that we sell tickets 330 days in advance, that we schedule employees for many months in advance sometimes, it's difficult to adjust capacity in the very near term, which is why our hedge position is more heavily weighted call set.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC", "And a little bit more on the previous question. In terms of open skies with China, Jeff, do you believe that a pacing item for open skies to occur -- because if you look at prior open skies agreements with the Japanese and with the EU, it's some sort of free-market concept for slot-controlled airports, so is it fair to assume that we should pretty much never assume China is ever going to grant open skies because they're not going to relinquish control over slots at Beijing and Shanghai?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "I don't know. It's a good question, Hunter, and I don't know the answer to it. I think that, that's going to require work by U.S. carriers pushing our own government to be flexible and to make sure that there are a fair allocation of slots to U.S. carriers. And as I -- as you allude to, our government's experience with Japan, in particular with Haneda, is a good example of that. That's a difficult process. What I -- I wasn't predicting necessarily a near-term open skies agreement with China. I was just saying that, if there were one, it would be necessary. That's a predicate to having a joint venture.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg on the line.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a couple here. Jim, appreciate that you gave us the quarterly PRASM guide and highlighted the headwind. Can you give us maybe an early read on October? And I'm asking because I know, last year, we did have the government shutdown. And as I recall, I think that was a -- maybe it was a 1 point, 1.5 points headwind. Any color on October, how things are shaping up?", "James E. Compton", "Mike, to be -- we're not -- don't comment on a specific month, but you're right just in terms of last year with the government shutdown in the beginning of the month and then it's coming back about October 16 last year. There was clearly, from a government traffic as well as business traffic associated with government-type fares, strength year-over-year in that area. And we did see that so far in October. We're now back to year-over-year where the government shutdown was over.", "Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just my second question, on the seasonal shaping. As we move into the early part of 2015, conceptually, it does make a lot of sense to really ramp up when demand is strongest, but given the adjustments there on capacity, you highlighted the trans-Atlantic numbers, can you talk about just some of the potential execution risks here? I mean is this -- could we see this go very wrong? Or do you feel like you have the systems, the controls, the ability to move people around? I mean I know there've been some structural changes, like on how you staff up at airports, for example, and the way some of the new contracts have been structured. I mean just highlight some of the things that we should be looking for so that we know that -- to go from X to X plus 20% on capacity, in particular markets, that you're operating well.", "James E. Compton", "Mike, this is Jim again. The -- what we're doing with the seasonal capacity turn [ph] is a process internally that we've started a long time ago. And by that, I mean the network planning group has worked hand-in-hand with our operations folks. Because you're right, there is a lot of coordination in terms of having utilization of the aircraft there, the crews and so forth; and the ability for the stations to handle the schedule. So we're really confident where we're at in this because the process began a long time ago and we're right on time line for the execution to go very well. And we're excited about it because, obviously, that peak summer demand will drive -- for the full year, we talk about adding 0.5 point of PRASM to our trans-Atlantic entity in 2015 with this network change that we're doing.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have a John Godyn on the line.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just one on costs and one on capacity. First, on costs. John, you had some good commentary about how you're tracking versus the cost-reduction plan that was announced toward the end of 2013. I'm curious if you could just speak to whether opportunities are being pushed forward or outright upside to the plan is being created and how we might revise the sort of $1 billion fuel and $1 billion x fuel numbers if in fact there is now being sort of upside being found?", "John D. Rainey", "John, it's a good question. And I would characterize our progress thus far as really more -- the opportunity has been greater than what we expected on the initiatives that we've embarked on rather than sliding forward initiatives. There have been some exceptions, but they -- those go both ways. When you get into this, some things take longer than you expect, and some things, you can accelerate. But generally, what we've seen is, where there had been opportunities, we've exceeded our expectations. And I really credit the employees for this. This is just, across-the-board, you see every single work group where there's a real drive for efficiency. I'll give you an example: In the third quarter, overtime in our maintenance group was about 2 points better year-over-year. And that doesn't really mean much just in terms of dollars in that statement, but 1 point in overtime change for maintenance is about $10 million to $12 million annually. And this is just really running a better, more efficient operation, and you see that in the bottom line. And that's one example. We see it in our res [ph] group. We see it in our airport groups. We've got better staffing with our flight attendants. There's really a huge drive across the company, and clearly, everyone is on board.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And if this is really sort of -- momentum and a cultural dynamic in the background, it sounds like it could last even for the next few years. I wonder, is it possible that, by the end of this plan, we find that we're hundreds of millions of dollars above the $1 billion x fuel and $1 billion fuel that you outlined at the end of 2013?", "Jeffery A. Smisek", "John, this is Jeff. I mean one of the things -- the point you make is a very good point. One thing is that this Project Quality is designed to deliver $2 billion of efficiencies annual cost savings by 2017, but it's not going to end in 2017. What we're instilling here is a culture of efficiency and continuous improvement, something that this industry has woefully lacked, candidly. And so we have -- we -- this is a first step of what we're doing. We have a lot of confidence in achieving our -- the goals that we set forth at in November of 2013, but it won't stop in 2017. This is a way of thinking. This is a way of questioning how and why we do things and how we can do things more efficiently, better for our employees, better for our customers and clearly better for our bottom line.", "John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And if I could just ask a question on capacity. Jim, you offered a lot of sort of tactical commentary in the short term about how you're managing different market dynamics, but when I think about the 2015 guidance and the fact that you're still growing a bit faster in international than in domestic, I just wonder. Is there appetite for maybe more structural change to how you think about international versus domestic? Because your overweight position in international still comes up as one of the largest risk factors, at least in my conversations with investors.", "James E. Compton", "John, this is Jim. Your -- the capacity guidance, let me put a little context around the international piece of 2015 because, as we've talked a lot about the seasonal shaping of trans-Atlantic, that really implies really low single-digit capacity growth for the Atlantic entity in 2015. As you think about Latin America, in terms of routes that make a lot of sense for us to complete our portfolio, we are beginning this year adding Houston-to-Santiago. It's, for a long time, been a big ask from our corporate partners, to serve that market. So we're very excited about it. So 2015, in that sense, becomes a run rate of that new market that we're very excited about. So it's very strategic in terms of what we're trying to do from a business side. We also are starting in this year Denver-to-Panama, and so the run rate of that market is also going to grow. And then the rest is -- what I mentioned in my script is we're seeing really strong demands in the beach markets. And so for instance, we can take a Chicago-LaGuardia trip on a Saturday and fly from Chicago to Cancun on that same Saturday. And well, it generates a lot of incremental capacity into Latin America, but from a margin perspective, it's actually very accretive. So the way we think of this of all is in the context of what we're trying to do strategically: beat capacity discipline, build on our strengths and do that with different levers. And one of the levers is some of the seasonality. And so when you think about the Latin, you kind of get into mid-single-digit type of growth in that area with what I described. In the Pacific, just to close that out, we're really excited about starting L.A.-Melbourne this year, and you're going to have the run rate of that. And again, it's as much about ultimately getting out of our tag Sydney-to-Melbourne. That is very expensive for us to operate but allows us to serve Melbourne. The 787-9 becomes the great airplane to South [ph] that will help out run rate capacity in there. And then we have the run rate of San Francisco to Chengdu and San Fran to Taipei on capacity that I have already noted is running ahead of expectations. That kind of gets us in the mid-single digits in the Pacific. So the international capacity, we think fits very well with our capacity discipline, although because of the run rate and some of the things we're doing to beach markets, generates capacity next year at the levels that maybe you're inferring.", "Operator", "From Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, we have Julie Yates on the line.", "Julie Yates Stewart - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I realize it's a little early to be giving 2015 cost guidance and you guys are still in the middle of your budgeting process, but from a high level, how should we be thinking about the nonfuel unit cost growth in 2015, especially in light of the fact that Project Quality seems to be going a little bit better than you originally expected?", "John D. Rainey", "Julie, we've characterized our cost goal as being one where we expect to grow nonfuel costs at something less than inflation. And I appreciate that's a little bit vague, as inflation can bounce around. It's a long-term goal, and we may see that. We may see cost pressures from 1 year to the next, which will cause that to vary. We are, as Jim alluded to, growing more next year than what we did this year. It's obviously easier to keep that number lower, as you're supported by some growth. So we're sticking to that goal. We'll give more clarity at -- over the coming quarter about what our 2015 number is, but we're extremely encouraged by the early progress that we've seen this year. I talked about in my prepared remarks the fact that, despite capacity coming down a full point versus our original expectations, we've been able to hit our cost goals. And so I expect that to bleed over to 2015, and the same performance that we've seen this year will continue into the next year.", "Julie Yates Stewart - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a follow-up on labor. Is there any update on reaching a single contract with either the flight attendant or the technician groups?", "Gregory L. Hart", "This is Greg. We remain in negotiations with our flight attendants. And I'm sure you all saw that we went [indiscernible] our programs [ph] with our flight attendants, which has been very, very well received. And we help -- we hope that is a bridge for an agreement with our flight attendants, which we expect to have happen sometime next year. We are still working with our technicians and obviously are very focused on getting a deal done with those folks as soon as we can as well.", "Julie Yates Stewart - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then how much of a tailwind on labor productivity is it to reach the single contract on the flight attendant side?", "John D. Rainey", "I'm not sure I understand your question, Julie.", "Julie Yates Stewart - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Once you get to the single contract with the flight attendants, I would imagine that you'll be able to recognize greater labor productivity from staffing.", "John D. Rainey", "Right, well, the specifics of the contract, we're still working on. Obviously, we -- there are some inefficiencies just in our system today by having 2 separate collective bargaining agreements with the inefficiencies of staffing, transportation cost, hotels, things like that. So we do expect some benefit from that, but we haven't necessarily quantified that.", "Operator", "From Evercore, we have Duane Pfennigwerth on the line.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of fuel questions, if I could. This move down we've had here, 2 90 [ph] to 2 40 [ph], 2 50 [ph] jet, before taxes and fees, a pretty sharp move. How has that changed your plans, if at all, for 2015 or maybe for the fourth quarter? Does that sort of relate at all to sort of the stage length increase, which is probably implied by that fuel efficiency? And then could you just give us a sense for where you are from a hedge book perspective and the degree to which you're participating in this downward move into 2015?", "John D. Rainey", "Sure. So let me take the last part of your question first, if that's okay. For the fourth quarter, we're 39% hedged. And over the next 12 months, we're about 35% hedged. In terms of our participation, in the fourth quarter, we are participating about 70% to the upside and the downside in fuel movements. And for the 2015, that's more like 80%. So help -- hopefully that helps. In terms of our hedge strategy, our hedge strategy is, part of it has been to be responsive to the overall fuel market. And over the last few years, you've seen that fuel has been relatively ranged bound, and our hedge portfolio has reflected that fact. And I think we fared better than any of our competitors over that period of time. We've seen fuel break out of that range, and I think we're very early on in this. We will look to see if it stabilizes and a new trading band develops, and then our hedge structure will respond to that.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "And then maybe I missed it. Have you offered CapEx guidance for next year yet?", "John D. Rainey", "We have not. We did talk about at Investor Day last year, Duane, our long-term goal of about $2.8 billion to $3 billion over the next few years. We have made some changes. I talked a little bit about some of the changes we've made from a fleet perspective. So that, we would expect that number to move around a little bit. But we'll give you more guidance on that as we get closer to year-end.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I -- it sounds like -- correct me if I'm wrong. It sounds like that pushed some aircraft out, so maybe the bias on that is down. And then just lastly, on the buyback, I think, when you initially announced it, $1 billion over 3 years, and you've taken down over $200 million in the first quarter, so it looks like you'll finish that in a year. Can you just give us a sense for when you would choose to update us on the authorization and how we should be thinking about that timing?", "John D. Rainey", "Well, we're going to take this in steps, Duane. I'm pleased with the fact that we're almost 1/4 of the way through this early on. We've seen some -- a lot of volatility in the market, and it has created some buying opportunities for us. We still think this is a great way to return cash to shareholders given where our stock is trading right now, but I've emphasized before, this is a first step. And when we complete this, or get close to completion, we'll come back to the market with our next step, but I'm not prepared to talk any more about that at this point in time.", "Operator", "And from Barclays, we have David Fintzen on the line.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Maybe a question for John. Just appreciate maybe getting a little ahead of '15 here, but if I look at your absolute nonfuel cost growth, in the last few quarters, you've kept it right around 1 [ph], if not below, in some quarters. As we get out to '15, and obviously there's still a lot to go on Project Quality, are there some other inflationary cost pressures that tick up in '15 versus '14 that would materially start to change that absolute cost profile? Or -- I'm just trying to think through some of the moving pieces into next year.", "John D. Rainey", "Good question, David. There are a couple headwinds. I do not expect it to change that profile. The best example I can give you right now relates to pension. So the discount rate that we use today to discount the liabilities in our pension is about 5.1%. The preliminary look for next year, it looks like it'll be closer to 4.3%, so that will create between $50 million and $100 million of headwind for us next year. There's also an update to the mortality tables for pensions, which is not reflected in our current numbers. But that said, even with those headwinds, we expect to achieve the type of cost performance that we've outlined, so I don't expect it to change the profile that you alluded to.", "David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then maybe a quick one for Jim, on the China -- on the Chinese capacity growth. It's obviously coming from a lot of arguably lesser-known brands from a U.S. perspective. How effective are some of these carriers at competing in the U.S. point of sale?", "James E. Compton", "Well, clearly, their point of sale is more a Chinese point of sale. And -- but I like to -- every competitor is a good competitor, and our goal in competing is to obviously operate and do -- at a really high reliability rate, with a great product. And -- but our point of sale on the U.S. side is stronger than the Chinese point of sale, and you have that dynamic for them also on their side. And clearly, you're right, they're building a brand presence as they grow their presence into the U.S. And so United, with since 1986 being in the market in China, has a strong presence over there to date.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Thomson Reuters, we have Jeffrey Dastin on the line.", "Jeffrey Dastin", "Could you elaborate on the 787-10's conversion? Will there essentially be deferred 787 deliveries?", "John D. Rainey", "Well, our current plan is to defer the deliveries that we expected to take in 2017 and '18 into 2022. We still do hold option positions. Jeff -- or rather, Jim alluded to the fact that fleet flexibility is something that's very important for us to be able to respond to the economic environment yet still do so in a capacity-disciplined manner. But that was the move that we've recently made, yes.", "Operator", "From Flightglobal Media, we have Edward Russell on the line.", "Edward Russell", "Could you elaborate a bit more on the -- looking at used aircraft, first of all, where the 737s you purchased are coming from? And then also, are you looking for narrowbodies, or widebodies?", "John D. Rainey", "Sure. The 737-700s that we obtained were from a leasing company. I don't want to comment on any further on the airline that they came from. But the other part of your question: At this point, we're really more focused on narrowbody lift. Part of the issue that we're solving for is, today, we are too reliant on the 50-seat RJ. It's -- it creates some operational complexities, but there's also, I think, a looming shortage with respect to pilots being able to fly some of those as we look at some of the changes in the training requirements. So what we want to do is backfill some of that capacity in a financially disciplined way. We don't necessarily want to go out and place a brand-new aircraft order that creates several billion dollars more of CapEx. We've talked a lot about having a balanced allocation of cash flow. So this is a way, by looking at the used-aircraft market, that we can still backfill some of that capacity, more narrowbody focused, but do it while still addressing the other cash flow needs that we have.", "Edward Russell", "All right. And can we infer also that you're looking for aircraft that are currently in your fleet, or models at least?", "John D. Rainey", "That's accurate. Any time you look at adding a plane or a new fleet type, there's some complexity with that. There has been some discussion about the 190s. That's something that is on the radar candidly as well. But certainly, if you look at our narrowbody fleet with the Airbus A319s, A320s, the new Jin 737s, those are all planes that fit the profile that we could easily accommodate into our fleet.", "Irene E. Foxhall", "Okay, thanks, everybody. We'll conclude now. We appreciate you all joining us on the call. Please call media relations if you have any further questions. And we'll look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining.

Please go ahead.", "Irene Foxhall", "Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chairman, President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey. Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which Jim will discuss revenue and capacity. Greg will follow with an update on our operations. John will follow that with a review of our costs, fleet and capital structures, after which we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We'd appreciate if you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jonathan Ireland.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thanks, Nene. This morning, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Both are available on our website at ir.united.com.", "Information in this morning's release and investor update and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.

For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor update, copies of which are available on our website. Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffery Smisek", "Thanks, Nene and Jonathan. And thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call.", "Today, we reported pretax earnings of $2 billion for the full year 2014. We earned $5.06 per diluted share, and achieved a pretax margin of 5.1% both significant improvements over last year. ", "In 2014, we focused on improving our operations and customer service driving more revenue and reducing our costs. We are pleased with the progress of our core business leading to a solid year of earnings improvement. We earned over $900 million more than in 2013. Even with the costly storms in the first quarter that disproportionately hit our northern hubs.", "We achieved a 12.9% return on invested capital. Our unit costs came in better than expected. We exceeded our expectations for our project quality efficiency initiative. We grew our unit revenue by 1.6% with many of our revenue initiatives only beginning to take hold. We launched a share buyback program sooner than anticipated, have already returned more than $300 million in the program's first two quarters.", "We paid down expensive debt while financing aircraft at record low interest rates. We took delivery of 35 new aircraft and remodeled three terminals and eight clubs. We improved our operation meaningfully throughout the year. We had an ambitious plan for 2014 and we executed well on nearly every level.", "I want to thank our employees for the progress we made in 2014. Our plans for 2015 call for growing our core earnings and margins, further improving operation, reducing our costs and adding more customer pleasing offerings and service. While we had much work ahead of us to make United the airline we know it can be, we are excited by the terrific opportunities ahead for United, our employees and our shareholders.", "I'd like to take this opportunity to address the recent significant decline in oil prices and its impact on the way we run our business. First we will only grow the airline as demand dictates. The US airline industry has transformed itself over the last several years through consolidation and capacity discipline matching capacity with demand and United will continue its discipline growing capacity less than GDP regardless of the price of oil. We will also be opportunistic with our use of the additional cash we expect to generate as a result of lower fuel prices. We will use this cash to accelerate our path toward longer-term goals we've previously identified including reducing our financial leverage and continuing to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program.", "At United we will continue to improve our operations and customer service, grow our revenue, reduce our costs and appropriately allocate our cash. We had a successful 2014 and I am proud of the progress we made. Our team is excited about the significant opportunity ahead to achieve the level of earnings that we and our shareholders expect.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, Greg and John.", "James Compton", "Thanks, Jeff. I would like to first thank our customers for choosing United. We are working everyday to provide you with reliable service and a flier-friendly experience to the destinations you prefer. We appreciate your business throughout 2014 and we look forward to serving you again this year.", "In the fourth quarter, our unit revenue increased 0.4% slightly higher than our expectations. As we described previously this result was negatively impacted by a 1.5 point headwind due to fourth quarter 2013 interline ticket reconciliations. As this was one-time in nature, it will not reoccur in the subsequent quarters.", "Our three-pronged revenue initiative focused on revenue management, network planning and our express operation continues to deliver solid results. In the fourth quarter we re-banked our schedule in Denver and Houston and we will re-bank our schedule in Chicago in the first quarter. The initial results of our re-banking have met our expectations and connecting yields in Denver and Houston have increased year-over-year. By expanding our connection opportunities in these hubs, we are able to improve the mix of originating and connecting customers.", "We more seasonally shaped our schedule in the fourth quarter by reducing flying during the lower demand shoulder period and expect to increase flying during the higher demand summer period. These changes contributed to the unit revenue results in the Atlantic entity which grew approximately 7% year-over-year. We anticipate the full year 2015 effect across the network to increase both unit revenue and margins.", "During the quarter, we also made good progress consolidating frequencies as we flew larger gauge planes and reduced our alliance on 50-seat aircraft. Frequency consolidation provides several benefits to the airline as it reduces cost, improved reliability, and expand the product offering by providing more premium seats and upsell opportunities.", "In the fourth quarter, our gauge increased on average by 4% while departures decreased by 6%. We will continue to execute on this initiative throughout 2015 and expect our gauge to increase 6% on average for the full year as departures decrease 4%.", "Examples include the Denver to Minneapolis, O'Hare to Cleveland, O'Hare to Philadelphia routes. We continue to overhaul our express operation by reducing the number of 50-seaters in our fleet. In 2014 we removed 39 50-seaters and introduced to 33 Embraer 175 76-seat aircraft. These newer larger gauge airplanes have been very well received by our customers and we have seen an increase in ancillary revenue since their introduction. Ancillary revenue per passenger earned on an E175 is 15% higher than on the 50-seat aircraft they are replacing largely due to having 16 economy plus seats and 12 first class seats. This regional fleet overhaul will continue into 2015 as an additional 71 50-seaters will exit the fleet by the end of the year with 49 additional E175s entering the fleet.", "Some of these E175s will also replace Q400 turboprop aircraft which will begin to leave the fleet this year. This transformation has had a positive impact on the reliability of the regional operation. As our fourth quarter controllable completion rate improved year-over-year with a better product offering and a more reliable service. We expect these actions to generate additional revenue and unit cost benefits in 2015 and beyond. In the fourth quarter, our corporate revenue portfolio increased by 4% year-over-year with strength coming primarily from the technology and healthcare sectors. We have been monitoring the impact of lower oil prices on our energy related corporate traffic. In the fourth quarter, we noticed a small impact and we are working closely with these corporate partners as they begin planning travel for 2015.", "Ancillary revenues continue to grow in the fourth quarter increasing approximately 10% per passenger and we achieved our goal of $3 billion of ancillary revenue in 2014 despite capacity growth being 1.2 points below our plan. With family plus revenue per available Economy Plus seat was up 22% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. To date we have installed Wi-Fi on 451 main line aircrafts and begun installation on our regional fleet. Our streaming video product is now on 194 aircraft and customers give it very positive reviews. Wi-Fi installation will be largely complete by this summer with streaming video installations complete by the end of the year.", "For the first quarter, we anticipate our unit revenue to be essentially flat with several factors contributing to our revenue performance for the quarter. First, our unit revenue outlook is impacted by a shift in revenue from MileagePlus redemption tickets out of the first quarter. This is a result of having new, more accurate data which allows us to recognize passenger revenue in the period in which the customer redeems miles per travel. This does not impact cash or our full year revenue outlook but will provide a headwind of approximately $75 million or about 1 point PRASM year-over-year in the first quarter. Conversely the third quarter and fourth quarter will experience a revenue tailwind of approximately $50 million and $25 million respectively.", "Second, we expect the average stage length of our routes to increase by approximately 1.5% in the quarter. This is mainly the result of restructuring our Pacific network. We now offer our customers a number of connections within Asia through our joint venture partner ANA allowing United to redeploy its aircraft to additional long haul routes from the US. For example, we eliminated certain shorter-haul flights out of Narita such as Hong Kong and Bangkok. In addition we ended our TAB flight between Melbourne and Sydney. In the same period we have added several long haul flights including Los Angeles to Melbourne and San Francisco to Taipei and Chengdu. While these decisions have proven to be margin accretive, they provide approximately 0.5 point of present headwind for the quarter.", "The third factor impacting our PRASM in the quarter is the effect of the strengthening dollar. While a strong dollar is good for our fuel purchasing, it reduces the revenue received from international ticket sales. The impact is somewhat muted because we spend a portion of our foreign currency to pay local expenses. In addition we have entered into currency hedge contracts to protect United from further weakness.", "Over the longer term, we believe that the strengthening dollar will generate additional demand in the US point of sale. For the first quarter, we estimate the foreign exchange impact to be approximately one point of PRASM headwind for the quarter.", "Finally while the domestic entity performed very well in 2014, it showed some signs of softening towards the end of the fourth quarter. We expect this to continue in the first quarter of 2015 with domestic unit revenues expected to be flat to up 2%. These unit revenue headwinds are partially offset by 1.5 point tailwind in the first quarter as we don't anticipate the same bubble of weather related disruption to our operation that we experienced in the first quarter of 2014.", "Turning to capacity. In the first quarter, we expect our consolidated capacity to be between flat and up 1% with domestic to be flat to down 1%. We still expect full year 2015 capacity to increase between 1.5% and 2.5%. With domestic capacity up 0.5% to 1.5%. The major driver of growth is the rollout of slimline seats. We currently have installed these seats on more than 300 aircrafts and installation will be 85% complete by the end of 2015. The remaining capacity growth will largely come from increasing our fleet utilization as our operation improves and the completion of aircraft modification of programs allows us to return aircraft to regular service.", "The impact of high utilization will represent nearly 14 additional aircraft becoming part of our fleet without spending any additional capital.", "In conclusion, I am pleased with the continuing progress of our revenue initiatives. Through the execution of our revenue plan, we are optimizing our network, our schedule, our revenue management practices and our express operation which we expect will lead to meaningful revenue growth in the upcoming quarters.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.", "Gregory Hart", "Thanks, Jim. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their dedicated efforts in 2014. United is turning the corner toward operational excellence and you are the foundation of our success. I especially want to thank our employees for working in the tough winter conditions. Your commitment makes our management proudly part of your team.", "While we made good progress in improving our operating performance, we realized we still have a lot of work to do. Our entire operation teams remains focused on running a better airline and we have 100s of projects underway to support those efforts.", "Today, I would like to talk about 2 initiatives designed to improve our departure and arrival performance. The first is focused on achieving on-time departures. The departure sequence for a flight is a fairly complex orchestration of dozens of activities. We are developing to alert our teams when any one of these take isn\u2019t going according to plan. This will allow our teams to properly address the specific issue and get the process back on track for an on-time departure.", "We are also focused on improving our on-time arrivals. For instance, we have a host of initiatives underway to short the time it takes to arrive at the gate once the plane lands. We are in the early phase of rolling out systems that will allow our pilots to self guide the aircraft into the gate area rather than depend on our ramp agents to guide them in. This will free up our agents to focus on other critical tasks such as plugging the power and air units into the aircraft which will facilitate the timely placement of the jet bridge.", "Additionally we are working with the third party provider to develop a gate management tool that integrates real time information to more proactively manage our gate complexes at our hubs. This will reduce the instances in which our aircraft arrived and are forced to wait for a gate to become available. These initiatives will reduce delays, save on fuel burn and improve the customer experience.", "These are just a few of the many initiatives we have underway to improve the operation. This year will be a crucial year as we executive on our operational targets to become more liable and efficient. I am confident that our dedicated work groups will help bring United's operation to level excellence we all expect.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to John.", "John Rainey", "Thanks, Greg. And thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. I'd also like to thank our employees for all their good work in 2014. Our success is dependent upon the job they do each and every day. Today we reported $462 million of pretax income for the fourth quarter with earnings per diluted share of $1.20 nearly double our earnings per share in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Our fourth quarter pretax margin was 5%, about 200 basis points higher year-over-year. The progress we made in 2014 is reflected in the improvement in our financial performance. Our full year pretax income was $2 billion with earnings per diluted share of $5.06 and a pretax margin of 5.1% approximately 250 basis points higher than last year. We achieved a 12.9% return on invested capital, our stock price increased 77% and we returned approximately $320 million of cash directly to our shareholders since initiating our share repurchase program last summer.", "We also prepaid $310 million of convertible debt that was convertible into 5.8 million shares. Our fourth quarter consolidated chasm excluding fuel, third party business expense and profit sharing increased 1.2% year-over-year. Full year consolidated chasm excluding these items increased 1.3% on roughly flat capacity. Our full year chasm was within our original guidance range of 1% to 2% despite lower capacity on 1.2 points from the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.", "2014 is our first full year of implementing our project quality initiative and we made good progress towards our $2 billion annual cost savings gone. In 2014 we achieved approximately $380 million of non-fuel savings over 25% more than our original expectation. A major driver of the savings was improving productivity. This quarter we improved productivity by 3% marking the 6th consecutive quarter in which our productivity has improved.", "We achieved our full year target of 3% year-over-year improvement and we are on track to achieve our goal of 15% to 20% productivity improvement by 2017. Additionally our fuel efficiency improved 1.3% in 2014 and 2.3% in the fourth quarter driven by more fuel efficient aircraft and improved processes. Using the average 2014 fuel price, our project quality fuel savings were approximately $200 million. We remain on track to achieve a 7% improvement in fuel efficiency by 2017.", "As we have outlined before, our goal is to contain chasm growth to less than inflation. For the first quarter we expect consolidated chasm excluding fuel, profit sharing and third party business expense to be approximately flat. For the full year 2015 we expect consolidated chasm excluding these items to be flat to up 1%. There are some areas of the business where costs are growing faster than inflation. The two most notable items include healthcare expense growing nearly 8% and pension expense which is negatively impacted by the lower discount rates and changes to the mortality tables.", "With our continued progress on our multiyear cost saving initiative, we are able to mute these pressures and expect another year of very good cost performance.", "Turning to fuel expense. In the fourth quarter our average fuel price was $2.83 per gallon which includes $0.25 from settled hedges. We recorded $237 million hedge loss in the quarter which includes approximately $80 million from 2015 positions closed out in fourth quarter. This month we also closed out virtually the entire remaining portion of our first quarter hedge positions. We now expect to incur $190 million in hedge losses for the first quarter.", "In the first quarter we expect our average fuel price per gallon to be between $1.96 and $2.01 per gallon including the impact of sold hedges. Our current full year hedge position allows us to participate in 84% of any future declines in the price of oil. Based on the January 15th forward curve, our existing opened 2015 hedges beyond the first quarter or in a loss position of approximately $680 million. Using the mid points of the guidance we have provided, we expect our pretax margin to be between 5 and 7% in the first quarter.", "We continue to take steps to strengthen our balance sheet. In 2014 we prepaid over $1.5 billion of debt including $248 million of our 6% convertible debt due 2030 that was prepaid in the fourth quarter. Additionally this month the last of our remaining convertible debt matured and in total we have eliminated $1.9 billion of convertible debt since the merger.", "We also continue to finance aircraft at very low rates including our most recent double ETC transaction which had a blended interest rate of 3.9%. As a result of these and other transactions our 2014 interest expense was approximately $50 million lower year-over-year. Our capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $1 billion and $3.1 billion for the full year.", "We expect full year 2015 capital expenditures to be between $3 billion and $3.2 billion. In 2015 we expect to take delivery of 11 787-9s, 23 737-900ERs, 2 used 737-700s, and 49 E175s 11 of which will go into our balance sheet.", "As we have expressed in the past, we want to replace many of the 50-seat aircraft in our fleet today. To do this in a disciplined manner, we are continuing to explore opportunities in the used aircraft market to replace some of these aircrafts without appreciably increasing our capital expenditures.", "In addition to taking advantage of the used aircraft market, we are making investments in our existing fleet to extend the useful life and better utilize the assets that we have as displayed by our recent decision to extend the life of some of our 767 300s. Including the $3 billion to $3.2 billion of CapEx in 2015, we now expect average annual CapEx of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion over the next three or four years.", "In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $100 million of United common stock and spend $248 million to retire convertible debt that was convertible into approximately 4.3 million shares.", "In 2014 we spend more than $600 million returning value to our shareholders through our share buyback program and the retirement of convertible debt. We are pleased with the early progress we've made in our $1 billion share buyback program and will continue to opportunistically repurchase additional shares over the coming quarters.", "I want to take a moment to address United's outlook on capital allocation in the current low fuel price environment. We will continue to allocate capital in a manner to maximize shareholder value. It's reasonable to assume that we could accelerate our share buyback that cash flows turn out to be better than what we originally expected at the inception of this program. We will also continue to de-lever and at a pace that will allow us to achieve some of our capital structure goals more quickly than previously planned.", "In conclusion, I am pleased with our progress last year but even more exited about the opportunity in 2015. We will build on our solid foundation to increase revenue, control cost, improve the balance sheet, and return cash to shareholders. Through these actions we will expand core earnings and demonstrate our commitment to increasing shareholder value.", "I will now turn it over to Jonathan to open up the call for questions.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thank you, John. First, we will take questions from the analyst community. Then we will take questions from the media. Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg on the line. Please go ahead.", "Michael Linenberg", "Hey, good morning everybody. Hey, I think Jim brought this up but maybe this is a question for John. Just with respect to currency hedging, that's I guess something that we haven't seen you do in some time and you mentioned that you had entered into a position. What currencies, what are the positions that strikes details on that would be great?", "John Rainey", "Sure Mike. So the four areas where we have the most exposure are China, Europe, the Canadian dollar, and the Japanese Yen. In the past we have hedged more in the Yen. Going forward into 2015 the only hedges we have in place were only euro, and we are hedged about 60% of our exposure at a rate of about 122. ", "Michael Linenberg", "Okay, that's perfect. And then just my second question, and this is maybe its John or Jim. Just looking at your fleet plan, I did see that it looks like you are going to retire two of your 74s by the end of this year and I just sort of think about the movement in fuel prices and the amount of money that you put into those airplanes to get their reliability up. I know there were some modifications. You've upgraded the entertainment options. What's driving that and then what replaces that. What do you have in mind? I mean I know there's been some headlines out there that you are looking at some of the larger 777s. I am not sure if they are incremental or if they would come from the current order book. Just -- I guess there's a bunch of questions in that. Thanks. Sorry.", "John Rainey", "Let me start with the 747s. You are right Mike, we have made some improvement to the interiors of those plains. Anytime we look at the retirement schedule for any fleet you often take into account when heavy maintenance events come due, and in particular these 747s, this is a good time to retire those. We still intend to keep the remaining portion of the fleet for some period of time.", "With respect to backfilling that, we are taking delivery of some Dash 9s this year and of course you have seen some speculation in the press about the 777 300 order. That is an aircraft that interests us. I don't want to necessarily comment on the rumors out there in the press. I will say that we have the ability to negotiate substitution rights with our manufacturers and so that is something that we are looking at.", "Jeffery Smisek", "But just -- this is Jeff -- just to be clear, those -- the rumored 777s that are rumored that we are looking at are not incremental airways.", "Michael Linenberg", "Great. Thanks Jeff, thanks John.", "Operator", "From Credit Suisse we have Julie Yates on the line. Please go ahead.", "Julie Yates", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "Jeffery Smisek", "Hi Julie.", "Julie Yates", "I would like to revisit the first quarter unit revenue guide and understanding there's certainly a lot of moving pieces here. But the last three quarters you've outpaced your initial PRASM guidance by about an average of 100 basis points at the midpoint. And should we think about a similar level of conservatism here with potential to outperform the initial guide or there's specific headwinds that will make that less likely?", "James Compton", "Hey Julie, this is Jim. When we guide we guide on the best information we have at the time. And so as I talk about the first quarter we wanted to line out exactly the tailwinds of weather last year that was contributing 1.2 PRASM for us in the first quarter but offset by the other items that I talked about whether be the MileagePlus, the stage length or the foreign exchange. So a net impact of 1 point there. That being said, I will tell you the revenue teams always focus on beating where we are at but what we guide to is the information that we have now. But the revenue team, the sales team across the network is always working really hard to improve on that.", "Julie Yates", "Okay. And then just the softness in the domestic market that you referenced towards the end of the fourth quarter. What do you attribute this to? Is this broad-based or more concentrated in some of your top hubs like Houston that might be feeling an impact from the fallen oil?", "James Compton", "Julie, what I was wanting to point out in regards to kind of guiding to the first quarter particularly the domestic is that we did see in the fourth quarter a progression so that if you combine the months from November and December to eliminate all the holiday movements and things like that, the November, December -- really industry domestic as well as for us growth rates were less than the previous months during the year and we want to highlight that as a base. So that was more broad-based. I wouldn't -- there were no specific entities or sectors that would be specific to that. What we want to kind of re-step what we were thinking about in the first quarter that some of that deceleration we actually saw in the combined November, December months.", "Julie Yates", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research we have Hunter Keay on the line. Please go ahead.", "Hunter Keay", "Hey, good morning everybody.", "John Rainey", "Good morning Hunter.", "Hunter Keay", "John, does the full year share count guidance include any assumptions for share buyback.", "John Rainey", "No, it is not.", "Hunter Keay", "Okay, that's good. And maybe one for Jim. Jim you made a comment about how re-banking I think Denver and Houston improved the mix of connecting and local traffic, I would have thought that re-banking would improve -- would actually increase the volume of connecting traffic. So it's a two part question. Where does your connecting and local traffic go from and too before the re-banks. Then when you said it improved the mix were you just talking about a higher-yielding connecting passenger? ", "James Compton", "Hey Hunter, I did talk about yield. The -- what we saw was an increase in the connecting passengers in both hubs. What we saw was a greater change in the mix of passengers with that. You are correct as you bring the hubs tighter, you create more connecting opportunities participate within the industry, but at the same time you also allow the revenue management just to really work that increased demand. And what we are excited about is we actually saw a greater increase in yield relative to our overall yield. But we did also see an increase in passengers.", "Hunter Keay", "And what was the -- can you give me like some broad high-level changes in what the percentage shift was from local to connecting in the hubs? Was it five percentage points, something like that?", "James Compton", "Yes, I am not going to disclose that.", "Hunter Keay", "Okay.", "James Compton", "But again I will emphasize that we saw an increase in passengers that are even greater increase than yields. So we are very excited about the initiative.", "Hunter Keay", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "From Buckingham Research we have Dan McKenzie on line. Please go ahead. Dan McKenzie, your line is open.", "Dan McKenzie", "Yes, hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for the time here. One house-cleaning question, what were the remaining NOLs at December 31st?", "John Rainey", "The NOLs, Dan?", "Dan McKenzie", "Yes.", "John Rainey", "There were about 10 billion or 11 billion.", "Dan McKenzie", "Okay very good. And then secondly, I'm hoping you can just clarify for us all here. How much weight should we assign to booking data that is publicly available? You guys have the ability to see it, what are the puts and takes? And the reason I ask is, I just got too many calls to count from investors wondering if demand was weakening further out this year. So I guess I'm just wondering how do we interpret the data, and is there anything that you are seeing that worries you further out at this point?", "James Compton", "Hey Dan, this is Jim. You are right. I think some of the public data is never going to be -- obviously not the full picture and we have the full picture because of our direct channels and so forth and we are really comfortable with your demand levels right now. And over the next 6 weeks in terms of our book load factoring that across the system. So we are comfortable with where they are at and it fits in well with the guidance that we gave in terms of PRASM. ", "Dan McKenzie", "Okay, thanks so much guys.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan we have Jamie Baker on line. Please go ahead. ", "Jamie Baker", "Hey, good morning everybody. Like Mike I am interested in the reports about swapping 78s for 777-300ERs. I don't expect you to comment directly on the negotiations per se, but I'm interested in when the discussions began and the extent to which fuel might've been a catalyst. If this is something that you started discussing with Boeing a year ago, that's says one thing, but if this is just a more of a -- I don't know -- a post-OPEC phenomenon, it tells us something different. Any color there?", "James Compton", "Well Jamie, I am not going to comment on discussions if there are any that are talking place. I will say that we take a very long-term perspective with respect to fleet planning.", "These are assets that we fly for 25 years to 30 years. If we are so fortunate that fuel prices remain at this level for years to come, we might adjust our view on what fuel prices we use when we make these fleet investment decisions. But for right now, we are still assuming the same fuel prices that we've used or the level that we've seen over the last few years, which is the $120 to $125 jet fuel.", "Jamie Baker", "Okay, fair enough. And Jeff, in your prepared remarks you said that you would size the airline to demand and I assume that comment was meant to allay any concern that lower fuel would mean an increase in capacity. Does the comment cut both ways? I am not of the view that revenue falls off a cliff, but if we do see fuel stay here and demand materially suffer for whatever reason, would you shrink the airline further, or would you simply maintain capacity until such time that most of the fuel price cushion had eroded?", "Jeffery Smisek", "No, Jamie, we're going to run the airline for profit maximization, and we're not going to be making decisions on any sort of short-term basis. We are very focused on maintaining capacity discipline vis-\u00e0-vis GDP. And we're going to continue that irrespective of what the fuel price is. Irrespective of fuel price, if demand were to fall off, we would appropriately size the airline to it as we always have. If demand were to grow, if GDP were to grow, we would appropriately size the airline over time to that too.", "Jamie Baker", "Excellent, that's what I was hoping to hear and thanks for the solid guide this morning. Take care.", "Jeffery Smisek", "Thanks.", "Operator", "From Cowen and Company we have Helane Becker on the line. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker", "Thanks operator. Hi everybody. Thanks for the time. I have two questions. One is as we think about the project quality initiative in fuel costs; I think you said that you were looking at 7% efficiency. So how should we think about the decline in jet fuel? Does that make it harder for you to achieve that, or does it make it easier for you? And is there any change to the $2 billion number as a result?", "John Rainey", "Helane, this is John. When we set that target at the end of 2013, we assumed a price per barrel of again roughly $100 to $125 jet fuel. And that is how we arrived at the $1 billion in savings. Obviously, as jet fuel has plummeted over the last few months, that eats away at the dollar amount of those savings that would be realized but fuel swings both ways. And the thing that we're focused on is the efficiency gain. We are absolutely laser-focused on achieving the 7% efficiency improvement between 2013 and 2017 because just as that potentially has swung to a $500 million or $600 million benefit today, that could be $1.5 billion to $2 billion in the future.", "Helane Becker", "Okay, and then my other question is something you said with respect to Denver. Can you parse out how much of the benefit that you've seen in Denver is a result of changes that Frontier has actually been making? Or is the shift in mix all related to the changes that you've been making?", "James Compton", "Hey Helene, this is Jim. We've been very focused on Denver and the team in Denver has done an incredible job over the last couple of years as the market -- the competition has either reshaped itself or adjusted in the market. But we are talking about the benefits are clearly a result of tightening up the bank. So the other benefits we are receiving in Denver are separate from that, but that Denver has been performing very well for us and the team has done a terrific job there.", "Helane Becker", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "From Evercore we have Duane Pfennigwerth on the line. Please go ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Hey, good morning, thanks. Wonder if you could -- and obviously your guidance is very strong here into the first quarter, but wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on your percentage of revenue that comes from the energy industry and any additional detail you can give on the early signs of softness that you referred to in the fourth quarter?", "James Compton", "Yes, hi, this is Jim. We don't disclose the absolute percent that's associated to the energy. We are -- and partly because it affects the network in many different ways. One of the specific ways, though, is through our corporate partners and the work we do with our partners in the energy sector. And historically, our sales team has always had a very close relationship with them. Over the years as oil has gone up and down, we've always worked very closely with them and how we can help them in their travel needs and understand their travel needs.", "So today, the corporate salesforce team is in those discussions with those companies to get a sense of what they're seeing in terms of 2015. As expected, as we've seen in the past, they are looking at all their costs as they reject -- as they react to the lower oil prices in their industry. But to this date, we've seen just a small impact from our corporate business that we can measure very closely. But we'll stay on top of it and monitor it as we go through the year.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Okay. John, could you just remind us how much is left on your capital return program? And then how do you think about it -- I appreciate those comments that as cash flows higher, it would be either debt reduction or buyback, but how do you think about kind of updating the market about size of that program?", "John Rainey", "We've achieved or completed about $320 million of buybacks thus far. So we've got $680 million to go, and we are very focused on the existing buyback program that we have in place. As cash flows come in better than what we expected, I think it's reasonable to assume, as I said, that we can accelerate that.", "And the timeframe is yet to be determined on that, but we are very focused on properly balancing capital allocation and an important component of that is returning cash to shareholders. So this, as we've said, is an evolution. This was our first step and we hope to build on that.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley we have Bill Greene on the line. Please go ahead.", "Bill Greene", "Yes, hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about whether you think that the increase in the industry's overall returns will cause the industry domestically to start to lose some of this discipline that you and Delta have both highlighted on their calls as it relates to capacity. Do you worry at all about that, or is that something that you think is not likely to happen given the structure we've got today?", "Jeffery Smisek", "Bill, this is Jeff. Look, we can only speak to United. We will absolutely not lose our capacity to split. We found that to be very healthy for us. It's clearly very healthy for the industry, and we're committed to it.", "Bill Greene", "Make sense. Do you feel like overseas we have more of a reason to worry, given that you would think that this lower fuel price will help Asian carriers quite a bit, for example? Do we have reason to worry about capacity growth overseas in a bigger way?", "Jeffery Smisek", "Well, I do think that the capacity of discipline that has been shown by US carriers is not necessarily shown by international carriers. And I think that that's certainly a possibility, particularly in areas worth with a lot of growth such as low-cost carriers in Asia.", "Bill Greene", "Right. Okay, great, thanks for the time.", "Jeffery Smisek", "Thanks Bill.", "Operator", "From Stifel we have Joe DeNardi on the line. Please go ahead.", "Joe DeNardi", "Hey, good morning, thank you. John, on the capital deployment side, is a dividend just kind of not on the radar at this point, or what would you need to see to maybe consider that?", "John Rainey", "It's not on the radar in so much as we are focused on our existing share repurchase program. We have a lot of discussions as a management team and with our Board on the right way to allocate capital. We still believe that the reasons that we're behind the share repurchase program or are still there today in the sense that we don't think that we are trading at our fair value. If you look at our market cap compared to our peers and our conviction in the plan that we have in place to get us where we need to be, that there's still a lot of opportunity to buy back stock at discounted prices to the intrinsic value.", "Joe DeNardi", "Okay, yes, that makes sense. And then in terms of the team's expectations with regard to fuel surcharges coming down internationally, what are your expectations for how that plays out through the year?", "James Compton", "Hey Joe, this is Jim. We don't comment on future pricing. I will say there are -- for instance, in Japan it's by law indexed, and so we expect obviously that will move as the rules of that index move and so we'll see it there. But in terms of international surcharges, we don't comment on pricing.", "Operator", "From Barclays we have David Fintzen on the line. Please go ahead.", "David Fintzen", "Hey, good morning everyone. A couple of questions for Jim. Just one following up on a bit of the comments on re-banking. How should we think about some of the upcoming competitive re-bankings that are going on call it mid-continent? Is that -- can you sustain or carry through a lot of these benefits as other -- as American hubs specifically are re-banked, or should we be factoring some of that into our thinking on RASM?", "James Compton", "David, this is Jim. We're obviously very focused on optimizing the revenue through our re-banking structure and the work we are doing there. And that's our main focus.", "That being said, you're right. It's a competitive business, and as we have re-banked and tightened our bank, those are connections that we are participating in that were participating somewhere else before.", "And so if you see incremental re-banking similar to what we are doing that will be a competitive balance in there, but our focus is clearly to optimize the revenue. And that's why we're really excited about the yield piece because we think the revenue management team can drive incremental revenue even with those competitive natures out there in terms of other people re-banking.", "David Fintzen", "Okay, that's helpful. And then you mentioned on the regional re-fleeting side, I think you said 15% bump in ancillary. How should we think about the other side of that? Any dilution on the passenger revenue side? Or put another way; is it TRASM neutral as you are up-gauging or is it still somewhat dilutive to TRASM?", "James Compton", "The -- it's a great question right because it's a wonderful product that we expect to attract a business market that wasn't attracted to a 50-seater. You've got to remember also there's structural changes. We increased the length of haul using that aircraft. There is a structural pressure on RASM that happens. All being said, adjusting for all those things, it's a wonderful product that we think is already attracting a better business mix and will continue to do so, as well as to your first point that we're able to attach 15% per passenger more ancillary revenue than we are on the 50-seater.", "David Fintzen", "Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "We have time for one final question. And from Raymond James we have Savi Syth on the line. Please go ahead.", "Savi Syth", "Hey, good morning. On the international growth, I know you talked about matching supply with demand and I was just curious given the trends we are seeing in the international markets where just economic growth is slower, I was curious as to if your outlook on international growth has been modified. It doesn't seem like it's changed much since you talked about it last in December?", "James Compton", "Hey, Savi, this is Jim. Our focus again to Jeff's point earlier of making sure that capacity is in line with demand. And so on the international front, a big part of our initiative is quite frankly the seasonal adjustment and peaking and de-peaking that we're doing by flying less into low peak demands right now in the winter. And when the demand is there in the summer we can -- able to up gauge that.", "So it's a perfect example that even in the environment that we are in we're matching capacity with demand. In addition, that global demand, particularly into Europe, has been soft. And yet we have over 7% unit revenue growth in the fourth quarter; another example of us really keeping capacity in line with demand. We are aware of the competitive nature that's out there. The growth in Asia, particularly in China, is running at 20% growth rate. We see that going through the year. That being said, our network is the best position to take that traffic with San Francisco and its local market leading the way, and that's where you've seen many of the routes that we've added, San Francisco, Chengdu and Taipei to other parts of Asia.", "So, we are aware of the competitive balance out there. We think we are well positioned. We've been in the market since 1986. We have strong relationships across Asia, and we see really good things coming.", "An interesting note though in particular to China, WTO in 2006 talked about 100 million passengers outbound in China by 2020. Now they think that will happen in 2015. And now people are talking about by 2020 200 million outbound travelers. That's to all points outside of China, but the US is a big part of that play. And we are extremely well positioned as we take a long-term view on our Asia strategy to capture that.", "Savi Syth", "Got it, thanks. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, for John. Just on the debt side, if you do have this kind of additional cash and can pay down more debt, how much debt can you prepay before it starts to be too costly?", "John Rainey", "Well, we've got quite a bit that we can take advantage of. I will say that some of the debt that is pre-payable, the rates on that are pretty attractive right now. So one thing that we could look at is actually using cash to purchase airplanes as well.", "Savi Syth", "Got it, all right. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Thomson Reuters we have Jeffrey Dastin on the line. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Dastin", "Hi, thank you so much. Just a follow on that last point. Could you add some more color on how much you're willing to spend the savings to purchase new aircraft?", "James Compton", "I'm sorry, Jeffrey, I couldn't understand your question.", "Jeffrey Dastin", "My apologies. On that last question, could you add some more color on how much money -- how much you would dip into savings to purchase new aircraft? How big -- how much are you looking out in 2015?", "Jeffery Smisek", "Jeffrey, this is Jeff. I think perhaps we're being sort of past each other here. The question that Savi had was prepayment of debt and what John was talking about was we have debt that we can prepay, but at some level your prepaying debt that has an interest rate that's attractive that you wouldn't want to prepay. And so another use of the cash would be to use the cash to purchase aircraft as opposed to financing those aircraft, which has the effect of reducing the debt that otherwise would be on your balance sheet.", "Jeffrey Dastin", "Okay, thanks for clarifying that.", "Jeffery Smisek", "Sure.", "Irene Foxhall", "Okay, we'll conclude the call at this time. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Please call media relations if you have any further questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Goodbye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining.

Please go ahead.", "Nene Foxhall", "Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chairman, President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey. Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which Jim will discuss revenue and capacity. Greg will follow with an update on our operations. John will follow that with a review of our costs, fleet and capital structures, after which we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We'd appreciate if you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jonathan Ireland.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thanks, Nene. This morning, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Both are available on our website at ir.united.com.", "Information in this morning's earnings release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.", "Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures.

Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Smisek", "Thanks Nene and Jonathan and thank you for joining on our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Today we reported pre-tax earnings of $585 million, the highest first quarter profit in United's history and over $1 billion improvement compared to the first quarter of last year. We earned $1.52 per diluted share, achieved at pre-tax margin of 6.8% and expanded our return on invested capital to 17.1% over the last 12 months. In the quarter we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow and repurchased $200 million of our common stock.", "Our cost discipline continued in the first quarter with non-fuel unit cost down 1.5% year-over-year bringing our average non-fuel unit cost over the prior four quarters to approximately flat with only 0.4% capacity growth. It is also the seventh straight quarter in which we improved productivity. We continue to deliver on our goals under Project Quality our $2 billion efficiency initiative and we\u2019re making substantial progress on improving our balance sheet. Additionally, in the first quarter our operational performance improved nicely with year-over-year improvements in our on time arrival and completion performance. This quarter all four of our Northern tier hubs experienced more snow days and more de-icing events than the first quarter of last year which you'll remember was a very tough winter. Yet we cancelled 17,000 fewer flights inconveniencing 1.3 million fewer customers. Importantly, we've delivered our operational improvements while also increasing the efficiency and productivity. ", "We made improvements across every part of our business in the first quarter and we could not have done this without the dedication and professionalism of our employees. I want to thank them for their great work and their pride in United. I'm pleased that each quarter we've been building on previous accomplishments. We expect that the second quarter will be another record quarter for United with pre-tax margins between 12% and 14% driven by strong cost performance and lower oil prices.", "At United we manage our business to maximize shareholder value. While unit revenue is an important metric we ultimately make business decisions to maximize margin and return on invested capital. In this morning's investor update, we provided second quarter unit revenue guidance of down 4% to 6%. Jim Compton will explain the component of our second quarter present guide in more detail in just a minute. But I want to mention that some of the decline is directly related to earnings, accretive action that by their nature are at present dilutive. The remaining anticipated unit revenue decline is due to external factors that we\u2019re working to mitigate where we can. United has been the industry leader in capacity discipline and as we've shown in the past we'll take the appropriate actions to ensure we are matching capacity with demand.", "Accordingly, today we reduced our full year capacity guidance by half a point and now expect to grow 1% to 2% in 2015. The first quarter was a good quarter for United in which we improved our operations, expanded earnings, generated significant free cash flow, paid down debt and returned cash to shareholders. We will continue to work aggressively to bolster our revenue and increase our efficiency while maintaining our focus on expanding our margins and return on invested capital. Over the last several quarters we have demonstrated that our plan is working and we remain excited about the opportunities ahead.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim, Greg and John.", "Jim Compton", "Thanks Jeff. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our customers for flying United. Every day we are working to improve our reliability, our product and our offering of destinations and schedule you desire.", "In the first quarter, our unit revenue was up 0.4%, higher than the midpoint of our initial guidance. Our domestic unit revenue was up 1.6% and our international unit revenue was down 0.5%. Our domestic unit revenue performance was largely driven by lower capacity in the quarter that would than anticipated results from our revenue initiatives and the timing of Easter. A contributor to our strong domestic performance was the re-banking of our schedules in Denver and Houston. We have seen both yields and volume of connecting traffic increase year-over-year in these hubs. We rebased Chicago in March and are pleased with the initial results. Our domestic results were also positively impacted by the timing of Easter this year, as Easter travel began in the first quarter. This provided a tailwind of 0.5 points to the consolidated network. This Easter travel share will reduce PRASM by a similar magnitude in the second quarter.", "Transatlantic unit revenue increased 6.9% in the quarter, mostly driven by our seasonal shaping initiative which reduced this flying during the lower demand in winter period while increasing flying during the higher demand summer period. This initiative helps to offset the pressure from a strengthening dollar, which generated a headwind of 1.4 points of PRASM in the Atlantic entities. Pacific unit revenue was down 7.4% primarily due to four factors; first, the weakening currencies in the Pacific contributed approximately 2 points of unit revenue decline; second, we grew our Pacific stage length as we revamped Australia flying and transitioned our unprofitable shorter haul intra-Asia flying to our joint venture partner ANA. This change in our Pacific flying although earnings accretive drove approximately 2.5 points of unit revenue headwind; third, declining fuel service charges particularly in Japan drove more than 2 points of Pacific PRASM pressure in the quarter. Finally, some [credited] capacity additions in China continued in the first quarter and accounted for 1.5 points of unit revenue degradation.", "Turning to corporate revenue, in the first quarter, our corporate portfolio decreased by approximately 1% year-over-year, as our oil related corporate customers began to reduce their flying. On a year-over-year basis, the revenue from our corporate energy accounts declined approximately 20%. Excluding energy, the remaining corporate revenue portfolio increased 1% year-over-year with strength coming primarily from the healthcare sector.", "Ancillary revenue continued to grow in the first quarter, averaging more than $23 per passenger an 8.6% increase year-over-year. Economy plus pricing optimization continues to be a leading contributor to our ancillary revenue performance. Quite simply, our customers value and are willing to pay for the extra space and comfort of our economy plus seats. In the first quarter, our economy plus revenue for available economy plus seat was up 16% compared to the first quarter of last year. In the second quarter we expect our unit revenue to decline 4% to 6% with capacity up 2.25% to 3.25%. Based on our current projections, we believe that the second quarter will produce a lowest unit revenue performance of the year.", "For the second quarter, we anticipate domestic PRASM will be down approximately 3% and international down approximately 7%. There are three primary contributors to the unit revenue weakness that together will pressure our second quarter PRASM performance by 5.5 points; first, the earnings accretive improvements we have made to the United\u2019s network [indiscernible] that are PRASM dilutive contribute 1 point of PRASM pressure; second, there are external factors driving 3.5 points of pressure which consist primarily of the strong U.S. dollar, lower oil prices and 0.5 point headwind from the timing of Easter; third, competitive capacity and pricing pressures are generating approximately 1 point of unit revenue decline. I will walk you through each of these in greater detail and describe the actions we are taking. First we've made a number of network and fleet improvements including several that reduce cost and expand margins but aren't a drag on unit revenue. These improvements include the installation of slimline seats, the extension of our stage lengths and the consolidation of [slimline] seats, which in total we expect to drive 1 point of year revenue decline.", "As an example we've installed slimline seats on 386 aircrafts to date and expect to have 485 completed by year end. These slimline seats improve fuel efficiency, generate very low marginal non-fuel chasm and are highly accretive to earnings. However the additional seats create a headwind to PRASM, as they generate lower than average yields. We remain committed to these network and fleet modifications despite the unit revenue pressure they provide, as they generate significant cost benefits, are accretive to our margins and will improve our operational reliability. ", "Second, external factors are also contributing to our expected second quarter revenue performance; we expect that the strong U.S. dollar will contribute one in a quarter point of consolidated unit revenue decline. We anticipate that as we move into the summer U.S. point of sale will increase and offset some of this projected weakness. This will be more pronounced on the Atlantic entity as we expect American consumers will take advantage of the strong dollar and take European vacations. Where we don't anticipate a point of sale shift we will benefit from capacity adjustments we are making through our network. In the second quarter we will benefit from an 11% reduction in Japan capacity and a 13% reduction in our Canadian capacity to offset the weakening currencies in those countries. We will continue to monitor ongoing capacity reductions into the winter months to address continued foreign exchange pressure. Our current expectation is to reduce Japan capacity in the fourth quarter by 7% year-over-year. Declining oil prices are also affecting unit revenue. As I mentioned earlier many international surcharges throughout the world but primarily in the Pacific have decreased as result of lower oil prices. In the second quarter we expect the average surcharge to decline compared to the first quarter and contribute approximately 1 point of year-over-year PRASM pressure to the consolidated network.", "Where demand permits we have increased base fares to offset a portion of this headwind. Additionally, the Japan capacity reduction I mentioned earlier will help offset the surcharge reduction. We don\u2019t anticipate these actions can completely close the gap but they should mitigate some of the effect. Lower oil prices are also causing energy related corporate customers to scale back their travel budgets. We expect this to reduce consolidated unit revenue by approximately three-quarters of a point in the second quarter. We are working closely with our corporate customers to address their travel needs and we have begun taking appropriate capacity reductions in several energy centric markets to address their declining performance. Coming into the summer we plan to reduce capacity in these markets by 6 percentage points compared to our original expectation. We will continue to closely evaluate the performance in these markets and are prepared to make additional changes if necessary. ", "The third contribute to our unit revenue decline is the competitive capacity and pricing pressure we are confronting. With respect to competitive capacity in the second quarter our routes will face 6% competitive seat growth, this growth will come largely in China, the transatlantic market and Hawaii. We anticipate this will provide a 1 point headwind to PRASM. We expect that this competitive pressure combined with the external factors and margin accretive actions we are taking will put a toll of 5.5 points of pressure by consolidated unit revenue in the second quarter. With respect to capacity, today we lowered our full year guidance by half a point to 1% to 2% year-over-year. With this level of capacity we can accomplish our goals of durable, margin accretive growth while also addressing the pressure points that we just discussed.", "In conclusion we are pleased with the progress we have made to expand our revenue premium over the last few quarters. The current environment has brought new challenges and we will continue to manage our network as we have for several years with discipline. With that I'll turn the call over to Greg.", "Greg Hart", "Thanks Jim. I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our employees for their great work in the first quarter. It was a challenging quarter and a tough winter but our operation performance improved as a result of their professionalism and their dedication. As Jeff mentioned in the first quarter we faced record cold and had more snow days and more de-icing events than the first quarter of last year, the year of the polar vortex. Despite these challenging conditions our operational performance improved year-over-year. One area of keen focus for United has been our express operation. In the first quarter our express completion factor improved by almost 5 points compared to last year. Our mainline operation also had a strong quarter with on-time performance increasing by 1.5 points year-over-year and in February we had the fewest cancellations of any major carries despite having four northern hubs.", "Much of this improvement is due to process changes and the investments we made to improve how we manage through and recover from the regular operations. For example, in late January we experienced a significant snow event at our north hub using our new [crew solver] software we were able to quickly and efficiently redeploy our flight crews after the storm resulted in a quicker recovery for customers and employees. On the following day our on-time departure performance was at least 6 percentage points better than we would have achieved last year. Additionally, we had a best express recovery day in the United\u2019s history. Proactive planning and the great work of our employees combined with new software and other technology solutions all helped us to improve our operations in the first quarter. While I am pleased with our progress, we continue to take actions to improve our reliability.", "And now I will turn the call over to John.", "John Rainey", "Thanks Greg. And thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. I\u2019d also like to take this opportunity to thank our employees. The progress we made this quarter demonstrates their commitment to improve the United. With their continued support I know we can carry this momentum into the future.", "Today, we reported our highest ever first quarter pretax profit of $585 million and grew our earnings per share by $2.85. We increased our trailing 12 month return on invested capital to 17.1% and generated over $1 billion in free cash flow. Both our earnings and free cash flow represent $1 billion improvement over the first quarter of last year. I am pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made but even more excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us.", "First quarter consolidated chasm excluding fuel, profit sharing and third party business expense decreased 1.5% year-over-year once again demonstrating the great progress we were making in reducing cost, becoming more efficient and improving the operation. We continue to make solid progress in executing our project quality efficiency initiatives including continued productivity improvements. In the first quarter productivity improved 2% year-over-year marking our seventh consecutive quarter of improved productivity. We also benefited from strengthening dollar which drove approximately 0.5 points of unit cost improvement.", "Looking to the second quarter, we expect consolidated chasm again excluding fuel, profit sharing and third party business expense to be up a 0.25% to 1.25% year-over-year. Our full year guidance remains unchanged as we continue to expect non-fuel chasm to be between flat and up 1% versus 2014 despite reducing our full year capacity guidance by 0.5 percentage point. Project Quality continues to be key to achieving our cost goals. In 2015 we expect to achieve $800 million in non-fuel savings from these initiatives and we expect productivity to improve by approximately 3% for the full year.", "Turning to fuel expense, we recorded approximately $200 million hedge loss in the quarter which includes approximately $10 million from second quarter positions closed out during the first quarter. We are now 11% hedged for the second quarter and based on the April 16th fuel curve expect to incur at approximately $109 million in hedge losses while participating in 93% of any future price declines. For the second half of 2015, our current hedge book is in a loss position of approximately $340 million and allows us to participate in 79% of any decline in oil prices.", "Based on our guidance, we expect our pretax margin to be between 12% and 14% in the second quarter and expect to generate significant free cash flow again. We plan to utilize this cash in a balanced fashion; to buy back stock, pay down debt, accelerate funding of our pension and make appropriate investments in our business. In the first quarter we returned $200 million to shareholders through our repurchase program and we have now completed $520 million of our $1 billion program. Our current expectation is that we will complete the share buyback program in 2015.", "We continue to make good progress in de-levering our balance sheet. In the first quarter we made $320 million of debt and capital lease payments including prepayment of approximately $120 million and also announced our intention to prepay $600 million of 6% notes in the second quarter. By May 1st we will have prepaid approximately $750 million of debt year-to-date generating $40 million in annual interest expense savings. In addition, in the first quarter, we contributed $180 million to our pension plans and now expect to fund approximately $700 million in 2015 well in excess of minimum funding requirements.", "Our capital expenditures for the first quarter were $794 million and we continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be between $3 billion and $3.2 billion. In the quarter we took delivery of 12 mainline aircraft consisting of nine Boeing 737 900 ERs and three Boeing 787-9s. We also introduced 12 more new 76 seat E175s in service. In addition, this morning we announced several refinements to our fleet plan which will further our efforts to achieve our long term capacity goals of being disciplined with our capital investment.", "We have discussed for some time our need to reduce our dependence on 50 seat RJs and to do it in a capital disciplined manner. We are in final negotiations to lease between 10 and 20 used narrow bodied aircrafts which we will take delivery of over the next years. These aircrafts require only modest reconfigurations in order to be common with our current fleet. Additionally, we are extending the useful life of 11 more of our 767-300 ER aircrafts which are in addition to the 10 we previously announced.", "By adding an all new interior which will include new Y-class seats, state of the art entertainment system with WiFi, winglets and modifications to improve aircraft reliability, we expect these aircrafts to continue to be productive for years to come. Importantly, these fleet changes allow us to reduce our reliance on 50 seat RJs from approximately 8% of our ASMs at the beginning of last year to about 4% by the end of next year, and finally we signed an agreement with Boeing to substitute 10 787s for 10 777-300ERs without any material change to our capital spending. The increased gauge of the 777-300ER will allow us to better serve certain high demand markets and will integrate seamlessly with our existing 777 fleet. These decisions are significant steps in achieving our long term capacity plans including the elimination of a significant portion of our 50 seat fleet.", "In conclusion, I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter, we've demonstrated great progress for four consecutive quarters and are executing against our plan to continue to increase shareholder value. We will take the appropriate actions required to expand earnings, grow margins, generate free cash flow, return cash to shareholders and increase our return on invested capital. I will now turn it over to Jonathan to open up the call for questions.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thank you John, first we'll take questions from the analysts' community, then we'll take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow up question. Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Thank you sir, [Operator Instructions] please hold for a moment while we assemble our queue. And from Stifel we have Joe DeNardi on line, please go ahead.", "Q - Joe DeNardi ", "On the fleet changes you guys announced the transitioning of some of the wide bodies under the domestic entity, can you just, I understand you're looking to pull down some international capacity but can you just walk through how that impacts kind of the domestic capacity trends over the next few years?", "John Rainey", "Hey Joe this is John. I sense that the main question out there is there fuels domestic capacity growth or not, and the answer is no, it doesn't. What this is going to allow us to do, it's going to permit us to reduce frequencies and increase gauge which is part of our network optimization plan. So this is a seat neutral initiative that we're doing here. Let me give you an example of where we fly high frequencies in our hub to hub and markets, take the example of San Francisco to O'Hare. Within 90 minutes on the late flights of the night, Red Eyes, we fly three narrow body aircraft. This is going to allow us to consolidate frequency to use that 777 in that market.", "Jeff Smisek", "And I'll tie it to John's comment where he on numerous times mentioned removing our reliance on 50 seat regional jets, these narrow bodies then we'll be able to free up and do exactly that, is move, as our 50 seat reliance as we move away from that. It generates the narrow bodies to cover that, so there's a cascading effect to it, so in general, it really promotes more cost efficient flying while serving the demand that's out there.", "John Rainey", "Joe, I would just add, this is John, and this is bigger picture all part of our plan to utilize the assets that we have more efficiently and to improve our return on invested capital so that we can deploy capital in a manner that best creates shareholder value.", "Joe DeNardi ", "Okay, that's helpful, and then John, I feel like there have been a number of changes since you guys talked about Project Quality, that are impacting the cost structure a bit with the fleet changes here. Can you just talk about how some of those initiatives are going and what impact that these fleet changes are having on Project Quality and whether the better than expected performance continues into next year?", "John Rainey", "Sure, and you're probably alluding to the fact that half of our Project Quality savings are in fuel savings. And we have a goal of becoming about $1 billion more efficient in fuel by 2017 and certainly today's fuel prices impacted that and on the margin some of these decisions whether it's taking delivery of used narrow body aircraft, that are maybe less efficient or extending the life of some of the older planes that we have, they will have some impact but the progress that we\u2019ve seen to date in the fuel efficiency line with Project Quality we're very pleased with. We expect to achieve about $500 million this year out of our Project Quality fuel savings initiative and so that's all based on really the tracks from our overall goal.", "Operator", "From JP Morgan we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Baker", "Thoughts on LaGuardia parameter rule and the impact on PS out of JFK, also wondering if this ties to the domestic wide body phenomenon, you clearly have the aircraft required for Transcom out of LaGuardia on 7,000 foot runway. But the facilities there are lacking in my opinion [the lounge is air side and obviously -- excuse me, land side and obviously your slot portfolio isn\u2019t quite as rich as Delta or Americans. Does this tie together and what are your aggregate thoughts on this topic?", "Jeff Smisek", "This is Jeff; let me take a crack at that. The parameter rule has been in place I think for something like 60 years it\u2019s worked pretty well as is. We\u2019re certainly consulting with the port authority about what their thoughts are and our thoughts and then different carriers have different views on that. As for operations in JFK I don\u2019t think really at this point we want to comment on that.", "Jim Compton", "And Jamie I would add, this is Jim here, our Transcom product continues to improve and perform very well across all the ports there so we\u2019re excited about the product that we\u2019re bringing in and what we can do in that market across our network.", "Jamie Baker", "And then follow up, question probably for Greg, as we think longer term about the ramifications of potentially pursuing more of a used aircraft strategy, I think Delta would argue one reason of their strategy has been successful that they have this sufficient Tech Ops in place that one really needs to support a somewhat older fleet. Is there a corresponding investment in maintenance for United that we should think about modeling as it relates to this strategy or do you have the systems and people in place and I realized we\u2019re only talking 10 to 20 shelves for now I am just trying to think a little bit longer term?", "Greg Hart", "I think we\u2019re particularly well positioned to be able to manage any used aircraft we bring on market or into the market with our facility in San Francisco which are; we think are some of the best in the world and the services we provide there. So I think we\u2019re very well positioned and it is well a lot of what the aircraft we\u2019re looking at are actually similar vintage than what we already have in our fleet today.", "Operator", "From Credit Suisse we have Julie Yates on the line. Please go ahead.", "Julie Yates", "Q1 was very strong quarter for free cash flow, those were $1 billion, but only $700 million looks seasoned deployed for debt pension and buybacks and I assume that free cash continues to improve in Q2 and Q3. John you mentioned balanced deployment but can you offer more color on the cadence of that deployments between the different opportunities and why we aren\u2019t seeing more buyback especially with year-to-date stock performance?", "John Rainey", "Certainly Julie, we\u2019ve talked for some time about our need to continue to de-lever and we\u2019ve set some intermediate targets out there of gross debt goals in the neighborhood of $15 billion. The steps that we took to prepay the debt that thus far this year as we\u2019ve announced will help achieve some of that. I do firmly believe that there is significant shareholder value opportunity with de-levering our balance sheet. We are too heavily levered today and it\u2019s a vestige from an industry which is -- we\u2019re not operating in it anymore, it\u2019s much more reformed industry.", "As we look at the opportunities that we have to de-lever we don\u2019t have a lot of other options to prepay debt where it make sense say for the secured debt that we have the term loan facility of about $1.3 billion. So as we begin to pick off these pieces of debt like the 6% notes there are less opportunities to prepay that and you will see us probably gear more towards returning cash to shareholders at that point.", "Julie Yates", "And then just on the pension is there a benefit to expense from the higher discretionary contributions?", "John Rainey", "There is, and we treat pension just like debt and we\u2019ll continue to fund that appropriate. We\u2019re in situation today where in a low interest rate environment we want to be careful about being in a position where we could actually fund ourselves having an over [firm] pension where you\u2019re not getting the good return on that cash. So, we\u2019ll be primitive with respect to how much we fund there.", "Julie Yates", "And then just lastly can you offer any update in terms of what amount of the CapEx for this year you tend to finance?", "John Rainey", "It\u2019s a good question and typically what we\u2019ve done if you look at our CapEx profile this year about $3 billion to $3.2 billion, about two thirds of that is aircraft. And in the past we tended to lever up and borrow most of the amount of that for aircrafts. To your earlier question about limited opportunities to prepaid debt. If we\u2019re in situation where we\u2019re generating a net free cash flow the next best opportunity to de-lever is actually not borrowing incremental money for new aircraft. And so that\u2019s not a decision that we\u2019ve made yet and we\u2019ll wait to see how cash flow is paying out for the year. But it\u2019s reasonable to expect that going forward we will borrow less money for aircraft and spend more cash up-front.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank we have Michael Linenberg on line. Please go ahead.", "Michael Linenberg", "Two questions here, if I could, firstly John. John I want to make sure I heard you correctly I think you indicated that you were going to prefund the pension by 700 million this year?", "John Rainey", "That's correct.", "Michael Linenberg", "Okay, so, I don't think you've put out your annual yet but just based on where the deficit was, plus the 700 million this year, it sounds like you're actually pretty close to removing the underfunding, we could be a year or so away from that is that right?", "John Rainey", "Well, that's fairly close, at the end of the first quarter we\u2019ve got an unfunded liability position about $2.5 billion. And what I was alluding to earlier you could actually find yourself in a situation where if you close that entire gap and then interest rates were to rise again that reduces the projected benefit obligations so you could actually be in a situation where you have an overfunded pension and that's not necessarily the best use of that capital, so we're very thoughtful about the amount that we're going to fund so that we can get close to fully funded but not be in a situation where we'd be overfunded.", "Michael Linenberg", "Perfect and just my second question to Jim, on the 777s, the ones that are being redeployed to domestic, appreciate the example that you provided, I mean the way we should interpret that or think about that airplane, is it you know going to be utilized hub to hub flying or Hawaii is that going to be the primary use if those airplanes come back into the domestic?", "Jim Compton", "Hey Michael, this is Jim and you hit it right on the hub. It'll support us in frequency consolidation hub to hub and also support our Hawaii and so that's exactly right.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research we have Hunter Keay on the line, please go ahead.", "Hunter Keay", "It's a question John on, looks like your ancillary business expense guidance ticked up at about a $100 million incrementally in the back half of the year. Is there any revenue attached to this and if not come the chasm mix fuel guide did not come down from the prior guide, it even went a little lower capacity and given how Project Quality is going I would think that that would sort of lead to a reduction in the full year chasm mix fuel guide, unless again this is a new initiative and there's some other revenue I can put in the model in the back half.", "John Rainey", "That's an insightful observation Hunter; we do have in that guidance an assumption about resuming some of the third party sales we've done for fuel. Just this quarter alone you know it's about a $130 million variance from the previous year so to the extent that we got increase of the revenues in and we have more or less in all setting expenses. It's a profitable business but its pretty low margin.", "Hunter Keay", "Right, okay, that's good and then, I think one of the things that I'm concerned about and I think I'm hearing this from an increasing basis from some investors is that big airports continue to get more service and the smaller mid-sized airports continue to get less and Jim you touched on some of the competitive capacity growth causing some pricing headwind for you guys in 2Q, you're not alone, everybody has competitive capacity growth in the markets and you're putting 777s in big airport that's going to theoretically I think exacerbate, that probably forward, so is there anything that you guys can tell us now, why we should not being concerned about -- even though the headline number on capacity continues to sort of trend better on the increment, the competitive capacity trends appear to be getting worse so how do we feel good about United's ability to sort of compete in that environment as the biggest airports are getting more and more competitive?", "Jim Compton", "Hey Hunter, this is Jim. That's a great question, obviously I'll speak from United's perspective and how we think about this, but the base of it is that we are really committed to a disciplined capacity approach, so even the 777 that I talked about, it will be seat neutral and we'll manage that capacity discipline. You know as a matter of fact over the last eight years United's grown its capacity at GDP or less for every year and so that's really the strong part of our plan that we feel allows us to grow our margins and reinvest in our business and so continue to do that.", "There's an examples as we've done that, what's the test of that, we lowered our guidance to 0.5 point this year from 1.5 to 2.5 guidance from 1 to 2. A lot of the work we're doing to offset and mitigate some of the foreign exchange has been in place in the first quarter, our Japan capacity was down 11% year-over-year so it gets back to that general principle of always staying disciplined and allowing us to be flexible to move with what\u2019s happening in the market places and the demand. So from United's perspective there's nothing about what we've been doing over the last several years that's going to change going forward. There's a change in how we're approaching capacity, the capacity that we're adding is really efficient and so when I talk about the slimline seats and that's going to grow our capacity growth of 2% in the domestic space in the second quarter, is that efficient slimline capacity growth comes in a lower average yield which drives pricing down, but it\u2019s very cost effective and margin accretive. So our commitments to that and we're going to continue to do that.", "Hunter Keay", "Thank you John and Jim.", "Operator", "From Cowen and Company we have Helane Becker online, please go ahead.", "Helane Becker", "This maybe a question for Jeff. You are now the second largest US airline and you're not included in the S&P yet, and I'm just kind of wondering if you think about that at all, if it's a priority and if you do think about getting included is there stuff you can do to perhaps move the process along?", "Jeff Smisek", "Helane, I think about that every night right before I go to bed.", "Helane Becker", "I hope that\u2019s not true.", "Jeff Smisek", "I am a really boring guy. Yes it is something that we do think about, it is something that we think is appropriate and as for anything we can do to get there that I\u2019ll turn over to with John.", "John Rainey", "Halena, we meet the qualifications today to -- for inclusion in the S&P500 there is not anything, there is not anything that we can do to get them to be more interested in us I think part of it is you\u2019ve got to have someone meet the S&P500 to actually being included. So, it\u2019s something that I think would help our stock long term having a fund in us like that and something that we certainly desire but it\u2019s largely outside of our control.", "Helane Becker", "And then can I just ask a labor related question, I think you still got a couple of contracts that aren\u2019t -- don\u2019t have merged seniority list. Can you do an update for us on where that stands?", "Jeff Smisek", "First of all, we\u2019ve gotten contracts with -- we've got 28 out of our 30 contracts to get done, so we only have two left. So those are with our technicians and with our flight attendants. We\u2019re in negotiations with both groups. I won\u2019t comment on the negotiation themselves, but I\u2019ll tell you we very much would desire to getting those done. We believe that our employee groups wish to get them done but we have to approach that in an appropriate disciplined manner to reach agreements that are good for the company and good for the employees.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley we have William Greene on line. Please go ahead.", "William Greene", "Jim, I am wondering if you can clarify one point on some of the PRASM commentary, you talked about second quarter being the trough and so obviously things will get better. Do you feel like that\u2019s more on balance capacity statement or is it more on balance of demand statement? Do you have enough visibility into the back half to understand sort of what demand looks like or is it really just the capacity from this or even comps I guess could be the other right answer too?", "Jim Compton", "From a PRASM point of view, as you -- second quarter being the low point is driven by many of the things I talked about on the call. The largest effect for instance, fuel surcharges in Japan [hitting] us in the second quarter. And as you go through the year and particularly through the fourth quarter you begin to kind of mitigate some of that just on a year-over-year basis. On the -- some of it is just the seasonality, seasonal shaping that was really successful in the quarter, particularly in the Trans-Atlantic. We planned obviously to grow that capacity as we move into the summer strong periods and take advantage of the higher RASM in the summer period through for instance Trans-Atlantic.", "So it\u2019s a combination of some of the effects year-over-year kind of balancing it out tied with the initiatives that we are doing to reduce our capacity and some of the oil related markets as well as for instance in the Trans-Atlantic will be flat to down year-over-year in the fourth quarter now which drives our guidance reducing it by 0.5 point to 1 point to 2 point. So, those things that market basket of things kind of makes the second quarter the low watermark based on what we see today.", "William Greene", "John I wanted to follow up one question for you on fuel, so obviously we\u2019re redoing the hedge book and we\u2019ll participate in lot of the downside. When you think about deployment of cash, do you think at all about trying to lock in longer term some of the current fuel prices in any way or is that just not a part of the use of cash?", "John Rainey", "It\u2019s a good question Bill and it\u2019s absolutely when we look at four projections for earnings today at the fuel prices that you see today, which arguably are lower than the long term average. We absolutely think about protecting some of that because the opportunities that we have to improve our business with the type of cash flow that we can generate are huge and so spending a little bit of money to protect against any pop in oil prices is something that we will likely do as we look at opportunities we\u2019re more focused on 2016 than \u201915 at this point, but I think that\u2019s a reasonable use of cash given what we can do with the cash flows in terms of improving shareholder value.", "Operator", "From Barclays we have David Fintzen on the line. Please go ahead.", "David Fintzen", "Just a question for Jim and you alluded to I know you mentioned sort of point of sales start to shift into the summer. Just given the speed and sort of historic degree of the year and the move in the euro, is there a different dynamic in point of sale shift into the summer than maybe you\u2019ve seen in the past where you\u2019ve kind of clean up a lot of it with U.S. [20] sales, so how is that trending, is it sort of different this time?", "Jim Compton", "There is a general shift deployment now to the U.S. side that head -- as you head into the summer. We do think that given the exchange rate and the strength of the dollar that we'll see that accelerate this year, and quite frankly in our bookings we are already starting to see some of that, so, some of that foreign exchange impact that's affecting us in the transatlantic will thus be offset by an even stronger point on sale of the US and the transatlantic since we're head into the summer. So we're beginning to see those trends happen, they're above and above the rate that they normally do.", "David Fintzen", "Okay, sort of more 3Q than 2Q is what you're alluding that one?", "Jim Compton", "Yes, absolutely, you know most of our, even our seasonal shaping of capacity was meant to hit kind of the June through August period, but we've really above the lines with seasonal shaping, the Trans-Atlantic that we set out for this year.", "David Fintzen", "Okay and then just on a sort of similar topic, the Euro hedge, if you didn't have that hedge in the second quarter what would the incremental FX hit be and then how does that run off through the course of the year?", "Jim Compton", "It's not a huge amount, we're hedged 47% for the balance of the year at around 1.22-1.23, and so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s big of a number for the second quarter. I don\u2019t have the specific number that you've asked off the top of my head, but I don't believe its material, so I'm thinking through it.", "David Fintzen", "Okay, all right, that's helpful and one quick one just to the energy related comment, on travel demand. The way I kind of interpret, is that predominantly international travel that's energy related that you're seeing or are you seeing sort of a broader Houston impact?", "Jim Compton", "It's both of those, the energy travel going to a couple of interesting, is that it really flies, when it flies internationally it flies in business class, and so a big portion of that revenue is international because of that. But even in Houston a data point, is that we saw our Houston [rising] in the first quarter, down 5% and our consolidated PRASM was up 0.4, so that gives you a little contest that, yes it is -- a lot of that oil traffic is international. But it also affects the domestic and we're adjusting some of that domestic capacity for instance to North Dakota and Canada to address some of the demand issues that are associated with that.", "Operator", "From Evercore ISI we have Duane Pfennigwerth on the line, please go ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Just two questions from me, to what extent did pilot availability factor into your decision to accelerate some of these regional fleet changes, and wonder if you can offer any comment on your partners' ability to fly the schedule the schedule that you want them to fly.", "Jeff Smisek", "This is Jeff; I'll talk a little bit about that. Pilot availability clearly, particularly for the 50 seat operation is an issue for us which does indeed affect the availability of our express operators to fly the scheduled, and moreover the 50 seat product is something that is not as good a product as the 76 seaters, for example the new Imperio 175s that are in the market [indiscernible] product with considered very attractive airplane, very comfortable airplane has WiFi, has putting first class food up front, has a better ancillary revenue opportunities, and confortable seats and is a very good product. But the shift of the pilots, our reduction in availability of pilots for smaller airplanes is clearly affecting us, as in it's affecting all of our competitors who operate the [program].", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Thanks Jeff, and then just on seasonality of free cash flow generation, strong number here in the first quarter earnings seasonally stronger in second quarter, but is it fair to assume that free cash flow generation will actually be higher sequentially in 2Q and thanks for taking the questions.", "Greg Hart", "It's fair to assume that Duane, a lot depends upon earnings, but to your point we tend to build a lot more cash in the first and second quarters and we expect very strong cash generation there. We have a goal being free cash flow positive in every quarter and giving the earnings profile of this business, that's not an unreasonable assumption.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Is that something you think you could hit this year potentially.", "Greg Hart", "Again it depends upon your earnings assumption, but yes potentially.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We've time for one final question, from Buckingham Research we have Dan McKenzie online, please go ahead.", "Dan McKenzie", "Apologies for yet another 777 question but I can't resist and I guess I'm just wondering if the move is potential prelude to adding a fourth cabin domestically and how should we think about the pros and cons of that kind of a strategy?", "Jim Compton", "Dan, this is Jim, we have no plans to add a fourth cabin domestically, given what we\u2019re doing, ancillary revenue particularly with the economy plus, we actually we're really early in the game of driving as sort of the revenue with that product today, so we're going to kind of -- we\u2019re going to continue to build on that and so the answer would be no.", "Dan McKenzie", "Okay, very good. You know John, I guess just following up on the free cash flow commentary obviously you\u2019re completing the share repurchase well ahead of schedule here and I believe investors are concluding that United may not actually announce another capital return program this year but -- and I guess I am wondering if we should preclude that possibility I mean what\u2019s the right way to think about expectations here?", "Jim Compton", "I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that as we conclude our existing share repurchase program that we\u2019ll be in the market with something additional whether it\u2019d be a share repurchase, dividend whatever we think is the best way to return cash to shareholders at that point in time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media [Operator Instructions]. From Thomson Reuters we have Jeffrey Dastin on line. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Dastin", "How does the 747 fits into United\u2019s fleet --planned fleet, retirement plan in 2015 and how do you only considered retiring a significant portion of 747s going forward?", "John Rainey", "The 747 is something that we do intend to keep for a few more years we have a couple coming out of our fleet in the near future but some of these we\u2019ve made some improvements to the operating reliability of the aircraft and we could expect to keep them for another few years. They have another sort of big maintenance events in the 2020 time frame that that will be another decision point for us whether we want to extend them further at that point or go ahead and retire them.", "Jeffrey Dastin", "And just a separate fleet related question, so with which model of Dreamliner did United exchange for the 777s and might United elaborate on what discount they may have received for them?", "John Rainey", "We have not disclosed which model we substituted and we might not elaborate of the discount, that\u2019s something we\u2019d like to keep between us and Boeing.", "Operator", "From The Street we have Ted Reed on line. Please go ahead.", "Ted Reed", "I don\u2019t quite understand why you\u2019re trading in 787 orders for 777 orders. I thought the 787 orders were big advantage for United. So I\u2019d like to know why you\u2019re doing it apart from price and give me an example of where it would benefit you.", "John Rainey", "We\u2019re still a big believer in the 787, it\u2019s a greater best in our fleet today. The 777-300ER is also a very good aircraft and happens to have the best reliability of any plane in the sky today. It also has -- we have an opportunity to put that in some markets that it\u2019s a better aircraft and with the 787 or some of our other existing planes out there today. So this is all part of normal fleet planning that we do from time-to-time and there is nothing to read into this about the 787.", "Ted Reed", "Can you give me an example of a route that it might be better than -- that the 777 might be better?", "John Rainey", "I won\u2019t give you a specifically route, but clearly it integrates well with the 777 we fly to New York, it allows us to up gauge New York, which has always been a strategy of ours given the constraints there and the demand that we\u2019re seeing in New York with the hub and how it\u2019s working in New York. So that\u2019s a great aircraft to up gauge in New York with that 777-300.", "Ted Reed", "And one other thing Delta say that it would cut international capacity growth in fourth quarter by 3%, I can\u2019t quite figure out from you said is that about what you\u2019re doing. I know you have some big cuts in Japan, but can you compare it to Delta?", "Jeff Smisek", "We haven\u2019t disclosed what the fourth quarter in terms of international in total, we are bringing our Atlanta capacity to flat to down year-over-year. Again for us we\u2019ve been very much focused on capacity discipline. So, our Japan capacity for instance in the first quarter was down 11% it\u2019s already planned to be down 7% in the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019ve been ahead of this as we create the flexibility in our fleet plan to match capacity and demand.", "Operator", "And we have time for one final question from Flightglobal, we have Edward Russell on line. Please go ahead.", "Edward Russell", "I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on the time line of the 777-200s coming into the domestic fleet.", "Jeff Smisek", "It won\u2019t be this year.", "Nene Foxhall", "With that, we\u2019re out of time and we\u2019ll conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call media relations if you have further questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Please go ahead.", "Irene Foxhall", "Thank you, Brandon [ph]. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chairman, President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey. Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which Jim will discuss revenue and capacity. Greg will follow with an update on our operations. John will then review our cost, fleet and capital structure after which we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We'd appreciate it if you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.", "With that I'll turn it over to Jonathan Ireland.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thanks, Nene. This morning we issued our earnings release and separate investor update, both are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in this morning's earnings release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represents the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for more throughout description of these factors.", "Also, during the course of our call we'll discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures please refer to the tables at end of our earnings release and investor update. Copies of which are available on our website. Unless otherwise noted special charges are excluded as we walk through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Smisek", "Thanks, Nene and Jonathan, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Today we reported pre-tax earnings of $1.3 billion, the highest quarterly earnings in United's history. We earned $3.31 per diluted share and produced an 18.2% return on invested capital over the last 12 months.", "In the quarter, we generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow and almost $0.5 billion of free cash flow. We put our cash to good use by investing it in our employees and our business, prepaying debt and making significant contributions to our pension plans, buying back stock and investing in strategic partnerships.", "Over the past few years, we've made good progress strengthening our balance sheet to derisk the business while also making substantial progress completing our initial $1 billion share repurchase program. Accordingly today we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2017. In addition we now expect to complete our initial $1 billion authorization in the third quarter, almost two years ahead of schedule. Our new share repurchase program demonstrates confidence in our ability to generate and sustain meaningful free cash flow.", "Turning to expense, we continue to demonstrate cost discipline, growing second quarter non-fuel unit costs only 0.3%. This excellent cost performance is due in large part to the continuing success of Project Quality, our $2 billion efficiency and quality initiative. Project Quality highlights the dedication and commitment of United's workforce. Our employees continue to discover and implement new ways to improve everything we do and I want to thank them for their efforts to help make our company stronger and more sustainable over the long term.", "I'd also like to thank our employees for their commitment and effort managing through a challenging operation in June. Our operational performance was below our expectations in June due to tough weather and a spike in maintenance write ups and we took action to address the maintenance related situation. As a result, we've seen a meaningful improvement in our operations over the past few weeks and Greg will provide further detail in a few minutes. We expect the third quarter to be another good quarter for United financially, and we estimate our pre-tax margin will be between 13.5% and 15.5% driven by continuing cost discipline and lower oil prices.", "Although our expected margin performance is muted by the current weak revenue environment for our industry we're making network and capacity decisions to address this weakness with a focus on structuring our network to expand both margins and return on invested capital. Over the last several years we have demonstrated our commitment to matching United's capacity with demand and we will continue to take the appropriate network and capacity actions to deliver value to our shareholders.", "In conclusion the second quarter was a very good quarter for United and I am proud of the work our employees have done to deliver record earnings which benefit all our constituencies, including our employees themselves. We have a great deal of confidence in our future as we work to make United the carrier of choice.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, Greg and John.", "Jim Compton", "Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to thank our customers for flying United. We work hard every day to improve our performance, our product and our network to deliver the choice and experience you desire. In the second quarter our consolidated unit revenue fell 5.6%. The drivers were consistent with our initial expectations, a strong U.S. dollar, the effects of lower oil prices, pressure as a result of margin-accretive initiatives and competitive pricing actions.", "While the drivers were unchanged, unit revenue deteriorated throughout the quarter. In particular revenue from our energy-related corporate contracts declined more than we anticipated and the effects of competitive pricing worsened throughout the quarter. Corporate revenue for the second quarter decreased by approximately 5% on roughly flat traffic year-over-year, largely due to a 30% reduction in revenue from oil and gas related corporate customers. We believe this decline has roughly leveled out, and we don't anticipate material deterioration for the remainder of the year. Excluding oil and gas related corporate revenue our corporate revenue was down approximately 2% with traffic volumes up approximately 2% year-over-year.", "Ancillary revenue continued to perform well over the second quarter, growing 7% per passenger versus the second quarter of last year. We are now generating more than $23 per passenger in ancillary revenue and remain on track to achieve $3.2 billion of ancillary revenue this year. In the third quarter, we expect our [indiscernible] to decline 5% to 7% on capacity growth of 1.25% to 2.25%. We anticipate international unit revenue will be down [to 11%] [ph] and domestic unit revenue to decline 1% to 3%.", "The drivers of our third quarter unit revenue are largely the same as those in the second quarter. We expect the foreign exchange impact to account for 1.5 points of year-over-year PRASM pressure. We anticipate that the impact of lower international surcharges will account for one point of weakness, and that lower oil and gas related corporate revenue will drive nearly one point of PRASM decline. We also expect the current competitive pricing actions will drive another 1.5 points of decline in the quarter. Finally, the margin accretive actions we are taking, such as installing slim line seats and consolidating frequencies through up gauging will drive a half point of unit revenue decline.", "As we expect this to be our second consecutive quarter of negative year over year unit revenue performance, we have taken the appropriate actions to minimize this decline. We reduced second half capacity by approximately half a point and now expect full year 2015 consolidated capacity to grow between 1% and 1.5% this year. The capacity reduction largely comes from three markets where we've seen meaningful reduction in demand.", "First we further reduced capacity in our Core Energy markets. We have reduced capacity in those markets by 9% in the third quarter and 8% in the fourth quarter. Second, we pulled down capacity into Brazil by 7% in the fourth quarter to help offset the yield weakness driven by the strong U.S. dollar and the weak Brazilian economy. Finally we further reduced our Trans-Atlantic capacity in the fourth quarter. Our Trans-Atlantic capacity will decline approximately 0.5% year over year. The total impact of these changes will result in fourth quarter consolidated capacity of approximately 0.5% to 1.5%, more than 1.5 points lower than we had initially planned.", "As we have demonstrated over the last several years United has historically built its capacity to match demand and will continue this practice going forward. We will evaluate further capacity actions based on our expectations for demand as we move into the winter periods.", "We continue to improve our network with a focus on enhancing our core strengths. In June we announced our decision to move our p.s. service from JFK to our global gateway at Newark Liberty. With this change we will have the most flat lie-flat seats between New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco of any airline and will now offer our premium p.s. product at our premier New York Hub.", "In conclusion while unit revenue performance is down year over year, I am confident we are taking the appropriate steps to address the current challenging demand environment. At United we have a long history of matching capacity to demand and we intend to continue that. Our decision to move our p.s. product out of JFK and into Newark Liberty is one example of how we are prepared to take significant actions for the long-term benefit of our network, our customers, our employees and our shareholders, and we will continue to evaluate other opportunities going forward.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Greg.", "Greg Hart", "Thanks, Jim, and thank to everyone for joining the call this morning. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for the continued hard work and for managing through a difficult operation in June. I'm proud of how you handled the tough conditions by putting our customers first and I appreciate your dedication and professionalism.", "Despite a challenging June, our operation has improved materially this year. In fact we have cancelled 24,000 fewer flights during the first half of this year than we did during the same period last year. We also improved our system-wide on time performance by over four points during the same period. This improvement could not have been achieved without the commitment of our experienced team.", "With respect to the second quarter, we performed well in April and May, but a difficult June led to second quarter operational performance that did not meet our expectations. One factor was weather. In June we faced thunderstorm activity at one or more of our hubs during 25 of the 30 days of the month. We also experience an increase in maintenance write-ups in the first three weeks of June. We've taken steps to address the maintenance related issues and over the last four weeks we've seen our performance improve materially including a roughly 50% reduction in maintenance cancellations when compared to the first three weeks of June.", "Over the past several calls I've talked to you about the investments we've made to better communicate with our customers. During the difficult June period we used these new tools and procedures to more quickly and effectively respond to our customers' needs. For example with these tools we are able to proactively notify customers about disruptions and resolve their issues in a more timely manner than we could have in the past. In addition, by equipping our airport employees with handheld devices and mobile printers, our agents were able to assist thousands of customers throughout the gate area with average transaction times of less than a minute.", "In closing while our performance in June did not meet our expectations, we have seen meaningful improvement in our operation year-to-date due to the hard work of employees and the use of new technology. We are committed to doing what it takes to run an even more reliable airline and we are making, and we'll continue to make, the investments to ensure we do so.", "With that I'll turn the call over to John.", "John Rainey", "Thanks, Greg, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. I also want to take this opportunity to thank our employees. Today we announced record quarterly earnings in large part due to the commitment and professionalism that our employees bring to the job every day.", "Our second quarter pre-tax profit was $1.3 billion with a pre-tax margin of 12.7% and we increased our earnings per share by 41% year-over-year. We achieved a 12 month return on invested capital of 18.2% and generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow, net of $620 million of pension contributions. Second quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, was up only 0.3% year-over-year, a result of our continued focus on efficiency and reducing cost.", "For the third quarter we expect consolidated CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense to be approximately flat year-over-year. We now expect full year 2015 CASM, again excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, to be between flat and up 0.5% despite, again, reducing our expected full year capacity by an additional quarter point.", "Project Quality, our $2 billion efficiency and quality initiative continues to play a critical role in our excellent cost performance. Year-to-date we have achieved approximately $350 million in non-fuel savings and expect to realize $800 million for the full year. Based on our progress to date we now expect to achieve our goal of $1 billion in annual non-fuel cost savings by the end of next year, a full year in advance of our initial expectations.", "Productivity improvements continue to be a major driver of our Project Quality success. This quarter productivity improved 2.2% over last year, marking eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement.", "Turning to fuel expense, we recorded a hedge loss of approximately $200 million in the quarter. For the third quarter we are approximately 20% hedged and based on the July 16 forward curve we expect to incur approximately $230 million in hedge losses while participating in 83% of any future price declines. For the fourth quarter our hedge book is in a loss position of approximately $225 million, and allows us to participate in 77% of any decline in oil prices. Additionally, in the quarter we began building a small hedge position in 2016, marking our first entry into the market since oil prices began to decline late last summer. We will continue to be opportunistic as we consider layering on additional hedge positions.", "We expect to generate continued margin expansion and free cash flow in the third quarter with a pre-tax margin between 13.5% and 15.5%. We continue to take a balanced approach to deploying our cash. In the second quarter we prepaid $800 million of debt bringing our year-to-date debt payments to $920 million. Additionally we spent $620 million funding our pension plans in the quarter bringing our total pension funding for the year to $800 million and materially reducing our unfunded-pension liability. Given the progress we've made year to date, we don't anticipate significant additional funding this year.", "We also invested in the business with $1.26 billion in capital expenditures and repurchased $250 million of stock. Finally we spent $130 million on two strategic investments. First we invested $100 million to purchase a stake in approximately 5% of Azul Brazilian airlines, a carrier that, over the long term, will strengthen our Latin network and provide United's customers with exclusive connection opportunities throughout Brazil. Second we invested $30 million for an equity stake in Fulcrum BioEnergy, an alternative fuels company. We are excited about each of these equity investments and look forward to these new partnerships.", "Along with our second quarter results today we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2017. In addition we intend to complete the remained $230 million of our initial $1 billion authorization in the third quarter of this year, almost two years ahead of schedule. Over the last several quarters we have taken a balanced approach to investing in our employees and the business, paying down debt, funding our pension and repurchasing stock. We have now eliminated all prepayable high-interest rate debt from our balance sheet while also significantly reducing our unfunded pension liability. While there is still more that can be done in these areas, we are excited about our new $3 billion share repurchase authorization.", "We also continued investing in our fleet in the second quarter adding six 737-900ERs, one 787-9, three used 737-700s and 15 additional 76-seat Embraer E175 regional aircraft to our fleet. We now have 60 E175s in our fleet and have removed almost 100 50 seaters since the beginning of last year.", "In the quarter we announced plans to lease up to 25 used A319s and add 10 to 28 more E175s in 2016 and 2017 bringing the total number of E175s in our fleet to as many as 153 by 2017.", "In conclusion, I'm pleased with our record-setting second quarter results, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We will continue to execute on our plan to increase shareholder value as we focus on growing earnings, generating free cash flow, increasing our return on invested capital, and returning cash to shareholders through our new buyback program.", "I'll now turn it over to Jonathan to open up the call to questions.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thank you, John. First we will take questions from the analyst community. Then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question, and if needed, one follow-up question. Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And from Credit Suisse, we have Julie Yates online. Please go ahead.", "Julie Yates", "Good morning.", "Jeff Smisek", "Good morning, Julie.", "Julie Yates", "With the incremental capacity reductions, when do you expect United can get back on a flat to positive unit revenue growth trajectory?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Julie. This is Jim. As you're aware, we don't provide guidance beyond the upcoming quarter. We've guided to third quarter rise and decline of about 5% to 7%. But let me talk about some of the factors that we already know that will positively affect the fourth quarter. First in the fourth quarter we'll begin to lap some of the drivers to our current revenue decline. In particular, the strong dollar and some of the effects of the lower oil prices that began in the fourth quarter of last year. As you just said, we have made adjustments to our capacity. And so as we're responsive to adjusting our network to match demand we expect to realize those benefits. But in the end it's a little bit too early to zero in on where the demand will be, particularly on the business side this far out. But we do, as I mentioned, we do some of the factors that will begin to lap in the fourth quarter will be positive in terms of our unit revenue.", "Julie Yates", "Okay. Understood. Thanks, Jim. And then last week one of your competitors noted 50% of their yield decline was just from three domestic markets. Would you agree or are you seeing more broad based weakness or would you add other cities to those called out that are particularly weak?", "Jim Compton", "Yeah, Jim again. You know we are seeing - our biggest yield pressures are coming in Dallas. You know some of the similar things with Love Field and so for the pressure that's happened in Dallas as well Chicago that we've talked about in the past. And then in Houston, I'll tie back to my energy comments that we're seeing the impact of that. So I think those are probably the three markets that we're seeing the biggest yield decline.", "Julie Yates", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan we have Jamie Baker on line. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Baker", "Good morning, everybody. John as it relates to the $3 billion increased authorization, could you just provide some background as to how you arrived at that particular figure, whether you contemplated dividend at any point in your conversation? Just sort of what goalposts you might have established in terms of thinking about the magnitude of the incremental buyback?", "John Rainey", "Sure, Jamie. Well the magnitude is something we also think about in the timeframe that we expect to accomplish that and we look at both what our expectation about future earnings are and cash flow as well as the other sources of, I guess, draws on that cash. We have been pretty specific about what our intermediate-term debt goal is. We still have a ways to go to accomplish that. Right now we have a gross debt including capitalized leases balance of about $17 billion and the target that we've set out there is $15 billion. So there's still some work to be done there. We also need to continue to invest in our business. We recognize that there's still a lot of things that we can do that are good returns on that cash as we invest improving our operations, providing a better level of customer services and so forth, and giving our employees the tools to do their jobs. So as I talk consistently the allocation of cash flow for us is one about balance and we look \u2013 to answer your question, look at sort of what the cash flow that we're going to generate and then look at how we balance that cash flow and returning our cash to shareholders through a share buyback is part of that.", "With respect to dividend, again, there may be a time and place for a divined in our future, but at this point we still believe that returning cash to shareholders, the best way to do that is buying back our own stock.", "Jamie Baker", "Got it. And as a follow-up, it appears that Boeing Capital again has surplus. Embraer 190 down [indiscernible]. You know, from an MTOW perspective I don't believe these are scope compliant at the express level, but you could fly them at the mainline. Would we be remiss in at least contemplating whether these aircraft could wind up at United which in turn would allow you to put down even more 50 seaters?", "John Rainey", "We always look at every aircraft that's out there. And you could certainly point to that size aircraft and look at our fleet. And there's perhaps a need to fill that gap. But we are taking into account the economics of that aircraft, the availability of them. And there may at some time in our future be a need to place an order for aircraft of that size, but that's not something we've decided yet.", "Jamie Baker", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much, John. Take care.", "Operator", "From Bank of America we have Andrew Didora on line. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Didora", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking my question. I guess my first question is for Jim. Outside of the oil industry, how are your corporate volumes trending? And I ask because we've heard a smaller hotel company talk this morning about just being a little more incrementally cautious on the overall demand environment around travel. So just how has your growth been on the corporate side? Has it been decelerating or has it been pretty steady over the last few quarters?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Andrew. Jim. It really does come down to two separate stories as you mentioned the oil base and all other. And as I mentioned, clearly we're experiencing pressure on the oil base where we're seeing about 30% declines in revenue in our corporate-related contracts in the energy sector. But if you look at the non-oil based companies, we're actually very pleased with our performance. I think you got a segment though, and I think many of them when we talk to them are [feeling] [ph] the pressure of the strong dollar off of. But in general the demand is still solid. The little bit of softening as GDP forecasts have come down as we've moved through the second to the third quarter, the yields have come down. But the demand's pretty solid in the non-oil area.", "Andrew Didora", "Okay. Thank you for that. And then I guess my second question is for John. Just in terms of the unit costs continue to come in better than expectations here. And I know you provide a little bit of commentary in your prepared remarks. But I guess going forward from here, what are some of the biggest areas of focus today on the cost side? And where should we be seeing a lot of the cost saves you mentioned be coming through? Thanks.", "John Rainey", "So with respect to project quality, I would want to emphasize that while we have a specific dollar amount and timeframe associated with this, this is becoming a way of doing business at United. And as we get near completion of this initiative, we will jump right into the next one. We recognize that this is an ongoing improvement process and there's further opportunity. But the main thing I would want to point you to I think in terms of magnitude of opportunity going forward is the cost benefit that we have from restructuring our network. So if you look at the second quarter for example, we increased our average gauge by 7% while reducing our departures by almost 5%. That has a tremendous cost benefit that comes with it as well, and as we've talked about as I said in my prepared remarks, continuing to take planes like the E175 and sitting down more of the 50-seaters there's a continuation of this going forward and you should expect to see that in our cost results.", "Andrew Didora", "That's great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research we have Hunter Keay on line. Please go ahead.", "Hunter Keay", "Good morning, everybody. John Rainey, a couple questions for you, I think this is the first time you've used the word opportunistic as it related to our hedging program and with all due respect your on to a pretty bad track record of being opportunistic with fuel hedging, so I guess I can interpret that two ways. You're going to try to time the market so you're going to get \u2013 you're going to hedge the same but you're going to try to do it at times where you feel there's value there or you're actually going to hedge a little bit less and just stop the systematic stuff where you're hedging every day, hedge less but maybe buy some hedges where you feel like there's a pullback in the market.", "John Rainey", "So I'm going to answer the question slightly differently, Hunter. We have had historically what you might describe as more of a mechanistic structure to our hedging where it's sort of been on autopilot, but in periods of extreme volatility like what we've seen in the back half of last year as well as the first part of this year, that's not necessarily the most prudent way to hedge. And given all the bearish signals in the market for the first part of this year we've been reluctant to take out any position in 2015. However when we look out to 2016 and beyond and we look at both the revenue environment, capacity environment and our cost structure, having the ability to lock-in or said differently, reduce the volatility of one of our single largest cost inputs enables us to accomplish so many other things that are really important and create value in the business. And as we look at hedging, despite maybe taking a more opportunistic approach, it's really more of risk management and reducing the volatility with our costs and that enables us to play on things much like what we did today with the $3 billion share repurchase program. So those go hand in hand. If we see a more stable environment with less volatility going forward, we might be able to get back to a hedge program more like what you've seen in the past, but we are looking at particular price that are more attractive. If that's characterized as opportunistic, then so be it at this point.", "Hunter Keay", "Okay. And then was there a cost benefit, revenues for united are probably going to decline [indiscernible]. Is there a cost benefit to that that maybe goes away next year if revenue stabilizes that should make the CASM performance this year a little bit harder to maintain around the increment assuming roughly some more magnitude to capacity growth?", "John Rainey", "Is there a cost benefit to, I'm sorry, I didn't follow your question exactly.", "Hunter Keay", "Sure. Is there a cost benefit to a decline in revenue?", "John Rainey", "There are revenue-related costs whether it's credit card discount fees, commissions and so forth. But we generally view those as good costs in a business. We much rather focus on the top line growth.", "Hunter Keay", "Right.", "John Rainey", "Over the years the magnitude of those has diminished quite a bit. It's much different than it was 15 years ago in this business where they made up a much larger portion of our cost structure.", "Hunter Keay", "Okay. So the nature of the question was basically is there anything in the CASM this year that should be a little bit harder to maintain next year if revenues don't go down just as much?", "John Rainey", "Sure. We added, as I mentioned, around distribution perhaps.", "Hunter Keay", "Yep. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Stifel we have Joseph DeNardi online. Please go ahead.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Hey. Thanks. Good morning. On the Trans-Atlantic capacity you guys were talking about coming down a little bit in the fourth quarter, is that thing done collectively with your JV partner so that maybe total industry capacity reductions are more than even what you guys are pulling out?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Joseph. This is Jim. As we work through our capacity, we're always in dialogue with our joint venture partners so that we can as a group manage through that process in the best way. Our capacity reductions are, as I mentioned, focused on where we think demand is relative to our network. We clearly make that, have those conversations with our partners and share that information as the group works together to manage across the Trans-Atlantic. So the answer is yes. We're tweaking some things. The great thing about our network and our fleet is its flexibility. And so what you're seeing in the Trans-Atlantic is that fleet flexibility going up, allowing us to gauge appropriately to the demand we expect in the fourth quarter.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Okay. And then John or Jim, have you guys looked at all at implementing any sort of a credit card surcharge? And what would be some of the considerations there?", "John Rainey", "I wouldn't comment on that at all.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank we have Mike Linenberg online. Please go ahead.", "Mike Linenberg", "Yeah, hey. Good morning, everyone. Two questions here. John, you did a nice rundown on the fleet. But I didn't hear any mention of the 777 300 ERs. When do you take delivery of them? And then I did hear that you are going to early retire some 7-4s? Can you just touch on that?", "John Rainey", "We take delivery of the first planes at the end of 2016. And with respect to the 7-4s, there are a couple in our fleet that we will take out, but we'll make a decision about whether the 777s or for that matter that A350s replace the 7-4s a little bit later. We are going to hit a period at the late 2019 time period where a lot of those 7-4s that we have in our fleet come due for a more expensive maintenance visit and that might be a good opportunity to sit them down at that point in time.", "Mike Linenberg", "Are there any that are going to come out in 2016 2017 or it's a more 2019 decision?", "John Rainey", "There might be a couple that come out in the earlier years, yes.", "Mike Linenberg", "Okay, good, and then this question may be it's John or Jim. On the p.s. service you started up in October so that's sort of one action. The second action as it just relates to the slots, I guess the slot swap between you and Delta, what sort of \u2013 do you need any sort of regulatory approval for that or you can just proceed with that and it's a done deal?", "Jeff Smisek", "This is Jeff. On the slots at Newark we are in discussions with the \u2013 they have trust authorities that relate to that, they have the opportunity to view that and we are in discussions with them but we are highly confident that we will consummate that transaction.", "Mike Linenberg", "Great. Thanks a lot, Jeff.", "Operator", "From Cowen we have Helane Becker on line. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker", "Thanks very much, operator. Hi guys, thanks for the time. Just a question on your second quarter salaries and benefits, head count was up just under a half a point and capacity was up 2.3%, but that line item was up over 12% and it was up more than it was up than it was for the year-to-date so was there something special in the second quarter we should know about and then how should we think about that going into the rest of the year?", "John Rainey", "There's two things I'd point out there, Helane. One is profit sharing and because of our higher pre-tax margin in the second quarter we trigger a higher profit sharing ratio and so that's probably higher than what we have modeled. The other thing, we continue to see pressure both with respect to pensions as well as medical and dental. We saw a lot of pressure last year and we're seeing a lot of cost increase in those areas this year as well.", "Helane Becker", "Is that because you have an older workforce?", "John Rainey", "There's a lot of reasons that go into that and certainly the tenure of your workforce is one of them.", "Helane Becker", "Okay, and then can you just update us on your unfunded liability? Thanks.", "John Rainey", "If we were to look at our contributions to date, without making adjustments for any actuarial assumptions or anything like that, which need to be done, we're actually at about $1 billion of an unfunded liability. That's obviously subject to change when we measure that at year-end but it puts us in a very good position over the next several years as we think about that like any other debt obligation. We've said before, we want to get to a point where if we were to get in an interest rate environment where rates are higher than they are today, we can get close to fully funded, and we are effectively in that position right now.", "Helane Becker", "That's great. Thanks so much for your time. I appreciate it.", "John Rainey", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie online. Please go ahead.", "Dan McKenzie", "Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks.", "John Rainey", "Hey, Dan.", "Dan McKenzie", "John, regarding the 18% return on invested capital over the past 12 months, how does that break down domestically versus internationally? And I'm guessing international worse, domestic better, but what is that gap? And then as you think, say, the international, is the fix on the international side just as simple as the U.S. dollar stabilizing against other currencies? Or are you thinking that beyond this year perhaps bigger steps might be required?", "John Rainey", "Well, let me first take the return on invested capital piece. As you can appreciate, we have fungible assets and it's pretty difficult to take a 777 that may fly domestically and also fly internationally and allocate that capital base between the two. So we don't look at return on invested capital on an international versus domestic basis. If you were to look at just NOPAP [ph], the numerator, certainly you've seen a better balance today that what we've seen historically where a lot of the profitability from airlines came \u2013 at least from the airlines that I've been associated with \u2013 came from the international portion. The domestic environment is a very good one right now and happens to be a very profitable one as well.", "Dan McKenzie", "Okay. Very good. And then I guess just following up with a second question here. Holding steel prices constant, how are you thinking about the medium-term margin goals? And how far along are we on the trajectory versus the November 2013 Investor Day.", "John Rainey", "I would say, Dan, we're probably a little bit more than halfway through it, if you could all of the various initiatives that we outlined. Certainly we've had a little quicker pace with respect to our cost achievements but we recognize that we still have a lot of work to do here and we're pleased with the progress. A lot is made of core earnings improvement versus last year and it's certainly very difficult to strip out oil without acknowledging that there's some effect on revenue as well. So we tend to focus on the things that we can measure. The fact that we've improved productivity for eight quarters, the fact that we've cancelled 24,000 fewer flights for the first part of this year. We had one of the highest completion factors of the major carriers coming out of Newark, the fact that our cost performance continues to improve quarter-after-quarter. And all those are good indications of the progress that we were making, and we feel like we've got a good plan that we're executing on. We'll continue to demonstrate that performance.", "Dan McKenzie", "Fantastic. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth online. Please go ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Thanks for taking the questions. Just going back to Mike's question about moving your Transcon flights from JFK to Newark, can you talk about the profit improvement that you expect from that move?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Duane, this is Jim. We would obviously, not that we won't talk about this profit, I will tell you, we're really excited. I mean if you think about the PS product United had for long history in that product of serving our customers with that premium service and the ability to introduce it to really the premier hub in New York, at Newark Liberty and offer from L.A. and San Francisco every flight flatbed seat, we're very excited about it and what the results will be on that. In addition to, if you're leaving from L.A. or you're leaving from San Francisco and you're going over the Europe, you'll have that flatbed experience across your whole journey and so forth. So I won't disclose profit but I will tell you, we're very excited about the move. We think this is really incremental to our net worth. As I mentioned, we think it's terrific for the long term for our product, our customers, our employees and obviously, our shareholders.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Okay. And then can you comment a little bit about what you're seeing in China right now. Obviously, that's been a competitive market for you, and you focus more on less competitive long-haul service there. But can you comment on any specific demand trend changes that you're seeing to that market?", "Jim Compton", "This is Jim again. We obviously continue to see the significant capacity in this region. But again, as I mentioned, our history there, our position there, we're very happy with and happy with the performance. China runs at a very high level and so forth. China is such an important market to us, given our footprint there. We also take the long view of it. We're really confident where we see demand today even in today's environment. And although that capacity growth is strong, that demand will come in line over the next several years and so forth. Working with our network guys, if you look at areas that capacity is growing and that RASM pressure is on it, the demand side in China today actually puts less pressure to razz them than the other markets that are growing. So it's really that demand catching up to the capacity levels there. And we think over the next five years, and again, given as you mentioned, our ability to fly to secondary cities and so forth with our fleet in the 787, we're really well positioned to do well there.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Okay. So if I could just summarize what you said, the competitive capacity is still an issue. But in terms of end market demand, you haven't really seen an incremental change to the downside?", "Jim Compton", "Yes. Yeah. The demand is still growing. Clearly obviously not at the 20% capacity we've seen. But again, the long-term view on demand for capacity has continued to grow at a pretty good rate.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Thanks. And then just lastly, John, on pensions. Can you just help us think about the implication of your improved funding status? What do you expect cash funding to be going forward? Next year? And how much could this be a cost tailwind into 2016? Thanks for taking the questions.", "John Rainey", "I would describe it less as a cost tailwind and more of a cash flow tailwind. So year-to-date we've funded $800 million. Going forward, this would probably be a rounding error in your model. You could see us fund somewhere between $50 million to $150 million a year. But there's not a need to have a big catch-up contribution like what we have this year. Again, everything else being equal, given what we know today.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Thank you.", "Operator", "From Barclays, we have David Fintzen online. Please go ahead.", "David Fintzen", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on some of the Atlantic comments. Is there any reasons within Atlantic in Europe specifically that are requiring more capacity adjustments? Or is it a broader reduction across the network?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, David. This is Jim. I think the Trans-Atlantic as it relates obviously to foreign exchange makes it a broad breadth impact in terms of demand and so forth. That being said, we are seeing good premium traffic into the U.K. and so forth. But if you think about it, remember that foreign exchange has really affected our offshore point of sale. And in the third quarter period of time, it's seasonally the point of sale out of Europe is one of the better periods of time during the year. At the same time, that stronger dollar, our expectations to drive higher U.S. point of sale because of the stronger dollar, although we've seen an uptick, it's not at the level of expectations that we originally thought. So it's really more broad-based and so forth. And in addition to the capacity reductions that we made over the course of the year out of Scandinavia and so forth, Norway, Sweden and we've adjusted some of our capacity down there. So if there was a reason we probably seen it more there, but generally it's across the board in Europe.", "David Fintzen", "Okay. And presumably it's harder to shift point-of-sale in off-peak 4Q than it would be through the summer?", "Jim Compton", "Yeah. You know, again, I'm a big believer \u2013 we chase demand, right? And off-peak periods demand softer and so you could reach that conclusion and so forth. But the U.S. point-of-sale growth from the stronger dollar still hasn't reach the level based on what we anticipated earlier in the year.", "David Fintzen", "Okay. That's helpful. And this is a little bigger picture question. In terms of all the refleeting efforts, which is obviously important cost initiatives, does that add or subtract from flexibility to adjust capacity? And does that give you more levers to pull in the timing of those pieces?", "John Rainey", "Well I would say one of our main focuses that we've had for a number of years right now is to preserve fleet flexibility to be able to respond to any type of economic environment. And if you look at the composition of our fleet today of roughly 700, 710 mainline planes, 22% of that fleet is free and clear of debt unencumbered. We could sit down in any type of economic environment and we want to continue to preserve that going forward. In fact, as you see us finance less of new aircraft and in some cases buy aircraft entirely for cash, that preserves that flexibility, because what we don't want is to be in an environment where we want to adjust capacity but we're still have to cover the cash cost of those planes.", "Jim Compton", "And David, I would just add \u2013 this is Jim. I think actually one of the flexibilities that it does add for us is in the area of range. And so we're able to kind of look at different markets based on the range we're getting through the refleeting we're happening. And on the other side also is the fact that it drives new revenue opportunities within [indiscernible].", "David Fintzen", "Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate all that.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley we have Rashiv Lalani [ph] on the line. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the comments you made about the domestic environment and some of the competitive behavior. Do you feel like the aggressiveness, I guess, is leveling out or do you see the potential for that to maybe increase and spread beyond the couple of cities that you touched on?", "Jim Compton", "Yeah, as I mentioned I talked to a couple of the cities, Dallas, Huston, Chicago where we're seeing most the pressure. We're looking at a 1% to 3% decline in consolidated domestic in the third quarter, as I guided to. In the second quarter that was down 3.6% and so I think the team's doing a terrific job of managing what is a softer demand environment that quite frankly creates lower price points and we're meeting that demand. And so I'm thinking the domestic relative basis is more stable and that actually our guidance relative to the second quarter shows that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. And then just another question, John, maybe coming back to some of the comments you made on the cost side. You talked about a lot of the opportunities that are ahead of you, but how does labor come into play just given what we've seen on pilot agreements and what you've got open in front of you on flight attendance, et cetera.", "John Rainey", "We have in our cost guidance this year, we've provided for 2015, there is an assumption about getting agreements with the last two remaining groups out of the 30 collectively bargain agreements completed, and I think importantly for us, but that goes both ways. So there's also a cost benefit to the company of getting those collective bargaining agreements, but more importantly, we want to get everybody under a joint contract and moving forward. There's a big sort of cultural morale piece to that as well that we're very focused on. So hopefully, we'll complete those agreements in the near future.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then just longer term as we think about the pilot side maybe?", "John Rainey", "Well, we've said consistently that we need to run this business where we can keep our unit cost growth at something less than inflation, and that includes all of the cost inputs including labor. We certainly want to pay our employees competitive wages that are market-based and that goes into that assumption, but to the extent that we've got inflation pressure in certain areas, like that perhaps, we're going to offset it in other ways by becoming more efficient and more productive.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "John Rainey", "Yep.", "Operator", "And our last question from Goldman Sachs, we have Tom Kim. Please go ahead.", "Tom Kim", "Hi. Jim, I wanted to follow up on your China strategy. Can you talk about like what opportunities you may have to form strategic partnerships with the Asians as you've done in Europe and now recently in Latin America?", "Jim Compton", "In terms of our alliances and so forth, as we think about China, clearly envisioning we have a terrific partner in Air China, and to the level that we're allowed to in terms of how we can expand our net worth by connecting and creating more connections for our customers and expanding our footprint there. And we'll continue to do that and look for opportunities with our Star partners to do that and at the same time, obviously, complement that with what we think is a terrific strategy given our fleet, the 787, the ability to fly secondary cities such as Chengdu from San Francisco and so forth, as well as build on our core markets in both Beijing and Shanghai. So the answer is like Latin America, as John mentioned, expanding our network with Azul, we'll continually look for opportunities that are growth markets, and clearly China is, and ways to expand our presence and our footprint in the market.", "Jeff Smisek", "This is Jeff, Tom. The one thing I would add to what Jim said is, as you know, China is not open skies. But there will come a day when China is open skies and when that day comes, we would be keenly interested in exploring a joint venture similar to the type of joint venture that we enjoy with A&A today across the Pacific and that we enjoy with Lufthansa and other of our partners, Air Canada and others, across the Atlantic.", "Tom Kim", "Good stuff. We obviously understand that the Chinese are building up their network from the trans-Pac and I'm wondering which inning do you think they're at. Basically, we're trying to size up when we should anticipate trans-Pac capacity slowing?", "Jim Compton", "Yeah. That's a great question. I think to begin, the industry as demand grows, capacity is going to grow. I think expectations for demand growth in China, clearly we believe are strong and long term and so forth. It would be difficult for me to put a level of that but I think where demand grows, you're going to see capacity grow. I think as I mentioned earlier, we're really well positioned.", "Tom Kim", "Okay. If I can just squeeze in one more. Just to follow-on an earlier question about fuel. And this is really for John or Jim. I'm curious about your risk management strategy, particularly around fuel. Quite candidly, if it were not for lower fuel prices, the airline industry profits would be done and obviously for your company as well, not up. And this is in spite of all of your successes in containing non-fuel CASM growth. And obviously pricing is going to be whatever the market is willing to pay but I'm wondering how are you thinking about earnings risk if the consensus viewer of a lower for longer fuel environment doesn't happen? If we go back to last year, I don't think any of us thought fuel was going to drop suddenly the way that it did in the second half. We all know fuel is really volatile and it could obviously go the other way. I'm just wondering given the consensus view is that fuel is lower for longer, how are you thinking about the biggest risk to your earnings expectations? And related to that, how quickly can you respond should fuel suddenly sort of spike unexpectedly?", "John Rainey", "First of all, I disagree with the way you characterize that slightly because to say that \u2013 to just look at the impact of fuel and not understand that fuel also impacts the revenue environment I think only looks at one side of the equation there. A lot of the headwinds that Jim talked about earlier are certainly very related to fuel. Even if we take the foreign exchange headwind that we've seen, that's due to a stronger dollar. A stronger dollar has in part influenced the price of fuel. So we're seeing a lot of pressure year over year. As we move long term though and we look at an environment that potentially could have lower fuel inputs than what we've seen, we're going to update United Airlines. We're going to focus on what we can control and that's balancing the right amount of capacity for the demand in our markets.", "Tom Kim", "Fair enough. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Reuters we have [Indiscernible] on line. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you very much for taking the question. What steps has United taken in recent weeks, if any, to ensure that diverse technological issues do not cause more system-wide ground stops which is adding redundancy?", "Jeff Smisek", "Sure, Jeffrey. This is Jeff. I'm glad we enjoy the same first name. First of all we had an item that was disruptive that lasted about two hours that was a network connectivity issue. We recognize the inconvenience to our customers and the inconvenience to our employees. Our employees responded very well. Our IT people responded very well, got the system back up. In fact a lot of the tools that Greg talked about that we've invested in also the many of which are technology tools, decision-making tools actually permitted us to have a really good operations start-up the next day despite that disruption.", "I will tell you that the technology is our single largest area of non-aircraft CapEx. A lot of that goes to the operation itself, providing better tools and better decision-making tools as well. We're investing in hardware. We're investing in software. We're investing in the people and the processes to recover from irregular operations, because those are always going to occur because of weather or, for example, some kind of a maintenance issue with an airplane. We're focused very heavily on investing in the reliability of our systems and I can assure our customers that that investment will continue and that we're very focused on not only improving the stability, but actually offering additional technology to our customers to permit them to have better information, better choices better control of their travel, and for our employees that will permit them to do their jobs better.", "For example we're issuing 2,200 iPhone 6 Pluses to our flight attendants and over time as we add to those iPhones, our flight attendants will have vastly better information than they've had before and better interaction with their customers and can be better opportunity to serve our customers. So we're keenly focused. No one likes to have a technology outage. It can happen at any company. It happened to happen to us on a day that, of course, there was a lot of media excitement around the New York Stock Exchange.", "But I can tell you we are keenly focused on improving our technology, improving the stability of our technology, and more importantly, as you obviously have to have stability. Stability, to me, is like safety in an airline. You have to have this job, one, but improving the quality of our technology for our customers and the quality of our technology for our employees. And both those things are really important. And we are keenly focused on it, and we are spending a significant amount of both time and money and bandwidth to get that accomplished.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Well, thank you so much. And just to clarify, because it's unclear where a technological issue can occur, is it difficult to really target those investments? Do the investments need to be general?", "Jeff Smisek", "Well, no. Not necessarily. We know areas, for example, where we can beef up systems or beef up backups. And so we know where to look. We also obviously do invest in significant amount, a significant amount of time and attention to the network itself and all the connectivity of the network, and of course, as all companies do today. We have very sophisticated investments in cyber security as well. So I think we know exactly where we're going and what we need to invest in.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you. And I'm so sorry. Just last follow-up then. So since you have pinpointed those areas, have you started those particular investments? Or do you have at least plans already to start those investments?", "Greg Hart", "Oh, you bet. We've already started. We have regular investments. We have a system-wide program we call Refresh in terms of improving all of the backbone of the system, the connectivity of the system. And again, continuing to improve Wi-Fi bandwidth and coverage because so much of our future and so much of our obviously the customer usage, but our own usage particularly at airports and onboard airplanes is Wi-Fi related. And we have very significant not only investments but processes going on today to continue to upgrade and improve our technology.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you so much.", "Greg Hart", "You bet.", "Irene Foxhall", "Okay. With that, we're out of time. So we'll conclude.", "Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call media relations if you have any further questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Goodbye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This morning we issued our earnings release and separate investor update, both are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in this morning's earnings release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represents the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for more thorough description of these factors.", "Also, during the course of our call we'll discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures please refer to the tables at end of our earnings release and investor update. Copies of which are available on our website. Unless otherwise noted special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Acting CEO, Brett Hart; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart; and Senior Vice President, Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. Brett will begin with some overview comments, after which Greg will an update on our operations. Jim will follow the discussion on the revenue and capacity. Gerry will review our costs, fleet and capital structure after which we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We'd appreciate it if you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Brett.", "Brett Hart", "Thanks, Jonathan. And thank you all for joining us on our third quarter 2015 earnings call. As you are no doubt aware our new CEO, Oscar Munoz is currently on medical leave while he recovers from a heart attack he suffered late last week. The entire United family has Oscar in our thoughts and prayers. To provide leadership during this period, our Board of Directors had asked me to work with our experienced leadership team and serve as Acting CEO in Oscar's absence. We will continue to push forward the agenda we've laid out over the past six weeks, focuses on customer service, team work and innovation with safety always remaining paramount.", "Like Oscar, I believe United has the people to network and the assets to achieve the same or greater margins as our peers. And I with our management team will continue to take steps necessary to get us there. The last several weeks have been very eventful for United. With news of Oscar's heart attack hitting many of us hard. However, I want to assure you that the United team has never been more unified and committed to the goal of making United great again. ", "Turning to our third quarter results. This morning we reported pretax earnings of $1.7 billion, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. Our return on invested capital was 19.8% over the last 12 months and we decreased our non-fuel unit cost in the quarter. Our employees' hard work is a significant contributor to these results. And I want personally thank them for the many contributions to our success. ", "I will now turn the call over to Greg to provide more information on United's operational performance. ", "Greg Hart", "Thanks, Brett. And thank you to everyone for joining the call this morning. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their tremendous work through the busy summer season. Day and day out United employees are showing their commitment to improving our operational performance and a considerable progress we made reflects their continued dedication and hard work. Our entire team recognizes that United still has an opportunity to improve the operation. And we are all focused on raising our performance to level we and our customers expect. However, I do want highlight the progress we have made this year. Year-to-date our consolidated on time performance is five points better than the same period last year. Year-to-date completion grade also improved significantly as we have cancelled over 30,000 fewer flights in last year which translates into 2.7 million. In fact, year-to-date including both the mainline and express operation, we have a better completion rate that our main competitors in New York and Chicago, and we have better completion in Houston that our major competitor in Dallas. ", "Finally, in September we set an all time record for bag handling. And so far this year a mishandle bag rate is 9% better. Over the past several calls, I talked about the investments we've made to improve the operations. The third quarter results showed that these investments along with the hard work of our front line employees are beginning to take hold. ", "I'd also like to highlight our cargo operation. Cargo revenue in the third quarter was approximately flat year-over-year. While this year has been challenging with declining surcharges and increasing industry cargo capacity, the team has done excellent work offsetting this pressure through an intense focus on expanding our market share. Year-to-date, United's market share A4 carriers improved approximately 10% compared to the same period last year. This led to approximately 8% growth in cargo revenue over the last 12 months. A period in which our major competitor saw their revenue decline.", "To the entire operation's team, I want to thank you for a very good year so far, but we still have a long journey ahead, you should all be proud of the significant progress we've made. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Compton", "Thanks, Greg. Again this quarter, I'd like to thank our customers for fly in United. Many of you have noted the improvement in our products and our operation. And we are continuing to do more everyday to deliver the product you desire. In the third quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined 5.8% in line with our expectations. The four factors we discussed in our prior earnings call, a strong US dollar, and the effects of lower oil prices, pressure as a result of margin accretive initiative and competitive pricing actions contributed to negative unit revenue growth year-over-year. In the third quarter, we amended our co-branded credit card agreement with Chase and Visa more than two years before the original expiration date. We expect the multiyear extension will generate in an incremental $200 million of revenue in the second half of the year and approximately $400 million of incremental revenue for 2016. ", "Turning to the fourth quarter. We expect our unit revenue to decline approximately 4% to 6% year-over-year. The major drivers of a fourth quarter decline are similar to those in the third quarter. We expect the foreign exchange impact to account for 1.5 points of year-over-year PRASM pressure. Assuming current conditions continue, we anticipate that the impact of lower surcharges particularly in Japan will account for approximately one point of weakness. We continue to see degradation from our corporate energy customers. With revenue down approximately 35% year-over-year representing roughly one point of PRASM decline. We also expect the current competitive pricing actions will drive approximately 1.5 points of decline in the quarter. Finally, the margin accretive actions we are taking such as installing slimline seats are anticipated to drive approximately 0.5 PRASM decline.", "I'd like to take this opportunity to speak briefly about our presence in China. China continues to be an important and profitable market for United. We are closely monitoring the changing dynamics of its economy. Following the currency devaluation and Chinese stock market decline in August, we saw a brief drop in bookings. However, bookings recovered nicely and have rebounded to near pre -devaluation levels. A second factor we continue to experience, a significant competitive capacity growth in China. For the fourth quarter we anticipate an approximately 35% increase in non - United capacity growth year-over-year. Despite these pressures, our major shipments is in the US China market is an asset which will produce returns on our investments now and over the longer term. Results in Chengdu saw meaningful year-over-year improvement. And we are continuing to execute on our China's strategy with our new non stop service to Shiyan, China. While the current revenue environment is challenging, it is important that we take steps to capture incremental revenue by better meeting our customers' needs. For example, we know that our business customers prefer two cabin aircraft over single cabin 50 seat aircraft. We have responded by significantly increasing the number of two cabin regional jets for mainline aircraft and routes where we previously flew small regional jets without materially affecting capacity. To that end, 79% of United's top 100 business markets are now operated exclusively with two cabinet aircraft on weekdays. This is up from 59% in November of 2013. To put in a slightly different perspective, 94% of the flight in these markets will be flown with two cabin aircraft. We will continue this transition in the quarters ahead. While this is just one initiative, it is a good example of how we are listening to our customers and responding appropriately. ", "With respect to capacity. In the fourth quarter, we expect to grow approximately 1% to 2%. This 0.5 point increase versus our prior guidance is due to higher completion factor as improved operations are driving fewer cancel flights. For the full year 2016, we anticipate growing capacity approximately 1.5% to 2.5%. With a quarter of point due to leap year adding an additional day to the calendar. ", "In conclusion, as we move into 2016, we will begin lapping many of the headwinds to run your performance and expect quarter-over-quarter PRASM improvement. We are working to return PRASM growth which will be supported by our advancement in our operation, network and customer service. We want to be the carrier of choice and we will continue to take the necessary actions to achieve that goal. ", "With that I'll turn it over to Gerry. ", "Gerry Laderman", "Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Let me also thank our employees for another record quarter which was a direct result of their hard work and dedication. In the third quarter, our pretax profit was $1.7 billion excluding special items, the pretax margin of 16.6%. We increased our earnings per share by 65% year-over-year, generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and achieved a 12 months return on invested capital of 19.8%. Our GAAP net income was $4.8 billion but that includes a non-cash special item of $3.2 billion related to the reversal of our tax valuation allowance in the quarter.", "Non fuel cost performance in the third quarter was excellent. With consolidated CASM excluding fuel profit sharing and third party business expense decreasing 1.5% year-over-year. We expect CASM excluding those items to be flat to up 1% for the fourth quarter and to be down approximately 0.5% for the full year. Sensible cost management is critical for United's financial success. To the first nine months of this year, we've achieved approximately $600 million in non fuel savings through our project quality efficiency initiative and we expect to realize $800 million for the full year. We continue to expect achieve our goal of $1 billion in annual non fuel cost savings by the end of next year, a full year in advance of our initial expectations. ", "Turning to fuel expense. We recorded a hedge loss of approximately $250 million in the quarter. For the fourth quarter we are approximately 23% hedged and based on the October 15 forward curve, we expect to incur approximately $275 million in hedge losses while participating in approximately 81% of any future price declines. For 2016, we have about 17% of our expected fuel consumption hedge. This hedge is currently in a loss position of approximately $43 million, but does allow us to participate in approximately 93% of any future decline in oil prices. ", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve a pretax margin between 9.5% and 11.5% in the quarter with pressure coming from passenger revenue, offset by improved mileage plus revenue combined with lower fuel prices and solid non fuel cost performance. ", "As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, our top priority is investing in our business. We believe it is critical that our employees are provided the tools to do their jobs efficiently and effectively. Our investments are major contributor to our improving operational performance and we will continue to look for investments to further advance our progress in this area. In the quarter, we spent over $700 million on capital expenditures and continue to expect to spend approximately $3.2 billion for the full year. Part of this capital is allocated to aircraft. In the quarter, we took delivery of six 737-900ERs, four 787-9 and one new 737-700. We also added 16 additional, 76 seat Embraer E175 regional aircraft and now the 75 of these customer pleasing regional aircraft in our fleet.", "Debt repayment and pension funding were minimal in the quarter as we made excellent progress, paying down debt and funding our pension in the first half of the year. So far this year, we made more than $900 million of debt repayment and contributed $800 million to our pension plans. Actions like this strengthening our balance sheet and demonstrate our commitment to reducing the financial risk in our business. Additionally, providing a meaningful return to our investors is fundamental to our capital allocation plan. In the third quarter, we spent $262 million in share repurchases. So far this month, we've spent approximately $100 million more to repurchase United stock and this morning we also entered into a $300 million accelerated share repurchase program that will be completed within three months. Furthermore, this program does not prohibit us from making additional open market repurchases of our stock throughout the duration of the program. ", "To wrap up, we are proud of our results this quarter and we will continue to focus on delivering strong earnings and allocating our capital in a thoughtful and balanced manner. The investments we are making in our people and our product will ensure a great future. Finally, I just want to reiterate what we said earlier. The thoughts of everyone here are with Oscar and his family.", "I'll now turn it back over to Brett for closing remarks. ", "Brett Hart", "Thanks, Gerry. Thank you again to everyone who joined the call this morning. This had been a challenging few weeks for us. And we are proud of how the United family has come together. Now let me go, we ask our customers and our employees to tell us how we could do things better. And we have heard from thousands of you. We are reading and listening to every single suggestion and in the upcoming weeks, we will be announcing some changes that are a direct result of your feedback. We believe like you that United can be great again. And it is with your ideas, your support and dedication that we will as one United team be successful. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Jonathan to open the call for questions. ", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thank you, Brett. First, we will take questions from the analyst community. Then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask the questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Thank you. From Deutsche Bank we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.", "Michael Linenberg ", "Yes, Hey, good morning, everybody. Question to Jim. Jim, when you highlighted the sort of the four issues that have been undermining the revenue performance, you talked about the fourth one being this competitive pricing issue. And I know you sort of characterized it as such on this call. But when we look at the guidance that was put out today, I mean rather than competitive pricing I mean it's referenced as softening of domestic yields and maybe I'm just reading too much into it, but when I sort of see that it tells me maybe this is a bigger issue and maybe it is more of a demand issue rather than just a carriers going rogue on pricing. Can you just give us some additional thoughts on that?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Mike, excellent question. We are not seeing --if I talk about let's break it out, top of the domestic based on your question. We actually see what I would call a lukewarm or tepid demand and really good demand continuing kind of what we have seen in the third quarter and so for as we head into the fourth quarter. And so that as we think about our guidance, the items that highlighted whether be it foreign exchange, we still have that impact year-over-year and if you took today's current exchange rates, you would begin to fully lap that in the second quarter of 2016. Then there is the internationally jumping there is lower surcharges but that also flows across to domestic and impact domestic also, that given current surcharges with lap itself also in second quarter. And then we are somewhat unique with energy. And in the energy as I mentioned we are seeing about 35% declines in our corporate revenue associated with that sector. And quite frankly that we talked about that in 20% in the first quarter, 30% in the second quarter so 35% in the third. We continue to see a drift towards that 40%, so as I think about the fourth quarter that would be kind of demand maybe that you are point to that we would see given our presence in Houston that might be what you are alluding to. But at the end of the day also if you think about the course of the year, our expectations of demand at the beginning of the year are clearly lower as reflected in where GDP has gone through the year. So as we think about next year, many of those elements will start to lap but we are still focused on where that demand will be versus our expectations. We are planning around 2% to 3% GDP in 2016 but like this year we want to keep our eyes and monitor on where demand versus expectations go.", "Michael Linenberg ", "Great, very helpful. Then just my second question and this is to Gerry on the fleet. If I sort of look at your latest fleet schedule and I kind of look back the last time you published it, doesn't seem like there's much change on mainline. I think be holding a 747, you're holding onto it a little bit longer that maybe what you had previously expected. But when I look at the regional side, it does look like that your holding onto some of those airplanes a little bit longer. I think there was a bigger reduction in the regional fleet a few months back. Is that a function of maybe some of the issues that one of your regional carriers is facing and so in order to maybe back fill for some of that it makes sense to maybe keep some of these airplanes in the fleet longer? What's driving that?", "Gerry Laderman", "Mike, it is really just kind of timing issue on a few aircraft. It doesn't change sort of our long term view on where the fleet is headed and you will see over time less regional flying, more mainline flying as we up gauge but I wouldn't read too much into the change in the year end number. ", "Operator", "From Buckingham Research we have Daniel McKenzie on line. Please go ahead.", "Daniel McKenzie", "Hey, good morning, guys. Brett, congratulations on being selected to step up here and my condolences, I know you guys are all close to Oscar. I know you're still getting your feet wet in the role here but given your customer service responsibility this year I'm wondering if that's something you would want to talk to. What have you found? Where's the low hanging fruit and where do we go from here?", "Brett Hart", "Yes, appreciate that Dan. We have been focused for some time and course of the year on improving customer service and identifying areas where we can impact make a difference and where possible make a difference in the short run. Oscar certainly coming in and taking the time to talk to customers and employees, he is laser focused on that area as well. And this would be certainly one of those areas where we could say that our efforts are being expedited. I think that you see changes and improvement and you probably already are in areas like our ability to do with regular operations. And you will see us addressing the boarding process. You will see a number of changes related to the overall in flight experience. But we should keep in mind that at the very core, operational reliability is really the driver for customer satisfaction. I can ask Greg to add anything that he likes to add on this point as well. ", "Greg Hart", "Yes. Oscar obviously capable of as Brett mentioned a laser like focused on a number of things. One of which was reliability and it is really continuing the trend we started little bit over a year ago in terms of making improvements in the operations and rethinking really everything that we do each and everyday. And exciting thing for all of us is we are on the front end of a whole host of activities that we've engaged in over the past year to improve the operation. We got a wave of things that are coming to, that will help carry us forward in terms of improvements. ", "Daniel McKenzie", "Very good. I guess just second follow-up here. One message that I'm really hearing from you is 59% of the departures getting a heck of a lot better from a margin profitability perspective just given the RJ restructuring and you are obviously talking about getting back to margins relative to your peers. What are you seeing exactly in that part of the business in terms of profit improvement and where to be go from here? What any there in really with the RJ restructuring? ", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Dan. This is Jim. If you think about in two pieces and we feel lot obviously strong initiative introducing the E-175 into the network. And we are very far along in that path and we finish that rolling out that path as we move into 2016, we are very far along. I would say in terms of the regional piece and becoming less depended on it, if you think about continuing to remove 50 seat regional jets for about halfway in total when you combined that with where we are in the 76 seater in terms of restructuring the network. So we are very excited about it. You are right we are seeing the benefits that product of two class cabin, it is comes in a number of ways. One is just more competitive in this high business market. Secondly, it is introducing the ability to drive ancillary revenue which have been very successful on this year, introduces with that 76 seater we put in mainline when it substituting for 50 seater, a first class and economy class. So the network is responding really, really well in terms of as we gauge really gauging strategy to be much more competitive across the domestic network. ", "Operator", "From Cowen and Co we have Helane Becker on line. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker ", "Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. So just one question here with respect to-- actually I have two questions. There were some stories in the press this morning about some of the Chinese airlines merger cargo and operations and then some speculation that maybe some of the larger airlines would merge. I don't necessarily want you to comment on what you can't comment on, but I am just kind of curious China Southern is a sky team member in Air China is star lines member so have you thought about how something like that would affect your operations in China going forward?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Helane. This is Jim. Air China is a tremendous partner of ours and quite frankly we are continuing to build that relationship as we grow in China. And lot of degrees here to your questions obviously China is a very competitive market and as I mentioned we see non UA capacity growing 35% in the fourth quarter. I'll tell you it's very profitable for us and its profitability quarter-over-quarter has continue through the first three quarters this year and I expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. And is built on really strong plan that we've talked about in the past. One is capturing the demand that is very strong out of China. If you think about the demand in China what we are finding is that although there is a large capacity increase, as the economy grows it stimulates more traffic. There is also existing traffic from China to the US many times goes over other connecting point such as Korea. So it is non stop come in but we capturing of that traffic too. So not only is that a market that's growing in new demand, we are actually recapturing some of that connecting traffic over hub such in Korea. That being said, our strategy again is also depended on the secondary cities not just the Beijing and Shanghai. And a lot of studies have shown that the demand for China will double by 2020, half of that demand is going to come from secondary cities. So when we are look at our due service out of San Francisco, it's exceeding our expectations in doing very well year-over-year. And that's heart of that strategy which is why we are excited about our second secondary city San Francisco to Shiyan. So I know I answered your question, China is an important part of our network, very profitable, extremely competitive in whether it's cargo or whether it's passenger carriers, but we think we are really well positioned to keep building on the profitability that we have there. ", "Brett Hart", "Hi, Helane. This is Brett. Just to put a point on that I think the second part of your question. We are just in a position to speculate on rumors related to potential mergers. ", "Helane Becker", "Okay, no, that's fine. And then I just have a completely unrelated question. How far along are you in -- I know this I'm not saying it the right way. But how close are you to the cap on 70 C aircraft with respect to your scope clause?", "Gerry Laderman ", "Helane, based on what we have in the pipeline, we would hit that cap sometime next year as we bring in the rest of the 175's.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research we have Hunter Keay online. Please go ahead. ", "Hunter Keay", "Good morning. One of the things that investors point to continually with United is the free cash flow yield. But you guys don't really talk about cash flow. You don't talk about free flow, I don't think you ever guided to and if you talk with people that believe in your stock, it has the potential to be one of the best free cash flow stories around. Good and even better industrial companies guide to free cash flow regularly so I guess two questions for you. Why aren't you talking about your free cash flow more and highlighting what can really be sort of industry best in story there? Is it something that we need to know about that maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves and if you care to put in a guidepost how should think about free cash generation next year, I would love to hear that too.", "Gerry Laderman", "So, Hunter, it is Gerry. This year as you know has been a great year for free cash flow and really kind of the first year that we made terrific progress in that direction. So it is something we look at. I personally get little bothered by the way it's typically calculated only because in airline has a significant CapEx exposure to new aircraft and depending on how we choose to finance new aircraft that has a material impact on free cash flow. So what we are doing is kind of thinking about the best way to look at that and manage that and work with you and others on how best to deliver that message. But it is a focus of ours. ", "Hunter Keay", "Okay. And then in the context of capital returns, I know that you guys said that you're going to be ramping up the buyback in the fourth quarter which is great. It's good to see that certainly, but do we need new leadership to come in and to really sort of bless a more aggressive capital deployment strategy? Or is this something that the current leadership team has the willingness and ability to do on an interim basis in the event that you can be opportunistic on your stock in terms of buying it back and in the event that you guys do have a bunch of cash coming into the business next year either be a debt which are going to raise for new aircraft acquisitions or the free cash flow itself, is there any recent think why the pace of the share buyback should not be materially increase in all of equal environment as we move through the course of 2016?", "Gerry Laderman", "So, Hunter, as Brett said earlier we are moving forward with our plan and certainly my plan in finance is to balance capital deployment. It has been in place for quite while. Now granted in the third quarter, our share buyback may not have been what some people would have expected, but keep in mind that was the circumstances we were dealing within the third quarter. We just felt it was prudent to maintain the steady pace we were at. But as you can see what we have done this month already between what we actually purchase in the open market and the ASR that we entered into that's $400 million dedicated to the share repurchase in this month. So we are absolutely committed to contributing our current $3 billion program at or ahead of schedule. So that will continue. And let me talk about the other parts of the capital deployment strategy. It is absolutely essential that we make the investments we have to make in our people and our processes now systems and our product. It's going to be done sensibly and these investments need to be margin neutral or margin accretive. And I think that those investments will be made within the CapEx guidance that we've been giving out. And then we got continued de-risking of our balance sheet. That's an area that we don't have a luxury any more for pre paying substantial amount of high coupon debt. As you know, we've done all that. So going forward as we continue to manage to the right level of debt, that will be a combination of the debt that amortizes over the next few years, it is billions of dollars. First of all, we manage financing for new aircraft then it's interesting situation because that's an area that we can access capital really, really cheaply whether it's through the capital market or through the banks. And we continue to manage that and in the process while I would expect that we would continue to finance most of our aircraft deliveries, we may not finance them to the level that we have in the past. And that's another way of getting to our goal of de-leveraging. But there is no question and as you saw given our commitment this month, we are very focused on as part of that also doing the right thing with returning capital to shareholders.", "Operator", "From Credit Suisse we have Julie Yates online. Please go ahead. ", "Julie Yates", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Are you guys ready to give a split between the domestic and international growth embedded in the 2016 capacity guide? ", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Julie. This is Jim. We've guided to consolidated 1.5% to 2.5%. Right now as we look at capacity for 2016, we'd be up 1% to 2% on the domestic side and 2% to 3% on the international, so that's how we would split that 1.5% to 2.5%. And I've always say were going to keep our eye on demand and make sure that we have a best align or demand with capacity but we're really comfortable with that breakout right now. ", "Julie Yates", "Okay, great. And then any comments just directionally how that 2% to 3% internationally was split between the three geographies? ", "Jim Compton", "I will give you some direction that we recently and we're very excited about some markets we just announced, San Fran and Auckland, San Fran to Shiyan, China as well as San Fran -Tel Aviv. So San Francisco is a key focus for us to continue to capture the benefit in Asia as well as we have a terrific long history in Israel that we feel really excited about the San Francisco, Tel Aviv flights. So a lot of that off is West Coast or some -- there's a little bit of run rate in some areas this year, but that would be things that were ready to talk about right now.", "Julie Yates", "Okay, very helpful. And then Jim on the domestic PRASM, looks like that improves sequentially to a decline of 1.6% in Q3 which is about 180 basis points better than Q2 primarily on load factors, that's nicely ahead of the A4 average, it is pretty impressive given the pressures in Chicago and Houston. What's allowing you guys to outperform on domestic unit revenues and do you expect the domestic entity can continue to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter and into 2016 as well? ", "Jim Compton", "Julie, I think it is a number of things. And first point to some of the things that we talked about and the improvement on the operations as we gone through the year. The operations teams done a tremendous job. And so we are building that for a liability that we need to build and as Greg mentioned we have more to go and we are going to continue to do that. And so from revenue perspective you can clearly see that, that when you become carrier of choice and at the margin you build on that you see that incremental revenue come to us, we are very excited about that. The revenue management team although there is competitive pricing out there. We approach that as not one size result and so not into a lot of detail but the revenue management team works extremely hard particularly at high demand period to make sure that the best mix of demand is on the aircraft like and pull that off to really strong way. The network as we talked about as we begin our up gauging introducing two cabin aircraft into business market, it is giving up -- it is at the early stages of giving those results. So in number of those things and yet we do have those pressures not because of price expansion but the fact that the energy sector is now, I think the team has done a terrific job. Actually if you take a look at it and you referenced the 84A, our consolidated domestic length apologist arousing in the third quarter was it high it has been since 2011 on a relative basis to 84A peers, so we are really excited about the initiatives that teams driving, actually more excited about what we have come forward. ", "Operator", "From JPMorgan we have Jamie Baker on line. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Baker ", "Hi, good morning. A question for Brett. We met with Oscar recently and he indicated and these are his words that United had lost its front line. And I for one appreciated the bluntness of that statement. He also indicated that he expected to have the final bench, manage of bench in place by year end. I know you spoke about pushing forward with the current agenda but I'm curious if your views on the front line and the timetable from management clearly are consistent with his.", "Brett Hart", "Yes, I appreciate that question, Jamie. I think first you have to put in the context what Oscar was doing in his seven weeks with the company and his commitment first and foremost was to get out into the operations to get down into break room or is to get out on the ramp to talk to employees and the focus very specifically on what they would like to see change. And he heard it at every location that he went to and it's very healthy for us to receive that feedback. And Oscar had a level of urgency with respect to addressing; getting our employees the tools they need to provide terrific customer service which is at the end of the day his clearly are objective. So I think what you may have read from that perspective into Oscar's comments was a real sense of urgency which we all need to have about ensuring that our employees, our front line employees are able to provide the level of service that they would like to provide and in some respect we really acknowledge that we can do better and we are working very hard on that. But I wouldn't misinterpret Oscar's desire to create urgency in that area which is appropriate with an outcome perspective to disconnect between our front line employees and management so we are very focused on it and we expect to continue to move forward with the momentum that Oscar brought in that area. As relates to the management team, look this is added score, this is a team that has been here through first quarter which resulted in record results, and the second quarter which was already in record results and the third quarter which we resulted in a record results. We would expect -- you would expect every new CEO to come and evaluate his management team that is the CEO's prerogative, any changes that are made are based upon what's perceived as we needed and in parts what that CEO perceives that he or she need. So I don't think that's out of the ordinary for a new CEO. I'll tell you that the team that we have here now is fully capable of and well in fact execute the plan to rest of this year. And we feel very confident about that and we feel very confident about our ability to continue to connect with the front line employees and move forward as the unified organization. ", "Jamie Baker ", "Excellent. I appreciate that. Second question follow up with Jim on domestic pricing. How much stronger are pricing trends in markets where discounters do not file fair's than in the O&D where they do and the reason I ask the question is that I am trying to assess whether domestic revenue pressures are a function solely of discounter influence or perhaps there's also room for pricing improvements in markets where discounters do not have an influence, any color on that?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Jamie, Jim. Yes, clearly the competitor pricing pressures that we talked about in Houston, Dallas and Chicago continue and so it is -- those competitor pricing pressures are more isolated in those markets. I would add that the energy sector becomes a little bit more spread both international and the domestic where we have seen that demand. But outside of that we see good demand, relatively -- relative to -- obviously energy relatively strong demand and so I think that as we manage price relative that demand we will continue to do that. And but I think there is a strong demand outside those markets that you refer to. ", "Operator", "From Stifel we have Joseph DeNardi on line. Please go ahead.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Thank you. Brett, just on your comments about closing the margin gap between you and your peers, I guess your few innings into on the cost side and a fuel adjusted basis margin having a close much so, is the story here that you just have to wait for Houston and domestic yields in the Pacific to get better before the gap starts to close or what are the main levers over the next 24 months that you see closing that gap?", "Jim Compton ", "Well, clearly this is Jim. Clearly the energy is putting pressure on us. And so as that sector moves and whether it softens a little bit more and begin to improve that will obviously have an impact on us because the corporate energy business and that sector and our hub in Houston is very much affected by that business. In terms of growing margins from a networks perspective, I separate that because the networks on a past as I saw as we kind of refer to what we are doing with two cabin aircraft becoming less depended on regional jets that are up gauging strategy is very much a margin accretive strategy. And so --and we are going to continue -- that is our path to continue into 2016. In addition that up gauging just a piece of that is slimline activity that we began this year. Remember that we've talked about it before, it comes out of $0.04 to $0.06 rise depending on the fleet in the market and it comes out of about $0.01 to $0.02 CASM depending on the market, very much margin accretive. So I think would summarize is that being the team's initiative going forward are to continue to drive incremental margin and we are really confident that we can do that. There are some extra things obviously such as the energy that put pressure on that. But we are moving forward, the network will continue to contribute to that. ", "Gerry Laderman", "Yes. Joe, it is Gerry. On the cost side, keep in mind that brings next year as we continue with project quality initiative. We hit that run rate of $1 billion, that's couple hundred million incremental to this year, so there is some real benefit there. We got to continue de-leveraging that helps on interest expense and yes don't forget as we continue on the reliability initiatives efficiency is going to drive cost down as well. ", "Joseph DeNardi", "Okay, thanks for that. And Gerry, I guess just on project quality, just the $200 million in savings expected in 4Q just given the pace that you guys are moving out, how much upside is there to the $1 billion at this point and then if you could just -- is there an interest expense target that you think is appropriate for next year just given the de-leveraging?", "Gerry Laderman", "On project quality, it is too soon to tell kind of pace going forward beyond the initial initiative. We'll have more color I think when we start our talking about 2016 cost guidance in January. But I can tell you that nobody is stopping. The $1 billion will reach and the sort of the sensible cost management culture is embedded in everyone's DNA here, so we will continue with those efficiencies. As Jim said, as we update we are going to get some benefits there on the cost side as well. So we will have more color for you into next year. But we are hopeful of that, that we will continue with the progress we've made. ", "Joseph DeNardi", "Okay. Then just on the interest expense, is there a target, do you think you guys can get to next year?", "Gerry Laderman", "Not really. We're not going to that yet. Will take a look at so where the opportunities are there and will have more color on that in January.", "Operator", "And our last question from Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora on line. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Didora", "Hey, good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the question. I guess my first question for Jim certainly appreciates all the color around what you're seeing in China right now. It seems like from booking standpoint you aren't seeing much of a change. But with the capacity increases you noted I guess will unit revenues in the region get worse before they get better or do you see -- can you continue sequential improvement on the Pacific like you're seeing from a system wide perspective?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Andrew, Jim. Obviously that capacity if you think about China, by itself that capacity does put pressure on unit revenue and we see that 35% growth in the fourth quarter. But on the other hand demand is growing strong but as I mentioned on the couple sources of that demand whether it is traffic that's making, it is also the US over other connecting points or the economies stimulating it. So we are filling much of that capacity and as you think about going forward the Chinese carriers continue to use the rights and as we move beyond 2016 given the current allocation of right we should begin to see that capacity growth debate.", "Andrew Didora", "Great, thank you for that. And my follow-up question. I guess at this time, are you willing to say when you think you could get back to a flat system wide PRASM?", "Jim Compton", "Andrew, this is Jim. I am not. I talked a little bit about kind of the pieces that are moving, foreign exchange that giving current levels of foreign exchange, the negative impact of PRASM will begin to fully lap in the second quarter. The lower surcharges will lap fully in the second quarter given where they are at today. The energy business is the one that we are watching really, really closely. We've seen it soften a little bit more from the second quarter and we talked about being 35% down in the third quarter. Compare to -- based on the pricing structure today that would lap itself in the third quarter of next year. So it is difficult to pinpoint when that PRASM would be flat year-over-year. But we think those pressures, those negative pressures begin to update as we move towards that. And the last piece is that, as I mentioned on earlier comments that we are going to keep our eye on demand. Demand at the beginning of this year expectations were to be greater than what we've seen. And so it makes it difficult to pinpoint that. But as I mentioned in my comments we do see that quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement as we head towards growing PRASM. ", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the analysts and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Reuters we have Geoffrey Dunstan. Please go ahead.", "Geoffrey Dunstan", "Thank you very much. Brett how does your vision or the initiatives you will introduce to realize that vision differ at all from Mr. Munoz's vision or initiatives? ", "Brett Hart", "Hi, Geoffrey. They don't differ at all. We have plan in place and we are going to work execute that plan over the course of the next couple of months to finish out this fiscal year. Oscar's focus and what he brought to us during the time that he was here, and was a renewed focus on our customers, on getting our employees the tools they need to succeed in provide excellent customer service. Making sure that our systems and processes are geared towards those objectives and he had a very strong focus first and foremost on safety. We are using what he provided in terms of his vision as a lens for executing on our plan for the rest of this fiscal year. So those perspectives are in entirely aligned and there would be no dramatic changes. ", "Geoffrey Dunstan", "Great, thank you very much. In line with that, what is on the table beside a new tone that will United to conclude contracts with its flight attendants and its maintenance technicians and then if you may, is there anything that's going to be a game changer to the in-flight experience and plans that you are guys taking now. ", "Brett Hart", "So on the first part of that question; we remain very focused on achieving joint collective bargaining agreements. And we think that Oscar's focus again was on connecting immediately with our front line employees and with our labor leaders. And we will continue that process. So and obviously towards achieving agreements that are fair to or employees and fair to the company over the long run. So we remain focused on that. In terms of the in-flight experience I'll allow Greg to -- Greg or Jim to provide perspective on that. ", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Geoffrey, Jim. On the products, let me jump on the products side and I think what you are going to see is when I think call it cadence and we have been doing a deep review of our product and quite frankly listening to our customers and our employees being involved in that conversation about different things we can do. So it is cadence and I would say that we are down to three choices of premium coffee. And that was something we heard loud and clear. And I think we are really, really closet. We kind of go through that process bringing our employees quite frankly into that process and our customers are going to enjoy that so forth. It is small example of cadence that you are going to see across the company. Relatively quickly I want to say this is going to come slowly. And recognizing our best customers, our flight attendants today are doing a terrific job of offering a free drink to some of our best customers in the economy cabin when they don't get their upgrade. So that's another example of cadence of things from a product point of view. I put all that we have a number of product things happening. Whether as to continuation of rolling out Wi-Fi, whether it's the reconfiguration of our aircraft and growing flatbed seats, newer San Fran and newer LA will be100 flatbed seat beginning on October 25 with our PS service in New York. So a number of product things are going to be happening as well as the things that we are hearing from our customers and employees. ", "Operator", "And our last question from the Associate Press, we have David Koenig. Please go ahead.", "David Koenig", "I was going to ask pretty much the same thing about the in-flight experience. How quickly are you going to have more details on that? There were some reference to some other initiatives coming out and maybe some guidance in January. When do you expect to have more details on anything additional on in-flight experience? ", "Jim Compton", "More details. Over the next week and we will be starting -- we will announce more of those details. So again it is a cadence that a cadence as we can implement them. Some items take longer to implement and planning. But as we move through the next several weeks and through the end of the year. You will hear many of those details. ", "David Koenig", "And anything you can say more on the boarding process? I mean that's something that carriers constantly ticker with, is it just part of that fleet that's giving you problem or you are looking at everything and what might you change?", "Jim Compton", "It is interesting after all who is looking at the boarding process because that's one of the things quite frankly that we hear a lot about and how we can improve it. And we are actually doing some testing of that boarding process here in O'Hare beginning this week, changes to it. So nothing to announce yet but again an example of that. There is a lot of activity happening based on what we are hearing from our employees and what from customers. So you will hear more on that where we describe how that testing went. But we are going to try -- you will hear will be experimenting with some different boarding process, give some better details and how we can improve that. ", "David Koenig", "Can you say what you are testing? ", "Jim Compton", "I am sorry.", "David Koenig", "Can you say what you are testing? ", "Jim Compton", "I won't because the testing is literally starting this week. I will encourage people to walk by BA in O'Hare and you can see that testing live if you are hitting one of the time periods we are doing it.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Brandon, this will conclude our call. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call me at relations if you have any further questions. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Good bye.

But today, let me start frankly by extending my thanks for all the well wishes I have received from across my United family during my situation. I am pleased to report that I feel great. My recovery is progressing very nicely. Already this week, in fact, over the course of the last month, I am beginning to participate in meetings and certainly plan to increase my involvement each week going forward. As far as expectation of full return, I certainly will be back full-time by the end of the first quarter, if not sooner and I am incredibly energized by that prospect. So again, I look forward to seeing all of you out on the road.", "As I am thanking people, I want to thank Brett and my entire United team for their excellent work and implementing our shared purpose and vision for United. We really have made significant progress in both our operation and our financial performance. I am frankly excited to be here today that we announced record profits for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. And this I tell you could not have been done without the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that exist with our frontline employees. I am very proud of what they do each and everyday and we are going to leverage and use this increased level of engagement to continue the momentum into 2016 and beyond.", "So, with that, let me turn the call over to Brett.", "Brett Hart", "Thanks, Oscar and thank you all for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. The entire United family is very pleased to have Oscar in the room with us today. And like him, we are all looking forward to his full-time return. In the meantime, I and the management team want to thank our employees for making 2015 a great year for United. We achieved record financial and operational performance, made meaningful strides towards enhancing the customer experience and this fall we committed to continuously earning the trust of customers and employees. While we are \u2013 while we still have more work to do, I am proud of the tangible measures of success we have already demonstrated, none of which could have been accomplished without the hard work and commitment from the entire United team. Over the last 3 months, I have visited each of our hubs and I am consistently impressed by our employees\u2019 enthusiasm, dedication and strong desire to win and it is an honor to work alongside them as we take the next steps toward improving United.", "Today, we reported 2015 pre-tax earnings of $4.5 billion, our highest level of earnings in United\u2019s history. I am pleased to announce that through our profit sharing program, employees will be able to share in the success as we pay out $698 million, our largest distribution ever. For the year, we achieved a return on invested capital of 21%, also marking the highest ROIC ever reported by United. These numbers represent a meaningful improvement year-over-year as well as progress closing the gap in financial performance of our two closest competitors.", "A major contributor to our strong financial performance is the improvement in our operation. When compared to last year, our completion rate improved by more than 1 point and on-time performance was 6 points better for the full year 2015. This was particularly evident in the fourth quarter as our on-time performance and completion factor were the best since the merger. A well-run operation is a top priority for customers and we are working extremely hard to become the consistently reliable airline our customers can depend on.", "We also want to be a great place to work for our employees. We have a responsibility to provide them with contracts they deserve. And this fall, we made significant progress to do just that. Evidence of this progress can be found in the two new agreements covering our pilots and technicians that are currently in the ratification process. Additionally, we reached an agreement to open negotiations on new contracts for our airport and customer service work groups, more than one year in advance of the amendable dates. We are also continuing negotiations with our flight attendants and are hopeful that we reach an agreement with them this year. I want to thank these union groups for their commitment to reaching agreements that will lead our workforce in the years to come.", "I am pleased with the progress we made in 2015. We took significant actions that have led to both strong financial and operational performance. We are excited for the opportunities in 2016 as we focus on making the changes necessary to become the airline that we, our customers and our shareholders expected to be.", "Now, I will turn it over to Greg.", "Greg Hart", "Thanks, Brett and thank you to everyone for joining the call this morning. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their efforts this year, particularly during the busy holiday travel season. As Brett mentioned, we have made meaningful improvements to our operation and we couldn\u2019t have done it without the continued hard work and dedication of our employees. Due to the great work of the United team in 2015, we had the best on-time arrival performance since the merger. Additionally, we had a better completion rate than our network competitors in both New York and Chicago and better completion in Houston than our network competitor in Dallas.", "We also continue to deliver well on bag performance. In fact, during 2015, we achieved record bag performance for 7 of the 12 months in the year. As reflection of our commitment to operational excellence, we recently launched a new United Global Performance Commitment for corporate customers in 2016. With this program, we will compensate eligible corporate accounts if we fail to meet our operational targets for the year. This clearly demonstrates our level of confidence and commitment to continue to improve United\u2019s operational performance.", "Looking forward to 2016, we have a number of opportunities to further improve the operation. One change we implemented earlier this month was an increase in the amount of out-and-back flying we do. Said differently, we are increasing the amount of flying that begins at a hub and then travels to another station before returning directly back to the originating hub. In 2015, approximately 35% of our flights followed an out-and-back pattern. At the beginning of this year, we transitioned to approximately 70% of our flights that now follow this pattern, although which is more consistent with that of our peers.", "This does two things for us. First, it dramatically reduces the complexity of the operation. In addition, it helps to isolate the impact of weather and aircraft control related events to the impacted hub while mitigating the impact on our other hubs. We believe that reducing this complexity and limiting the impact of weather on our operations will drive improved reliability and efficiency and provide a better experience for our customers and our employees.", "In closing, I want to thank the entire operations team for all their hard work in 2015. I am proud of the significant progress we made this year and I look forward to building on these successes in 2016.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Compton", "Thanks Greg. I would also like to thank our customers for their business in 2015. As Brett indicated earlier, we want to be our customers\u2019 first choice on every trip they take. And we will achieve this by continually building their trust. Accomplishing this won\u2019t be easy and won\u2019t happen overnight, but the entire team is committed to this goal. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined 6%. The four primary factors we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our revenue performance as expected; strong U.S. dollar, the effects of lower oil prices, pressure as a result of margin accretive initiatives and competitive pricing actions. However, we also faced some unanticipated headwinds during the quarter. First, the attacks in Paris put pressure on bookings across the Atlantic during the weeks that followed the event. Second, our strong operational performance resulted in more completed flights than initially planned. While this is beneficial to margin and excellent for our customers, the additional capacity provided a tailwind to unit costs, but a headwind to PRASM. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw oil prices continue to fall. We have provided incremental pressure to our Houston hub and corporate energy business, while ultimately being a tailwind to our fuel expense and overall earnings. Finally, demand declined throughout the quarter as demonstrated by downward revisions to fourth quarter GDP expectations.", "Turning to the first quarter, we expect our unit revenue to decline approximately 6% to 8% year-over-year with domestic PRASM down approximately 4% to 6% and international PRASM down approximately 8% to 10%. The major drivers for the first quarter revenue performance are expected to be largely the same as the fourth quarter. For the consolidated system, we expect foreign exchange impacts will account for 1 point of year-over-year PRASM pressure. Given further decline in oil prices, we anticipate continued pressure from lower surcharges, particularly in Japan which we expect will account for approximately 1 point of weakness. Lower oil prices have reduced revenue from our corporate energy customers and we are also beginning to see a decline in revenue from the broader non-energy Houston market. The combined revenue pressure from both these energy contracts in the Houston hub is anticipated to be approximately 1 point. Finally, we also expect the current competitive pricing actions will drive approximately 1.5 points of decline in the quarter.", "As we have mentioned before, while PRASM is an important metric, there are other metrics at United that are equally or even more important, principally profit margin and earnings. As we construct our network and deploy our assets across it, our primary goal is to increase earnings and margin. To that end, there are certain decisions that may be dilutive to unit revenue, but margin accretive for the business. Over the next several years, we have specific initiatives in place that may have just that effect. Our up-gauging initiative is one such example. Our reducing departures and increasing the average gauge of our airplanes, we will grow our capacity very efficiently, which will be a tailwind for CASM while putting pressure on the PRASM performance. I would add that in the case where we replace the single cabin 50-seat aircraft with the two cabin regional small mainline aircraft, there is additional revenue that we can generate from having Economy Plus and First Class seats. In 2016, we anticipate increasing our average gauge by approximately 5% and reducing our average departures by approximately 1% compared to 2015.", "Another opportunity to grow earnings comes from further improvements to our pricing and segmentation capabilities. As we have seen in 2015, this has become an increasingly important component to revenue management. The more we segment our fares, the better opportunity we will have to minimize revenue dilution. The first phase is the rollout of our bundled fare offerings this month. This allows customers to purchase the collection of products suited to their travel as opposed to a more manual process of selecting from an \u00e0-la-carte menu. The second phase, which we expect to launch in the second half of this year, will complement this bundled structure by introducing an entry level fare that will appeal to the purely price sensitive customer. We believe this slate of offerings will allow further segmentation across United\u2019s customer base, while also avoiding some levels of revenue dilution built into our pricing structures today.", "Another way we intend to improve our revenue performance is through continuing to improve the reliability of the operation. Reliability is a top priority for our customers. And over the last several years, our revenue has suffered from the inconsistency in our operation. As Greg mentioned, the operation has made significant strides forward and we expect over time for this to generate additional revenue. Earning the trust of our customers is critical for long-term earnings improvement and the great work from Greg and his team are cornerstone for that success.", "With respect to capacity and as a result of reduced trans-Atlantic flying, we reduced our expectations for the first quarter capacity and now anticipate growing approximately 1.5% to 2.5%. For the full year, we still expect to grow 1.5% and 2.5%. As we all know, there are certain pockets of the globe that are experiencing economic slowdowns. We are thoughtfully addressing these issues by repositioning capacity to the areas that are experiencing the most economic growth. An example of this is what we are doing in Houston. Due to the decline in the energy business as we have discussed, our Houston hub has experienced significant yield pressure. Consequently, we are shifting capacity away from Houston and into other growing markets like Denver and San Francisco. We will remain disciplined in allocating our capacity in the markets that will generate the highest profitability. In conclusion, we are continuing to implement margin accretive initiatives, product improvements and other initiatives across the commercial organization to attract and retain more high value business customers. In 2016, we anticipate sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement and expect that the actions we are taking, along with an improving operation, will further earn the trust of our customers.", "With that, I will turn it over to Gerry.", "Gerry Laderman", "Thanks Jim. I would also like to thank our employees for helping to make 2015 a record year for United. Their hard work led to our success this year and I know they will bring the same energy and dedication to our efforts in 2016. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $934 million or $2.54 per share excluding special items. This is double what we earned in the fourth quarter of 2014 and marks the seventh straight quarter of record earnings. For the full year 2015, we reported $4.5 billion of net income or $11.88 per share excluding special items and we achieved the pretax margin of 11.9%, a 6.8 point increase versus last year and the highest in United\u2019s history.", "Disciplined cost management has been the key contributor to our results this year. For the full year, our unit costs excluding fuel, profit sharing and third party expenses decreased 0.7%, more than 1 point lower than our initial 2015 guidance, despite nearly 0.5 point of capacity reduction from our original plans. As Jim mentioned, our up-gauging strategy was a meaningful contributor to our CASM performance in 2015 and we expect this contribution will continue as we ramp up the program through 2019. Looking forward to 2016, we expect our CASM, excluding the impact of new labor deals to increase approximately 1%. The new labor agreements with our pilots and technicians, currently open for both, would add approximately 2.5 points of CASM for the year. This is consistent with our commitment to maintain CASM growth below inflation over planning cycles. 2 years ago, we set a goal to achieve $1 billion in annual non-fuel savings by 2017. We now expect to achieve this goal in 2016, a full year in advance of our original timeline. This focus on continuous improvement and durable savings will not end as we still have opportunities to improve efficiency and manage costs prudently.", "Turning to fuel expense, for 2016 we are 17% hedged and are in a loss position of approximately $225 million. Our portfolio allows us to participate in 98% of any future declines. We are currently evaluating the structure of our hedge program. And in the meantime, we have not added any new hedges since July 2015. Based on the guidance we have provided for cost and revenue in the first quarter of 2016, we expect our pre-tax margin to be between 8% and 10% in the first quarter.", "Moving on to cash flow, in 2015, we generated $6 billion of operating cash flow and $2.5 billion of free cash flow. In deciding how best to allocate capital, I would also look at cash flow net of aircraft financing, since the decision to lease versus purchase an aircraft can have a material impact on the traditional calculation of free cash flow. When incorporating proceeds from long-term aircraft financing, we generated over $4 billion in adjusted free cash flow for 2015. I am pleased that we continue to generate significant cash flow in excess of both what we need to run our business and what we need to secure our future.", "Taking all that into account, in the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $520 million repurchasing United stock, about double the amount we spent in the prior quarter. For the full year 2015, we spent $1.2 billion in the share buyback program. Looking forward, I expect that we will spend at least $750 million repurchasing stock in the first quarter and now plan to complete our current $3 billion program substantially earlier than originally anticipated.", "One of the tools we use is the 10b5-1 plan, which allows us to purchase stock throughout the quarter even during periods when we might otherwise be unable to be in the market. As an example, we purchased shares on every trading day so far this month. We also used our cash to fulfill one of my primary missions of ensuring that we continue to make all appropriate investments in our business. In 2016, we expect to spend $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.1 billion of non-aircraft CapEx. This would be roughly $100 million more than 2015 for non-aircraft CapEx. This increase is driven almost entirely by incremental technology investments. We believe that further investment in our technology is critical for our ability to compete in the years to come.", "We also expect to invest approximately $1.7 billion on our fleet in 2016. We plan to take delivery of 14 737s, 5 787-9s, our first 777-300ER and 9 used A319s. We will also add 40 Embraer E175s to our regional fleet. Our fleet investments this year also included pre-delivery deposits associated with the order we announced today for 40 737-700 aircraft to be delivered beginning mid-2017. As we have stated in the past, we are continuing to shift more flying towards the mainline operation as our regional flying is being reduced. It is our expectation that our current seat of approximately 250 50-seat aircraft will be reduced by more than half by the end of 2019. While this new 737 order does provide replacement capacity to partially offset the reduction in the regional operation, we are continuing to pursue additional aircraft to continue up-gauging and meet our capacity plans.", "We are also utilizing our cash to continue to secure our future. In 2015, we prepaid $1.2 billion of debt, including $300 million in the fourth quarter. As of the end of the year, our gross debt balance, including capitalized operating leases, was $17 billion, $1.1 billion less than the end of the prior year.", "In 2015, we also contributed more than $800 million to our pension plans. And as of year end, our unfunded pension liability is now $1.5 billion, a $700 million reduction from the prior year. As we head towards well-funded status for our pensions, we anticipate contributing approximately $400 million to our pension plans in 2016.", "In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for United as seen in nearly every financial metric. Moving into 2016, we look forward to delivering strong earnings performance and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation. I believe that the investments we are making in our people and our product will lead to a strong future that will benefit our employees, customers and investors.", "I will now turn it back over to Jonathan.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Thank you, Gerry. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Jonathan. [Operator Instructions] From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi on line. Please go ahead.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jim, just on your comments around demand weakening through the quarter kind of tied to the revisions to GDP. So, are you seeing that show up in forward bookings? And does the guidance for first quarter assume that demand continues to weaken from here or that kind of starts to stabilize at some point?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Joe, this is Jim. As you look at first quarter, our guidance is obviously based on the information that we have today both a yield perspective and a booking perspective. What I would say is that the pressures that we saw in the fourth quarter, which are mainly yield, continue in the first quarter. So, we see strong demand. I have to always separate a little about what Houston and the energy, there are certain sectors that in high-yield demand we are seeing weakness. But overall, our bookings, both factors look where they were last year in terms of the load factor point of view. It\u2019s the yield pressure that we see in the first quarter.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Okay. And then Gerry, just on the profit sharing accrual in first quarter that\u2019s I think about 60% higher than first quarter on a much less increase in op income. So, have there been any changes to that just based on some of the new labor contracts or how should we think about in 2016?", "Gerry Laderman", "There have been some minor changes. For example, we added a layer for our M&A employees at 10% over a certain threshold. Other than that, it\u2019s pretty similar.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "From Cowen & Company, we have Helane Becker on line. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker", "Thanks very much, operator. Oscar, welcome back. Do you guys ever release or tell us and this is probably for Jim, what percent of the cabin, the front of the cabin is being sold versus used for upgrades?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Helane. We haven\u2019t released that. It\u2019s one of those we have talked about in the past growing our pay versus load factor and we continue to do that. I will tell you we are also focused on making sure that we keep that in balance with our loyalty customers. There is a lifetime value with our MileagePlus customers. That\u2019s very important to the overall economics as we go forward. So, it\u2019s a balance. And so internally, we continue to debate what that is, whether it\u2019s pure products to offer to get into the first class, lower price points in first class, but also balancing that with the upgrades to our loyal customers.", "Oscar Munoz", "Helane, this is Oscar. Let me just add my suspicions. As I traveled on our network and system, I spent a lot of time on our aircraft and spent a lot of time with some of our high-value customers and that is a particular sore subject with them. And so that balance that Jim speaks about, I think is a very important one that we have to strike.", "Helane Becker", "Okay. Thanks very much, gentlemen. Those are really all my questions for now.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on line. Please go ahead.", "Hunter Keay", "Good morning. So Gerry, it\u2019s nice to see the buyback pick up and thank you for the update. But if we assume you guys have significantly more cash of which to dispose this year, which I am putting at about $6 billion to $7 billion factoring in pension contributions, assumptions around finance CapEx and maybe a little bit of excess cash, should it be a fairly obvious decision to make that the level of buybacks this year exceeds your capital spending given the immediate accretion that you get to EPS, not to mention the signal you will send to your long-term shareholders about the trajectory of earnings beyond this year?", "Gerry Laderman", "Hunter, that\u2019s a good question. Let me talk about capital allocation generally, just as sort of set the stage. We have really the three components to it. So we are very focused on making the investments we have to make. To paraphrase an old friend of mine, I know what happens when you take the cheese off the pizza. So we will, first and foremost, make the right investment, but they have to drive the value that we expect or we would stop making some of them. Let me turn to the balance sheet and in securing the future, we are in a pretty good spot with the balance sheet, so I would not anticipate the level of debt prepayment that you have seen in the past. Having said that, the way we will continue to manage the balance sheet is through the amount of new aircraft financing. So I would expect this year to finance some, probably not all of the aircraft this year and that\u2019s going to potentially leave some cash. I would say first and foremost, I want to see that cash before I spend the cash. But as we continue to manage our cash sort of down to the target range that we feel comfortable with, that sort of $5 billion to $6 billion of liquidity that we have stated as sort of comfortable target range, there is absolutely the opportunity for additional cash in the buyback. And as I have said in my comments, that $750 million is the minimum, so we will continue to have this dialogue through the year. But I hope you are right. I hope that this is a year that generates those significant cash flows.", "Oscar Munoz", "Hunter, if I can just \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind, if I can just weigh in on that subject as well. I think if you check my history, you will see the willingness to allocate capital to shareowners in a very broad and distributed way, I don\u2019t think that changes with regards to this. I think it would be at least up sort of qualifier to 750 was added on purpose. And I don\u2019t necessarily disagree with the premise and thesis behind the concept, but we do have to strike a balance. And so this is one of the places where I have been engaged to a little bit and we will keep them more increasingly engaged and you will get more definitive direction in about two months on that going forward.", "Hunter Keay", "Okay. Yes. I know, Oscar, I am glad you are here because you do have a bit of a reputation of being a capital deployer, so I think it would be helpful for everybody, including your owners, who have been sweating out a pretty difficult year. It\u2019s very hard to buy an airline stock. It is very hard to do that I mean as an investor. And a lot of your owners feel like it\u2019s kind of been sort of hung out to dry a little bit. So I think you would go a long way Oscar if you would commit that barring any sort of major change in the environment, which is I think an easy enough for you to make right here on this call to come out and say barring no major changes in the economy or anything like that exogenous that we will spend more buying back stock than we will on capital spending this year, I think that would go a long way if you would be willing to make that commitment here today?", "Oscar Munoz", "We are going to look \u2013 we are going to spend a lot of time with our shareholders directly and individually and discuss all their viewpoints and we will make proper public commitments as we see fit. But again, history does tend to repeat itself and I am very excited to get back into this conversation and debate because it\u2019s a great one. Thanks Hunter.", "Hunter Keay", "Okay. Thanks for your time.", "Operator", "From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie on line. Please go ahead.", "Dan McKenzie", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time here. One quick housecleaning question, what were the NOLs at the year end 2015?", "Brett Hart", "About $9 billion.", "Dan McKenzie", "Okay. And so I guess just kind of extrapolating forward, is perhaps 2018 the first year you might conceivably become a taxpayer, if that\u2019s the case or should we think about cash taxes sooner than that?", "Gerry Laderman", "So I can tell you that we are working hard now that we are in a mode of booking taxes and seeing a future of being a tax \u2013 cash taxpayer. And we were doing some good tax planning. I don\u2019t want to at this point tell you when we anticipate being a cash taxpayer. Obviously, that depends on future earnings, but it\u2019s reasonable to anticipate if the earnings trends continue, you would see a relatively rapid utilization of those NOLs.", "Dan McKenzie", "I see, okay. And then as a follow-up question here, this one is for Jim. You mentioned sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue improvement, which I believe was on business travel spend. And so is the right way to think about that is 20% of the passenger revenue getting sequentially better each quarter and the reason for the clarification here is we do have some FX headwinds and some competitive headwinds, so I am just trying to reconcile the comment with other revenue externalities?", "Jim Compton", "Hi, Dan. There is a couple of things happening as you think about 2016 and as we move through the year. You touched on a couple of them just now. But currency, obviously is a big driver of what we look going forward. So kind of where currencies are at today, we would begin to lap some of the currency effects in the second quarter this year. When you look at things such as surcharges and as you know over the past year, we have talked a lot about surcharges particularly in Japan that by law are tied to where oil trades. We will begin to lap those pretty significantly in the third quarter of this year. But again, there are still some sort of charges out in Japan that most recently have come down, so the full effect of that will be more towards the end of the first quarter of 2017. Pricing \u2013 the competitive pricing actions we have talked about through the year, based on where they are at today, we will begin to lap those in the third quarter of 2016. And then lastly oil, we have reported on our corporate energy portfolio through the year being down 20% in the first quarter, 30% in the second quarter, 35% in the third quarter and we saw it drop to 40% in the fourth quarter. So that lapping, given where the current oil prices are and the expectations that oil prices will stay low longer, that lapping affect will take longer than what we have talked about in the past. All being said, there are things that as we lap through the year are \u2013will have less headwind on our RASM performance and that\u2019s why we have talked about quarter-to-quarter improvement based on the factors I described. Always qualify it because as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw GDP expectations come down from our initial expectations, so that and the volatility of oil prices is still that one thing that we don\u2019t like to talk about as specific. But I think given what we have see lapping during the year, we feel good about quarter-over-quarter improvement as we move through 2016.", "Dan McKenzie", "Okay, very good. Thanks for that perspective.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg on line. Please go ahead.", "Michael Linenberg", "Yes. Hey. Good morning everybody and welcome back, Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz", "Thank you.", "Michael Linenberg", "I mean to start off, maybe to Jim. Jim, you guys are the biggest carrier to China and we have seen a more significant devaluation of that currency over the past few months, is there anything just given your footprint in that market, are you seeing anything, anything on the trends. And I would sort of say that within the context of some of your commentary about the revenue weakness you talked about yield softness in the international markets as well as domestic and I didn\u2019t know if you were calling out China or other markets in total, what\u2019s \u2013 can you address that?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Mike. I think there are things that are getting to us obviously Houston that I have talked about already. And as you mentioned our exposure to China, I would tell you, demand in China continues to grow at the pace of industry capacity. We have seen a little bit lower yield, but we are actually seeing \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s been very profitable for us and that profitability maintained. So from the demand perspective, we are seeing demand keep pace with the capacity that we have talked about over the past several quarters. Again in the first quarter, we see about 19% industry capacity from China to the U.S., but yet we are also seeing bookings for the industry going at that rate. You put that with our strength in San Francisco, the best gateway to Asia, we feel really good about our current position and quite frankly long-term position for China going forward.", "Michael Linenberg", "Okay, great. And then just the second question, when you look at your overall revenue performance and you compare yourself versus notably the other big two, American and Delta and you have looked at yourselves on even unit revenue basis. I appreciate the fact that obviously there are some initiatives that you are pursuing that are obviously margin accretive and ROIC accretive and therefore one consequence is that they may be RASM or PRASM dilutive. But I think there is another view out there, at least the perception that maybe strategically you are falling a bit behind your peers and whether it\u2019s on the alliance front or the joint venture front, you look at some of the announcements and some of the relationships and how some of your competitors have grown those relationships. And yet when you look at United, you have a strong \u2013 or at least I believe you have a strong relationship with Lufthansa and you have a good relationship with Air China and you also have a relationship with ANA. But a lot of times, we don\u2019t hear much commentary on it and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s showing up in the numbers. I mean, is that perception real or are there things that over the next year or so that you plan to roll out that maybe will help mitigate some of those revenue sort of differences?", "Jim Compton", "Hey, Mike. Well, a couple of thoughts. One is you mentioned Lufthansa in the Trans-Atlantic, which was a terrific partner for us and the performance in the fourth quarter, albeit down in the 2% RASM decline was really industry-leading performance \u2013 and our relative performance in the Trans-Atlantic is our peers. We have widened our RASM premium versus our peers in that. That\u2019s with the great work of our team in terms of seasonally balancing the network, and quite frankly, working very closely with Lufthansa. So, that JV for us, in that particular, is obviously very much forward. It goes back into the 1990s relationship. And so we have had great success in that. If you look \u2013 and so \u2013 and then if you look at the Pacific, which is really a growth market for us, ANA plays a big part of that and that relationship from a JV, a little bit younger, but we have made great strides and we have talked about some of the Tokyo when you are flying to places in Asia that we now connect into ANA, which has allowed us to grow our San Francisco hub long-haul. So, I think we have used the JVs to help leverage our market and grow our relative performance both in the Trans-Atlantic as well as into Asia. Recently, our investment and our commercial agreement with Azul, although Brazil is the challenged market right now over the long term, we think that\u2019s going to play terrific. And it\u2019s already generating connecting traffic at numbers that are exceeding our expectations, albeit at lower yields given what\u2019s happening in Brazil as well as the currency situation. So, I think we are very focused on the alliance side to make sure we have the right partners to extend our network and we will do it in a way that obviously allows our customers to have more choice and more opportunities.", "Michael Linenberg", "Okay, great. Thanks, Jim. Thanks for that comprehensive answer.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker on line. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Baker", "Hey, good morning and warm welcome back to Oscar. First question probably for Gerry and Oscar, that incremental 2.5% of potential labor-related CASM, was that for \u2013 I apologize, for all working groups or just the two TAs that are out for ratification right now, one of which comes back tomorrow?", "Gerry Laderman", "No, Jamie, that was just for the two that are out for ratification.", "Jamie Baker", "Okay. And for Oscar, you have talked with us about winning back the frontline. Do these increases in wages accomplish this in your mind or are there still incremental expenses that are required that might not be captured in the labor line, whether that\u2019s I don\u2019t know better tools for employee, new uniforms, that sort of thing that could pressure CASM a little bit further?", "Oscar Munoz", "You know what, Jamie, it\u2019s probably a little early for me to actually quantify what the impacts of these are, but my commitment is to balance both our commitment to our employees and make the appropriate investments and prioritize investments while understanding that we have broader stockholder base. And so it\u2019s a delicate balance between those two. And again, the more time I spend out in the field understanding the needs, the needs aren\u2019t as great as you think expense wise. So certainly, comp is one. But beyond that, I think building the right systems tools, uniforms, things like coffee and peanuts and all add up, but they are just at appropriate level investments that will strike a balance with. But again, I can\u2019t quantify anything at this point in time.", "Greg Hart", "Jamie, let me just add that, that process has started. It started last year. And the CASM guidance you see for this year includes some of that already, some of the tools and some of the other investments, we are making that\u2019s rolling into the CASM guidance that you see. And let me just, by the way, I need to clarify to Dan on the NOL, as of 12/31/15, the remaining NOL is a little closer to $8 billion and $9 billion. Sorry to interrupt you.", "Jamie Baker", "Yes, no, no, that\u2019s fine. Actually for follow-up, while I have you, Gerry, the 73-700 is a larger gauge than I have been at least I thought you were looking at in terms of potential bridging that gap between 76 CRJs and I guess, the A319s. So, what shifted in terms of the decision-making process? Does this entirely eliminate the need for something smaller than the 319 at the mainline? How did the price of fuel impact the calculus? Any additional color there?", "Gerry Laderman", "Sure. I would say, the price of fuel really doesn\u2019t impact our decisions on long-term fleet orders, but I would say that for this batch of aircraft, where we looked at all the variations, in fact, the 319 as well as the 737 and the 100-seat opportunities from both Embraer and Bombardier for this batch of aircraft, the 700 was the winner. As I mentioned, we will continue to look at aircraft and we will continue to look at each of those aircraft types going forward.", "Jamie Baker", "Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks very much, gentlemen.", "Operator", "Credit Suisse, we have Julie Yates on line. Please go ahead.", "Julie Yates", "Good morning and welcome back, Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz", "Thank you.", "Julie Yates", "Gerry, a follow-up on the buyback, how should we think about just the seasonality of cash flow generation and then the timing of other cash requirements like debt payments and pension fund and just as the year progresses?", "Gerry Laderman", "So, it depends on the type. So, for pension funding, we have a fair amount of flexibility. So, I would assume right now relatively even through at least the first three quarters. On aircraft CapEx, we have some in the first quarter. There is a bit of a lag and then some in the back half of the year. And everything else is fairly flat through the year.", "Julie Yates", "Okay. And then Jim, one for you, you noted competitive capacity actions at about 1.5 point headwind again in the first quarter. You noticed any changes in competitive pricing actions either domestically or internationally? And do you worry that those worsen in a lower fuel environment?", "Jim Compton", "Julie, I don\u2019t want to comment on competitive pricing. It\u2019s obviously it\u2019s a \u2013 this business is very competitive and we obviously match capacity in our demand given the pricing structures that are out there, but I don\u2019t want to make any comments on competitive pricing actions. We will, as I mentioned in the script, that given where competitive pricing actions are today that the hypothetical the assumption that\u2019s where we are today. We begin to lap some of that effect by the time we hit the third quarter.", "Julie Yates", "Okay, understood. And then just on the phases of cabin segmentation, that was certainly helpful. At some point, do you anticipate being able to put some quantification around what that can add in terms of revenues?", "Gerry Laderman", "Yes, we look forward to doing that. That segmentation that we talked about we have been working hard on it in 2015 and so we are excited about rolling it out going forward. What that will do for us is a couple of things. One it will allow us to compete with ultra-low cost carriers much more effectively, which means more pure product for customers that are looking for just that price point. And it will also, as I mentioned, help us remove some of the dilution that we have in our pricing structure today. And so I am not ready yet to kind of quantify, but as we rollout the second half of the year, I look forward to updating you on that.", "Julie Yates", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth on line. Please go ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions for me. We get a lot of questions from investors about closing the gap from a margin perspective to the industry. It looks like based on the 1Q guidance and certainly 1Q is not the year and you have got some hedge impact there, but it looks like that gap actually widens in the March quarter. So, is closing that gap still a goal for the company? What should we be advising investors in that regard and if so, over what timeframe?", "Gerry Laderman", "Hey, Duane, I will start. It\u2019s Gerry. So it is still a goal. We have never put a timeframe on it, but we are very focused on doing what we can do both on the costs side and the revenue side to continue to maximize our margin, but we haven\u2019t at this point, put a timeframe on it.", "Greg Hart", "So I think form the network side, we are very focused on growing efficiently. And so we talked about up-gauging a lot over the past year and 2015 was the first phase of that where we are seeing growth with the use of slim line. And as Gerry mentioned contributed to the CASM side, comes at a lower RASM, it had significant contribution to the CASM side. We will continue to do that as we also look at frequency reduction and up-gauging into the mainline aircraft from the regional aircraft. And we can do that seat neutral in certain markets. As we have up-gauge that and we drive lower departures actually it\u2019s really efficient growth and it comes with efficient fuel costs. And so it all kind of works together and we are very much focused on driving that this year.", "Oscar Munoz", "Duane, if I could just maybe slightly more definitive on the issue of industry comparisons and all of that, it\u2019s a competitive industry and I am a competitive guy. And so lest anything else we said, we will always have our eyesight on folks that are maybe at this point in time and sort of performing a little better than us. I will tell you what the most critical question around that is, do you have the potential, do you have the capacity, do you have the ability with your network, with your people with all of that. And one of the things I have seen in the relatively short time I have been here is a tremendous amount of all of those things starting with the energy, excitement of our front-line employees, frankly it\u2019s where it really starts. So at the end of the day, over the long-term, we certainly believe our relative earnings profile will improve and when and how and all that, that\u2019s more than I am trying to get done here over the next few months.", "Gerry Laderman", "And Duane, it\u2019s right on up-gauging remember that 2016 is a year where there is a dip in that process from 2015. It\u2019s just the cadence of new aircraft orders. That ramps up again in 2017 and continues nicely through 2019.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "I appreciate that comment. And Oscar, personally we are all amazed that you are on this call and wish you a continued strong recovery. Just on the network side, I had one question. Please check us on this. But we went back and looked at utilization changes, aircraft hours per day over the course of 2015 and many had a nice year-to-year improvement in that and frankly that was what was driving capacity growth. In the case of United, it looks like utilization was actually modestly down. We assume this is an effort to improve reliability, maybe more spares, can you just talk about it, this is the case and the reasons behind it and if there is any cost opportunity there longer term? Thanks for taking the questions.", "Jim Compton", "Yes. The \u2013 one of the things we are driving is our seats per aircraft are going up, so we are driving growth that way. But clearly, as we reinvested in reliability, we want to make sure that the network is driving the right results from the reliability stage. In addition, part of our strategy of growing seats is to lower our stage length, I mean so some of that utilization to drive it an improved network is from a lower stage lengths which is driving block down. So it\u2019s a combination of couple of things, both investment in reliability as well as our network strategy going forward to set us up to grow efficiently.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Flightglobal, we have Edward Russell on line. Please go ahead.", "Edward Russell", "Hi, I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on where you are cutting capacity out of Houston and where you plan to grow in San Francisco and Denver for the network side?", "Jim Compton", "Hi Edward, this is Jim. I think if you think about what we were looking at for Houston in 2016, we are going to grow Houston approximately slightly up about 2%. I think given what we are seeing in the market and as my comments on energy and what\u2019s happening in the Houston hub, we will probably keep that relatively flat for the year. And so that capacity, as we look at places of strength, San Fran and Denver to the East Coast, what we are focused on, to fill in some holes that we don\u2019t serve today, that will be clearly focused on business markets. And you will see the strong commitment in Houston just adjusted slightly to use that capacity in markets that are performing better right now.", "Edward Russell", "Okay. And that\u2019s you are keeping growth in Houston at 2% this year, that\u2019s what \u2013 that\u2019s correct?", "Jim Compton", "I am sorry, could you say that again?", "Edward Russell", "You said you are keeping growth in Houston at about \u2013 capacity growth at about 2% in 2016?", "Jim Compton", "No, our plan was to grow at about 2%. I think you will see it relatively flat in 2016 given the market.", "Edward Russell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. Jonathan I will turn it back to you for closing remarks.", "Jonathan Ireland", "Okay. As we are out of time, we will conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call Media Relations or Investor Relations if you have any further questions. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Goodbye.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Brendon and I'll be your conference facilitator today. Following the initial remarks from management, we will open the lines for questions.", "This call is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed, or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.", "I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Jonathan Ireland, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Brendon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com.", "Information in yesterday's release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.", "All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. Number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-Q, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for more thorough description of these factors.", "Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor updates, copies of which are available on our website.", "Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are President and CEO, Oscar Munoz; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; and Senior Vice President of Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. We also have Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Greg Hart in the room to assist with Q&A.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Jonathan. And thank you all for joining us this morning. For the first quarter, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $688 million excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter pre-tax profit ever.", "We achieved dilutive earnings per share of $1.23 excluding special items, a 28% increase versus last year when adjusting for taxes. And as you all know we repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock.", "Reflecting back on the quarter, I'm particularly proud of our operational performance which again showed significant improvement. Our first quarter consolidated on-time performance was more than 12 points better year-over-year and we had 3,600 fewer cancellations, a 20% reduction versus the first quarter of last year. This improvement demonstrates the dedication, passion, and hard work of United's aviation professionals.", "I know as I travel the system, I see the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that our nearly 86,000 employees around the world are bringing to work every day. I'd like to thank them for their efforts and dedication, particularly their work through this winter season.", "This quarter's results show great strides forward and with our sense of shared purpose and the investments we continue to make in people, processes, and systems, we're positioned for even greater success in the months ahead.", "On the commercial side of the business, we launched our Global Performance guarantee, which links our corporate contracts to operational performance, showing both our confidence and commitment to running a consistently reliable operation.", "With respect to our network as part of our industry-leading Pacific strategy, we announced an enhanced partnership with Air China, and a joint venture with Air New Zealand, both of which are expected to expand our global reach.", "We also announced several routes that further strengthen our global footprint, including the first ever non-stop service by a U.S. carrier to Hangzhou, our sixth Chinese destination. We also became the first U.S. airline to serve Israel non-stop from the West Coast connecting two of the world's most influential technology communities.", "Now, having said this, we know we are facing some revenue challenges. We are making good progress on a number of initiatives to improve revenue, but some of them like a more reliable operation and improved customer satisfaction as you know have a lagging effect. I expect these improvements along with other commercial initiatives will drive improved revenue performance as we move into the back half of this year.", "Now turning to our people, as I've said many times reaching new agreements with our representative employees is one of my highest priorities. We have already made great progress with our pilots, dispatchers and IAM representative work groups, all ratified contract extensions this year. This represents half of our unionized workforce. We remain focused on getting contracts like these for our flight attendants and technicians and we plan to keep working closely with the unions to make that happen.", "Lastly, as you have heard, yesterday we announced additional changes to our board. I want to welcome the two new board members and I look forward to working alongside them and our other recently elected members over the upcoming years.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Jim and Gerry. Jim?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on slide six through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined 7.4%. The four primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations.", "In addition, while we had anticipated that the timing of Easter would have some impact on close-in business travel, it proved to be greater than we had expected. While we have seen total bookings return to pre-Easter levels, we are closely monitoring the mix of business and leisure bookings.", "Turning to the second quarter: We expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 6.5% to 8.5% year-over-year with domestic PRASM expected to be down approximately 3.5% to 5.5% and international PRASM expected to be down approximately 11% to 13%.", "While the primary drivers of this decline are consistent with the first quarter, we are beginning to lapse some of the effects from last year, somewhat muting the impact on a year-over-year basis. For the consolidated system, we expect the strong dollar, lower surcharges, the Houston and energy market weakness and competitive pressures to drive approximately 3.25 points of softness.", "While these drivers explain a portion of the unit revenue decline, they don't capture all of it. As can be seen on slide seven, the remaining headwinds unit revenue is largely driven by passenger demand, using GDP as a proxy, not keeping pace with capacity. Like any supply versus demand relationship, this is creating downward pressure on pricing. This is particularly evident in the international markets where United is more exposed than any other U.S. carrier. While United has consistently grown at/or below the rate of GDP, this dynamic is creating a unit revenue headwind to United of approximately 2.5 points.", "Turning to slide eight; we are taking specific actions in each market to improve our unit revenue performance in this environment with a focus on maximizing near-term profitability while also positioning ourselves for longer term success.", "In the domestic market, this includes redirecting capacity to capitalize and changing demand patterns, introducing entry level fares to increase segmentation and reduce dilution; launching marketing and sales initiatives that leverage our improving reliability and further rolling out two-cabin service in top business market. We expect that these actions, along with improving reliability and customer satisfaction, will drive domestic unit revenue to be flat to positive in the fourth quarter.", "With respect to the international markets, we expect Latin PRASM to turn positive by the fourth quarter, benefiting from reduced Brazil flying. While we are currently experiencing softness in the Atlantic due to recent events, we see strong summer bookings and expect to get close to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter.", "Unit revenue recovery in the Pacific will take more time. And surcharges and a strong U.S. Dollar continued to impact our performance. In spite of this, we are very optimistic that the Pacific entity, one of our true competitive differentiators, will see sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement this year despite continued pressure from industry growth, which is not uncommon in developing high opportunity markets like China.", "We are also prepared to reduce overall capacity where appropriate. We have made some targeted reductions to our schedule, pulling down flying in Houston, Brazil, and the Middle East. And as you can see on slide nine, we now expect our 2016 capacity to grow 1% to 2%, a half a point reduction from our previous full year of capacity guidance.", "In conclusion, during the first quarter, we continued to generate high levels of profitability, despite the unit revenue pressures we experienced across our system. We are taking very deliberate actions within our network and we'll continue to adjust our flying with a goal to maximize long-term profitability and return to positive unit revenues.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry.", "Gerald Laderman - Senior Vice President Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on slide 11. Our net income declined by approximately $200 million year-over-year as this quarter was the first quarter in a number of years in which we booked significant federal taxes.", "Pre-tax earnings improved by approximately $100 million due to lower oil prices, partially offset by lower revenue and higher non-fuel expense. Our pre-tax margin was 8.4%, a meaningful improvement compared to last year. More significantly when adjusted for taxes, our earnings per share of $1.23 increased 28% versus last year.", "Details on our fuel expense which decreased by almost $700 million year-over-year are shown on slide 12. This decrease was driven by lower fuel prices, improved fuel efficiency and reduced hedge losses.", "Looking forward what we have not added to our hedge book since July of 2015, we're still 12% hedged for the remaining nine months of 2016 and as of yesterday are in a loss position of approximately $80 million including premium expense.", "Moving to slide 13, non-fuel unit costs for the quarter grew 1.3% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third-party expenses. We continue to manage our costs to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the airline.", "For the second quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs to grow 2.5% to 3.5%; and for the full year, we now expect unit costs to grow 2% to 3%. This guidance includes the benefit of annual efficiency savings initiatives totaling over $1.1 billion.", "These savings initiatives were achieved a full year in advance of our initial expectations and are providing over $100 million more in sustainable savings than our original goal. Our guidance also includes the impact of the three recently ratified labor agreements.", "We expect the newly ratified IAM agreement to have a marginal impact on 2016 expenses. For 2017, we expect the impact of the three contracts to be approximately three-quarters of a point of CASM.", "Based on the guidance we have provided for cost and revenue, we expect our pre-tax margin to be between 13% and 15% for the second quarter. With respect to cash, in the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $376 million of free cash flow.", "As you can see on slide 14, during the quarter, we invested approximately $820 million in the business. We took delivery of three 787s, two 737s and one used A319. And we added six Embraer E175s to our regional fleet.", "We also announced additional aircraft orders for 65 Boeing 737-700 aircrafts. These aircraft will allow us to reduce the size of our 50-seat regional fleet to address the regional pilot shortage while providing customers with larger two-cabin aircraft with greater amenities. Importantly, as we transition out of 50-seat aircraft into the larger gauge mainline aircraft, we expect to begin generating structural cost benefits of up-gauging and reducing departures.", "During the quarter, we also announced plans to accelerate deliveries of certain wide body aircraft to facilitate the early retirement of our 747s, as the 747s' cost and complexity to operate continues to be a burden. This decision does not represent an increase to overall CapEx, capacity, or total fleet size.", "Our sustained cash generation over the last few quarters and the discounted value of our stock led us to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of stock in the first quarter, representing 8% of shares outstanding.", "Based on the progress we've made to-date and cash flow expectations for the rest of the year, we now anticipate completing our $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of the third quarter this year.", "In conclusion, we showed once again the first quarter solid cost discipline while investing in our business and returning significant cash to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our plan to improve our financial performance and secure a strong future for our employees, customers, and shareholders.", "I'll now turn it back over to Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, sir. So while I'm pleased with all of the accomplishments within the quarter, I got to say it's the future that has me and us excited. Thus, after spending time with many of you share owners over the last few months, I know there's a strong desire to learn more about certain initiatives we have underway and of course their impact on the bottom line.", "To that end, we'll be holding an investor call on June 21st to describe in more detail many of these initiatives and their contributions to earnings over the next several years. I look forward to that conversation. But before opening up for questions, I'd like to thank our customers for choosing United. They have a choice, and I appreciate your business.", "So, with that, I'll turn it over back to Jonathan.", "Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Oscar. We will now take questions from the analyst community. Please limit yourself to one question; and if needed, one follow-up question. Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And please hold for a moment while we assemble our queue. From Barclays, we have David Fintzen online. Please go ahead.", "David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Question on \u2013 really for Oscar. Now that you've gotten a little more time in the seat, can you just talk us through a little bit of how you see the earnings gap to your peers and in large buckets, how do you think about the mix of revenue and cost in sort of closing that gap over time?", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, there's no mistaking that our various airlines domestically are built differently and we clearly have our own strengths and challenges. Our higher cost hubs \u2013 and structurally we are less \u2013 we are a little bit \u2013 little less reliable. But I think of it from the standpoint that we have I believe better business markets and certainly better international gateways. Those are a little bit more competitive than others. But as we think about building a playbook, our own playbook, not copying others, is I think the strategic work that we have to continue to do; and so as I think of your question, I think we have to sort of double down on three areas of strategic focus. Certainly we need to win on revenue. And it's just not markets and schedule and price but it's product and service. Execution, which we're doing a great job already. Reliability certainly; productivity, just heard Gerry talk about that in a significant way. Cost of course is included in that and then technology which we haven't talked about.", "We look forward to sharing some of that in June. And people always kind of wink at me when we say this but winning on trust with our employees and then speaking to them and then through to our customers and of course invariably to you as share owners. So we're still in the early innings, the momentum is building in the system across all these areas. But it's a combination of all of those, David.", "David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then when I look at the international RASM outlook, I mean, should we think of those things as just short term oversupply issues or kind of more of the macro or do you think you're going back to sort of the revenue side in closing that gap, I mean, is this something that you think is more structural in nature that's further developing?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey David, this is Jim. The way I think on the international side is clearly depending on the regions of the world, take China, for instance, where passenger demand is growing at a fast pace even in that high capacity. So we believe that over the long-term that capacity and demand will come in line. What we're excited about is our uniqueness as to how we're participating in China.", "It's unique in the sense that as Oscar mentioned two new secondary cities in China; that growth that I mentioned out of China, half of that will come from secondary cities. It's the fleet that we have and the flexibility of the 787, it's really allowing us to play in that market at a fairly early stage in a very profitable entity that runs at a high profitability. Quite frankly, at a profitability that's no different than our domestic. So we believe that as demand catches up to the capacity level out there, we will be able to close that year-over-year RASM. And I mentioned in my comments we actually see closing much of that during the year as we move to the fourth quarter.", "David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Appreciate that. And I look forward to learning more about the playbook. Thanks.", "Operator", "From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi online. Please go ahead.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jim, just two questions for you. One just on your \u2013 I'm not sure what you guys want to call it. But the kind of basic economy fare that you guys plan to roll out. Is there any updated timing on when that's going to be launched and is the benefit from that factored into your expectation for flat domestic PRASM by 4Q?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hi, Joseph, we're targeting second half of the year. So no change to our timeline that we talked about and very excited about and yes, it's a piece \u2013 it's one of the initiatives that as I described in my comments of how we're very much focused on moving PRASM to flatten upward and that is a big piece of it.", "The concept of it is to allow us to compete more effectively with low cost carriers. And the second piece of it, it will allow us to move some of the dilution that happens in the marketplace given the fare structure we have today. So, yes, absolutely that's part of our path to that flat deposited PRASM in the fourth quarter.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then just one for Oscar actually. I think that the CapEx increase that you guys announced surprised some people. Oscar, I'm just wondering if you can you talk about given how short of a time period you have been there, you don't have a permanent CFO in place at this point. What made you feel comfortable to announce such a big increase to your CapEx profile over the next couple of years?", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's a combination of things certainly aging of the 47 fleet that needed to be replaced, plain and simple. And on the 37s, it's actually economically viable and accretive rather than not and having to jump on those slots with regards to what was available to us. So, a combination of those things. I can tell you that not only myself, but the team was very deeply involved in that conversation. And we didn't do that lightly knowing what the reaction might be with regards to increased CapEx. Jim, would you add anything?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "And the only thing that I would add is on the 737s, keep in mind, we had a real problem. There is a regional pilot shortage that compelled us to deal with the significant reduction in 50-seat flying. And when we did our analysis to say, okay, what should replace that looking in the new and the used market, we took some used aircraft, as many as made economic sense. In the new aircraft market, we looked at all of the available options. They are all good aircraft, but the lowest cost choice for us is the 737 and 700.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead.", "Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, hello. Oscar, there's a little question that you delivered a pretty unimpressive guide for the second quarter. And I realize that with everything going on with the board, that may have been a distraction and you know you're getting involved with the flight attendant negotiations. Nobody is accusing you of not having a full plate here. But traditionally when companies start falling further and further behind their competitors and based on the guide that is what you expect in the second quarter, they're faced with three choices. You can do nothing. You can simply try harder. Or you can come up with a new plan.", "So, my question is simple. Does mediocrity suffice, is fixing United as simple as rolling up your sleeves and relying on easier comps or is something significantly more radical, a change in course ultimately required?", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Is that a leading question, Jamie? I'm going to go with mediocrity for 200 planes. It's \u2013 I think one of the things that is important to know is that we ain't conceding anything on anyone, and so what we've been doing is flying profitably. I have watched and monitored how that works. We need to be, in my mind, a bit more disruptive in the marketplace. I think we've been standing by a little bit too much. Now, exactly what that means and how we do it thoughtfully and from a share owner, sort of value-creating perspective is the work we're beginning to do.", "Interestingly enough, I have a couple new board members that have a lot of knowledge and ability in that space. I will lean hard on them with that regard. But, no, it definitely has to change. Accepting the same thing constantly over and over especially in this market. There would be decreasing demand, overall global economic picture, our increase in expenses on the labor side and all those things. We have to do things differently through many, many factors. And so you will see some of that thrust here over the next few months. As far as the initiatives, some of the values of those initiatives will be there. But certainly, again, there is a lagging effect. But, no, there is no one standing by here just waiting for these things to clear up. And hopefully it will get better. We've got to take some action.", "Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That helps. And on that lagging effect, presumably, the investments that you're making in labor aren't driven by a sense of charity. Rather they're intended to generate a return at some point, presumably in the form of better RASM, more corporate share preference by business travelers to make United their first choice and all that kind of stuff. So, in your mind, once labor is embraced, compensated and energized, how long do you think it's likely to take before you start to generate a financial return on those efforts?", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well, I'll just correct one thing. I think my family here is damn energized already. So we've got a good hard step on that. How and long it will take, I don't know that I am capable at this point in time with projecting that. The way I'll see it and monitor it and present it very transparent to you \u2013 every little step we take forward, we're going to highlight for you. And how long it's going to take, it's hard to tell. We didn't get here overnight, and we're likely not to get out overnight. But I want to have initiatives that have a more immediate sort of value that you can see. I really believe in this concept of proof, not promises. Again, my history is laden with that, and that's what we're going to work through. So, again, as far as timing, Jamie, it's too early for me to tell you any specific timeframe.", "Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Oscar, thank you for your answers. Take care.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker online. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. I know that the first quarter is generally your toughest quarter anyway and you generally underperform your peer group. When you look at the performance in the first quarter to the second quarter, given that the unit revenue guide is kind of flattish to maybe even a little worse, can you just talk about the dynamics that get that revenue decline continued as opposed to sequential improvement?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Helane. This is Jim. You're right. Seasonally, our first quarter is our more difficult quarter. And we are working hard in terms of that sequential RASM to improve that. I do want to emphasize the international exposure. The domestic RASM from the first quarter to the second quarter does, with our guidance, show a sequential improvement. So we are focused very much so on that international side in particular and we've made some capacity adjustments. That's part of our guidance down to 1% to 2% capacity guidance. That half point drop from our previous guidance is all international.", "So one is to react to the market out there on the international side, and to make sure that our capacity moves more in line with demand. As we move through, particularly it's still the second quarter, a shoulder period, for instance, in Trans-Atlantic. We see strong bookings in the summertime for Trans-Atlantic that will help with that sequential RASM as we move through the year. We've made initiatives in Latin America that beginning in the second quarter our capacity through the rest of the year is basically flat after doing seasonally adjusted capacities to capture demand in each markets, for instance, that drove our capacity up, very strong margins, but that put pressure on RASM. So our focus is on that international side, the initiatives to move capacity to right places as well as to drive the initiatives.", "And in addition, the great work by the operations team and reliability, given that work, we're beginning to see already in our hubs, signs of our share beginning to improve. And we think that will continue and spread and drive that RASM as we go through the year.", "Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. Thanks for that very comprehensive answer. I just have a question about the first quarter the decline in regional capacity purchase expense. As you shift more capacity to the mainline from the regionals, shouldn't that expense line actually decline further? And how should we think about the mix between mainline and regional revenue given that your mainline revenue declined more than regional for the first quarter, and maybe it should have been more balanced?", "Gerald Laderman - Senior Vice President Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer", "Helane, let me address the cost piece of it. But clearly as we shift from regional to mainline, you'll see a continual drop in regional expense. Some of that, though, is going to be offset by the increased cost of the regional flying as they have \u2013 the regional airlines have their own pressures that they have to deal with, and that becomes more expensive flying. But generally with the decline of the 50-seat flying, you'll see a drop in regional expense.", "Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Great. Thanks very much for all those answers.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Helane, I will just add to that as we shift to the mainline, remember, it creates revenue opportunity. Those 50-seaters don't have economy, plus they don't have a first-class cabin. And we continue to see great up-sell in the first-class cabin as well as strong economy plus sales.", "Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Jim.", "Operator", "From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.", "Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jim, thanks for all the commentary. I appreciate the presentation as well everybody. But, Jim, in your commentary, you talked about being open to adjusting overall capacity. And I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit further. Specifically, I'm just wondering what international entity is driving the biggest sequential revenue deterioration exactly. And I'm wondering what demand trends need to transpire before you might get more aggressive. And however you might talk about that, whether it be bookings or revenues that might be falling short, and how quickly you might be able to respond.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Dan. Thanks for the question. I think the Pacific is quite frankly the biggest sequential driver on unit revenue impact to us. And as I mentioned, we will \u2013 as I mentioned some of the capacity reduction, actually all of that half a point reduction in guidance is on the international. So, we will stay really focused on the demand environment relative to the capacity we have. I will say about the Pacific, it's also impacted but we'll start to lap some of the foreign exchange and the surcharge impact is most dramatic in the Pacific. So, we'll lap some of that.", "So, we believe even in that entity that we will continue to close \u2013 move towards flat RASM in the Pacific as we move through the year. The Pacific, as I mentioned, even the markets we're adding, Oscar mentioned two of the secondary cities, but you think of San Fran to Singapore, very unique and innovative for us. It's the first non-stop market to the U.S. just from Singapore.", "San Fran-Auckland building on our relationship and growing our relationship with Air New Zealand. San Fran-Tel Aviv that we launched on March 30 is off to a great start, connecting two high-tech communities and seeing great bookings there. So, all of those would say that uniqueness of our expansion we think serves us well and comes at a high level of profitability. All that being said, we've been consistent. We'll keep track of capacity and demand and make sure that we're keeping them in line, but also remembering that the international is also a longer term play that we're really excited about.", "Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Very good. I appreciate that, Jim. I guess just staying on the Pacific for a second here. United did sign a multi-year agreement to strengthen its partnership with Air China per the release. I'm just wondering what is that exactly and how and when might that tie to, say, increased revenue contribution on that entity?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Yeah, Dan, we recently signed an enhanced agreement with them that quite frankly builds a relationship over a longer number of years. I want to be clear; it's based in the concept of the alliance world. It's not a JV world. China is not Open Skies and so it doesn't come with antitrust immunity. But we think we have a lot of ability to grow together both relationship-wise as we learn about the market from each other, both Air China learning about the U.S. market and us quite frankly learning a lot about the Chinese market.", "That will bring us closer together in marketing. It will bring us closer together in some sales initiatives and allows us to understand the marketplace. And we think that will enhance our connections through the market as we build not only in Beijing, but as we build in some of the secondary cities. So, we can increase the connecting opportunities that we have with Air China. We connect close to 200 a day over the Air China network in Beijing today. And we think there's upside building that relationship.", "So, it's \u2013 within the alliance world, we're bringing much more higher level executive attention to it. The team of senior executives will much more frequently meet with senior executives of Air China to work on those initiatives that I talked about.", "Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Very good. Thanks for the time, guys.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay online. Please go ahead.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, good morning. So, when we talk about the structural margin gap, I think everybody just talks about market share and hubs. And I think that's important, but I think it gets focused on a little bit too much. So, how much of the gap is attributable to the fact that you've a 1,500 mile stage length versus about 1,000 mile stage length for your two biggest peers. And that seems to me like it's as structural as anything. And given that or a change in that wouldn't it just be unreasonable to assume that you have any possibility of closing the margin gap, particularly now that your costs are going to be going higher? And shouldn't we just expect this margin gap to be permanently structural if for no other reason than the stage length alone?", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Hunter, it's Oscar. I'm going to let Jim answer the stage length question specifically as we have discussed it. I'm not sure we'll give you some additional facts there to warrant maybe a different opinion.", "With regards to, again, the concept of the long-term perspective and in fact, conceding that margin gap will be there forever as I've studied the market and the industry over the last decade and before, I know that things can change very quickly in one way or another. So, I'm not quite ready to concede anything in that regard. And we'll continue to work the initiatives to close and narrow that margin gap in the near term. But with regard to the stage length, Jim, why don't you cover some of that with him?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Thanks, Oscar. Hey, Hunter, there are structural differences between networks, and I think of them as mainly driven by geography. We clearly have two East-West Coast hubs. That by definition is going to indicate longer stage length. It's also those coastal hubs are tremendous international gateways, which is why our network is really built for strong international presence and growth over time and then international flying.", "Our hubs are also very business-centric markets and \u2013 which also means there's lots of competition. And I think you're referring to sea chair and so forth. That's a result of those competitions of large business-centric markets. We don't have a dominant hub. They're very competitive. And, again, the geography of the coastal hubs, large business-centric markets drives more competition. And by definition, drives more stage length.", "So we haven't evidence that correlates stage length directly to profitability. Stage length is somewhat a result of the geography and the strength of our hubs. And we think that hub structure works for us very well. For instance, in New York, it is the only true connecting hub in New York. And it allows \u2013 it allows us to make revenue management decisions on high yield flow traffic versus low yield connect traffic that's unique to us. All of those things will drive an actual stage length.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think I will add to that real quickly. As we begin the discussion on this in earnest, certainly that's one area. But there are a lot of other factors that will, in fact, affect our network. And to optimize that network, that's the discussions we are having in earnest with regards to moving forward. So many factors there. Thank you.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "All right. Yeah, thank you very much. And look, I appreciate the commentary and the 4Q PRASM trajectory. The market doesn't appear to believe you. Your stock has actually sold off more since you guys provided that. So I think it has been sort of one step forward and one step back with United for the last four years. And as you talk about this margin gap closure, it becomes like all people are going to focus on. So \u2013 and it's actually the fact it's the widening as your operational metrics are improving is arguably even more concerning.", "So the existence \u2013 the argument against the existence of a structural disadvantage seems more feeble as time goes on. So is there a conclusion that you might draw here, if that doesn't happen that you don't close the margin gap or the PRASM gap that maybe there is a conclusion that United is just too big?", "And is there a scenario where a couple years down the road if you are not getting where you need to be that we're talking about major surgery here to the network, involving asset divestitures or real estate divestitures of something like that, is there a scenario where we see structural overhaul of the network evolving shrinking the size of this company?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Yeah, Hunter, I think it's way too early for anyone, particularly me, to answer that question. And so stand by. I understand your viewpoint, I understand the market's reaction. I understand the situation we're in. And that's what I'm here to do. And that's what we'll get at very quickly.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "All right. Thank you for the time.", "Operator", "From Credit Suisse, we have Julie Yates online. Please go ahead.", "J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, in your prepared remarks you noted strong summer bookings, particularly in the Trans-Atlantic and one of your peers last week highlighted strengths in advanced summer yields domestically. Are you seeing similar dynamics on the domestic market?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Julie. You know, as we look at the demand environment in the second quarters, from a business travel point of view, we saw softness in margin that continued into April. We do see signs kind of mid-May and into June, positive signs that would point to strengthening in yield as we get up closer to that time. It's a little bit early on the business traffic, the window. But we are yield there right now.", "We feel pretty good that we see some demand picking up as we move towards the summer, beginning in mid-May. I would emphasize corporate is still a little bit soft. We saw our corporate portfolio in the first quarter down 3%. We took out energy, it's down about 2%.", "So, the energy sector is impacting us. We expect that to continue through the second quarter, given where oil prices are. So, the corporate sector \u2013 the energy sector as well as the overall Houston hub will continue to put pressure on us. So we see good demand, we see strong demand, but quite frankly it's at lower yields.", "And then I think, I'll point to the slide I showed in the presentation and we do have some supply and demand dynamics affecting in diluting yields, as we think about the near-term. And I'll close it that we see demand picking up kind of mid-May, June with some signs of stronger yields.", "J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. And then is there any additional color you can offer on the Trans-Atlantic and the dynamics causing the weakness there, the sequential deterioration in PRASM in Q1 was a little worse than I would have expected given the actions just taken on seasonal shaping. Is there lingering impact of Paris and Brussels that's going to impact Q2 as well or what are some of the dynamics there?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Yeah, Julie, I think the recent events and the tragedy in Brussels has impacted bookings. What we generally see is a slowdown in bookings after events like that. Those begin to pick back up, but quite frankly you lose days, even weeks of the booking curve.", "And that's impacting the second quarter, which is why, in the Trans-Atlantic as you move towards the summer period, that booking curve still has plenty of time to fill up and we see that demand. So, I tie it more to the recent events that, particularly in Brussels, that is affecting the overall travel to the Trans-Atlantic.", "J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg online. Please go ahead.", "Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everybody. Just two questions here. Jim, going back to the slides \u2013 and by the way, thanks. I really appreciate the slides. Very helpful with the call. But on the slide, I think it's slide eight where you look at the different geographic regions and you call out China performing better than domestic. Now, is that on a PRASM basis or is that on a profitability basis?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Mike, this is Jim. It's on profitability analysis. You can thank my boss for the slides.", "Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. And then \u2013 thanks, Oscar. And then my second question is to Gerry. With respect to the fleet, when we look at your fleet and how it has evolved, it looks like versus the last update, there is a larger reduction in the number of CRJ-700s.", "And as I think about it, I would have maybe anticipated the bigger decline in 50-seaters rather than 70-seaters. And I'm just curious if that reduction is a function of the fact that you're bringing in a lot of E175s, the Embraer Aircraft and maybe that you're up against scope and so as E175s come in, you got to take out CRJ-700s. So, if you could just provide an explanation for that, that would be great. Thank you.", "Gerald Laderman - Senior Vice President Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer", "It's a combination, I think, of two things. One, as you said, the scope limitation that we dictate some of the swapping out of the CRJs for the E175s. And also timing on when the 50-seat aircraft leases expire. We try not to take an aircraft that we're still paying for. So, between the two, that would drive what you're seeing.", "Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. Jim, I wonder, you gave a lot of stats there pretty quickly. I wonder if you could just repeat by regional entity where you think we'll be in the fourth quarter and what gets us there?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Duane. Yeah. This is Jim. As I said on domestic, we expect given our initiatives improved reliability. We're seeing that translate into some of the highest customer \u2013 the highest customer satisfaction scores that we've seen. And as we build on that momentum, coupled with the initiatives, I talked about entry level fare initiatives that comes in the second half of the month.", "The ability to upsell into first class as we put more two-cabin aircraft into the domestic system. And other marketing initiatives that will leverage that reliability that we're seeing in our system. We think those initiatives put us on a path to flat to positive PRASM in the consolidated domestic system in the fourth quarter. In the Latin, we also believe we have a path to progression to hit the Latin America PRASM by the fourth quarter as well as in the Trans-Atlantic.", "The one area that will probably lag it because of things that are particularly the strong dollar, the RMB, the Chinese currency, is relative \u2013 the dollar relative strength to that currency has a longer tail to it, lack of better words, than what we saw with the yen and the euro.", "So, we think Pacific will take a little bit longer to get to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. But we're really excited about it. And we have a good path to it. We understand the importance of PRASM. And what it means to drive in top line revenue and the team is very much focused on it.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI", "So, flat to positive in domestic, Atlantic and Latin, which just feels like given the relative size of those feels like a consolidated flat to positive despite Pacific, is that a reasonable way to think about it?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "I put it kind of consolidated closer to flat. Again, the domestic we think we have a path from flat to positive. The other international entities, given the capacity growth were closer to flat, so you weight those together. I would want to call it consolidated positive at this point.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI", "Okay. And then just for my second question, as we think about losing a bunch of these 50-seaters, can you give us some basic building blocks? So, maybe a ratio for every three 50-seaters that goes away, you take one of these mainline deliveries associated with that order. And then just the inputs to profit improvement to help us sort of build up to what this fleet transition could mean for you over the next couple of years?", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I'll jump in and then let Jerry. As you think about from a network perspective, you can think of \u2013 you're right, the three-ish 50-seaters, two to three kind of in line with each of those 737s that come in to replace those.", "And so, we think of concepts in markets, where we're perceived neutral and where we can work with frequency and use that mainline aircraft to fill in the pattern that previously had much more higher frequency of 50-seaters. Well, you can kind of think of that two to three range in terms of that replacement.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI", "And can you give us any sense for profit improvement for each of these that goes away?", "Gerald Laderman - Senior Vice President Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer", "We haven't. But I really want to stress the ability to drive ancillary revenue. On the firsthand, given the economy plus section that comes with that. It's a great first-class cabin. It comes with Wi-Fi. It comes with our personal device entertainment system. So, it has a lot of the attributes that customers are looking for. And it will come with increased reliability.", "So, we think from a customer point of view, it will drive great benefit. I think it's one of the things that Oscar mentioned on our Investor Call in June, we can highlight and kind of walk you through some specific steps on that.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And just on the cost side, I would add clearly the larger aircraft is going to be more efficient on a seat cost basis and fuel efficiency as well. There will be some meaningful savings there.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thanks for the time.", "Operator", "From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi online. Please go ahead.", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. With regard to the changes that we're seeing at New York in the regulatory changes at New York, do you have a sense of just how much, if any, additional capacity may be accommodated not necessarily your own, but your total New York capacity as a result of the FAA relaxing some of the restrictions there?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hi, Darryl, this is Jim. We don't. And, you know, the marketplace will obviously \u2013 will determine that. Again, our big concern in a highly congested, most congested air space is we \u2013 is the risk of a more congested air space. And so, what that would mean for our customers. In terms of what the market dynamics or what the results \u2013 we just don't have a sense of that right now.", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe to follow-on some of the other questions that we've heard. I guess, what might help is if you could give us some reassurance, perhaps, in the level of commitment to actually getting to a positive unit revenue trajectory. Meaning, I've heard some people ask you if you should get smaller, and I think that's a fair question.", "And I've heard some people ask you, how confident really are you that you can get to a flat or modestly positive RASM trajectory in some of these markets by the end of the year. But just wondering, you have the ability to get to positive unit revenue in just about any demand environment. It just depends how small you're willing to get. So, would you be willing to provide a commitment to \u2013 the investment community to achieve a flat unit revenue trajectory by the end of the year?", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "This is Oscar. I think, as far as future guidance, I just \u2013 I want to hold my powder dry a little bit until I understand it a little more thoroughly and get a lot of input from all of you as well as our team here. I think on the June call, I think, we'll be able to give you a sense. I know that's a couple months, and it gives us a little more certainty about the year.", "But what I don't want to do is begin to commit on these calls the things that I know the market wants. I know the optics wants to be there. We need to fly profitability. We need to fly the way we at United fly with our current network.", "And over some point in time, if that needs to change or adjust accordingly, we'd make those changes. But we'll make them thoughtfully with a lot and lot of research and internal analysis. And those are not sort of shooting from the hip kind of conversations that I want to have on a call. So, if you'll allow me a little more patience, now that we're getting back to work, we'll talk a little bit more about this in June. Thanks.", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Stephens, we have Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. When it comes to rolling out that basic economy fare later on this year, what are the gating factors that would prevent you guys from getting that out as expected? Sort of what needs to happen internally, is it IT or something else?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Jack. This is Jim. We're really confident on our timeline. The IT team here is very focused. It's a very collaborative process. Quite frankly, it's collaborative with our operations team, because we want to make sure that across the enterprise, the understanding of what the customer is purchasing and what their expectations are for that product are really clear. So, we're really confident on the timeline, and I don't see any gates or as you mentioned in our way. There is a huge collaboration going on, and IT is right behind us with it.", "Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. That's great. And then when it comes to thinking about fuel hedging, could you guys give us an update on your thought process around, perhaps, increasing your forward hedging, given the volatility to the upside that we've been seeing in fuel over the last several months?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Sure. Hedging is just one tool that can help provide better certainty, as we try to achieve our business plan. It's no longer for us a hedging of near-term volatility. That's a very expensive insurance policy. We can just self-insure that risk. So, it's just one tool. There are a number of factors that we'll look at, including our net exposure to fuel. One of the benefits of the Houston hub works in the other way.", "As fuel prices rise, there's a correlation on revenue, particularly in Houston. So, it will be that net exposure that we would focus on. The competitive landscape, what others are doing that could impact the industry and the overall economic environment.", "So, we'll be thoughtful about our hedging. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have not done any hedging since last summer. And while there's been some volatility in fuel recently, from a historical perspective, it's still a very low fuel environment.", "Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you again for the time.", "Operator", "From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth online. Please go ahead.", "Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning. Just on the CapEx program, could you just talk a little bit about your thoughts on financing. I know that you mentioned about maybe 50% of aircrafts were debt financed this year. But as you look forward, thoughts on operating leases or debt financing and how should we think about liquidity and debt targets?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Sure, Savi. Let me talk about leasing first. I would absolutely love to lease some of these aircraft. But it's got to make economic sense. There are a number of factors, let me give you three. One is just the cost of money, cost of debt.", "As you know, we can finance \u2013 debt finance aircraft at a very low cost. That creates a high hurdle for the leasing companies to overcome. And historically they haven't been able to do that. They are better able to today to pass through their lower cost of funds to us. But that's one factor.", "Probably the bigger one is residual value. You need to make leasing work in situation where the leasing company is going to be more optimistic on residual value than we are. And then sort of tenure, think of it like buying an automobile. If you're going to trade in your automobile every two years or three years, leasing might make sense. If you're going to keep that auto through its useful life, leasing becomes very expensive.", "So, when we look at these aircraft \u2013 these are largely core aircraft that we expect to keep, very long-term, 25 years, 30 years and leasing can get expensive. But, that's not to say that leasing can't work. And like we've done historically, we will continue to look at leasing opportunities and see if we can make anything work in that space.", "But that's one of the reasons why when we talk about free cash flow and capital allocation, I look at adjusted free cash flow. So, for me, I'm going to adjust for the financing. So, whether it's a lease or whether we use [ETCs] or other debt financing, that's going to drive the availability of liquidity that we can use in our capital allocation program, where top priority is still going to be returning cash to shareholders. And as we continue to have strong earnings, we would continue with that program.", "Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "That's very helpful color. Thank you. And for a follow-up, just on the reliability, that has been a big focus and there will be a lot of investments here made to kind of continue to improve reliability. Could you discuss like what metrics you're looking to measure how you're performing on that? And then just from a timing perspective, when do you expect that to kind of manifest itself and get revenue and costs as a benefit?", "Gregory L. Hart - Chief Operations Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey. This is Greg, Savi. I'll take the first piece and then defer it to Jim and Gerry on the cost and revenue piece. We look at a ton of factors and a ton of measurements in terms of how we're performing, everything from bag delivery and performance to two different ways of looking at around departure performance to how quickly we shut doors on aircraft and literally tens and tens of metrics each and every day.", "And we've managed this quarter through the hard work of the United team and the 86,000 people out in the field working the flights each and every day to actually set record performance across many, many metrics. And as proud of that performance as we are, we're more excited about where we're headed, because we feel we still have a lot of opportunity to improve from there.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "This is Jim. I would just add that reliability that we're seeing and the great progress in that area, we actually are seeing in our hubs our share growing and taking hold the beginnings of that. And when I talk about moving towards flat deposit RASM by the fourth quarter domestic, again a piece of that is the momentum that we're capturing there.", "So, it's hard to put a timeline on net revenue as Oscar referred to that earlier. But we're seeing signs in our hubs in that share. We want to obviously expand that some of those old cities and get some traction there. But we're really confident with the reliability and the initiatives we have out there. That's part of our success in moving towards flat to positive.", "Gerald Laderman - Senior Vice President Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. And from the cost side, we're seeing some of that benefit already. You think about misconnects and having to deal with the cost of putting customers up at hotels and meals and whatnot and crew costs as well. So all of that, we see immediately as we run more reliable operations, but there's still more to come on that as we can gain greater efficiency in the operations. So, while we have some cost savings, we're already seeing it will increase over time.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Savi. This is Oscar. One thing, at least from my operational background that I think applies across any industry, as you invest to become more reliable, that investment is purely a cost one. As you get more reliable, how you reduce that cost or that safety cushion, how quickly you do it, how effectively you do it, is a key attribute that Mr. Hart will be challenged with very quickly.", "And, again, now, every time we do that, I mean, we've said Denver and Houston over the last couple of weeks have been massively hit. We have 700 people that are not able to come to work on a day. And so it's all those things and all of those different moving parts that you have to address. But that safety cushion is across the system will have to be managed better. And then, therefore, cost comes out. But it starts with having a reliable product. So, thank you.", "Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "All right. That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Savi.", "Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations", "And thanks to all of you for joining the call today. Please call Investor Relations if you have any further questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Brendan and I'll be your conference facilitator today. Following the initial remarks from management, we will open the lines for questions.", "This call is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed, or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.", "I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Jonathan Ireland, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Brendan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com.", "Information on yesterday's release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.", "All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.", "Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor updates, copies of which are available on our website.", "Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.", "Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are President and CEO, Oscar Munoz; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; and Senior Vice President of Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. We also have Chief Operations Officer and Executive Vice President, Greg Hart, in the room to assist with Q&A.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you all for joining us today. As we look at the second quarter, we certainly made significant progress and as we continue to execute against our global operations better than our company has actually ever seen and at the same time delivering solid financial performance.", "As you can see on the chart, for the second quarter, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $1.4 billion and achieved pre-tax margins of 14.5%. Those are both excluding special items. For the quarter, we earned $2.61 of diluted earnings per share, which once adjusted for taxes, represents a 25% increase year-over-year, and we delivered this result while improving on our initial expectations.", "So, clearly, we accomplished a lot and I'm proud of the hard work of the United team. So, let me give you \u2013 give me a minute to thank all of our employees for their continued dedication to providing a positive and reliable experience for our customers. This can be seen as our operation continued to perform at a high level last quarter with our on-time performance improving over 11 points year-over-year, and on the heels of our best ever six month run on on-time arrivals and bag handling, we are now consistently performing at the level that we and our customers expect of us. Our focus has now shifted to maintaining this level of reliability while doing so more efficiently.", "We also completed an important milestone in our labor negotiations by reaching a joint tentative agreement with our flight attendants. If that applies, this agreement will bring our 20,000-plus flight attendants on to a single contract, relieving inefficiencies we have experienced over the last several years. And, most importantly, this will be an important step in unifying our airline to one shared purpose: to be the airline we know we can be.", "I want to extend a special thank you to the AFA for their dedication and effort in reaching this agreement. As we speak, our flight attendants are participating in road shows and submitting their votes and we look forward to seeing the results in mid-August.", "Speaking about flight attendants, training is already underway with them, and many of our other employees in preparation for the December launch of our new United Polaris business class. Discussion Construction has already started on the first Polaris launch in Chicago, production has also started on our new suite-like seats and the first wave of our chef-inspired menus are being finalized. The experience we're creating, as you know, is exactly, what our customers have asked for and we can't wait for you to enjoy yourself starting on the 1st of December.", "Now, back to the quarter. We also continued repurchasing our stock, spending approximately $700 million, representing just a little bit over 4% of our shares outstanding and as we announced yesterday, our board has approved an additional authorization for $2 billion.", "Many of you have heard me say, I believe in proof not promise. As you can see this quarter, we had many proof points that we're continuing to build a great airline. However, as we mentioned on our June Investor call, this is not enough and we fully acknowledge we aren't yet performing, from a financial perspective, to the level of our and your expectations and we're not standing still. This can be seen on slide five. On our June call, we laid out a description of the initiatives we are currently implementing and are expected to drive over $3 billion in benefit by 2018. If you've not seen our June presentation, I encourage you to go to our website and download.", "We expect these initiatives to contribute to driving incremental value and shrinking our margin gap to peers. We'll keep you updated on the progress of these initiatives.", "And we're not stopping there. We are currently in the middle of a thorough self-evaluation of all aspects of our business. In particular, as shown on slide six, we are working to identify ways to operate our airline more efficiently now as it's reached top tier reliability. We are also refining the mission of each geographic region, hub and spoke. Additionally, we are implementing a profit-maximizing product and segmentation strategy that best aligns with our customers.", "And finally, we have a cost gap to our peers that we're identifying and addressing those costs that are controllable. I am looking forward to presenting this next chapter of United at our fourth quarter Investor Day.", "But before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to speak to our future capacity plans. Let me start by saying we acknowledge, truly acknowledge the importance of returning to positive unit revenue, and, of course, we recognize that our future capacity plans directly impact the future PRASM performance. However, we must evaluate what our network is today, and the evolution to ensure that long-term optimization and sustainability of earnings is maintained. At times, this may include adding capacity to strengthen our best performing markets and ensuring we remain competitive. However, we determine that certain clients will not generate sustained profitability; we will then carefully consider modifying that capacity.", "Proof of our result is seen in us again reducing full year capacity 0.25 point. We have now reduced our 2016 capacity growth plans by 0.75 point. This is a meaningful demonstration of our responsiveness to the present demand environment, particularly given that our initial guidance have always been responsibly and conservatively disruptive. Our review and analysis won't stop here as we continue to closely evaluate future changes. Going forward, as we adjust our capacity we tend to update shareholders on these modifications.", "So, to wrap up, again, I want to thank our employees for another great quarter and a continued focus on our customers and continue to spend a lot of time visiting stations and I can't be more proud of the work they are all doing.", "So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on slide eight, our second quarter revenue declined 6.6%, nearly a full point better than our initial expectations primarily due to international yields, 4th of July holiday timing and other initiatives.", "With respect to the third quarter, we expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 5.5% to 7.5% year-over-year with domestic and international PRASM to be in those same ranges.", "On slide eight, we defined each of the major headwinds we anticipate for the third quarter summing to approximately 3.5 points of drag on PRASM.", "I'd now like to explain what we are seeing in the current demand environment. Leisure bookings have been strong as travelers are taking advantage of attractive fare levels and a strong U.S. dollar. Corporate travel bookings in the second quarter were essentially flat with revenue down approximately 3% as corporate yields continue to be pressured.", "Looking towards the rest of the year, we expect to see further softening of corporate yields as summer leisure travel subsides. We will closely monitor these effects as they impact our closing yield, high-yield revenue.", "On our April earnings call, we provided an outlook for fourth quarter PRASM and I'd like to update you on that today. Due to downward revisions for fourth quarter GDP as well as a growing concern in the pace of corporate yield recovery, our fourth quarter estimates have been revised downward. In response, as you have seen from our announcement yesterday, we are reducing second half capacity to better align with demand.", "On slide nine, we show specific actions we have taken in each geographic entity. I'll let you read through the details on your own but rest assured, we are actively managing our network to optimize results in a challenging revenue environment and are seeing the results. For instance, as a result of our capacity reallocation, Houston had the best year-over-year PRASM of any hub in June, followed closely by San Francisco and Denver.", "Taking all these regional dynamics into account, with respect to capacity, as can be seen on slide 10, we now anticipate full year capacity to grow between 1% and 1.5%. As Oscar mentioned, we are currently in the process of closely evaluating our capacity for the fourth quarter and 2017.", "As I wrap up, I want to reiterate our focus on maximizing profitability throughout our entire network. We are constantly evaluating the revenue and profitability landscape to ensure we have the proper plan in place. We continue to be committed to growing our capacity in line with demand but remain willing and prepared to adjust when necessary.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerry.", "Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Jim. A summary of our financial performance can be seen on slide 12 for GAAP financials and slide 13 for non-GAAP financials. Excluding special items, pre-tax earnings were $1.4 billion with a pre-tax margin of 14.5%. Importantly, our earnings per share were $2.61, a 25% improvement year-over-year when adjusted for taxes as we continue to repurchase shares.", "Moving to slide 14, non-fuel unit costs for the quarter grew 2.5%, when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third-party expenses. For the third quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs to grow 2.5% to 3.5% and for the full year, we continue to expect unit costs to grow to 2% to 3%, despite reducing capacity by almost 1 point versus initial expectations. This guidance includes the benefits of our annual efficiency savings initiatives from our 2013 cost savings program as well as our recently announced 2016 program. In total, we expect these two programs to drive $400 million of cost benefit when compared to 2015.", "This CASM guidance also includes the impact from the three ratified labor agreements reached this year, but does not include any assumptions associated with the tentative agreement we recently reached with our flight attendants. Once ratified, we will provide more specifics on the impact to our cost.", "Based on the guidance we have provided for revenue and costs, we expect our pre-tax margin to be between 13.5% and 15.5% for the third quarter. With respect to cash, in the second quarter, we generated approximately $2.5 billion of operating cash flow and $1.8 billion of free cash flow.", "As you can see on slide 15, during the quarter we invested approximately $770 million in the business and took delivery of two Boeing 787-9 aircraft and two Boeing 737-800 aircraft. As Oscar mentioned, we repurchased approximately $700 million of our shares in the quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we still have approximately $255 million remaining on our prior $3 billion authorization. Additionally, as announced yesterday, our board has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization.", "Returning cash to our shareholders is a core element of our capital allocation strategy. However, this will not be done at the expense of the health of our balance sheet, as maintaining manageable debt levels is critical to running the airline through a variety of economic cycles.", "In conclusion, throughout the quarter, we have continued to demonstrate strong cost discipline, a commitment to invest in our business and a desire to reward our shareholders. We believe the plan we have in place positions us well to continue these actions going forward, while allowing us to be nimble and responsive to a changing economic environment.", "I'll now turn it back over to Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Gerry. As you've heard, we've made substantial progress in the second quarter but we know there is more work to do. It has already been quite a busy summer and will continue to be up, for us here at United, as we work to set up our next chapter. I look forward to sharing more of this with you later in the year.", "I'd like to close by thanking our customers for flying United. Our operation is running well, our schedules are adapting to meet your needs and our airport and onboard products continue to elevate your flying experience.", "Thank you for choosing United and look forward to seeing you on a flight soon. With that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan for Q&A.", "Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Oscar. We'll now take questions from the analyst community. Please limit yourself to one question. If you'd like to ask another question, please reenter the queue after your question has been addressed. Brendan, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Jonathan. And from UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. I mean, can you just give us a sense of how you are thinking about \u2013 I know it's early but could you give us a sense of how you're thinking about 2017 capacity levels, at least to start the year?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Darryl. This is Jim. Hey, we're not \u2013 we're actually working on our 2017 plans, as I speak right now, and a lot of focus on that. So, it's too early for us to comment specifically on that.", "I will say, as we talked about this year and we talked about in the past years, we're focused on keeping capacity in line with demand. So, we're working through that process now and we plan to update you later in the year on what we're going to do in 2017.", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey, thank you. I'll surprise you with a non-RASM question. Gerry, if you assume that the current field curve and the RASM environment continues into next year, and you plug in some new labor contracts and the step up and CapEx that looks like you guys will have next year, that is the potential that consume most, if not all of your free cash flow next year. So, first of all, can you say whether you agree with that assessment and could you put a finer point on what CapEx looks like next year and how much flexibility you have to manage that down if the RASM environment remains challenging?", "Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Joe, one thing I talked before about looking at free cash flow net of aircraft financing, we've had this discussion that rather we choose to lease aircraft or buy aircraft that can make material difference in free cash flow. So, when I am looking at cash and cash allocation, I do take that into account. And we had to finalize our plan to aircraft financing closer to the start of the year, but just kind of looking at where our aircraft CapEx next year is and kind of what we did this year, I think it's reasonable to assume have a range of about half to two-thirds of our aircraft CapEx being financed next year. So you could probably plug that into your number. It could be a little bit less, it could be a little bit more depending on interest rates but in the current interest rate environment, as you've seen us and others do, the capital markets are quite attractive. So, that's one lever we have sort of depending on the environment how much of our aircraft CapEx is financed.", "In terms of other levers, we can always dial down non-aircraft CapEx. We've had reasonable experience doing that. Aircraft CapEx, the only comment I would make is that it tends to be the case that when a manufacturer is building an aircraft, they expect you to take it, and they tend to start cutting metal, call it 18 months, 15 months ahead of schedule. So, you pretty much lock in most of the year's aircraft sort of if not now, within the next few months but you can do a lot with aircraft beyond that and we've done that in the past when necessary.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on line. Please go ahead.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, Oscar, you mentioned that you're undertaking a self evaluation of all aspects of the business and there is some headlines, I think Bloomberg that says you guys are reviewing management hubs and operations. So, this is good, and this is, I think, a lot of people have been waiting to see. So, can you give us some color on this? Is this like a full scale what you would refer to sort of like a top to bottom strategic review? And can you give us maybe a sense of how to think about a timeline when you'll have something to say about these things? What is the potential set of outcomes or is this more not like a finite thing that's going to last six months or something, but more of just like an ongoing new approach to how you're thinking about writing the business? So, any color around this would be great. Thanks a lot.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think with regards to duration, I think companies make the mistake of doing these near-term things and then stopping. It's a dynamic world and you have to adjust accordingly but you have to start with a full blown thrust, and it's amazing how quick news travels. I just issued that note this morning to our employees. It is a top to bottom full-scale view on everything that we do. It's something that we have to do and acknowledge and that involves the management structure and who is aligned. I've always said that structure follows strategy and so developing in the near-term what our North Star is, has, I think, been the critical plan.", "So we do have a finite time period that we'll work through over the summer. We have a board meeting in September where we'll sort of talk a lot about this, and you'll hear about it in our fourth quarter Investor Day. And then, again, it will change as the dynamics of the competitive marketplace do. But we're excited. It is spanning the globe, if you will, with regards to the conversations we're having. We have more than a few work streams working around every little thing to product offerings, to the broader issues around capacity and network planning. And so, I think it's exciting. So, thank you for asking that.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora on line. Please go ahead.", "Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good morning, everyone. So, Oscar, United's operating performance from both in on-time and delay perspective has been steadily improving since last fall, but there has obviously been a lot of industry headwinds that have not allowed your PRASM to really show any benefit from this. I guess, one, what are some of the initiatives you believe have helped you get where you are operationally? And then, second, do you have an estimate of what kind of the PRASM benefit that you have gotten this year from this improved performance?", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. I was looking at Greg. I don't know that I have a number specifically for the PRASM impact. But with regards to your question about what's generating this, first and foremost is the incredible passion of the professionals that run our business. They have re-engaged in a way that we haven't seen in a long time. And that's just not me talking; you can ask a lot of folks that are seeing that benefit. They are just working hard and they're engaged and I think that's a big critical factor.", "In addition, over time, between project quality, a lot of the process and procedures and investments that we've made in the business, which are substantial, are all assisting those folks, giving them the tools to properly do their job. And the benefits, again, it's a good question that we should come up with a more quantitative answer. It is a significant value. I'd say running better is running cheaper and we are seeing that and we'll get you a better number here in the course of time.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Andrew, if I could add just from a customer perspective on what we're hearing in the marketplace, as Oscar said, the level of operations is really, really strong and the operations team has proven it's sustainable and durable. We're hearing that back from our customers. Our corporate sales force on a routine basis is very excited about, for instance, going in and bringing in the scorecard of our corporate guarantee. And year-to-date, six plus months into it, we're not paying on it, which means we're meeting our commitment on terms of our operations.", "So, that \u2013 as Oscar said, it's hard to put a PRASM on it. Those are the things that will lead to PRASM. We're seeing our local share in our hubs rebounding back to levels that we saw before some of our integration issues. And so, we're really, really excited about it.", "And lastly, on our call in June, we talked about $300 million of operational efficiency, as well as some of the what I call choice as we get back in terms of being a carrier of choice among our corporate partners. That's a line item in there that does relate to PRASM.", "So, as Oscar said, a little bit too early to put a specific number on it but we're getting the right momentum.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "As we said to the sales force, Jim and I, the notion that we can't sell anymore because we don't a particularly good product, that excuse is no longer on the table.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Yeah.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It fell away. Thank you..", "Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth on line. Please go ahead.", "Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for the update on your thinking on the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more granularity as to which areas or maybe segments, international segments where you're feeling a little bit more concerned about what your thinking is on the kind of the progression here as you head into the end of the year.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Savi, this is Jim. I think as we look out, and as I mentioned, fourth quarter, our expectations, given expectations of demand is measured by GDP declining, we expect obviously that to continue.", "The corporate business, although we see the demand flat, the revenue is down on lower yield. We expect that to continue. That's correlated to that expectations of GDP coming down, so that's part of what was driving it. So that's that domestic piece of our ability \u2013 of putting pressure on our ability that I talked about on our April call.", "Internationally, we did see weakness in trans-Atlantic PRASM in the second quarter. We're adjusting to that on our slide. We talked about the fourth quarter being down 1% to 2% capacity. So we're reacting to that, Our capacity was up about 2% in the second quarter. We're guiding to 0.6% to 1.6% in the third quarter and we're guiding to down 1% to 2%. So we're addressing some of that demand on the trans-Atlantic side aligning with that capacity with demand.", "Latin, we actually \u2013 that's the one where we actually see the quarter-over-quarter improvement on a RASM basis stronger than some of the other entities. And so, we feel good about where the Latin entity is heading as we head into the fourth quarter.", "On the Pacific side, it's really from a demand perspective, a lot of the things we talked about in the past with OA capacity. I will say our launches of our new markets are meeting or exceeding our expectations. We are particularly proud that we jumped back in the trans-Atlantic on this, but our San Fran/Tel Aviv flight is doing exceptionally well and our Asia flights are all meeting and exceeding our expectations. But the demand \u2013 there is still OA capacity demand. We are starting \u2013 we have an opportunity to start San Fran/Shanghai number two in October. So we're seeing a little bit of capacity from that but we think that over the long run that's the right investment for us to make.", "Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker on line. Please go ahead.", "Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning, everybody. Jim, you've cited that GDP expectations are coming down but GDP is still growing, yet it's revenue that's declining. So, in other words, that long-term relationship between GDP and revenue appears to be decoupling, Ken (28:00).", "Now, I understand why this happened when the Internet came along. I understand why it happened briefly during the financial crisis, but I can't point to a secular cause over the last 18 months. So, this leaves us with the obvious conclusion that revenue weakness has to be self-inflicted. Do you share this view or can you identify something secular that's causing this decoupling? Because if you're a rental car agency, and we're talking about Uber, okay, I can kind of figure it out. I can't cite what that secular change might be.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Yeah. Hey, Jamie, I think there is that one correlation with fuel price that has that impact on revenue. We talked about surcharges over time and so forth being down and that correlation in terms of how fuel has affected revenue. So, some of that \u2013 because I do agree in 2015, you're right: industry revenue as a percent of GDP was down and was an inflection point from previous years and I expect that will continue again today.", "And so, other than that correlation to fuel, I'll go back to the other thing we've talked about right? We have seen capacity grow faster than demand and that's putting pressure on yields and corporate demand is not growing at the pace. The corp yields, the corporate demand is not growing at that pace of capacity.", "We are pretty consistent. I mean, we're back to our initial year guidance on capacity and we're down from that initial year guidance on capacity, and that capacity even where we're guiding today will be less than what expectations of GDP today that we are talking to. So we're managing our plan in this environment and we feel pretty good about it.", "The last thing I would say is that on the June call we talked about our slimline and upgauge program. We have some modest growth in the third quarter. That capacity becomes really margin accretive. And so where leisure bookings are strong that's the capacity to absorb that leisure bookings. Lower RASM but at extremely lower cost CASM. So we really feel good about the plan we're rolling out.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Jamie, this is Oscar. Jamie?", "Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Great go ahead, please.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, no. You get one question. You got to get back in line but I just (30:40) by the way, it's a very thoughtful question as all of them are but the concept of the self-inflicted portion I think is a very interesting one, and somebody had asked me earlier about the work that we're doing here over the summer. We have to explore that a little bit to make sure that we're not just following historical conventional wisdom all the time because again, as I said, it's a dynamic marketplace and we have to find either the secular impacts or things that we can generate or do better. So, thanks. We'll go to the next call.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, thanks for the time. Jim, a question for you. On slide eight, you did a good job of providing just color on PRASM and some of the drivers there. But it seems to only explain about half of the weakness in your unit revenues, right? I mean, just a simple math, you've got 3.5 points out of that 6.5 points. What are some of the other drivers? What are we missing out there?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "I think the other drivers are little bit of \u2013 I just mentioned, capacity is growing faster than demand across the industry and that's putting pressure on yields in an environment where corporate demand is not keeping up with that pace of capacity. And that higher yielding demand that's not there at that greater capacity puts pressure on PRASM.", "And the other piece is that modest capacity, in that modest capacity growth we have, if you look at our domestic, we will actually be slightly down in departures in the third quarter to drive that modest capacity growth. That's that margin accretive initiatives that we talked about in June giving a little bit more hold as we roll though the year.", "So, that's slimline growth and the upgauge strategy becoming less dependent on the regional and more dependent on to the main line. Again, it offers us ancillary product both first class and Economy Plus. But it does come in at RASM that's lower than the average but an even lower CASM which makes the margin accretive. Those are really the elements that are putting pressure on RASM.", "Operator", "From Credit Suisse we have Julie Yates on line. Please go ahead.", "J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, another one for you. Just when put out the flat RASM targets in April, what level of sequential improvement were you expecting at the time for the third quarter? I'm just trying to reconcile Q2 coming in at the better end of your range but the outlook for H2 has worsened. So, just trying to calibrate expectations on what the sequential improvement looks like from here?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "If I got the question correct, what we kind of thought third quarter sequential improvement would have been when we made that?", "J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Correct. Like how much did the outlook for the third quarter deteriorate since the April call?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "It has come down. And so \u2013 and due to that kind of revision down in GDP, the specific number, I don't have that in front of me where we were at from a forecast point of view. But given those GDP revisions, as that related to fourth quarter it's also impacting third quarter. So that weakness is rolling to the third quarter also.", "J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, understood. Is there an updated timeframe in which you are expecting the different entities to get back to flat deposit of RASM?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Again, we're not \u2013 I'm not \u2013 I don't have...", "Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer", "We're really focused on profitability, as Oscar mentioned in his comment. And so our initiatives out there are focused on doing that. As we lay out that game plan, we're focused on optimizing RASM every day and then put some RASM. And so, as we move through the rest of this quarter into the fourth quarter, we'll be able to get a little more insight and kind of continue to update you guys where we think PRASM is and ultimately where that lands relatively to positive PRASM growth.", "J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks for taking the question.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank, we have Mike Linenberg. Please go ahead.", "Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Jim, I want to go back to \u2013 you talked about further softening of corporate yields. I couldn't tell if that was just a continuation of what we were seeing or is it just noticeable deterioration from where we were a few months back. And the fact that you \u2013 I mean, you mentioned that demand seems to be fine and yet yields are under pressure, how much of that is a function of some of the changes to the fare structures with respect to advanced purchase restrictions maybe going away or Saturday night stays, some of the expenses getting lifted off, sort of lifted away. I mean, maybe that speaks to the point that Jamie brought up about the fact that we're sort of seeing a breakdown here between revenue and GDP. Some of it is related to just the structure out there and maybe the prevalence of a much more liberal fare regime in place. Thoughts on that?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Mike. Thanks for the question. I think pricing actions always affect PRASM, but I think it's more a continuation of what the demand that we're seeing where demand is relatively flat on lower yields.", "So, one thing, as you move into a summer peak period and you have that leisure demand strength, it actually, with lack of better words props up your inventory. And so, your lower inventory buckets are not as open as much.", "One of the things we're watching as we move past that peak period of summer season is strong leisure demand. And to your point, kind of the corporate demand being relatively flat, that can put relatively more pressure on yields relative to the third quarter where you have peak demand, strong from the June, July, August months.", "But to answer your question, we're kind of seeing demand where it was at. I would note that as energy sector continues to be down year-over-year, it's decelerating at a slower rate. So, that's also putting pressure on us on a year-over-year basis as we go forward.", "Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Cowen & Company, we have Helane Becker on line. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much, operator. Hi, guys. Thank you for the time. And, Oscar, as we look ahead to your business over the next say two years to five years and during this time period of the revenue improvement that you outlined last month, is there an earnings per share target we should be thinking about that you are thinking about managing to or should we not be looking at it as an EPS target, should we be looking at it as an operating margin target?", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's a great question and one that we are in the process of developing with that specific public measure that we're going to be driving to and obviously keeping you updated on. They all have merit. We're going to pursue all of them and certainly, it's more profitable; it's margin improvement; it's closing the margin gap to others or whatever the big drivers are. It's a great question but we will certainly definitely tell you at our fourth quarter Investor Day. It will be the culminating part of our conversation I suspect.", "Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. We'll look forward to it. Thanks.", "Operator", "From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.", "Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the time here. Jim, I am wondering where are we at with respect to, I'll call it enhanced revenue management technology getting rolled out. So, the entry-level fares product, I believe United in the past had been targeting the fourth quarter. I am just wondering is that still the case and what does it mean for United exactly here?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Dan. Entry-level fares, yeah we are still targeting second half of this year, a lot of work going on in that area to roll that product out into the marketplace. We're very excited and when you asked what it means for United, it's going to allow us to have a price point that allows us to compete for sure against ultra-low cost carriers and allow us to move some of the dilution that we've placed on ourselves today with our current fare structure. So we're very excited about that. We see that rolling out in the second half of the year.", "And so, we look forward to updating you on that. And it will be significant, in our earnings call. We talked about revenue initiatives, of strong customer choice revenue initiatives of $2.5 billion by 2018. That entry-level fare is a piece of that but also pieces of that as we update and become much reliable on the regional carriers and introduce more first class and the Economy Plus will drive other components of ancillary revenue that we have out there today.", "And then, finally, on revenue management, as I mentioned on the call in June, we're in the process of moving to a new forecasting model. We call it Gemini. We're in the market. About 2% or 3% of our overall domestic revenue is affected by it and we're getting good results. And so, that is also part of our 2018 initiatives that we talked about that rolling out and we'll update you as we ago but we're still in the very early testing phases of it but getting good results from it.", "Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. Appreciate the color.", "Operator", "From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go, ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI", "Hey, thanks good morning. So, going back to Mike's question, our checks suggest that you've actually tried to show some leadership with respect to restoring advanced purchase requirements. Would you comment on your experience in this regard and if the more reluctant party was willing to restore these fences as well, what is that worth to United or the industry?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey. This is Jim. Yeah. I'm not going comment on pricing initiatives in the marketplace both ours and other carriers. I'm just not going to comment on that.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Could I get a second, since I didn't get a byte on that? Jim, do you feel better about year-over-year unit revenue improvement during the peak leisure demand period or during a pure corporate demand period like September?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Well, as I mentioned, it's \u2013 you know, the leisure period drives relatively better unit revenue in the peak summer months relative to other periods of the year. It's a little early for us to get a good handle on corporate demand as we move past the Labor Day weekends; we're very much focused on it. There are things we're lapping across our system that we've talked about in terms of how it affects unit revenue.", "On the corporate side, we're seeing flattish demand on lower yields and we're seeing GDP revisions step down and so we're keeping a close eye on that. Again, that's why we've adjusted capacity. Our capacity adjustments that we made to the rest of the year are across the system both international and domestic, and we'll continue to do that as we watch demand going forward.", "Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "From Stephens, we have Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the time. As it relates to the slimline seats, could you give us an update on how much of your domestic network has already been outfitted with these slimline seats and is there a way to sort of summarize the impact that could have in terms of profitability on a seat mile basis?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Slimline, our program is little bit over 50% rolled out right now. In our June call, we talked about it being 50%, so we're beyond that as we're into July now. So it's little bit 50%-plus on the whole network. And so that program is past the halfway point on the slimline side.", "In terms of profitability, it comes at a lower RASM but a lower CASM and we haven't put numbers around what that's worth yet. As we walk through the rest of the year, we'll update you folks on our initiatives and we can put some more color on that going forward. We did talk about that program, slimline and upgauge program, driving $800 million of contribution by 2018. So, we'll be able to update you where we are at as we go forward.", "Operator", "Okay. And from UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. I'm just wondering the cost reduction targets that you guys provided on June 21 and then today's presentation again. Is there a portion of that that's specifically related to achieving a joint collective bargaining agreement with flight attendants?", "Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer", "No. That's...", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "That's the incremental (44:50)", "Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer", "It's Gerry. Those cost target is unrelated to the collective bargaining agreements.", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "But, I guess, presumably, getting a deal done with the flight attendants would allow you to realize some of the merger synergies that were originally intended. Are you saying that that would be incremental to your $1.3 billion cost reduction target?", "Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. We look at that separately, that can depend.", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "Any \u2013 sorry, Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Go ahead with your third question.", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "I was just going to ask if there was \u2013 if you could provide an updated view on what that -if you could help quantify that synergy from the integration effort and I'll leave it at that? Thanks", "Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We have not done that for a host of different reasons but there are incredible inefficiencies by the way its structured today and we are so anxious to put this behind us for so many different reasons. One of them being the efficiency, mostly the level of service we could provide across our system. So, thank you.", "Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, thanks. Gerry, just on the CASM outlook for the year. You took 50 bps or 25 bps, I guess, out of the full year capacity guidance. How much pressure did that put on CASM? Is the FX environment helping the CASM outlook now? If you could just help us understand the relationship between kind of capacity reductions and how much pressure that puts on CASM.", "Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer", "It puts some pressure on CASM. We've dealt with this in the past. Last year, in a situation of declining capacity versus our original guidance, we managed CASM down actually. So, this is all part of the process we have of always looking at opportunities to run the business more efficiently and to drive the cost savings through the various initiatives we have. It's not one thing. It's just all those little things that add up to our ability to manage CASM even in a declining capacity environment.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on line. Please go ahead.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi, again thanks. So, Jim, you said that corporate bookings are about flat with revenues down about 3%. Is it fair to assume that that entire gap is driven by the concept that you've referred to in the past as dilution and is it fair to assume that the main thrust or one of the main thrusts of Gemini is to minimize dilution and in that regard as it relate to the small market that you roll it out, you said you're seeing good results. Is that effectively minimizing dilution or is it good results from other stuff that maybe we're not appreciating that we know about? Thanks.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hi, this is Jim. You're absolutely right. It's minimizing dilution and that's the result that we're seeing. That's what we're targeting and in our test market that's also what we're seeing. So, it's consistent with what our expectations were.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth on line. Please go ahead.", "Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, thanks for taking the extra question. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the \u2013 and what we're seeing on the energy demand in terms of kind of the decline. I just want to make sure I understand. It seems like it's still declining but the comps are getting easier. And then also just from a newer perspective, I don't think we have seen much kind of in the way of volumes in additions of new capacity coming in and then wanted your latest thoughts on what's happening in Newark? Thanks.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Savi, this is Jim. As it relates \u2013 you broke up a little bit on the question \u2013 in terms of Newark and the removal of slots, yeah, I think, we've seen \u2013 we work really, really closely with the FAA, and other carriers. The FAA would say they're oversubscribed in the peak slot period. And on their Level 2, they've worked with the carriers to make sure that we don't deteriorate the operations at Newark. And so we're hopeful and in very close contact with the FAA on that, working with them to do that.", "Outside of that, we're not seeing that much in terms of OA growing capacity. And so as it relates to \u2013 that's what we're seeing that's happening in Newark right now.", "Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And just the clarification on the energy decline?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Oh, on the energy, I am sorry. In terms of energy, we're still seeing the decline in energy demand. It is coming at a decelerated pace than what we've seen in the past but it's cumulative so it is impacting our RASM as we move through the rest of the year. The energy sector continues to weaken but at a slower rate.", "Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Got it. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for the follow up. Just on the capacity side internationally, is there anything that you're seeing today that would lead you to believe that industry growth is going to slow materially from that sort of mid-to-high single digit range? I'm just trying to figure out if it's reasonable to assume that international PRASM just remains materially negative as we look into next year.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Yeah. This is Jim. Again, we'll focus on United's capacity. The one piece I'll point out is in Asia and the China capacity. There is limits to capacity growth based on the bilateral that's agreed between China and the U.S. government. And those bilaterals are almost to the point where they've been met. So that will have a natural kind of slowdown in capacity growth from the main U.S. to China. But I wouldn't to comment on other industry capacity around other regions of the world.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "But on that 10 points that you noted capacity growth for the industry in 2Q in Asia, how much of that would actually come down with what you are describing in China?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "We saw capacity growth in China grow over 20% in Q2. And so, obviously, there is run rates that affect as you think about going forward. But pretty much all of it, the \u2013 we're close the route authorities being granted between the two countries work (52:00) out but we did see capacity growing at a little bit over 20% in the second quarter.", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank we have Mike Linenberg. Please go ahead.", "Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Hey, thanks for the follow-up question. Hey just \u2013 and this is for Gerry, just with respect to strengthening the balance sheet. When I sort of look at later this year, it looks like there is some additional cash contributions to the pension. When I think about the amount of stock that you want to buy back and your CapEx even after the piece that's been financed, how should we think about your debt levels going forward? Are they going to stay sort of relatively constant or should we anticipate meaningful debt pay down as we sort of move into 2017 and 2018? How should we think about that? Thanks Gerry.", "Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So, Mike, the important point is that we need to maintain a healthy balance sheet. We're there, particularly when you talk \u2013 when you add our pension obligation, and when I talk about healthy balance sheet, it's really about managing through a cycle. And we're very comfortable that we would continue to have access to capital through a cycle. We have about $8 billion of unencumbered assets. So I'm comfortable with where our leverage is today, given our business and given what we're trying to do. So, we don't need to significantly reduce leverage at all.", "And with the additional CapEx I expect over the next few years, I said when we raised our CapEx guidance back in March with the additional aircrafts our 50 (53:44) seat issue, as well as the early retirement of 747. All of those aircrafts, I would expect to finance and with sort of the range I put out earlier on the call and what I expect to do next year, I think if you run the arithmetic, you would not see a decline in our gross debt number over the next year or two.", "Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Very good. Thanks, Gerry.", "Operator", "And from Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.", "Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hey, thanks for the follow-up here. Jim, another question on the $3.1 billion in initiatives underway, I think a big part of the story is improving efficiency via upgauging. And I think, the domestic upgauging is pretty well understood but if I'm not mistaken, there is also a wide body upgauging that is just beginning, which should aid margins on the international part of the network. And I'm just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit further on that?", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "Hey, Dan, it's Jim. The international upgaugings are really, really small piece, and it's driven mainly by the 767-300 conversions to two class. So that's driving a little bit of that upgauging. It's a really, really small piece of the upgauging that we talked about on our $3.1 billion initiative.", "Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer", "And, in addition, as you think about 2018, when the A-350s come, that fleet will all be part of international upgauging but again in total very small piece.", "Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay, very good. Thank you.", "Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Dan, and thank you to all for joining the call today.

Please go ahead, Julie.", "Julie Stewart", "Thank you, Brandon. Good morning everyone and welcome to United's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com.", "Information in yesterday's release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.", "All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.", "Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor update, copies of which are available on our website.", "Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Levy. In addition, we have Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart, and Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella in the room available to assist with Q&A.", "And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz", "Thank you, Julie and good morning. Welcome to a terrific second quarter, strong financial results and even more incredible operational results. And these developments that we've seen today and frankly, I\u2019ve seen over the past couple of quarters across the board are not only obviously the direct result of a lot of our great employees, but also the leadership in this room. And I think it is a direct result of the work we've done in so many areas to reengage the United family for both our customers and for our employees. And so as you think of our customers, I want to thank them for their continued loyalty and support. We continue to find new and better ways to service them and make them more comfortable on our airline.", "But we\u2019re here about financials, so on the financial side, I\u2019m turning to Slide 4. Our earnings per share excluding special charges was 5.4% higher than last year at $2.75. We reported pretax earnings of $1.3 billion, with a pre-tax margin of 13.2%. Both of those of course are excluding special charges. Total revenue was 6.4% in the second quarter. This is the highest level of quarterly revenue that we\u2019ve had since the fourth quarter of 2013. Also in this quarter, we repurchased $422 million of stock at an average price of $74 per share. Secondly, on the operational side, we finished this quarter as the Number One airline amongst our largest competitors in completion, on-time departures and on-time arrival. This is the first quarter United\u2019s operation has finished Number One among our peers since the merger and we look forward to continuing to build on this momentum in the second half of the year.", "We've also made meaningful strides and are executing on ten changes we announced in April on the customer service area and so to better serve those customers and really empower our employees, and so the initial results are very encouraging, specifically around the issue of involuntary denied boarding. Since we put different things into inception back a couple of months ago, we\u2019ve achieved almost 85% reduction in involuntary denied boarding. So that's a good metric that we\u2019re monitoring across the board. And it's important to make the point that these changes amount to a lot more than just a policy shift. Really is more of a, you know, I\u2019m going to use the term paradigm shift in our culture and mindset of our employees and our management. So it\u2019s about providing our people with tools, but also the imperative to solve problems kind of in the moment for our customers. And so we're excited about those developments and you\u2019ll hear more coming from us soon.", "And during the quarter we also continued to execute on our strategic initiatives that we laid out at Investor Day last fall with a primary objective of improving our absolute and relative margin performance. We feel incredibly good that we're on the trajectory that we laid out at Investor Day and so it\u2019s a solid path for us that we\u2019re very excited about.", "So with that I'll turn it over Scott to discuss both ops and the revenue environment.", "Scott Kirby", "Thank you Oscar and thanks everyone for joining us today. I'm going to start by talking about our operation. With all the decks and slides that we've created in the past year, for those of us at the United team, this is probably our favorite. You can clearly see that in the second quarter, United ran the very best operation amongst our largest competitors. It was true across the board, with great departure performance, on-time arrivals, completion factor and mishandled baggage rate. We just couldn\u2019t be more proud and thankful to the United team for the incredibly reliable operation. And this improvement is coming from all parts of the company. It starts from getting blank to the gate, ready to fly on time and while we don't traditionally show you a lot of tech op statistics, our maintenance team is doing a great job with margin improvement in tech ops metrics that I recall seeing at any airline, anytime, anywhere during my career.", "At the airport, our agents and ramp team are turning airplanes and getting them out on time. You can see our industry leading departure performance, but dig a little deeper and you\u2019d find an almost 100% improvement in quick turn performance and many other metrics showing huge year-over-year improvement. Globally, our ramp team has set new records for mishandled bags in 22 of the last 24 months. And once our customers get on the airplane, our flight attendants are just doing an incredible job. In fact we get more positive feedback on flight attendants then we get feedback on anything else. That\u2019s an amazing statistic and a testament to our great flight attendants. Our pilots are the day to day leaders of the airline on the front line and without that front line leadership none of this would be possible.", "And finally, our network operation center has the most difficult job in the industry given our hubs are located and the airports most likely to experience air traffic ground delay program and they do a phenomenal job quarterbacking the entire operation and quickly recovering after air traffic control or weather events. I know some of the investors on this call are really more interested in what I\u2019m going to talk about on revenue, intended to discount operational performance, but great operations are the foundation that a great financial airline is built on. First, over time we will win more customers by being the best operationally. And even in the short term, our CASM performance is much better when we run a good airline as evidenced this quarter by our strong CASM results. So thanks once again to the entire United team and to the operations and leadership led by Greg, who is here in the room with us today.", "Turning down to the revenue environment, demand was solid, we performed in line with our passenger unit revenue forecast during the quarter, despite softer than expected demand in the Pacific and despite higher year-over-year completion factor. Kudos also to the cargo team for a 22% increase in revenue in the quarter, with an assist to the operations because one of the keys to winning cargo business is running a good operation and delivering that cargo on time. Our consolidated PRASM was 2.1% higher year-over-year for the quarter, just above the midpoint of our guidance provided in April. All entities except the Pacific were PRASM positive in each month during the quarter.", "Domestic revenues were 2.4% year-over-year, a very solid result on 5.6% growth in ASMs. Atlantic performance of 3.3% was better than we forecasted, boosted by strong US point of sale and healthy front-cabin demand. Latin PRASM grew 7.8% year-over-year, driven by the timing of Easter and strength in Brazil, Caribbean, and Mexico beach markets, which more than offset weak performance in the Mexico business market. PRASM in the Pacific was weaker than we initially expected and declined 5.5% this year, worsening from the decline in the first quarter. This result was nearly 400 basis points worse than our initial expectations due to softer demand in China and Hong Kong. Looking forward, we anticipate third quarter consolidated PRASM to be about flat. Domestically, we expect PRASM to be also to be about flat given higher industry ASMs and shifts in holiday timing. The domestic market has absorbed our growth well and we\u2019re pleased with the performance of our new summer flying from a revenue, operational, and financial perspective.", "The Atlantic PRASM is also expected to be flat as the demand pattern shifts to European point of sale in July and front-cabin demand is pressed by European vacations in July and August. So that\u2019s being somewhat offset by stronger Europe. The Pacific remains our most challenging region and probably the only region that we\u2019ve seen an actual slowdown in demand. But we are hopeful that a reduction in industry capacity growth by the fourth quarter will help future PRASM results. United capacity growth slowed in the Pacific from 6% in the first half of the year to just under 1 in the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect that retiring our 747 fleet which we\u2019re excited to do, but it will help the second half profitability in the Pacific. Latin PRASM remains a bright spot, but second quarter growth was likely the peak growth rate for PRASM during the year given the Easter tailwind in 2Q. As we get into the back half of the year, comps will start to get a little bit tougher as we lap the start of the Brazil recovery.", "Turning to Slide 8, our capacity outlook for the third quarter is up approximately 4%. As it was in the second quarter, we expect that growth to be biased towards higher domestic with an increase of 5.5% to 6.5%. Our full-year outlook for system capacity growth stayed the same at 2.5% to 3% and is consistent with our guidance from March 15. I think everyone probably knows this, but our capacity guidance is based on scheduled capacity. In the first half of the year, our ASM growth ended up higher than we\u2019d originally expected as a result of higher completion factor. We couldn\u2019t be happier to see that because it means running a really good operation is good for our customers and our investors. If this trend does continue in the second half, our full-year capacity growth will be towards the higher end of the range.", "On Slide 9, we are delivering on our promises from Investor Day, which includes executing on all of our strategic initiatives. In addition to the great progress we\u2019ve made improving the operational integrity of the airline, we\u2019ve rolled out basic economy fares across our mainland US domestic system and we\u2019re pleased with the initial results and operational manifest that come from fewer - having fewer gate checked bags. We continue to optimize our pricing strategies related to basic economy and we remain confident in the $1 billion contribution from segmentation by 2020.", "This summer we added new margin accretive flying in 15 domestic markets and we\u2019ve up gauged five domestic markets from regional to mainland. We're growing faster than any of our major competitors, something that hasn't happened here in a very long time. We're doing this by adding efficient margin accretive flying this summer, 75% of our growth is being driven by gate, with 25% coming from improved fleet utilization. United has unique network opportunities and we are capitalizing on them. Another example of this is our plan to remake several of our hubs, which further improves connectivity in our domestic network. We\u2019ll start with our Houston hub this fall by taking our bank structure from ten to eight. We expect connectivity in this hub will increase dramatically with 50% more connection opportunities in the largest bay on the same number departures per day.", "In 2018, we also plan to rebate our Chicago and Denver hubs. Rebating our hub, up gauging the airline, improving utilization during peak period, and adding [indiscernible] already achieved that's why these are unique opportunities for United. On revenue management, we continue to optimize our yield management posture and we\u2019ll roll out the first phase of the Gemini yield management system in late August with a broad rollout in 2018 consistent with our Investor Day plan. We\u2019re off to a great start on making United the best airline in the world. It's working really well so far and we\u2019re optimistic about our opportunity ahead and our ability to continue to improve absolute and relative margin performance. We run the best large airline operation in the nation in the quarter. And we continue to close the margin gap this quarter as we\u2019ve been doing for the past several quarters. United team is truly doing an outstanding job.", "With that I'll turn it over to Andrew to review the financial results.", "Andrew Levy", "Thanks Scott. Yesterday afternoon we released our second quarter 2017 earnings and our third quarter investor update. I'll discuss both our results and outlook at a high level, but please refer to those documents for additional detail. Slide 11 is the summary of our GAAP financials and Slide 12 shows our non-GAAP results. Adjusted earnings per share increased 5.4% to $2.75 and we reported pretax income of $1.3 billion which represented 13.2% pretax margin excluding special charges. ", "Turning to Slide 14, nonfuel unit costs increased 3.1% on a year-over-year basis, which is better than our initial forecast of up 4% to 5% mostly due to improved operational performance, higher ASM growth, sustained cost reduction efforts and timing of certain expenses. We expect third quarter CASM x to be higher year-over-year by 2% to 3% and our projected full year 2017 CASM x increase remains unchanged between 2.5% and 3.5%.", "Turning to Slide 15, we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of unrestricted liquidity which includes of $2 billion untapped revolver. We are comfortably in excess of our stated liquidity target range of $5 billion to $6 billion. During the second quarter, we generated $1.6 billion dollars of operating and $314 million of free cash flow. We also contributed $160 million to our pension plans and continue to forecast a total contribution of $400 million in the full year of 2017. During the quarter, we repurchased $422 million of our share at an average price for $74 bringing our repurchases in the first half of 2017 to $735 million at an average price of $72 a share. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.1 billion remaining in repurchase authority.", "Turning to Slide 16, full-year 2017 CapEx is now projected to be between $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion which is $400 million higher at the midpoint than our prior guidance. The slide provided some details for this increase which includes higher non-aircraft CapEx, more free delivery deposits and used aircraft transaction. Let me give you a little bit of color on each of these categories. We will invest between $200 million and $300 million more than forecasted earlier this year in IT, ground service equipment, facilities and other critical areas of our business. Technology projects are the biggest area of non-aircraft CapEx and we are increasing investment in our digital platforms, applications development and strengthening our technology infrastructure.", "On the fleet side, there are two buckets driving higher CapEx. First $50 million more in PDPs, represent the net impact from a number of changes to our new aircraft order book. The deferral of the first four A350 aircraft out of 2018 to later periods is accounted for in our new projection. Please note that today we will have no further updates to provide about our A350 order. Second, $150 million is related to the purchase of 21 narrowbody aircraft off lease. These include 737NGs, A320 Series aircraft and 757s which have an average age of 21 years. We expect to reliably operate these aircraft for many years to come. The acquisition of used aircraft will be difficult to forecast since these transactions will most often times be opportunistic. We expect this will continue to be an important part of our fleet strategy and we\u2019ll effectively reduce average fleet CapEx.", "We continue to expect 2017 to the high watermark for CapEx and expect 2018 CapEx to be approximately $1 billion lower. We will provide a more refined 2018 forecast later this year. Lastly, Slide 17 as the summary of our current guidance including third quarter\u2019s projected fuel price range using the July 13 curve. The range provided for capacity, revenue and costs imply a third quarter pretax margin of between 12.5% and 14.5%. In conclusion, we are pleased with the results in the first half of 2017 and remain confident in our ability to continue to drive earnings improvement. We are managing the business to maximize margins and are focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders.", "With that, I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining the call today. And I will now turn it back to Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz", "Thanks, Andrew. And again, one just quick last shout out to the energy and enthusiasm of our employees who made such a strong quarter possible. And so with that let\u2019s turn it back over to Julie and we\u2019re happy to take your questions.", "Julie Stewart", "Thank you Oscar. First we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if need one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you Julie, and the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And from Wolfe Research we have Hunter Keay in the line. Please go ahead.", "Hunter Keay", "So Scott, you said that Denver is your most profitable hub, obviously it looks like Frontier has announced a pretty big growth push there with the - I think they\u2019ve called it natural share. I\u2019d be curious to have sort of your early take away of what that means for you guys there and if you care to talk about how you might deploy basic economy that means just fee, that is just sort of the first sort of like production test of that product or just any broad thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you.", "Scott Kirby", "Sure, thanks Hunter. In the near to medium term, anytime we have capacity growth from anyone but particular a low cost carrier it\u2019s going to lead to some pricing pressure. Over the longer term however I view this really having watched the ULCC growth over the last decade this is the best news that I\u2019ve heard in the last ten years. I have known and look, what they said is, they\u2019re going to run a connecting hub-and-spoke network in Denver. The model that they used to have which led them to bankruptcy, but they\u2019re pivoting from what has been the most successful models, point to point ULCC strategy around the world to going back to trying to copy what the network carriers do and run it connecting business model.", "And the reason I view that is that best thing that has happened in the last decade is because I believe for many years that the ULCC business model can\u2019t work when a network carrier decides to compete on price and particularly once we\u2019ve been able to roll out based economy. And while I believe that for a long time this is the first I guess public validation that one of the ULCCs is throwing in the towel on the point-to-point business model and switching to a network model. And look that\u2019s a lot more complicated. It's one thing to run a point-to-point network, but when you're trying to run connecting traffic, you got to slow down the aircraft utilization because you got to wait for passengers and employees to connect and airplanes to be timed correctly.", "You got to staff up, because you have peaks and valleys, you got to connect bags, which is one of the most operationally difficult thing we do. Today if Frontier has a flight from Orlando to Denver and it\u2019s delayed by two hours, all they have to do is run the flight two hours, but the customers still get there and it\u2019s not a good experience, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. Tomorrow when they\u2019d have half the people in that airplane that are connecting, if that flight is two hours late, their choice and they got one flight a day to all these markets, do we delay everything else for the rest of the day by two hours or do we have half the people on that airplane go to a hotel and spend the night or do we buy [indiscernible] half of the people in that airplane tickets on United to get them to their destination that day.", "It is exponentially more complex to run a connecting model. And for Frontier to publically acknowledge that the old business model has run out of growth opportunities in the middle of an IPO process I just view as a phenomenal validation of everything we've done has worked and our ability to compete and win against them. And I can promise you they\u2019re not competing on our turf and trying to get a network carrier in Denver, that is a battle I guarantee United will win.", "Hunter Keay", "Thank you for that thorough answer Scott, I appreciate it. A question for either you or Andrew, I suppose on this whole zero based budgeting concept. I think you know there's some success and there's some failure - stories of failure out there around that concept. I think like Heinz for example one of the worst places where it didn't work like that was supposed to. So it\u2019s not always the slam dunk. Can you talk to me about sort of lessons learned that you have seen from your own experience with it, what maybe you've learned from other industries and if it works does this represent incremental cost upsides to what you laid out at the Analyst Day or is that considered as a long-term guide? Thank you.", "Andrew Levy", "Sure, again hey Hunter, I think what you're alluding to is the fact that we're going to - we're starting a, we\u2019re calling it a bottoms up budgeting process as we get ready to budget 2018. Look, I view this really simply as a way to understand the business at a greater depth of detail instead of just simply looking at changes year-over-year in terms of expenditures. We need to revisit the expenditures that we spend the year and make sure that everything we're spending money on continues to make sense. So it\u2019s a big of a mind shift and it's a bit of a just a change in the way of thinking about the business. We're not approaching this with any particular cost savings target in mind. ", "But I do believe that in scrutinizing our cost at a higher degree of detail throughout the organization that we will in fact find opportunities to save money along the way. But this is a journey, it\u2019s going to take time and it's a different way of going through the budgeting process. So unlike Heinz or some of the other examples, where perhaps the goals were more short-term oriented and removing cost from the business, I think that will just simply be an output overtime as we get more proficient looking at our cost base and that process is going to start this fall. Actually we've already started that process now, so.", "Oscar Munoz", "And Hunter, this is Oscar. With regards to experience in other industries and I\u2019ve done it in telecom, I\u2019ve done it in railroads, I\u2019ve done in soft drinks. I just think it as Andrew outlined, this is a normal process that companies go through and now that we're running better, we\u2019ve always talked about taking out some of the safety cushion in operations is one area. So we are very cognizant of both the great trust we\u2019ve built with our employees and with our customers and we're not going to be silly about a cost structure there and just about making sure we do normal things that businesses do. So we\u2019re excited about that possibility that Andrew will lead.", "Operator", "From Bank of America we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Didora", "Scott, you mentioned, it\u2019s in the slide deck and in your prepared remarks that the new summer capacity in efficient and performing well. Are there any metrics that you can provide to help us understand this because I think the point gets lost a bit given that that 3Q PRASM and margin guide would suggest otherwise.", "Scott Kirby", "Well, I guess I\u2019d start with your back part of that. I don\u2019t think that the pre-3Q PRASM or margin guidance suggest otherwise. And look as we move from -- what I guided really reflecting as we moved from 2Q to 3Q, one, on a sequential basis, there are a bunch of calendar things that are probably a point [indiscernible] just calendar issues. That of course is an industry issues but you know not have a or Easter being in the second quarter, with movement of the Jewish holidays in the third quarter, timing of the Easter, just even the day of the week there is extra Friday in the second quarter, extra Saturday in the third quarter, all those things are a point. ", "And then we also got industry capacity ramping up particularly in the second half of August and into September at the off-peak period and so our guide is really reflecting those things. Our capacity increased, just started, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll come up with some more things to share but only been flying for six to seven weeks it\u2019s a little early to have anything definitive and share with you but I\u2019m sure we can come up with something to talk about more in the future, but look you can just look at this quarter from a margin perspective, we\u2019ll only got one airline to compare to, but at least stripping out the hedge losses, we have in fact [indiscernible]. ", "It\u2019s the fifth straight quarter that we\u2019ve closed the margin gap that\u2019s pretty good track record. And we just feel really good about how well this is going. I\u2019m particularly proud of the ops team because switching from a slow growth or no growth mode to growth is not easy operationally and we've done that. At the same time our team is putting up absolute records in terms of operational performance. So really across the board we're excited about how things have played out so far and very optimistic about the future.", "Andrew Didora", "And just my second question, Andrew, I know our CapEx will be down to $1 billion next year. But I think it still implies a tick-off from your prior $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion guide. Is this just a change in the order book that you've announced over the past few months or is there something else in there to think about in 2018?", "Andrew Levy", "Andrew, it's really nothing to do with the order book. It's really more of an - well, first of all let me start out by saying that we want to give you directionally rough order of magnitude sense of \u201818 versus \u201817. And I think in the comments I made, I did state that we will give you a more refined estimate later this year. But it's just rough order of magnitude I think the main difference is just a higher level of non-aircraft CapEx expenditures, we think that some of the investments that I touched on as far as categories and investment that that will continue next year and that\u2019s our expectations as we sit here right now. So it really doesn't tie into the new order book and I don't expect any changes in the new order book that would affect 2018 CapEx to occur between now and the end of the year.", "Operator", "From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Scott, does the guidance embed continued strength in operational performance or are you assuming that you normalize to something that you perhaps achieved over say a longer period of time versus the second quarter?", "Scott Kirby", "I not only made it explicit to something, either on RASM or CASM about continued operational performance. It\u2019s sort of a continuation of the trends from a RASM perspective. So I guess that would implicitly assume that operations continued to run well. Really doing things on a sequential basis. And from a CASM perspective, I\u2019ll let Andrew talk about anything on CASM.", "Andrew Levy", "I think we made some assumptions about how meetings certain targets would affect profit sharing or operational bonuses that are based on meeting certain targets. We do expect to continue to operate the airline at a similar high level that we\u2019ve been as far as estimating a higher completion factor. We really haven't taken that into account on a go forward basis.", "Darryl Genovesi", "And any rough thoughts towards your 2018 capacity plan at this point?", "Scott Kirby", "Not yet.", "Darryl Genovesi", "I mean have you filled out all of the catchment area flying, the stuff that you weren\u2019t already serving that you\u2019ve added this year. Would you say that process is largely complete?", "Scott Kirby", "No, but you shouldn\u2019t try read anything into that about 2018 capacity.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank we have Mike Linenberg. Please go ahead.", "Mike Linenberg", "I just have a couple of fleet questions here. The four A350s, does that represent 100% of your A350 deliveries in \u201918?", "Scott Kirby", "Yes, it does Mike.", "Mike Linenberg", "And then just, the dozen MAX aircraft that are being accelerated into 2019, are those MAX 8. And then, if they are, are those types of airplanes in a two class or two plus class, with those airplanes makes sense Transatlantic for you.", "Andrew Levy", "Mike, let me handle the first part and then maybe Andrew or Scott can talk about the network use of that. First of all, their MAX 9 aircraft, so they are not 8s. [indiscernible] but those MAX 9 aircraft and those 12 aircraft as you recall we deferred 65, well we deferred 61 737-700 airplanes that was about a year ago, we did that less than a year ago. Four of the 65 became 800s, 737-800s which we\u2019re delivering this year. And the balance of the 61 positions had been kind of put out there in the future - in different way out in the future with Boeing. And what we're doing here is that these 12 aircraft are kind of first 12 of those 61 that we've identified a delivery slot and they\u2019re coming in in 2019 as we indicated in the release. So as far as the suitability of the MAX 8 for Transatlantic, I think Andrew is probably going to take that one.", "Andrew Nocella", "Yeah. I think right now, Mike, we have plenty of 757s in our European configuration that are flying around in the domestic system. So I don\u2019t think we have any rush to move into flying 737s across the Atlantic. But it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to look at for the medium to long term. But it\u2019s not something we plan to do in the short term at all.", "Operator", "From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker", "I just have a couple of questions. One, I think one of the things that you're doing to improve consumer relations has to do and denied boardings and I think, Oscar, you may have mentioned this as well with the program to encourage passengers to change their flights a few days in advance. And I'm kind of wondering how that\u2019s growing the acceptance of it, whether that's driving more, knowing that they won't be bumped, driving more passengers your way.", "Andrew Nocella", "Helane, this is Andrew Nocella. We are working on that pilot that does, what you described, we have not implemented it as yet and I would say it\u2019s a pilot. So it\u2019s really small. This is something that we continue to evaluate. We think it\u2019s a great idea for our customers and for United Airlines. So more to come on this if it becomes something substantial, but at this point, we\u2019ll likely launch the pilot in the next few weeks and the total number of passengers being moved in this pilot, you know, if they so desire to move, will probably be in the neighborhood of 50. So it\u2019s really small scale, but we think it\u2019s a great idea and if it works and our customers appreciate it a lot more to come.", "Helane Becker", "Okay. Great. So we'll look out for that. And then I just have a question on CapEx and IT spend. Airlines were really early adopters of technology and haven't been able to keep pace in part because obviously there were financial issues in the last decade, but I'm kind of wondering as you think about IT spend over the next three or four years, can you just -- of your CapEx budget, should we think about that as being like 10% of the budget? Should we think about it as being a combination of new website, new retail to cut customer outreach in terms of the mobile app and so on as well as system redundancies, so that you don't get caught out with technology issues? Thank you.", "Andrew Levy", "Sure, Helane. Our technology spend, both this year and going forward I think will be all of the above, everything you mentioned. It\u2019s application development, both customer facing as well as operationally beneficial applications, its infrastructure investments, including disaster recovery. That\u2019s a big part of our spend this year. It is bringing in automation in parts of the business where we\u2019ve had very little of that, including for instance, in our warehouses. We have a project this year we launched where we\u2019re going to start to automate our warehouse, our warehouses in terms of our spare parts inventory. ", "And there, I think you\u2019re right, there is a big opportunity to bring technology into the business and allow us to increase our efficiency as a result of taking advantage of that opportunity. I think you\u2019re also right that there are many, many years where we didn\u2019t have the balance sheet or the wherewithal to be able to make these types of investments and we\u2019re fortunate to be in a position where we can change that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and that is, in large measure, why we\u2019re spending more money this year in non-aircraft CapEx projects. As far as the pace of spend, I would assume it will probably be -- probably about a third of aircraft or non-aircraft CapEx will be in the IT arena, as far as capital expenditures, obviously more of it hits the OpEx line.", "Operator", "From Citi, we have Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Crissey", "Maybe Scott, could you talk about corporate, whether it be share or performance relative to leisure in general.", "Scott Kirby", "Corporate was strong in this quarter with quarter that was \u2013 it was up 6%, our corporate business. That\u2019s not the best metric, I mean, I\u2019ll give it to you, but we can always make corporate going up by just signing more corporate accounts, but we also need the quality of our corporate accounts, but business demand is, I think, certainly, internationally stronger than leisure demand, but corporate demand was strong throughout the quarter.", "Operator", "From Raymond James, we have Savanthi Syth. Please go ahead.", "Savanthi Syth", "Scott, maybe I can ask you, again, just how should we think about when you start to see the benefits to PRASM from three items. Like one is the kind of the increased amount of market presence. The second one is the basic economy which you just rolled out and then eventually, this Gemini rollout in late August, like when should we think of that showing up in unit revenue or maybe your unit revenue doesn\u2019t perform in line with what you would expect, given comps or capacity?", "Scott Kirby", "So I\u2019ll make one overarching point that our initiatives, the initiatives you talked about, some of those are, like Gemini is rather specific, but many of those are about margin. And you\u2019re already seeing that, besides the second quarter, you\u2019re going to continue to see it going forward. And I think so those are showing up in PRASM performance, I mean if you look at our second quarter, I mean domestically, bringing up one competitor compared to, but given our growth rate, but then given some of the issues in Delta last year, to be that close I think is really good about the result already. ", "On those things, new markets was the first line you mentioned. Those aren\u2019t on day one RASM accretive. You start flying to a new city, takes some time, around, but we typically think of that as about, on a domestic city, 6 to 12 month ramp-up for you to kind of get to full benefit. Gemini, [indiscernible], we already have some yield management benefits, but they\u2019re not really in the system. I think they really just started in the first quarter this year. On the system, we\u2019re going to have to rollout the first part of the new system in end of August, but I wouldn\u2019t expect meaningful changes to revenue for a little while. And even when we do let out to the full system, those kinds of changes, yield management system, with the kind of changes and sometimes they take one step back to take two steps forward, because you turn off an old system that\u2019s [indiscernible]. ", "That process is going to start in August and in basic economy, we\u2019ve got basic economy rolled out across the system, but we\u2019ve been for the last couple of months, one of our big competitors essentially has it rolled out. They\u2019ve done it in less than 1% of their system and there is a bunch of places that we\u2019ve been uncompetitive from a pricing perspective. We haven\u2019t been -- normally, we worry a lot about pricing competitiveness in the near term, we\u2019ve been willing to be uncompetitive on price in the short term, as we try to get this sorted out for what it\u2019s going to look like for the next 20 years instead of worrying about the next two months. ", "But I think by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have a position where everyone of the big network fares presumably will have rolled out basic economy around their system and at that point, I think basic economy will be more of a tailwind. It\u2019s less of a tailwind right now, because on some of our competitors, the standard, you can get the standard product on our competitors for the same products that we get the basic product on United Airlines. That won\u2019t be the case in the long run, but in the near term, we get benefits from selling up more customers, but I\u2019m sure we lose some share as a result of that as well.", "Savanthi Syth", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And if I may, just really quick. I wonder if there is an update on -- earlier this year, there was an announcement about kind of investing in Avianca, in Avianca Brasil, and kind of deepening the partnerships there. Is there any kind of progress on the investment or any kind of strategic initiatives related to that?", "Scott Kirby", "There is lots of progress, but none of them which we can talk about on the call today. We are fitting in to work with partners and we appreciate the, all of our Latin American partnerships and we hope to be able to have something to announce in the not-too-distant future.", "Operator", "From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Scott, actually a question for you, a higher level one, there have been quite a few developments since your Investor Day last year, can you just talk about some of the pluses and minuses since then that make it easier or harder for you to narrow the margin gap and meet some of the other commitments.", "Scott Kirby", "I\u2019ll give it a shot. We, on the plus side, feel like we\u2019re executing really well on all the initiatives that we talked about. We\u2019ve done more work in yield management than we initially intended. We\u2019ve grown more confident on basic economy, particularly when it rolled out everywhere. We -- the network stuff is a little, some of the rebanking is a little delayed as we got through the operational, making sure we can handle it operationally. As for the plus side, the operation is running better than it ever has in history and as I said earlier on, it\u2019s the thing we\u2019re probably the most proud of that really is a great foundation to build on the rest of the airlines. In the near term, so most of the things are going on plan or a little bit better than plan. ", "In the near term, if there has been a headwind, geography is a headwind for us, that has nothing to do with margin gap closure. But for example, in the second quarter, if we just had applied our RASM performance to the Delta geography, that\u2019s what we know right now, our RASM would have been seven-tenths of a point better. I mean that really is, we have big exposure to China and less exposure to domestic. And so with China doing worse, and domestic is doing better, we\u2019re going to underperform on the system private level, not because we\u2019re performing, but just because we have bad geography. Those things ebb and flow, so we don\u2019t really think of those as margin gap one way or another, because one quarter [indiscernible] pretty good about the trajectory that we\u2019re on.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Okay. And then actually Scott on the international front, as we move beyond the next quarter or two and I think you\u2019re kind of alluding to this, where do you think the best opportunity is and how sustainable was some of the flattish PRASM we\u2019ve seen, just given how much we\u2019ve already improved over the last year or two?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, for United, we have more modest growth plans internationally. Our international network is fantastic. We are the best international network in the business. I think we have the most, highest profit margins in the business. Latin America is obviously recovering quickly. We\u2019ve added some capacity there. We\u2019re going to start our service. We\u2019ve added a little bit in Europe. Obviously, Asia is the most challenged. I suspect we\u2019ll continue to grow, but not grow quickly on the international line and our growth will kind of depend on what\u2019s happening geography by geography. So it\u2019s hard to predict this more in advance what Asia is going to be doing two years from now versus what the Americas is going to be doing two years from now. But I would anticipate modest growth at a much lower rate than the domestic growth.", "Operator", "From Stifel, we have Joe DeNardi. Please go ahead.", "Joe DeNardi", "Scott, just given the partnership that you guys have with Chase, I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk to what you guys are seeing in terms of an impact from their rollout of higher reserve card, what that\u2019s meant for your business in terms of spend and card acquisitions and maybe what you\u2019re doing to make sure that the value your card offers consumers remains competitive?", "Scott Kirby", "Look, we\u2019re having an awful lot of discussions with Chase. And we appreciate the partnership with Chase. We\u2019ve gotten more engaged at a high level. So I have now a quarterly meeting with Gordon who runs the card portfolio at Chase and I believe that this should be upside in the future for us. It is one of the areas where we are currently underperforming, both Delta and American is probably a full margin point, it\u2019s not a point and a half, the kind of performance that they\u2019re getting. But this is about partnership and about making, getting to the world that\u2019s a win for Chase and a win for United Airlines. ", "We have done that before, we\u2019re fortunate to have the management sitting next to me, Andrew Nocella who led those efforts at my last airlines and American has got a huge tailwind right now from the deal with the city and they have a great partnership with them. I believe we\u2019re going to get, didn\u2019t happen overnight and I believe we\u2019re going to get there and I believe that Chase is committed to that and that we\u2019re going to get to a win with them. But I\u2019m not sure when we\u2019re going to be able to have the kind of tailwinds that American and Delta have had, but I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll get there, this is one thing that we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time talking about, because we can\u2019t do it alone, but I think the motivation is in the right place with our partners and that we will ultimately get a much better result out of the card, which will be good for United, good for Chase and good for our customers.", "Joe DeNardi", "And then maybe just switching gears a little bit, I think there have been a number of things that have kind of improved the cyclicality of the business, but maybe one thing working against it is this, what seems to be a shift towards more corporate traffic away from leisure. I\u2019m just wondering Scott or Andrew, if you could talk about historically, how, what the share of corporate traffic now is versus ten years ago and what that means for cyclicality?", "Scott Kirby", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatically different. It\u2019s focused on these earnings calls, more than anywhere else. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatically different. If you look at the places where it\u2019s important like across Atlantic, but then you got leisure markets like Hawaii that are gaining more. And so there are puts and takes.", "Andrew Levy", "The only thing I will add is, I think we\u2019re seeing strong premium performance across the globe other than Asia at this point.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Baker", "Well, nice segue from Chase. First question for, that wasn\u2019t deliberate, was it? First question, I know it\u2019s in my wallet. First question for Andrew, look, the third quarter guide, I mean, it\u2019s being met with disappointment by the market. My assumption is that if we set fuel to decide, your 2017 earnings plan is coming in a bit below what the \u201917 plan was last November. My first question is whether or not that is the case, but more importantly assuming the things are coming in a bit below plan, can you point to what adjustments you\u2019ve made in order to potentially get back on track? I mean, two, three, four initiatives that are incremental?", "Andrew Nocella", "Well, Jamie, I guess, we start by maybe that we don\u2019t agree with that view. I don\u2019t think any of us feel that we\u2019re off track in 2017 at all, even if you exclude the fact that fuel is indeed lower than what we thought it would be at the beginning of the year. I think the biggest difference we\u2019ve seen on the revenue side is what\u2019s been discussed already, which is weakness in the Pacific, China specifically, that fleet was not expected. That\u2019s the only thing so far that we\u2019ve seen that is a surprise. On the cost side, everything is progressing as expected. So no, I think we\u2019re kind of hitting on all cylinders and doing everything we thought we\u2019d do.", "Jamie Baker", "Okay. A question for Scott and I guess this builds a little bit on the theme of Savanthi\u2019s question, but I\u2019m curious what the basic economy RASM contribution is as it relates to the third quarter guide for flat domestic RASM. We were assure the basic economy was going to be immediately accretive, at least I think that\u2019s what you said. So I\u2019m wondering if that has proven to be the case, it would suggest that absent basic economy, your domestic RASM would actually be going down and I\u2019m not sure that I understand what that would be?", "Scott Kirby", "So, on basic economy, I do expect it will be RASM accretive and immediately RASM accretive with its competitive product. And we said that exactly in the past, but that would have been the underlying assumption that it was going to be competitive and expected our competitors to get the full workout, but currently, they have taken longer. I still think they\u2019re going to get there, but in the near term, you know, the upside that we get from upsell is offset, it\u2019s impossible for us to make sure, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s offset to a larger, maybe a complete degree by share shift. And so if we\u2019ve been through any of the forecast, it\u2019s probably what our competitors are going to do. We don\u2019t know that. We can\u2019t control that. And we\u2019ll get bigger benefits once we roll that everywhere.", "Operator", "From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. And sorry if it comes off as critical, but we\u2019re trying to be constructive here. So I guess we might disagree because you guys have been talking about a lot of margin accretive capacity additions, economy basic rollout, yield management. Yet, margins sequentially are looking about flat. Your competitors are up a little bit. So when we think about those initiatives that you guys laid out back in November, with 1.8 billion of incremental earnings expected this year, how can investors start to measure when that\u2019s actually going to gain traction when you guys can really start showing some improvement on the profitability of the business?", "Scott Kirby", "Look, I think we\u2019re five quarters in a row of closing the margin gap. Your forward-looking, I guess I am going to assume you\u2019re comparing to one airline, which has given the guidance for the third quarter, which is Delta. And we knew and could have known and everyone could have known all along that the third quarter was likely to be a year-over-year headwind. I mean, Delta that self described, hit the RASM in last year\u2019s third quarter from IT, there are IT meltdowns and related other issues. And so pricing issue at Delta last year, which I don\u2019t know for sure what the number was, I would guess it\u2019s another 50 basis points and so those things are uniquely third quarter year over year comp issues that are nothing about the trend line, nothing about margin gap closure. ", "We\u2019ve had five straight quarters of closing the margin gap and we feel really good about that. That\u2019s a metric you should look at us on. It\u2019s not going to be every quarter. Sometimes, it\u2019s going to be quarter-over-quarter things that happened this year or last year. Sometimes, it\u2019s going to be geographical changes. If China goes gangbusters all of a sudden, we\u2019ll outperform more. If China is bad, that kind of widens the gap. It goes on to the kind of initiatives we talked about at the Investor Day, so we feel really good about what\u2019s happened in the last year and the trajectory going forward.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Okay. I appreciate that Scott. I mean, you guys have these initiatives ramping to 3.2 billion of incremental earnings improvement, I mean, how do we think about those numbers relative to your earnings down here and I get it, that\u2019s -- those were not net of cost inflation and some labor deals, but your investors are looking for that earnings improvement, when should we expect it and I guess just coming back to the earlier question, what are some things that could change in the future if that traction doesn\u2019t develop?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, I think kind of, I guess to answer the question, when we say 3.2 billion of earnings improvement, we\u2019ve been saying compared to what it would have been without the initiatives. That\u2019s not and never said, 3.2 billion compared to whatever the baseline was, 2015 or anything else. And so, things like fuel price changes, things like new labor deals, things like industry revenue conditions change that baseline. It really is about being on a trajectory to close relative margin gap as much as anything. It\u2019s probably the best way to measure those things and absolutely margin gap. And we\u2019ve been doing that and we expect to continue doing that going forward. That\u2019s the best way to measure it though.", "Operator", "From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.", "Duane Pfennigwerth", "Can you talk about the linkage if there is any between planned growth at United and margin expansion for the company, not anything relative, but just getting your margins back to a trajectory of up year over year? I mean obviously, growth makes unit cost look a little bit better and makes employees happy, but what is the point of growing faster than GDP, faster than your peers while your margins are still declining?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, look, it sounds a broken record, but we continue to close the margin gap on each quarter. We did this quarter as well. And yeah, we had big pay increases for our people year-over-year, something we\u2019re really proud of, really happy, something that they deserve. That was the right thing to do. And implicit in your question is somehow growth, I don\u2019t think growth is going to either overcome that and if growth wasn\u2019t overcoming that, it shouldn\u2019t have grown. We were more profitable. We had a higher margin this quarter than we would have absent growth, and so we feel really good about where we are, not sure what\u2019s going to happen with the macro environment from a revenue perspective or from a fuel price perspective, we do know that the big pay increases which were great are in the past and so we\u2019re starting to overlap those things. But we\u2019re still going to be subject to what happens from exactly just macroeconomic stuff.", "Operator", "And our last question from Stephens, we have Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.", "Jack Atkins", "So I guess looking forward for a moment, Scott, in reference to your comment around comps getting more challenging in the back half of the year, and certainly some of the internal revenue initiatives that I think may take a little bit longer to gain traction than initially expected, but given the state of the overall market, would you expect you guys be able to see positive unit revenues in the fourth quarter, given that comps are materially are more difficult in the 4Q versus the 3Q or is the really weakness in Asia and the difficult comparisons going to make that more difficult to see, unless we see a stepup in industry fundamentals?", "Andrew Levy", "Yeah. So look, we\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t have any real data for the fourth quarter. So our forecast can really be no better than yours. You\u2019re right, comps get more difficult, but at the same time, this one point calendar headwind, at least, I don\u2019t actually know for sure what the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays are, but at least the Jewish holiday are a tailwind for the fourth quarter. So the calendar does get better for the fourth quarter and we also know that Southwest growth and Southwest Florida\u2019s domestic, it could be a lot slower in the fourth quarter as they retire all their process. So those are two things that are tailwind and the only thing that I can really think of is incremental, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call headwind, but the cost to yield more difficult. So your guess is as good as mine, how those combination of things balance out.", "Jack Atkins", "And just for a follow-up and it\u2019s kind of going back to the earlier statements around natural share, we can think about sort of the long term capacity growth plans, I guess just conceptually, how do you guys weigh the desire to take back what you view as your natural market share versus the potential for market disruption that that could cause. Clearly, you need to do what\u2019s in the best interest of your company and what you believe to be in the best interest of the company, but in cases where share has been seeded over the years and it could be highly disruptive to gain that back, how do you balance that internally.", "Scott Kirby", "Look, really a network, it\u2019s different than point to point and the kind of growth we\u2019re doing, it hasn\u2019t been either highly disruptive, I don\u2019t think it will be highly disruptive. We\u2019re not going in and trying to start flying from Miami to Milwaukee and competing head to head with someone. We\u2019re growing in our hubs where we can have the majority of the people on the airplane or connecting traffic and connecting revenues and in few places, we\u2019re going back to having just competitive service in a market like New York to Atlanta where our competitor Delta flies mainland and we\u2019ve downgrades, jets and now we\u2019re back to mainland. I don\u2019t view those things as disruptive, they haven\u2019t been disruptive. And I don\u2019t expect them to be. ", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From The Street, we have Ted Reed. Please go ahead.", "Ted Reed", "Thank you. I\u2019d like to ask about the Pacific, Scott. Delta just announced moving to Atlanta, Shanghai. And I just wondered how they\u2019re downsizing in Narita, it affects your overall in Asia?", "Scott Kirby", "I don\u2019t know. I read that announcement. I wasn\u2019t sure whether, although we speculated it was -- Narita Shanghai as you\u2019re confirming that. I don\u2019t think I have anything to -- I just read it before I came in here. So I don\u2019t really have anything to say about it.", "Ted Reed", "But in general, as Narita becomes less important, does that impact you in Asia and in China?", "Andrew Nocella", "Well, I think we have a great operation in Narita. This is Andrew, Ted. How are you doing? I think we have a great operation in Narita. We have a great partner with ANA and I think I\u2019m really optimistic about Japan over the long run. Right now, the Pacific over the short run is troubled process in terms of RASM as we said over and over again. So we\u2019re going to be really careful, particularly in Shanghai and Beijing over the next 12 months in terms of our capacity deployment to make sure we can move those markets in the right trajectory for a positive RASM outlook. But we\u2019re really confident where we are in the Pacific partners and our hubs and we think we have these leading franchises.", "Operator", "From Houston Chronicle, we have Andrea Rumbaugh. Please go ahead.", "Andrea Rumbaugh", "Thanks for taking my question guys. United reported a strong financial and operational quarter, but this can get overshadowed by some of the incidents that have gone viral on social media. And so I just wanted to know how you guys are working to showcase airlines improvement in the era of social media right now?", "Oscar Munoz", "Andrea, it\u2019s Oscar. I think it\u2019s a continuing task. The advent of social media in our space is particularly notable and I think the best thing that we can do and continue to do is to refine our customer service experience models, training and people and move from there. I think you will see something from us in the next quarter or so as we revamp our social media team by how we respond and just we need to be a little more agile. We\u2019re a big large company and sometimes, we are stuck in past and I think we need to evolve forward, so that we can handle those events fairly quickly. Not just from a management of the media, and its imprint, but of the individuals involved and if we can stick to the issues. So I think it\u2019s an important distinction between just managing or spinning an issue versus actually you know preventing it and solving for it.", "Operator", "And from FlightGlobal, we have Edward Russell. Please go ahead.", "Edward Russell", "Yes. I was wondering if you could breakdown your deliveries for 2018, 19 aircraft, could you confirm that and when we take your first Max and your first 787-10?", "Scott Kirby", "Let\u2019s see. The first 787-10 I believe is 2019, at the end of \u201918, so it will be in service in 2019. The first Max is 20 -- well, the first Max 10 is 2020, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re asking about Max 10 or just Max in general.", "Edward Russell", "Just first Max in general?", "Scott Kirby", "2018 is first Max in general. As far as number of deliveries next year, I\u2019m looking at Gerry Laderman here to keep me honest. We may be able to get back to you with an actual number there.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now turn it back to our speakers for concluding remarks.", "Julie Stewart", "Thank you all for joining the call today.

Please go ahead, Julie.", "Julie Stewart", "Thank you, Brandon. Good morning everyone and welcome to United's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and a separate investor update. Additionally this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our web site at ir.united.com.

Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.", "Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor update, copies of which are available on our web site.", "Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Levy. In addition, we have Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart, and Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella in the room to assist with Q&A.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz", "Thank you, Julie. Good morning everyone. Thank you as always for joining us. Yesterday, we reported pre-tax earnings of $1 billion with a pre-tax margin of 10.4%, excluding special charges, as you can see on slide 4. Our earnings per share was $2.22 excluding those special charges. In the third quarter, we repurchased $556 million of stock at an average price of $67 per share, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to about $1.3 billion. Andrew Levy will provide a little more details of the financial results here shortly.", "In the quarter, we certainly faced a number of challenges, including a series of historic storms and natural disasters, coinciding with the usual busy summer travel season. I have to shout out to our employees, they all impressively overcame these challenges, delivering record setting operational performance. Not only did our employees manage to keep our operations moving through these three devastating storms, they really banded together to help one another and take part in one of the largest relief and recovery efforts in United history. So I want to thank all of them, for demonstrating the level of energy and teamwork and morale, that embodies the shared purpose that we have at United.", "As you know, a big driver of this new spirit at United is what we term an energized culture and really increased employee engagement around all areas, but evidenced specifically by this year's operational performance, which has been just simply outstanding. This can also be seen on how our employees are prioritizing and elevating the customer experience, and I want to highlight a few of those on slide 5 that are gaining traction. We continue to improve our mobile tool, such as in the moment care, the app that allows our employees to more quickly and effectively solve customer interruptions, such as the ones faced this quarter from the severe weather. Also to proactively address travel disruptions, we put together a team, dedicated to providing creative solutions to ensure customers reach their final destinations. They are available to all stations worldwide, 24/6, 365 days a year.", "Now evidence of progress on our customer service can be seen at the dramatic decline in the third quarter of our involuntary denied boarding or IDBs, which are down 92% over last year, and we also had a remarkable 28 days this quarter with zero IDBs. And for context prior to this year, United didn't have a single day with zero IDBs.", "Now if you look at the business more broadly, we do feel good about over accomplishing at United, but we also know that we have a long journey and a lot of hard work ahead of us to realize our potential. The third quarter was a challenging environment, probably due to macro events such as the storms I mentioned, as well as things like geopolitical tensions, causing softer demand out of Guam, but we have also made a strategic decision to compete aggressively with ultra low cost carriers, which is essential to the long term health of our business. So today -- earlier, we promised the investment community an update on our 2016 Investor Day initiatives, Scott will do that in a moment. At a high level, our Investor Day initiatives are on track, with the exception of segmentation, where incremental contribution was temporarily offset by broad competitive issues.", "And also, new issues have arisen this year, and our goal is to produce meaningful, absolute and relative margin improvement, that is something that remains steadfast in our focus. And as we continue on this journey, it's critical for us ensuring that we properly prepare for and mitigate the headwinds that we cannot control, which are often many, correct through the ones we can control and we have to be able to distinguish between both of those. And so, we know we can control how we implement our initiatives like basic economy. We know we can control how we control our new revenue management system, and we certainly have control over the pricing mix that we are doing right now with ULCC. And that is what we are doing.", "In addition, we are taking a very-very rigorous approach to reviewing our costs, as we look forward into 2018 beyond our planning process.", "So that's the general update of our quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Scott for some more details.", "Scott Kirby", "Thank you, Oscar, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I am going to take a slightly different approach this quarter. We will start by providing the traditional brief revenue update and spend some time, talking about how the business has evolved over the last year.", "Turning to the revenue environment, our PRASM was 3.7 points lower year-over-year, and this included about a point of storm impact. Domestic unit revenues were weaker than our initial expectations due to the storms. More aggressive ULCC pricing in our hub markets, and temporary share loss during our initial basic economy roll out.", "PRASM performance in the Atlantic and Latin regions was in line with our expectations. The Pacific was a lot weaker than we initially expected and declined more than 10%, due to softer demand in China, Hong Kong and Guam. And while Guam is only around 1.5% of our ASOs, demand to Guam has seen a very sharp decline, and we are scaling back service between Guam and the markets in Asia.", "Looking forward, we anticipate fourth quarter PRASM to be down 1% to 3%. We expect October and November to be close to flat, which obviously implies a large forecast PRASM decline for December. For what it's worth and in some of the analyst reports, that doesn't imply that December will be down exactly minus 6, we'd say close to flat in October and November, doesn't mean it's exactly zero, and the midpoint of our guidance minus 2. There is a lot of rounding in all of those numbers.", "However, our forecast for December really is driven by the calendar, and in fact, the Christmas outbound starts a lot later this year. A lot of schools, including my own kid, don't get out until December 22nd. That means two things, first, the off peak period between thanksgiving and Christmas, which is the lowest RASM period of the year, that extended by a week. And second, much of the holiday return is pushed into January. So a lot of uncertainty around our December forecast, but our forecast PRASM decline really isn't about anything systemic, it's just the vagaries of the calendar.", "Now I'd take a step back and look at 2017, which has been a difficult year for United. We started the year focused on several key areas, improving the operations, which includes improving the culture for our employees and customers, rebuilding our network in a profit maximizing way, and executing on our Investor Day initiatives, as we work towards our goal of improving absolute and relevant margins.", "Turning to slide 9, our operations team continues to do a truly phenomenal job. This quarter was a great example and despite experiencing some devastating storms, our team and all the employees of United were able to rally together, keep the operation moving and deliver top tier operational performance.", "As challenging as the recovery efforts were, we continue to set new company records in the operation. We managed to set the best ever third quarter consolidated departures within zero, with the month of September having the best ever month in a consolidated D0. We also set a record for the best ever Star D0, which is the first flight to depart beginning of the day, and they set the stage for success throughout the day.", "Following second quarter's industry leading departure performance, third quarter D0 was second best in the industry among our peers. This type of operational performance is really outstanding, particularly given the four day closure at our Houston Hub. We have the lowest rate of consolidated airport operations and flight operations delays ever. These records show how committed we are to making United the best in class airline and how resilient our operation has become.", "A big driver of our operational improvement is the energized culture and increased employee engagement that Oscar talked about earlier. Operational performance is evidence that our employees are prioritizing, elevating the customer experience.", "On the network, we put some key faces -- some new faces and few leadership positions, and are really just getting started on our network improvement. Consistent with what we outlined this Investor Day, our top priority in the network is to strengthen our hub. We started over the summer by improving the competitiveness of our product and schedule, in October, later this month, we will re-bank Houston Hub, and in 2018 we expect to re-bank Chicago and Denver.", "Lastly, on Investor Day, all our initiatives are duly performing as expected, with the exception of segmentation, due to temporary competitive headwinds from the basic economy rollout. Our basic economy roll-out will dwell operationally, but from a revenue perspective, it started out right. Now that we are competing with similar projects from our large competitors, we are hopeful, segmentation will start to contribute, as we originally thought it would.", "We are in the early stages of our revenue management improvements, and we are encouraged by the initial results. We continue to optimize our yield management posture in our new system, which is called Gemini, is rolling out to plan. Initial results in test markets are encouraging, showing large improvements in forecast accuracy and a 1% projected improvement in RASM.", "Internally, we have a lot of work left to do on the yield management system, but I am really proud of the team, and look forward to doing a full deployment in 2018.", "Despite the momentum in these initiatives, as you can see in our results, they have been offset. Higher costs from labor and fuel, combined with revenue headwinds in the second half of the year, more than offset the value of our initiatives in 2017. Some of those headwinds we have talked about, include ULCT pricing, which is a strategic decision that we know is the right long term decision for United, as well as exogenous events like an unprecedented series of storms, softer demand in China, Hong Kong and tensions around Guam.", "In summary, we feel really good about things in our control. Many of our initiatives are long-tailed and we are headed in the right direction. As Andrew will mention shortly, we are also taking a very hard look at our cost base, which is an important driver of our ability to improve margins going forward.", "Turning around the operation, driving cultural change and improving our networking product and improving the customer experience, are all things that are important to our ability to build a great airline. While there have been some bumps in the road in 2017, we are on our path to achieve our financial goal, and we will work to navigate through unforeseen challenges along the way.", "I will turn it over to Andrew now for the financial results.", "Andrew Levy", "Thanks Scott. Yesterday afternoon, we released our third quarter 2017 earnings and our fourth quarter investor update. I will discuss both our results and outlook at a high level, and please refer to those documents for additional detail.", "Slide 12 is a summary of our GAAP financials and slide 13, shows our non-GAAP results. We reported earnings per share of $2.22, excluding special charges and pre-tax income of $1 billion, which represented a 10.4% pre-tax margin excluding special charges.", "Turning to slide 15, non-fuel unit costs increased 2.6% on a year-over-year basis, which was at the better end of our September 6 updated guidance, mostly due to the timing of certain maintenance events that will appear in the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter non-fuel CASM mix to be higher year-over-year by 2.5% to 3.5%, which brings projected full year 2017 non-fuel CASM mix to the high end of our prior guidance of between 2.5% to 3.5%. There are four principal drivers that have changed, since we issued that range.", "First is Harvey, where we continue to incur many costs including some additional costs, extraordinary costs, despite lost ASMs. Second is at our maintenance operation, where we experienced more high cost maintenance visits than we had forecast earlier this year. Third, is higher depreciation and amortization expense, which is mostly driven by changes made to our depreciable life assumptions for our fleet, to ensure consistency across some fleets, and changes to salvage values. It is also higher, because we continue to purchase aircraft off-lease, which has driven higher D&A expense, with the future offset in rent savings. Lastly, we had additional expense associated with new regional flying that started in September. While this additional 50 seat flying comes with additional ASM expense, it does enable us to execute our strategy of increasing [indiscernible] flying to smaller cities, from places like Chicago.", "We understand how critical cost control is to 2018 and the team is doing a ton of work to identify opportunities to improve cost performance, as part of the budgeting process. These range from flying the network in more cost efficient ways to reevaluating why we spend money in certain areas that have always been that way. At the same time, we know there are some headwinds in 2018. While we don't have the same pressure from new labor contracts that we had in 2016 and 2017, we do face some headwinds, such as a higher mix of 50 seat flying, rising medical and dental costs, higher pension expense and rising airport rates and charges, all of which we are working to overcome.", "Turning to slide 16, we ended the third quarter with $6.3 billion of unrestricted liquidity, which includes our $2 billion of untapped revolver. We are comfortable in excess of our stated liquidity target range of $5 billion to $6 billion and our balance sheet remains strong.", "During the quarter, we raised $400 million of unsecured debt, at an interest rate of 4.25%. We also contributed $160 million to our pension plans and that brings us to our expected contribution of $400 million for full year 2017.", "Turning to slide 17; during the quarter, we repurchased $556 million of our shares at an average price of just over $67, bringing our year-to-date repurchases through the third quarter of 2017 to $1.3 billion. Cumulatively, since we began repurchasing shares in the third quarter of 2014, we have invested $5.4 billion to buy back our stock, retiring 26% of our shares outstanding. As of the end of the quarter, we have $553 million remaining of repurchase authority. For 2017, we continue to expect adjusted capital expenditures to be between $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion.", "As we announced in early September, during the quarter, we finalized negotiations for our A350 order. We are pleased to have reached a great outcome for United-Airbus and [indiscernible]. There are three key changes; first, on timing. We have deferred deliveries by four years to begin in late 2022, and they will continue through 2027. Second, we will take the A350-900 instead of the larger A350-1000 variant. Third, we added 10 aircraft for a total order size of 45 aircraft. The delivery timing, model type and order size are all a better fit for our future wide body fleet needs, that allow these aircraft to have used for either growth or for a potential replacement for 777-200ER aircraft, as this subfleet will begin to approach retirement age, around the same time you start taking delivery of the A350s. Finally during the quarter, we finalized agreements to take two additional A320s in 2017 sourced from the used market.", "Slide 18 is a summary of our current guidance, including fourth quarter's projected fuel price range, using the October 12 curve. The range provided for capacity, revenue and costs imply a fourth quarter pre-tax margin between 3% and 5%.", "Looking forward, cost control is an integral component of our path to margin improvement, and as I mentioned earlier, we are in the middle of our 2018 budgeting process and taking a very rigorous approach to stem future cost inflation.", "With that, I will turn it back to Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz", "Thank you. I just want to thank once again to our employees, our customers, and certainly our investors. I think as Scott mentioned, there have been some bumps in the road in 2017, but we are on a path to achieve our financial goals, and we will work hard to navigate through any unforeseen challenges that come along the way. But at the end of the day, we are excited about our path forward, and just try to reward all of you along the way.", "So with that, let me turn it over to Julie and we are happy to take your questions.", "Julie Stewart", "Thank you, Oscar. First, we will take questions from the analyst community. Then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question, and if needed, one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And from Buckingham, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.", "Dan McKenzie", "Hey, good morning guys. Thanks. Scott, I guess the first question really is for you. There is a lot of noise in the revenue trend for the third and fourth quarter, which makes it a little hard to think about core underlying revenue trends. And so, if we just go back and strip out acts of mother nature and other idiosyncratic stuff, how are you thinking about the true core steady state revenue trends sequentially? Are they getting better, worse or going sideways?", "Oscar Munoz", "Yeah, I agree. Dan, it's really hard to strip out. There is so much that happened in third quarter this year, with the stuff that's happening in the fourth quarter this year, and stuff that happened last year in H1. So I think that the core trends are largely the same. The third quarter wasn't as bad as it appeared, is mostly what that means, and as you go into the fourth quarter, it's more representative of what the real demand trend is. The one thing that I think is improving, at least for United in particular, is we had in late of July, a huge change in the pricing philosophy at one of our ultra low-cost carrier competitors, that was a big shock to the system. Where walk-up fares wound up going down over the course of a week or two by 80% or 90%, and that takes little time to adjust to. While fares remain at those levels, we are better at managing in that environment, I think today, and will be in the fourth quarter than we were before.", "But if you sort through all the bad stuff that happened; I think, that the fourth quarter is a little bit better than the third quarter, even on core underlying trends. Mostly due to the changes we have made in being able to manage better, and the pricing that has remained consistent with the ULCC, and there is also less industry capacity in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, particularly as Southwest is growing less.", "Dan McKenzie", "I see. Thanks for that. And I guess, if I can go back to the ultra low cost carrier pricing just for a second; I know, at the time of our last earnings call, that was impacting 3% of our revenue. And I think that that stepped up and impacted a bigger percent in the quarter. How has that progressed? Is it still affecting a larger portion of the revenue base than it was at the time of our last earnings call, or how is that -- as we think about that heading into 2018?", "Oscar Munoz", "Yeah, it is. At the last United earnings call, we didn't -- I don't think we talked about Spirit, at least at all, and really didn't think much of it. But of course, the day after their earnings call, fare has been down dramatically, and it continues to go down dramatically. And so it did spread. It has kind of been constant I would say, for the last six to eight weeks, where fares got down to -- walk-up fares as low as $10 and that $10 including the online convenience fee or whatever they call those fees, which are lower than ever seen, and including the time that we were engaged in stuff like this, like my prior employer. But they have been -- they haven't gone up, but they haven't gone down. If you want to get down to $10 at the walk-up fare, there is not much room to go down, particularly when that fare started at $170 two months ago.", "So really not much change. There is a higher percentage of markets that are involved in the really low fares. The percentage build out 17% of our revenue that comes from markets where ULCCs fly, but the amount that is exposed to this kind of pricing -- that's of the domestic system by the way. But the amount that's exposed to this pricing is obviously less than that, it's 100% right now.", "Dan McKenzie", "Okay, thank you. Appreciate that.", "Operator", "From Macquarie Capital, we have Susan Donofrio. Please go ahead.", "Susan Donofrio", "Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted a follow-up on Dan's question, and that is, you talked a little bit about better managing against ULCC pricing. I am just wondering, is that because you are getting more comfortable with some of your new pricing levers, to as far as fine tuning basic economy, and also, your new yield management system? I mean, how can we kind of think about that? Because I am looking at markets, and it definitely looks like you are not as widespread with respect to some of the pricing initiatives?", "Oscar Munoz", "Yeah. There is a whole bunch of things, Susan, that are going on. One, basic economy is a great tool and we have been experimenting with the difference of price between basic economy and standard economy. It's not really the new yield management system yet, but it will be, and we have got some really cool stuff going on that we are experimenting with, that will roll into the new yield management system, that can be particularly targeted in these markets.", "One of the big things that changed is, for us, in this environment is, actually the impact on flow traffic. And so as the fares go down like this, we are selling a lot more local demand on some of these flights, and what happens is, we wind up spilling off connecting revenues. And that takes a little time to adjust to. What we do essentially is, we are going to be selling more seats in the local market, will continue and that maintains that competitive posture in the head-to-head local competitive markets. But we continued our yield management posture on the connecting flows, because essentially we have now fewer seats to sell in some of those connecting flows.", "But there is improvement in the local market with the connecting markets or places we can improve as well. And we have far more data today than we would have had a few years ago, to help us manage this and we also have, as you mentioned, the tools, basic economy, that's a real help. That in the very short term of things, when fares go down by 90% over the course of two weeks, that takes a little time to adjust it, but we are getting a lot more adjusted, as we go forward.", "Susan Donofrio", "Okay, great. Well thank you.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Baker", "Hey, good morning everybody. Scott, a question in the hypothetical, if you are given the chance to renegotiate one contract from scratch, but you were given a choice between the current Chase credit card agreement in the existing alliance contract with Air Canada and Lufthansa. Which would you pick? I am just thinking longer term, which of these two, unless you think there is a third more material option, might afford the greatest amount of potential margin upside, that sort of thing?", "Oscar Munoz", "Yeah, you are trying to box me out. So I will say there is opportunities on both. In dollar value, the larger opportunity, and it's not necessarily renegotiation, but the larger opportunity is absolutely with our credit card partner, Chase. And we are working on that. This is my and Andrew Nocella's third or fourth time through one of these, and also on the people on the Chase side, not their first time going through something like this with a partner. We had great success in the past, getting to win-win situations with our bank partners, and I believe and hope that we will get there with Chase. On both sides, we are seeing all the right things. We are big organizations that don't move -- both big organizations that don't move overnight. That has been true everywhere else that I have been as well. And I think that we will get to, ultimately, a much better result.", "And it is certainly -- it's a great partnership, but it is a disadvantage, as we sit here today compared to our competitors, and one that has a lot of opportunity. We also have opportunity on the Alliance front, and it's not so much about renegotiation of JVs, it's about realizing the potential of the JVs and on that front, all of our partners are engaged and anxious, and we are making real progress, both in South America and across the Atlantic in particular. We today are getting better results in those geographies than we otherwise would, even though we haven't done a new deal, just because we are working much closer together, and we are [indiscernible] to the line and feel good on both of those fronts that we are going to have improvements. The credit card deal is obviously bigger.", "Jamie Baker", "Got it. And the second question, on the topic of 'natural share.' Is it possible to quantify the progress that you have made or that you expect to make by, I don't know, call it summer of next year. Are you going to be half way there, 10%, 90%? And also, does re-banking help contribute to natural share in your model, or is achieving natural share strictly exercising growth? Obviously, I am trying to back in to when your capacity might moderate back to something closer to the industry average?", "Scott Kirby", "So I am not going to be able to give you an answer today on what the ultimate end-game on capacity is. But re-banking does help with natural share -- when we talk about natural share. It means, not just our share at our hub, it actually frankly means more our share and all of the non-hub cities around the country, so at Des Moines or wherever. And winning your share in Des Moines is not about carrying people from Des Moines to Chicago, it's about carrying people from Des Moines to the world. And what we have, a less efficient hub structure in Chicago, when we fly those people to Des Moines and we miss 10 or 15 connecting markets, then we lose out on share in a place like Des Moines, that would just be natural if we had a hub structure that worked better.", "So some of what we are doing to regain that -- a huge part of what we are going to regain natural share, is re-banking the hubs and driving higher levels of connectivity, which will increase your share at a market like Des Moines, without having to increase capacity.", "Jamie Baker", "Makes sense. Thanks a lot Scott, appreciate it.", "Scott Kirby", "Yes", "Operator", "From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Yeah, thank you. So Scott, the 4Q guidance implies full year operating margin of about 9.5% if you adjust for the weather in 3Q. By my math, about 3.5 points to that is from selling miles to chase, so why shouldn't I be worried that at 3% GDP and $50, the core airline business is only earning at a 6% EBIT margin. Does that type of return require different strategy than what you are pursuing right now?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, one, you can't divorce those two things from each other.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Well, to be fair Scott, last quarter, when you said that you are -- you have about 0.5% margin gap versus American because of your deal?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, I am saying you can't divorce those two things from each other, because one of the disadvantages that we have and that Chase has, is that if you are living in Des Moines, Iowa, and you are picking a credit card, and we are the number three player in Des Moines, Iowa, you are more likely to pick one of the other two. And that is not incumbent just on a Chase fix, but on us to help address. So part of winning back natural share is not just about the core airline business, it is also about improving credit card business.", "And I think of those two as fundamentally tied together. It is true that a big part of our earnings, and I am not agreeing necessarily with your numbers. But a big part of our earnings comes from selling miles. But that is a core part of the business, and you can't say strip that out, and then watch your growth fee at the airline. That said, we do think that there is opportunity to improve that part of the business, and it's one of the big areas that we are focused on. We can't do a -- well there are some things that we can do unilaterally. But we are working with our partners, but Chase is by far the biggest, and working with them to get results that look like our competitors. And I think both of us agree, actually both United Airlines and Chase believe that we can do that and that we can get to a world that's good for Chase and good for United Airlines that generates the same kind of results and we are marching towards that. It will not happen overnight, but we are moving in that direction, and I think we will eventually get there.", "Joseph DeNardi", "Okay. Andrew, it looks like you guys recently made some changes to mileage plus award valuations, you had increased the price on some saver awards, added a fee to cancel. It seems like those decisions benefit the airline business, because the miles flow through at a better rate, but they effectively devalue the currency for consumers. So how far can you push that, before people stop signing up for the card, and why shouldn't I be worried that, unless your disclosures improve and the transparency gets better, the marketing company won't continue to subsidize the airlines?", "Andrew Levy", "We have made some changes. We have gone through a dynamic type of pricing environment. But we have been really careful on how we do that, to make sure that our customers still see a great value. And I don't think that has changed here. There were a few price points that went up. But there are not many price points that are actually lower, as they reflect the true availability on particular flights. So I don't think what we did over the last two weeks is going to change the dynamics at all.", "Operator", "From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.", "Michael Linenberg", "Oh yeah. Hey everyone, good morning. Just I guess, two quick ones here. Andrew, you talked about pension expense being a headwind in 2018. How does the expense in 2018 at this point, how does that compare to 2017 and then how does the expense compare to what your anticipated contribution will be in 2018? Do you have a sense on that?", "Andrew Levy", "Yeah Mike, it's about $70 million of inflation that we are expecting at this point in time. Some of that is based on a forecasted discount rate, which we can only forecast at this point or actuaries can only forecast. That will get kind of locked down at the end of the year. So at the moment, a little over half of that is due to forecasted lower discount rate applied, and the balance would be lower mortality and expenses associated with that.", "Michael Linenberg", "And then just the contribution, I guess it was what, $400 million this year. For next year, what should we expect?", "Andrew Levy", "Mike, historically, we are kind of hesitant to give anything on 2018 just yet. But we will certainly talk about $400 million a year, and at this point, I don't see any reason to expect that number will be much different next year. It will depend on a number of factors. I think it's safe to assume, it will be similar to what we did this year.", "Michael Linenberg", "Okay, great. And then just to Scott, the PRASM forecast for the fourth quarter. How much of it is FX? Is there an FX boost in there that we should see?", "Scott Kirby", "It's pretty small, a quarter -- about 25 basis points of tailwind.", "Michael Linenberg", "Okay, great. Thanks Scott.", "Operator", "From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.", "Hunter Keay", "Thanks. Good morning. I think I have two questions for Oscar. Oscar, if we put aside any relative comparisons to your competitors, for your margins to go up next year, with current fuel, your RASM has to be something like 40 or 50 basis points better than your CASM ex-fuel. So I am asking you now, will that happen? And if you want to put that -- answer a different question, would you say United is a RASM or CASM story in 2018, and I would encourage you not to say both?", "Oscar Munoz", "Well I appreciate the encouragement Hunter. I think we are a margin company, as we happen for -- I think focused on that for quite some time. You know, I think it is a good opportunity for us to just discuss the broad advancements that we made as a company, with a strategy and a management team and a focus that, I think, holds for a very bright future.", "I think the interim periods are difficult to discuss, because we are making investments. We are -- I think the way I said it earlier is, we have dug ourselves historically in a little bit of a competitive hole as a company. And in order to get ourselves out of it, we have to do something a little bit extraordinary than others. And so, that's what we are focused on. We are focused on doing that, but at the same time, from a long term perspective, on margin capability.", "So as we head into 2018, one of the reasons we are not talking too much about it, we are deep, deep at work with regards to that. How do we get the kind of growth that has good margin, and how do we get into the bowels [ph] of our cost structure and ensure that we make that. And so it is about the net margin number. And so it's a difficult period for us, as we work through all this information. This team has only been in place really for a year, and we are just getting our mojo working. And again, I think Scott said it from -- with regards to our initiatives are long tailed, and what you see, vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors, is that they have been together as a team and with their focus and their initiatives for quite some time, and they are beginning to see the benefits of that. We just have a little bit more work to do, and we will continue to ask for a little bit more patience. But there is no change with regards to where we think our relative and absolute margin improvement need to be, to compete in this industry.", "Hunter Keay", "Okay. All right. But I think people are really trying to buy into this story, because they believe there is a CASM story here, at least I was. And the excess capacity growth has not translated in a better CASM ex, despite the fact that your ops are better. Higher completion factor drove a lot of the CASMB or the ASMB. And yes there were some onetime items in 1Q, I get that. But how can we have any confidence in the 2018 CASM ex story, particularly given the headwind that you guys went out of your way to lay out on this call? So can you at least may be bracket in like a high end of CASM ex for us, so we have some sense how to think about you guys in this next year?", "Oscar Munoz", "Not today. And trust me, we are not telling you because we don't want to; we are, as Andrew Levy talked about, deep in the middle of this stuff. In fact, I just saw the thick book that was on Scott's desk that I went through briefly yesterday, we are taking a very different approach that Andrew Levy has taken us through, with regards to some of this. And again, we need to ensure that we [indiscernible] through the detail before we probably can tell you anything at this point. So let us keep working through this, I just need a little bit more time. We have always been about proof, not promise, and so right now, it's going to look a little more promising and the proof will come, as we get more into the details of this.", "Hunter Keay", "Thank you.", "Operator", "From Cowen and Company we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.", "Helane Becker", "Thanks operator. I appreciate the time. Hi guys. So here is my two questions; one is, I think, relatively easy question. When you think about Scott, the ultra low cost carriers that you are competing against, are you just talking about domestic or are you including international in there, so that if you look at like Newark-Athens as an example, I think Emirates is in there, and they would be considered a low fare airline, maybe not low cost. So can you parse out what the impact of something like that would be on your business?", "Scott Kirby", "So we have the same approach to all competitors, low cost or not. Emirates is a unique example, we feel really good about our ability to compete with ultra low cost carriers domestically or with the ex-Air Berlin or Norwegian or anyone like that, that has a -- that is not subsidized by the government. Emirates is a completely different story, because they are subsidized by their government. And we can compete, and think we can compete effectively and win against anyone, but we can't compete against governments. So our best approach to competition is the same everywhere we fly, but you have brought up a unique example of a subsidized carrier, that is unfair competition.", "Helane Becker", "But is it -- aren't China Easter and China Southern subsidized as well?", "Scott Kirby", "I don't know. It's really not the same extent, and certainly they are not allowed to do things like fly from Newark to Athens.", "Helane Becker", "Okay, fair enough. Okay, that's great. Okay, I think that was it. One question, one follow-up. Thank you.", "Scott Kirby", "Thank you, Helane.", "Operator", "And from UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Scott, when you rolled out basic economy, you would have been forced to choose some spreads between how you price basic economy and how you price your regular economy product. I would imagine that early on, that spread is somewhat of a guess, and as you gain more experience with this, I mean, I guess, would you expect to be revenue managing that spread over time, and could you envision a scenario where it's much different than it is today?", "Scott Kirby", "Yes, is the short answer, and we are already doing that in a number of markets. So we do think that there is an opportunity there, and we are experimenting with that, as we sit here today.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Okay. And then I guess on some of your longer term initiatives, I think you said the only one that was behind, was the segmentation initiative. I guess, if I looked at the chart that you showed in November, I think you showed about an incremental $1.4 billion from these initiatives ticking in next year. Should we be thinking of that number as still largely representative of your view of how these initiatives sort of play out altogether in total?", "Scott Kirby", "Well, we are trying to get away from being quite that prescriptive. But we do think that we are largely on track with the exception of segmentation, that we are largely on track with those initiatives. It's also important I think to point out that, the Investor Day initiatives, while we felt we went out of our way to say that these are -- versus what would have happened, had we not done them, but that they were not absolute increases compared to the prior year numbers. A lot of people interpreted that in a different way. And what that means is, there are other things that could be headwinds or at least, it could be tailwinds. This year we have more headwinds, things like Asia. I am hopeful that Asia next year, will actually be a tailwind, because those kinds of geography driven issues ebb and flow around the world. But we do believe that we are -- basically, with the exception of segmentation on track or everything that we talked about, timing maybe a little earlier or a little later on different ones, we had some of that this year, although they are largely balanced out, with the exception of segmentation. But we think that we are on track for these initiatives.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Okay. I think that's an interesting perspective about what you just said about, people sort of taking these to meet -- to be something absolute versus something incremental, what you otherwise would have done. If I look at the 2018 consensus, earnings before tax number, it's about $3.1 billion, which is actually below the $3.2 billion that you have in this presentation from initiatives, which you would imply that the three kind of things that you would be breakeven or even at operating at a modest loss, without these initiatives?", "Scott Kirby", "Yeah. You got a bunch of numbers that are kind of apples or oranges that we neither endorse nor don't endorse. So yeah, you did the analysis, but I am not sure I'd agree with the conclusion, because I am not sure I agree with all the input numbers.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Citi, we have Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Crissey", "Hey, thank you for the time. I am going to follow-up on Darryl's because that was essentially the question I was going to go with. If we are not going to use those specific numbers, and I understood. I think we tried to understand at the time that those numbers were relative to what you would have otherwise done. And I think Darryl's point is fair, that given the results and being on track mostly, it implies that the company was going to have some tough times, were it not for these initiatives. What I am hoping to do is, maybe give you guys an opportunity to tell us, reframe this in a different way. Coming and saying we are on track for these initiatives, but don't mind these numbers, doesn't feel right. It feels like you need to like reset expectations, whether it'd be not giving specific numbers for individual initiatives, or somehow saying, resetting a bar here for these initiatives; because I don't think those numbers mean very much to anyone anymore, they seem very optimistic, and there must have been some significant headwinds that we were unaware of.", "So maybe I am hoping for you to give us an opportunity to come up with more specific reason, how are these initiatives going to play out? You got the gist of my question I guess?", "Scott Kirby", "I am not sure I actually do understand the questions, but it sounds like you want to give a new set of numbers that you believe?", "Kevin Crissey", "Well yeah, I mean, those numbers are -- [indiscernible], it's like $1.4 billion between 2017 and 2018, and we will back out segmentation entirely and call it $1 billion. I don't know what $1 billion headwind year-over-year should be there, that we shouldn't be able to attack those on. So if you are on track with these initiatives, why aren't we adding $1 billion? And I don't think that's the right number. So therefore, these numbers are not terribly useful. So what I am looking for is kind of more useful numbers.", "Scott Kirby", "Okay. Look, we are not going to redo the Investor Day numbers on this call today. As I think through what the Investor Day initiatives are, the network initiatives, we feel good about; we are going to redo Houston Banking, a lot of this is about the re-banking structures, we are doing Houston on October 29. Chicago and Denver are going to be a little bit later than we originally planned, just as we work through all the operational stuff on that. The fleeting is going to be a little bit different next year, because we just have changes in the fleet plans with 50 seaters. MileagePlus should go up, we had a hit this year from MileagePlus that was related in the old deal, we are paying back, essentially it's a loan. Not to classify it as a loan, but it was essentially a loan. We are paying back miles at a lower rate, that was pretty straightforward. Should happen. I talked about the revenue management stuff in my opening commentary, we feel pretty good about that, got it delivered, and there is a lot of water that still has to go under the bridge on that. We feel good about that one. And we are doing a lot of work on the cost stuff. I think that we will do well there.", "Headwinds remain, the overall macro environment that applies to everyone. The ULCC environment, and they are talking about some of the cost headwinds. We don't know for sure what the Pacific will do next year. But we kind of walk through each one of those. I am not sure the -- I don't have an exact number to update on today, but on those initiatives, we feel pretty good about, because they bring on those initiatives.", "Oscar Munoz", "And Kevin, this is Oscar, I think you raise a great point, and we understand it completely. And I think the conundrum is, how do we give you a sense of the results of these long tailed initiatives and provide you a little bit better transparency. And so, it's a good point. It is what we are in the middle of today, trying to understand -- not only understand, trying to better understand these issues and how they play out. Given all the things that have changed since we have given those things. So we need to package all that together, and that's what we are doing, as we put together our plan. But again, I just want to make sure, I understand your point completely as of the rest of the team, and thank you for that admonition. Appreciate it.", "Kevin Crissey", "Thanks. Maybe it's for Scott, can you talk about -- I know you are probably not going to give specific capacity guidance for 2018, but how do you think about it and the need to -- how do you think about capacity growth for 2018 overall?", "Scott Kirby", "Look, we are still going through it, and it's driven by a view of what's going to maximize our margin performance. And every day we are just trying to do that. And so we look at anything either additive or subtractive, it's about what the margin of RASM is going to be and what the margin of CASM is going to be.", "Kevin Crissey", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth. Please go ahead.", "Savanthi Syth", "Hey, good morning. Scott, I might have missed this, did you talk about what you expect regional trends to be that's kind of embedded in the 4Q guidance?", "Scott Kirby", "We didn't talk about it, but we -- essentially, there are some onetime things that happened last year, that are going to cause our reported results to differ slightly from what I am going to say. But the core performance is going to be that, Domestic and Atlantic are our two best regions we think and do better. Pacific will probably have the largest improvement, despite the fact that Guam is terrible. For core Pacific, we are at least forecasting it's going to improve. And Latin will continue to be strong, but as it overlaps the recovery and the sharp improvements in RASM last year, on a year-over-year basis, we expect it to be less strong.", "Savanthi Syth", "Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And Andrew, if I might quickly ask you, I know you realized on -- your focus on liquidity targets, but could you share your thinking on, how you think about debt levels and the use of cash here?", "Andrew Levy", "Well, you know Savi, our view on the balance sheet is unchanged. We certainly like to see a higher rating of our debt. But we feel very comfortable with where we are. We have not decided to try for investment grade. We may decide one day, that that is something that's worth doing. But at the moment, we are very comfortable with our debt levels. We are able to raise capital at extremely attractive rates, and we are very comfortable with where we are in the balance sheet, which is taking into account, not just debt levels but also the liquidity and the active capital that we have.", "Savanthi Syth", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Didora", "Hi, good morning everyone. Scott, there is obviously a lot of seasonality in your business, but the pre-tax margins in 4Q and 1Q, that can -- significantly below 2Q and 3Q, yet much more so than some many other airlines out there. Is there anything you are doing or can do to help mitigate this? Has it been something in terms of how you focus new capacity or maybe even the re-banking of the hubs? Or anything that you are doing in order to kind of fix this seasonality?", "Scott Kirby", "Well we are going to have higher seasonality than the others. Driven by the fact that we are a more business oriented airline and we have less exposure to Florida and the Caribbean, which for the less exposure of Florida and the Caribbean, means that our first quarters are relatively weaker. Our seasonality is going to be higher. We are working on -- another thing that we do that's unique, our peaks are higher and our valleys are lower, and should we change those two variables to help with costs. That drives higher CASM at United. But it's easy to say that, and it's harder to go through all the analysis and some work to address it. But I do think over the coming years, you will see us with less variability in our seasonal scheduling, which should be a cost benefit. But we are in the early stages of figuring that out. But we will always have higher seasonality, because we have lower exposure to Florida and the Caribbean.", "Andrew Didora", "Understood. Look I know, in terms of 2018 CASM, you are obviously not prepared to talk about that right now. But just at Investor Day, you did speak about 2018 to 2020 unit cost CAGR of sub-1% on just 1.5% capacity. I would say, you grew much faster than this in 2018. But with the headwinds Andrew that you kind of outlined in your prepared remarks, do you think this CASM outlook that you provided last November is at risk right now?", "Andrew Levy", "So we are just not prepared to talk about 2018. Look, there is a lot that's happened, a lot of changes that have happened since we provided that forecast over a year ago. We are working through it right now, and it's not as simple as you grow more CASM-ex goes down. I mean, on an Excel spreadsheet it does, but there is a lot of inputs. Some of them have nothing to do with, whether you grow fast or not. I mentioned one of them, airport rates. When airport rental rates go up, it doesn't matter how much you fly, you just pay more, and there is a ton of other costs then, some of which do go down when you fly more. As you fly more with aircraft utilization, it drives down your membership cost on a PRASM basis. But there is a ton of inputs. We are going through all that, and we are just not ready to give detailed commentary on 2018 for costs.", "We are in the middle of our budget process, we are going at it in a very-very detailed way in trying to get to the best answer we can get to, that's going to maximize margin for United, and we will comment on that further when we are ready to.", "Oscar Munoz", "This is Oscar again; again I just -- and I know this won't help matters much, but I know everybody is getting scared about the fact that we are not going to give these numbers, because of some ominous reason. I cannot fully express to you, how much in the middle of things that we are. We historically have had a lot of talented people with a lot of experience in this industry, who know their relationships and how they are supposed to work, and we also have a very-very large company, with a lot of places that we are digging into. And so, let us do a little bit more of that work, and when we come out of it, we will be able to sort of provide you some better information around what we are thinking.", "Operator", "Okay. From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Hey, good morning everyone and thank you for taking my question. And look, I try not to be too critical on these things, but I have just heard a lot of conflicting comments today, so I do want to poise my question this way. So Oscar, you have been in the transportation business for quite some time now, you know a lot of the investors here probably more than a decade. And you know that, when you point out public statements about earnings improvement or efficiency targets, people are going to measure you against those. And so, when you put in your slide today, that Investor Day initiatives are generally performing as expected. But then we hear on the call, we don't really want to focus on those numbers. You guys are drawing the focus there and then saying, we shouldn't be focused on it. So I guess, I just want to focus on your comments that, you said on the call, I am focused on absolute and relative earnings performance. When I look at your absolute earnings, they are down more than your competitors. Your relative margin gap is widening, not narrowing, and more importantly for the investors on this call, the stock is now down, call it 20% to 25% versus the market this year.", "So from an investor perspective, what is it that happened this year, that we didn't anticipate at the Investor Day last year? We knew a lot of the labor costs are going to be here? And what is going to incrementally drive positive change for your shareholders, where we can start to address some of these absolute and relative gaps? And can you commit to driving higher margins in 2018, barring some sort of change in the macro?", "Oscar Munoz", "Hey Brandon. Again, the things that I have changed, I think we have noted and discussed, A. B, it's hard to prove to you how well some of our initiatives have worked. The fact that they are working, and the headwinds have been significant. The inconsistencies that I think you are picking up, are just a function of time and structure. We are in the middle of planning process. It is a quarter that we just had and a quarter that follows, and we are really getting to the bottom of all these things. So I wish I had more information to share with you at this point. We are committed to the things that we've said, the absolute relative margin growth. It's just in this interim period, we are having some difficulties explaining this to you clearly, and we get that. That is still a little bit more work, and as we get better clarity on the things that we are doing, we will do what's required to make sure that we regain the trust. But more importantly, beyond the communication and quarterly update, I think the execution of all these initiatives is something we have to continue to focus on. And so, I appreciate your concern and your pointed question and appreciate your sentiment. And we will just move forward.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Well if you don't mind, I just want to follow-up; because you did mention you are going to control what you can. And in your opening comments, I think you mentioned revenue management, your role of economy basic, mention of the fair structure of ULCCs. But notably absent from that -- and now listen, I live in an Excel spreadsheet, right? I don't run errands, I am not trying to say, I know better than you guys. But at a simplistic level, we see domestic revenue growing, let's call it 4% this year. You guys chose to grow your capacity, let's call it 5%. From our perspective, we'd say that's going to be dilutive growth. So why was not capacity part of that discussion of what you can control, and is that something you are looking towards in 2018, to maybe rethink it?", "Oscar Munoz", "It's not. We have dug ourselves in a hole, from a competitive perspective, and the team that we got in together here, is about regaining that competitive advantage, and we have that focus on margin, but at the end of the day, we feel that the moves we made in the marketplace are creating a more positive potential for revenue increases in the future. And so it is a focus of ours and it's one that we are committed to.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Analyst and Investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions]. From Bloomberg, we have Michael Sasso. Please go ahead.", "Michael Sasso", "Hey, good morning. I will open and this is up to whoever wants to take it. I have been interested in the Polaris international cabin. There has been a lot of blog posts in the last few weeks, suggesting that you are delayed in your lounges. At least, there was some delay early on with seats. It has been really hard from my perspective to kind of assess how it's doing. I have not seen much guidance or input into whether it's helping you win over customers on these international routes. Can you just talk about one, how is it -- one, did you maybe announce this too early, there is some sense that maybe people are confused, why can't they see it? Should you have been a little -- been more restrictive or whatever in how you went about announcing this? And number two, just give us a sense, how is it doing? Is it winning over any customers?", "Andrew Nocella", "Sure, this is Andrew Nocella. The way I'd describe it is, first of all, whenever you change out -- see employers, there are many -- owner/suppliers that sees one of the -- for an airline the size of United, it takes a number of years. So the airline announced the new seat and has launched it, and by all of our measurements, where we are flying, it's doing very well. We are serving our customers all the time about the time about the cabin, comfort, their overall experience and all those things are going really well onboard our 777-300s and we just got our first 767 out there. We'd like it to go much faster, and we are looking at ways to do that all the time. But when there is hundreds of aircraft involved, it's just going to take a few years to roll out, and we are well on our way, at this point.", "But we also remember, there is many other components to Polaris. There is a new refined food offering, there is new amenities, blankets, and all of those things are available on all United Intercontinental flights, and are being well received by our customers. So we are well along the way. We'd like to go faster. But the feedback we have gotten in two days, I think has been fantastic, about the seat we have put on board and the changes we have made, and you will look for more and more of it over time, as we get more aircraft converted to include the seat, as well as all the other Polaris experiences.", "Michael Sasso", "And then, is there any -- how would we know, how it's doing? I mean, I guess it wouldn't be broken, I am sure it would be broken out and the results or whatever. But is there -- how could observers tell how it's doing financially, and if it's helping you financially?", "Andrew Nocella", "Yeah. We wouldn't release that type of individual data. And you are talking about, at this point, a small number of flights across the global system, it would be hard to -- even internally for United to estimate how one or two routes are doing, relative to the whole system. So that's something we wouldn't release. But look, we serve our customers all the time, and we are trying to understand what they like about the service, and we have made incredible headway. And our performance on those aircraft that have the Polaris seat as well as the overall Polaris experience is better than the experience on an aircraft that don't. So we know we are moving in the right direction.", "Operator", "From The Street, we have Ted Reed. Please go ahead.", "Ted Reed", "Thank you. I'd like to ask Scott a couple of questions about the ultra low cost carriers. Mainly, in the current quarter, are they doing anything different or are you going to do stuff differently? And also, I'd just like you to explain to me a little bit, the impact on connecting traffic?", "Scott Kirby", "So not much has changed in the last six to eight weeks in the ultra low cost carriers, and I don't know if things will change going forward. The impact on connecting traffic is, if we are flying between Chicago and Fort Lauderdale, and they are now lower fare. We carry more local traffic between Chicago and Fort Lauderdale. That means, we have fewer seats available to carry from Fort Lauderdale to Des Moines, actually, because we are more likely to be sold out in the local market, because we sold more seats in the local market. So that's how we have changed our yield management posture, with regard to connecting revenues, recognizing that essentially there are fewer seats available for connecting traffic than there were before.", "Ted Reed", "Thanks. And last thing, what are the hubs where they have the most impact?", "Scott Kirby", "We have probably the most flights in Chicago, it's number one for us.", "Ted Reed", "All right. Thank you, Scott.", "Scott Kirby", "Yes.", "Julie Stewart", "All right. Thank you all for joining the call today. Please contact media relations, if you have any further questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

In addition to cellphones, there is a phone located in the back of the room as well, 99 for an outside line and then 911 in case of an emergency.

Information in the following slides do contain forward-looking statements. In fact, that's the primary purpose of tonight. With that said, I encourage all of you to read the legally required disclosure on the screen. Joining us tonight are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Levy. ", "With that, I'm going to hand it off to Oscar.", "Oscar Munoz", "Thank you. Thank you, sir. And welcome Mikey. It\u2019s great to have him here. It\u2019s a great addition to the family and I think with Julie Stewart who's moved over to be my Chief of Staff, it's nice we have a buy side and a sell side perspective on the company. I think that sort of underscores our focus on the importance of you as investors as well as our many other constituents. ", "We're doing something a little different today. We're going to have our fourth quarter sort of call very briefly and then go into this thing, we call, an investor update. I think it gives us a little more time to have more conversation and clarity about some of the things that we're doing. And I think as Mike said two or three times, transparency, accountability, all those wonderful words that get tossed around. I think you\u2019re going to see lots of that more than you've seen certainly from us and maybe some \u2013 from people in the industry.", "Importantly, the E team is here, our executive team. All of you at the reception to get to know them a little better for those of you who don't know, if you have problems with the WiFi in particular and there's Linda. But there's actually a few of our young folks from both finance and commercial. [indiscernible]. There's Tom Doxey and Jonathan Ireland, which I think most of you kind of know and then from a commercial organization, there is Damien and Ankit [ph]. I hadn\u2019t seen Ankit. Ankit, are you here? He\u2019s stuck in traffic. Some of the people in the room. So I urge you, if you can, get a chance to meet those. Those are, I think, the future leaders of our company to some degree.", "But with that aside, let's talk a little bit about what we're trying to accomplish today. Here's just a quick version of the idea. I'm going to take the quarter ending and a little bit of a sense of where we finished in 2017 from a full year perspective. Then, we're going to get into the meat of the matter. And I think, as always, it'll be a terrific event for everyone. More importantly, we are highly confident of what we've been working on for the last few months and that confidence is going to sort of morph itself into not only guidance for 2018, but also we're going to give advanced EPS guidance into 2020. And so, that's something that you can look forward to over the course of time here.", "The quarter, I\u2019ll be brief, we came in better, both top line and cost in close-in pricing was strong as much of the industry and so that\u2019s certainly helped for us and as you think about some of our regions, China came in strong. Both November and December PRASM was positive. That's a nice inflection point, given the fact that we haven't had that for some time. So, we\u2019re excited about that. We ran and continue to run a great operation and that helps immensely with regards to our cost. We know our cost issues, we know we have structure -- structural issues we have to work through, but I\u2019ll tell you running better is running cheaper and again, our team continued, Greg Hart is here. His team continues to do a great job in that space. ", "And as I think past the quarter in to the full year, I realize we all completely understand that to some degree, 2017 was a bit of a transition year, not without its issues and consequences over the course of time in so many ways. But I don't want to let that cloud what I think really from the foundational perspective is really important as we head into 2018 and beyond. And so, we did do some pretty good things, despite some of the cost headwinds in fuel and some labor issues, labor cost that we had to deal with and so we've returned value to share owners in a significant way when the course of the year and announced an even bigger program moving forward.", "Strategic initiatives and you'll hear infinitely more about this today, had a good beginning and are already starting to bear fruit. I think you're going to get a master class from Scott Kirby with regards to what connectivity, what hub, growth and structure means to us. And I think you\u2019ll see a very strong foundation about what our growth plans, what our CASM plans are about, because I think on CASM and again, fourth quarter was a great momentum builder, we believe that CASM-ex, both from a relative and an absolute perspective, we've finished fairly strong and that's a foundational thing that we're also going to give multi-year commitments on and Andrew Levy will talk about that significantly in his portion of that. ", "But if you allow me just the next couple of charts, I need to talk about our record breaking operational performance over the course of the year. This is fundamentally when you think of customer service, customer engagement, customer involvement and stickiness, this is the primary basic foundational thing that we've been working on. For all of you that have been following us, when I first arrived was about the people, the people who are about getting the business running well and I think that infrastructure, that bedrock has been built. ", "And what you\u2019re going to hear today is the real focus of how you take this network and really make it and create profits for you as investors in the company. We had the best operational performance in United history. That may sound trite, because you guys have only been around together for a few years, but it's been significant and more importantly D0, which is kind of one of our many key metrics, but that's the one, I think probably we\u2019re most proud of, because we operate in some pretty tough environments and we don't get a lot of credit for that. We don't like to whine or complain, but it is important when you finish as strong as we have and in fact, we are one of the leaders in the industry. ", "And this doesn't happen without the people in our organization and so the kudos and the shout outs to them, because they've done a significant job, and not just in our own internal metrics, but if you think of external metrics, the Journal just published there, I think what's key on this chart, if you see the progression, well, fourth place is not our destination and we're not lauding the fact that oh, we're fourth. But look at the progression over the course of time and that's the important part because just a few years ago, we didn't do the fundamental customer centric thing that you need to do as an airline is run a good one. And so, this is underpinning our strategy and the foundation that we're moving forward.", "So as we turn to 2018, we need to continue that reliability aspect, but our 2018 focus is about improving United\u2019s margins and the bedrock -- the foundation for that are the first two things, strengthening our domestic network, again, we'll talk a lot about that today and driving efficiency and productivity and you'll hear more about from both Scott and from Andrew Levy. Those are foundational. ", "We have a lot of confidence, but more importantly, despite what you may hear and think, the alignment and the focus between our management team and how we're wound at this is we are so focused on this. It's just need to see, which gives us the confidence again, it wouldn't -- when you think about the continuity of profits and margins and sustainable over the long run, it's key. Important to note, because of the profit margins, because of how we've been running, we're not going to stop investing in our business. ", "Our people, the training, the models that you have to, you know, that you have to provide for them, so how to react in certain circumstances and how to run a great airline, we continue that training. The product is always a never ending sort of level of investment that we have to constantly balance and then technology. And I think at a future time, Linda and her team, we're going to blow you away with some of our digital innovation that we're building as we speak today. ", "And I maybe speaking a little out of school, but we are very excited about some of the more strategic things in digital, because we're always going to be the company we are. We've been around for a long time. We have the infrastructure. We have people that have been around with us for a long time, but how do we transform everything, I think the space is through the digital channels and I think we've got a lot of great ideas and already a lot of things and actions. ", "So with that, again, it's about margins this year and forward and I think what we're going to tell you is sustainable and so I\u2019ll be back at the end to sort of recap, but with that, Mr. Kirby.", "Scott Kirby", "Thank you, Oscar and thank you all for coming down here in person to join us and thanks to everyone that is listening on the Internet. As Oscar said, today, we're going to do something that is atypical, at least for our earnings calls and well Oscar talked a little bit about the earnings, everything from here going forward is talking about the future. And fundamentally, we're here today, one of the biggest messages that we want to talk about is the rationale for what we need to do to make the United network strong. And many of you have known me for a long time and you know that I'm passionate about airline route networks, because it is the foundation that everything else is built upon. And so today, we're going to talk about where we're going for the next several years. We're going to go all the way out through 2020 and tell you where we're going, but more importantly, we're going to tell you why we're doing what we think is the right thing to do for United Airlines.", "So to start, as I said, the network is the foundation of everything that we do and for as long as I've been around in the airline business, people have talked about the potential that exists at United Airlines and have been frustrated with when are we going to realize that potential. And today, we're going to hopefully talk about what really that means and what in the United Airlines route network doesn't realize the potential, what are the great things about it, but what are the things that aren't yet realizing the potential and how we can return United Airlines to profitable growth and how we can close the margin gap frankly through the right kind of growth and through strengthening the weaknesses that we have in our network.", "But to start, we have to leverage our strengths. One of the great things that we have at United Airlines is the best international gateways of anyone in the world. Our hubs on the coast do far better and I'm going to show you some data, do far better than our competitors and that is a huge competitive advantage. These are crown jewels for United Airlines. We also have the best alliance to participate in, at least, the alliance with the most potential. And the geographic position of our Mid-Continent hubs, Chicago, Denver and Houston is ideal. ", "They\u2019re big cities that are growing, vibrant cities and they are ideally positioned from a geography perspective to be really efficient hubs that complement each other and serve the entire country. But those three hubs have some uniquely United opportunities and that's what we're -- I'm going to spend at least the majority of the day talking about. And we need to grow and strengthen our domestic hubs and we'll talk about why before I jump to those conclusions. But more scale, more connectivity is what we have to drive at these hubs and you're going to hear me use the word connectivity over and over and over again today. ", "A hub and spoke airline is really a manufacturing company and it is about manufacturing connections. The more connections you can drive at a hub, the higher profits you drive at that hub, the more options you have for customers to flow through that hub. And it\u2019s exponential. You add one flight into a hub that has 80 connections, you don't just add one market like a point to point carrier would be doing, you add 80 new markets and that strengthens the whole network and it makes the other 80 flights stronger at that one hub. ", "And so the key to everything that we're going to -- that I'm going to be talking about for most of the rest of the presentation is about driving higher connectivity and why that matters to a hub and spoke airline. But I\u2019m going to start by at least taking a minute to talk about the uniquely United strengths and I talked about our strong international gateways. We have hubs in the five largest cities. What's remarkable actually is that the seven United Airlines hubs account for 80% of the premium demand in the United States, international premium demand is coming from the seven United Airlines hubs. ", "This is a huge asset and by the way, the profitability for all of us in the airline business flying internationally is really predicated on the premium demand. The more premium demand you have, the more defensible that is, the higher profit margins it drives. This is really a huge strength for United Airlines. We're also a member in the best alliance, at least the alliance with the most potential. This goes back to connectivity. We fly into partner hubs that have phenomenal connectivity on the other side. If you just think about United and Lufthansa and it's not just Lufthansa, but United and Lufthansa, when we fly from Chicago to Frankfurt or United or Lufthansa flies from Frankfurt into Chicago, our alliance is not about carrying people between Chicago and Frankfurt. ", "Yes, we do that, but our alliance is about adding a whole bunch of behind connecting points on the other side of Frankfurt that we can carry people to destinations we would never fly to. Likewise, for Lufthansa, so they can get people to Kansas City and St. Louis and Omaha, places they're never going to fly to on their own. And that\u2019s what drives value in an alliance. And our connecting partner, Lufthansa has clearly got the best connecting hubs in Europe. Our partners in Asia, particularly Air China and ANA have great connectivity there and we're building a great partnership -- set of partnerships in Latin America to really try to make a run for the money competing with American Airlines and LatAm, but we are in the alliance that has the most potential. I'm not going to talk a lot about this today, but there is a lot of things we have to do to actually realize this potential that we are working on with our partners and expect to continue to have this get better and better.", "What's also important though is the geography of our hubs, the size and geography of our hubs. And as I talk about hubs and I'm sure many get questions about things like natural share. The answer to those kinds of questions is going to come back to geography in many cases and our hubs are well positioned geographically to serve the entire country. You start with Chicago, not only is it the third largest market in the country, a great local market, but its geographical position is well positioned to serve the entire northeast, connecting to the Midwest, to the West Coast. It is well positioned to serve the entire northern tier of the country in addition to being a large market in and of itself. ", "Denver is situated in the middle of the country. It's probably the best position of any hub geographically, to serve the entire country, to serve Transcontinental flows. And it gives us unique access to the Mountain West, to small cities on the West Coast, to the Midwest to get people west. It has a unique element that no other hub at any airline can serve. It's the best position geographically of any hub, and at the same time, it's a big and growing market with the kinds of tech investments that you see going on there, tech companies moving there. It's a growing, vibrant local market, but it's also well positioned to serve a unique set of markets that only Denver can serve as efficiently as it does. ", "And finally, Houston is a wonderful southern tier hub that can connect people across the whole southern tier of the United States, but is also very well positioned geographically to serve all of Latin America. Whether you're coming from the North East or the West Coast, funneling through Houston is a really efficient routing to get you down to South America, to get you into Latin America. It is extremely well positioned and it's a big local market for Latin markets.", "So we have these three great hubs that are not only great in and of their own rights, and have potential in and of their own rights, but they also complement each other. Unlike some of our competitors, our hubs really are complimentary. You got a northern hub, a central hub and a southern tier hub. It's rare that we\u2019re over flying our hubs and competing with each other. These are three hubs that can complimentarily serve each other. But the opportunity at United is to make these three hubs stronger and they're not as strong as our competitors\u2019 hubs. They don't have the same profit margins as our competitors\u2019 hubs have today and there are four things that I'm going to talk about.", "One is hub scale. This is just how big you are and this matters for the obvious reason that if you're a frequent flyer, you want to be as big as you can possibly be. By the way, it also matters for things like credit card programs, because if we're not as big as our competitors in all the other cities around the country and you're a frequent flyer and you're deciding which credit card to get, you're going to get the frequent flyer program that -- for the airline that has the biggest service, the most service. And as we'll talk about -- as we go through this today, if we're number three in all those small cities, we're going to be behind on things like the credit cards. So it's not just the obvious things, it's all the ancillary businesses that matters well.", "Connectivity, this is the key and connectivity drives everything else that I'm going to talk about. It drives scale, it drives revenue quality, it drives asset efficiency. If we can drive higher connectivity, if we can manufacture more connections, that is the magic elixir that makes hubs successful. And we'll talk in detail about what that means.", "Revenue quality, as United was shrinking, United was pulling out of high yield small cities and that was really damaging to United Airlines and our relative revenue performance and CASM performance. And finally, asset efficiency. We have structurally created an airline as united was shrinking that we made ourselves high cost and Andrew Levy will talk more about this. I'll introduce the concept, but in short, we don't utilize our assets as well as our competitors and we have a lot of times of the year or days of the week where we just put our assets on the ground and don't do anything with them, but we still have the same costs and that is the structural cost issue that existed at United. The good news is that one is imminently fixable.", "But to start, I want to go back to this concept of the crown jewels, the international gateways versus the mid-Continent hubs. And so this just shows two hub types. So we've just compared our international gateways, which are phenomenal, all four of them are really -- do very well. And we have great data, you all know, we have great data to compare our hub profitability to others and we are pretty accurate at estimating each other\u2019s profitability by hub. Our international gateways are about seven points more -- have higher profit margins, about 7 points higher than our competitors and that is because they are in those big premium international markets -- places like San Francisco and New York are just crown jewels for United Airlines. ", "And so I'm not going to talk about this today, because we're going to talk about the opportunity, but we will -- that's the reason we will always defend every single point of market share in these crown jewel hubs, because we can't let the domestic base get eroded and still support the international flying that we do out of these hubs. But the real opportunity at United Airlines, to close the margin gap, to improve absolute and relative earnings, is about our mid-continent hubs and Chicago, Denver and Houston, despite being big markets, despite being well positioned geographically, have profit margins that are about 10 points lower than our competitors at mid-continent hubs. ", "It\u2019s another way of showing it. And this is one. If you look at both American and Delta, they're at the same spot on this chart. This chart on the Y-axis has domestic seat share and on the X-Axis has percent connecting revenue. And probably the more important thing is actually that percent connecting revenue. As you grow hub, as you drive higher connectivity, you make it more defensible and you make it higher profit margins. I mean, look at some of the hubs that are on this list, a lot of -- some of them are in big cities, but mostly they're in cities that are smaller than where the United Airlines hubs are and they have very similar profit margins and really there's a very high correlation between connectivity at the hub and profit margins. ", "And by the way, those two bubbles, all five of those hubs are very tightly packed in terms of what their profit margins are. Because they have similar high levels of connectivity, there's a similar point on this chart. And this, if you just remember one thing from today about the United Network, I would say it's probably this, because this is what drives the profitability of a hub. It's true around the world and it's what drives it at United. And for what it's worth, everything we\u2019re going to talk about today, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel here. This is not -- we're not treading a new path. ", "In fact, this is a well worn playbook that myself and one of the person at least in here have done at a number of other hubs at different airlines and driving higher connectivity of the hub is just math. I mean, we can talk about all the risks and things, but it's just math. When you drive higher connectivity at a hub, you're going to drive outperformance and incremental revenue through the hub. But scale, scale is the first thing that we talked about is a real issue at our hubs. And scale is issue for the obvious reasons that I said. But also, I want to tell you another reason that\u2019s an issue. ", "So in the last five years, we cumulatively shrank by 8% our hubs. You can see that our two competitors are growing in this hubs, in their hubs. Remember, these are growing, vibrant markets, Denver, Chicago, Houston, growing vibrant market. So what do you think happens when we're shrinking, but the total market is growing? Well, our competitors grow faster. There is a absolute correlation between these two things, an inverse correlation between these two things. When we shrink in a growing market, someone is going to come in and meet that demand and that's exactly what happened in United Airlines market. Unfortunately, it's even worse because a lot of that demand was met with low cost and ultra low cost carriers who backfilled us when we were exiting and shrinking in those markets. ", "And many of the people in this room have written research reports over the years about the best forecaster of PRASM going forward, the best forecaster of profitability and the best forecaster of all those stock price performance is this chart and this chart happens because of the left side of the chart. When we shrink, our competitors grow faster and that matters to us. It also matters because our customers want a great network, particularly our premium customers who want to get to as many destinations as they can with as much frequency as they can. And our depth is well below, this is the number of flights that we have per day in each market. Our depth is below our competitors at these hubs. ", "Our breadth, meaning the number of markets that we serve is below our competitors at our hub and importantly, our connectivity is significantly below where our competitors are. If you're American Airlines and you can carry more than twice, you have more than twice as many connecting itineraries on every flight that you're flying into those hubs, they're massively more profitable because they have that higher connectivity. And this is the biggest thing we're going to change and it's not just about growth. Some of it is about growth, but it's not just about growth. We'll talk about re-banking hubs. Again, the whole idea of re-banking hubs is not new territory. It's territory that at least some of us have been down before and it's a well worn playbook that we've used in the past. ", "Connectivity, I keep harping on connectivity and I got another example here. And this is the re-banking. So in Houston, we've gone from a ten bank structure to an eight bank structure and what that means is we didn't add any flights, but we\u2019re just keeping the number of flights the same, we concentrated into bigger peaks and I just have one example here. Our Las Vegas flight now has 21% more connections. This is the magic of making a hub work, because we now have 10 new destinations and either on peak demand days, we can yield up and we can spill off some of the lower fare traffic. ", "And on off peak days, we can run higher load factors. We've accessed a whole new pool of demand without even changing anything about the number of flights that we have, a whole new set of demand that's available and this isn't of course just one flight. You multiply this across all 500 flights in the hub and all 500 flights are getting another ten or so connections, significant change in the profitability of the hub. This is the key for United going forward. We have to fix this and we have to make this better, if we want our margins in these mid-continent hubs to close the gap to our competitors. ", "You can see by the time we get to the end of the year, this isn't on day one, this isn\u2019t for the full year, by the time we get to the end of this year, the combination of some growth, but also a lot of restructuring that we're doing at our three mid-continent hubs is going to drive 21% higher connectivity in Houston and 15% higher connectivity in Chicago and Denver. This really is a big deal to the profitability of United, not just this year and next year, but for the long term and particularly as we continue to grow this.", "Revenue quality also matters. To orientate this slide, we've divided the country into large, medium and small markets and shown you the yield and show you how many passengers we have, what percentage of our passengers come from these and what percentage of our competitors passengers come here. What you can see is they were a lot smaller in the small markets. We have fewer percentage \u2013 we have 26% of our passengers coming in small markets and our competitors have 30. Conversely, we are largest. 40% of our revenue is coming in large markets, which have the lowest yield. ", "This wasn't true 15 or 20 years ago. When Chicago to Laguardia would have been the example of a really high yield market, but in a world with lots of low cost carriers, it's not a high yield market anymore. Rochester to Laguardia is a high yield market, but Chicago to Laguardia is no longer a high yield market and we are disproportionately exposed to large, low yield markets and we did that to ourselves in the past six or seven years. This did not look like this in times past. And what happened at United is United was shrinking and frankly shrinking because they're getting pressure from rooms like this to shrink. And as United was shrinking, what United did was took the regional jets out of markets like Rochester, Minnesota and put them into markets like Newark, Atlanta and DFW to Chicago and that caused three damaging effects at United Airlines. ", "First, we lost that high yield traffic from Rochester that used to support the whole network. Second, we put regional jets into competition with American and Delta where they were flying mainline equipment and we lost customers who used to fly us and now we pushed them to our competitors, because they didn't like the product. And third, we had employees who were screaming at us, this is stupid, why are you doing this, and we alienated them and they were right, they were right that we shouldn\u2019t have been doing that. ", "And so we had three bad effects that happened as we took regional jets out of the kinds of markets they should fly, the small cities with high yields and put them in competitive large markets. And this is something that we can fix and address. When we talk about natural sure, I'll come back to a lot of examples like this, probably during the Q&A, but this is really one of the key elements for driving higher revenues that United is getting us back exposed to our fair share of these markets that we pulled out of over the last five or six years. ", "And then finally, the fourth element that I had in talking about the network is really a point on asset efficiency and Andrew Levy is going to talk a lot more about CASM and I won't steal his punch lines, because they're great and the numbers are really good, but a lot of the reasons that United structurally has higher costs than our competitors is a whole bunch of stuff around asset efficiency. And I\u2019ve just picked one chart to put on here and what this is, is, it graphs our monthly service compared to our largest month. So, August is our peak flying month and so how much do we fly in other months compared to August. ", "And what you can see is again as United was coming under pressure to shrink, United shrink in a way that maximized RASM. Our RASM is lower in January than it is in July and August. And if you just want to maximize RASM, shrink in January, shrink in February and that's what happened in United. And you can see, in January for example, we went from 88% of average or 88% of August down to 78%, 10 point decline in January. And that's good for RASM, but it\u2019s terrible for CASM, because we have exactly the same number of gates in January as we have in August. We have exactly the same number of airplanes and we have almost exactly the same number of employees. We try to mitigate this with voluntary leaves of absence and things, but this is a job for people. You can get 22% of your workforce to say, I don't want to come to work for the month of January. And so we -- our fixed cost structure is basically the same in January as it is in August, but we're producing 22% fewer ASMs. ", "Another way to think about this, another example because we've started this already, we started this in the fourth quarter. We added back service from Dallas to Sao Paulo on Tuesday and Wednesdays. When Brazil cratered, we canceled Tuesdays and Wednesdays. We put it five days a week, canceled Tuesdays and Wednesdays. We knew adding it back on Tuesday and Wednesday was going to be lower RASM. And in fact, it came in actually a little better than our forecast, but it came in with RASM that was 17% below average. ", "So our RASM was lower, because we flew Dallas Sao Paulo on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. But the CASM on that flight was even conservatively estimated over 40% lower, because the airplane was free. The gates were free. The slots were free. We had all of those fixed assets and people is even another area that was probably not even adequately represented in our CASM number because that crew that flew down on Monday instead of coming home, now has to stay till Thursday. We have to get them hotels. A lot of times, we have to pay them guarantee pay, because they don't get enough hours and they stay over in Sao Paulo. ", "They don't want to be there \u2013 if they wind up staying over in Sao Paulo for several days, we get them hotels, we pay them guarantee and then the crew that would have taken the airplane back on Thursday also has to stay over, because it's created a chain of events that you've got to wait for each crew to bring the airplane home and you just never catch up. And so this kind of behavior, if all you want to do is maximize RASM, man, this is the way to do it. But if you want to maximize profitability, it's damaging, because the CASM impact is so much bigger than the RASM impact. ", "So going forward, we're going to measure ourselves on these four metrics from the network perspective. We've got a whole bunch of more metrics, but hub scale, so one way to think about that is the amount of spokes, where we're ranked number one or two. Again, this matters I\u2019ve alluded to the credit card a couple of times, this matters not just for the obvious of winning customers, but if you're in Kansas City and there's no hub there and you're picking \u2013 you\u2019re a frequent flyer and you're picking who to fly, you're going to probably pick the airline that's number one in that city, because they can get you the most places. When you live in Kansas City, you almost always have to make a connection anywhere that you're going. ", "And if you're going to have to make a connection anyway, you can connect in Dallas or Houston or Chicago or Minneapolis and you're going to connect with the carrier that has the highest service. And that matters to our passenger revenue, but it also matters to all of our ancillary revenues. Connectivity, this is again the number one issue, the number one thing for us to drive is higher connectivity across the network. And it's not just about growth, it's also about structure and this is something we absolutely can do and again, it's just math. This is really hard to debate that it works, because it's just math as you exponentially increase the connectivity of a hub when you grow it. ", "Revenue share in small city markets, I talked about that, we\u2019ll continue to access more of those as we move forward. And then of course asset efficiency and Andrew Levy is going to talk more about what that means for our CASM and particular he's going to get to what that means for our near term EPS guide in 2018, but also an EPS guide for 2020 as well. And all of that is going to lead to improvement in our pre-tax margins, both absolute and relative. And this is a different way of talking about it than we did a year ago, but this is the issue. The network is the issue. ", "And if you want to and understand an airline and understand what their profit potential is for the long term, you have to understand the network. That's why we spend a lot of time on this today because this is what's going to get United, make United great again. This is what is going to drive margins at United Airlines in both an absolute and a relative sense, but that then gets us to the bottom line, which is our growth rate. And we are planning to grow this year, as we start to repair some of this and as we focus on our mid-continent hubs, we're planning to grow 4% to 6%. And we expect to grow at similar rates in 2019 and 20. ", "I also, while I\u2019m on this slide want to make a personal commentary. I've known many of you at least for 15, 20 or more years. And I think my reputation with you is, one, I've been probably the most hawkish person in the industry in terms of pushing for -- aggressively pushing for and driving consolidation, because I knew what kind of value that would create. I also had a history I think of being a capacity hawk and cutting unprofitable flying and I absolutely have done that in the past and would do that if we had unprofitable flying at United Airlines today. In fact, it's not something I'm proud of, but it was the right thing to do financially. ", "I've been at airlines where we've closed a number of hubs, but we have a different hand of cards to play at United. If I had the same hand of cards to play as I've had at other airlines, where we had unprofitable operations that we needed to shrink, that's what we would have done. But we have a different hand of cards to play at United. The opportunity at United is not about shrinking. The opportunity at United is about growing back to where United frankly should have been had it not went to negative 8% growth across the last several years. ", "And restoring the position, we're building back that chart that I showed earlier, moving United Airlines from the lower left and up into the right and driving higher connectivity and share in those three mid-continent hubs is the key to making United\u2019s profit margins higher. And that's why we're doing this. We're doing this because that's what works and we know that's what works again. Those three hubs, it's really about math and that's why we're here today to talk to you about that.", "And with that, I'll introduce Andrew so I\u2019ve focus just on the network. There also are a lot of great things going on in the network or at the company that aren't just about the network. So commercial initiatives that are going to drive higher revenues compared to what they otherwise would have been. And I'm going to turn it over to Andrew to spend some time talking about all those.", "Andrew Nocella", "Thanks, Scott. There I am. So as Scott said, the network is the really center of where we started this from, but we know all the commercial activities that surround network need to be worked in harmony for the network to achieve its potential and in particular, we know that our customer initiatives need to be ongoing as well and we have a lot of customer initiatives coming through the pipeline. So today, we're not really going to focus on those things, but I want to make it clear that those are ongoing and at the appropriate point in time, we'll discuss them. Today, I really want to focus on the revenue management and pricing area and customer segmentation. That is an important area of focus for the company and a lot is going on on that front.", "So in particular, Gemini, Gemini is our new revenue management system. We just turned it on and I want to talk about what it means to United Airlines and why it's so important. First of all, the very first chart on the left here is the forecast bias. So, Orion, which is a system that United's used for decades at this point, a couple of decades, just constantly under forecast demand and that's -- you can see the negative bar here under Orion. So what that meant is that we are constantly expecting the demand to our flights to be low. So our inventory access was open and we accepted lower yield passengers more often than we should. ", "Our analysts did the best job they could what a complicated network of trying to boost the Orion forecast artificially to account for this, but across thousands of flights per day, 330 days per year, that was just not the way to manage the system. And so we had to move to a new revenue management system and Gemini is our new one. And you can see it\u2019s slightly over forecast our demand. We're so happy to be there. So we no longer have this guessing game of how many passengers are really going to show up for the flight. The forecast is dramatically more accurate today than it's ever been. ", "So our analysts don't have to artificially alter the forecast and they can rely on Gemini to produce a quality forecast, so we know who's going to show up for the flight. And what does this mean? Well, on the right side of this chart is what happened to yield and PRASM in the test markets we did in the fourth quarter? So we ran a really good test. We went on and off, so we were in both systems against the same flights every other day and it had amazing results. Our yields are up 2.2%. Our load factor was down a little bit and we drove RASM 1.2% higher. So obviously, we're very excited about that. ", "We now have Gemini working across the entire system and so it\u2019s spooling into the process and by the second quarter of this year, it will be fully functional and third and fourth quarter where I think we'll see the best results from it. And this is something we\u2019re working on over time to make even better. The amazing thing about these numbers is we do have the analysts to account for things like Halloween and other things to make our forecast better. Those Gemini numbers up there are completely untouched. That is just the system running with the mathematical formulas that are in there. So we're pretty bullish about Gemini and what it's going to do for United Airlines as we enter particularly the second half of the year, but even as we enter part of the second quarter. So Gemini is a major development at United Airlines and one we're very excited about.", "All right. So the next thing I want to talk about is segmentation and this is something that we wholeheartedly believe in. And a few days ago, we announced United Premium Plus, which is going to be our new class of service between coach and business class. This will allow customers that want to buy up to a better experience, which includes more food and more leg room and more comfort. To do so, obviously, many of our competitors have done this. They're out there flying around the globe. ", "We worked with our alliance partners and they and Lufthansa as we really understand how this works, how many people are going to buy it from coach, how many people are going to buy down from business class and we also think this is going to be a big home run for United Airlines. It will take about three years to fully roll out across our international system. There's a lot of aircraft to convert, but in three years\u2019 time, we'll have this product out there and I think it's going to be a great home run. And again, it further shows how we're thinking about segment in our revenue and segment in the customers with each churn.", "On basic economy, come a long way since last summer. We've altered it a little bit in terms of how we put it in the bottom five fare classes versus going always up the ladder. But needless to say, we think it's been much more effective as we've made these changes. In 2018, we plan to expand it. We just in fact launched Denver to Hawaii. We hopefully will be launching to more international markets with basic economy and most importantly, we're going to give our basic economy customers another choice, whereas today, you're unable to select your seat assignment in advance. ", "When you book your ticket, you have to wait till you check in. I will be turning on technology shortly that allows you to assign yourself a seat for a small fee in advance, so you can pay that fee upfront or you can choose to wait till check in to get your seat for free. It'll be assigned to check in, but it's obviously an opportunity for our customers that are buying a basic fare to be able to select a seat or -- and it's an opportunity for United Airlines on the ancillary revenue front. So we're excited about that.", "All right. So as we turn to 2018, we look at RASM and where we think things are lining up. We just wanted to give you a perspective on things. First of all, as we grow and Scott just showed you the growth rate, we know we\u2019re growing a little bit faster than our primary competitors, so that will create a headwind. So we have some headwinds and we have some tailwinds as we enter 2018. So in terms of headwinds, that growth rate we expect will cause half a point off the RASM and Andrew Levy will be up next and will kind of explain how the CASM and RASM will work and why that makes sense. ", "And we also see OA competitive growth. So Scott showed you what's been happening in our hubs over the last few years. And in fact, definitely happened in 2017, where capacity growth in the United Airlines hubs was at twice the rate than our competitors saw. So we expect that headwind to continue into 2017 between half a point and a full point RASM. We don't know the exact number. We can't see all the way through 2018 at this point, but it's definitely a headwind. The good news is, is we have a host of initiatives. And since I joined United Airlines, I just have to tell you like every day, I come in and I find yet a new opportunity and it's just a question of getting all those ideas ordered, prioritized and in the pipeline so we can actually deliver on them. ", "And here's just a few things we\u2019re working on. Obviously, the schedules already change dramatically. What we have loaded in terms of the RJ developments into smaller cities that have this high yield exposure, key to what Scott talked about earlier. Gemini revenue management is already turned on and it's working across the entire United Airlines system. We\u2019ve re-banked the Houston hub late last year, Chicago in just a few weeks time and hopefully, Denver later this year after we get through the summer peak. ", "And then segmentation, beyond that, the list is really long and there's all kinds of things not only that are techie on the digital front, but also for our customers that we think ultimately drive more and more value. So I like to say I\u2019m really excited about all these opportunities. Some of them come online immediately like Gemini and some of them take a little bit longer to achieve like the Polaris business class seat, but we're well on our way and we've defined all those items and we're excited to be able to deliver on them and we think that's going to create a lot of value in future.", "So with that, I'm going to hand it off to Mr. Andrew Levy, my partner and he'll talk about our finances.", "Andrew Levy", "Good afternoon. So now you've heard Scott talk about the network strategy and one of the things that we think are important to do to improve profitability at United in the short term and the long term, Andrew just talked a lot about specific commercial opportunities and initiatives that are going to help us in terms of revenue. I'm going to talk about CASM mostly. Now, we are -- first and foremost, it\u2019s a margin story. So when people ask us what kind of story are you, well, it\u2019s margins. Margin is what matters and that's our primary focus. But we have a terrific CASM story and many of you here have known me for a long time. ", "You know my background, my history, I've been in the low cost side of the business for most of my career and those are companies where you have to compete on costs. And so I'm very passionate about that. That's my experience pre-United. But we have a great CASM story here as well. We have, as Scott mentioned, a very high fixed cost base. We have all these assets, a lot of people and as we talked about in the seasonality side, we don't use it very often. We're going to be able to address that going forward and that's what's going to drive a lot of our opportunities and I'll talk about that in a little bit more. ", "Now, we're also going to give you, as we've previewed, a annual 2018 earnings per share guide and we're also going to give you a target for 2020. We like earnings per share because it is really easy to calculate. It's really easy to hold us accountable, so we\u2019re going to talk about that. And I\u2019m not going to spend a lot of time talking about the balance sheet, but the balance sheet is a foundation of everything that we've talked about and that we're going to talk about that enables us to do all this. We have a terrific balance sheet. We have ample liquidity, low debt levels. We\u2019re very, very comfortable. So we won\u2019t talk much about the balance sheet today because I don't think that that's really an issue going forward. We have a great -- it's a great strength of the company, so we\u2019re going to make sure it stays that way.", "So let me walk you through the slide at first before I get into some of the details. On your left, you will see our CASM for 2017 and our forecast for 2018. We\u2019re going to be flat to down 1 in 2018. And you can see on the top right, we have some headwinds and some tailwinds, which I'll talk a little bit about. As I mentioned, we have a terrific CASM story. That being said, there are a lot of headwinds this year that we're going to overcome. Now, the first one and probably the most important to just highlight is the regional flying. And Scott talked about how we're going to fix the network. ", "We're going to add a lot of regional flying this year and that is going to be a CASM tailwind, or excuse me, CASM headwind. There's no way around that. These are expensive airplanes to operate. And so if you just look at it in terms of CASM, they do drive CASM expense. However, we're not doing this to optimize CASM. We're driving -- we're finding more regional jets, because that's what's going to take to fix our network to go in to some of these smaller cities and drive higher levels of profitability. ", "We have 31 more aircraft this year that are going to be fine in our regional fleet, about a half a point of CASM. Now, we're making a lot of investments in technology and that's very deliberate. That is to be able to better take care of our customers, give our employees the tools they need to better be able to take care of our customers. It's going to drive operational efficiency and therefore lower costs on the back end as well and we\u2019re making a lot of investments in infrastructure, disaster recovery, things of that nature that are foundational and really critical that we do. ", "We have other costs as well, which are more annual in nature, labor, even though we don't have any new contracts in place in 2018, we have annual wage escalation that continues going forward. Airports seem to only go one direction. We have a lot of airports that we're seeing a lot of price or cost pressure. We expect that will continue. Different airports perhaps different years and of course many, many other costs that we need to overcome. Now, next year and beyond, we have a lot of tailwinds also. ", "We're going to get a lot in the way of asset utilization whether they be gates, aircraft or our employees getting -- just becoming more productive and I'll talk about that in just a minute. We also have an opportunity because we've done such a good job with our operation and that's due to a lot of hard work, effort energy and focus that we have each and every day, but at the same time we've also put in a little bit of reliability buffers to help us get to where we are now. We're going to start to pull some of that back, which is going to be helpful in terms of cost. Aircraft financing, we historically had a lot of operating leases, which are very expensive. ", "As those aircraft are coming off of lease, many times, we're buying them and putting them on our balance sheet, because we intend to operate them until they're going to be scrapped at the end of their life. We'll talk a little bit more about that. And as I mentioned, not only is this a 2018 story, where we expect to be flat to minus one, but we expect to do the same thing in 2019 and 2020 and that includes any labor deals, which we have a pilot deal that's coming due on the 1st of January, January 1st of \u201919, excuse me. We expect this will be the best among our peers and we're very committed to making sure that this happens.", "So, productivity is the single biggest lever we have in these next few years. We have very high fixed costs and we have a very seasonal schedule. So we've kind of added to it, not only do we start out with high costs, but the way that we operate, we don't put a lot of ASMs or as many ASMs as we can. We're going to try to reverse that. Scott talked a lot about that. ", "Let me show you what we have here on the chart. As you can see on the left, left to right, you see productivity, ASMs per FTE, full time equivalent employee, aircraft utilization, departures per day, we\u2019re showing to you departures per day, which I think is more relevant. You\u2019re talking about seats. And then gate utilization, which is up dramatically, 7% next year. Scott mentioned, just going back to that Sao Paolo example, the marginal cost of incremental flights during those periods of time is extremely, extremely low and we have a lot of opportunities to do that. We're going to do some of that in 2018. We expect that to accelerate in terms of the meaningfulness, in terms of our overall capacity, growth rates in 2019 and 2020 and we're very excited about the ability to better use our assets and become more efficient and drive a better CASM story going forward.", "So capital expenditures, on the left hand side, you'll see where we came out in 2017, 4.7 as we had guided and we had also talked to you about this in the third quarter was that we thought we'd be at about $1 billion less in 2018. So we're renewing our commitment to you on that. That being said, we continue to grow the business. We're investing in fleet. We're also, by the way, becoming more capital efficient, not just through productivity, but also because we're going to continue to bring on used aircraft in two different ways. First is buying aircraft off lease, where the opportunity presents itself. ", "Last year, we bought 46 aircraft off lease. This year, we have about 60 that are coming off lease. We probably won't buy all 60. It will depend on the economics of each transaction, but that's a very efficient way to add to the fleet or to keep airplanes in the fleet instead of buying used -- new airplanes, it's much less capital, very efficient and the best used airplanes out there are the ones we've been operating since birth. So I expect that will continue. So we\u2019ll continue to move aircraft onto the balance sheet off of operating lease as those opportunities present themselves. ", "We're also adding used airplanes. You've heard me talk about that a long time. I love used airplanes. And as many of you know, 24 scheduled airplanes this year. 2018, three of them are actually widebodies. We recently signed a deal to bring on 3 767-300 ER airplanes. There will be many more user aircraft to talk about as time goes on and as we continue to take advantage of the spot market.", "Non- aircraft CapEx is going to continue to rise this year. Actually, it was kind of flat, but we expect it to rise in \u201918, \u201919 and \u201920. And that's as we continue to invest in our product with Polaris, clubs, the customer experience, our people, technology, tools that enable them to do a better job for our customers and at the same time investing in infrastructure, whether it's bag systems, gates, but also in many cases, it's just deferred CapEx, that just CapEx that didn't -- wasn't spent back when times were much tougher and we didn't have the balance sheet strength. So we're still digging out of that hole that will take us a long time, but there's a lot of capital that we will continue to spend in those areas, which we think are very, very important. Oh, by the way, one other comment, 2019 to 2020, we expect that we\u2019ll be lower or excuse me, that will be higher than 2018, but lower than 2017. 2017 will still represent the high watermark we expect at this time. ", "So, there's a lot going on in this chart. Let me first start out by saying that we all, I think, are enjoying a great market. There's no signs of weakness out there. The whole world is booming, which is exactly why we need to be probably vigilant and make sure we know how to manage through the eventual downturn, which will come at some point in time. As you can see here, I'm showing you year-end 2017 mainline aircraft in our fleet. And then where we expect to be by the end of 2020 and where we could be by the end of 2020. If we are going to utilize the levers that we've created for ourselves to manage our fleet plan, we have a lot of flexibility. ", "We've talked about that repeatedly about the flexibility we have with our order book at our fleet. We think that is one of the most important things that we have to manage through tougher times, apart from a terrific balance sheet, which I already touched on. But we can manage our fleet. This is critically important and the other thing that we can do to manage our fleet is continue to bring on lower cost airplanes. And again, you've seen me do that before. It's very effective. It gives you a lot more flexibility in the case of a downturn and we think that's critically important as we go forward.", "So, here's the punch line. 2018 guidance, we're giving you an annual number as we\u2019ve already previewed. Scott talked to you about capacity, 4% to 6%. CASM-ex, minus 1% to flat, we're all incredibly committed to delivering on that. We expect an earnings per share range of $6.50 to $7.50 and we touched on CapEx just a minute ago. We like earnings per share. We think that's what matters most to us as shareholders. We think it matters most to you as shareholders. As a metric, if you're going to pick one and so that is -- with our efforts to try to become more accountable, more transparent, that's why we're doing this today. ", "And lastly, this slide basically speaks for itself. This is a range for 2020. This is what everything we talked about gets us in 2020. We're very, very confident in the long-term strategy that we've outlined for you today. We have a great CASM story. As I\u2019ve tried to give you a little bit of information on today, while I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk a lot more of that in Q&A, very committed to making that happen and I think importantly, we're showing at these numbers a 25% compound annual growth rate in terms of earnings per share by 2020.", "So with that, I will turn it back over to Oscar to finish up.", "Oscar Munoz", "Just so we're clear on the numbers, $8.50 on the chart on the far range of EPS is the correct number. And I also want to reiterate, because it wasn't maybe clear on the chart that our CASM guide does include labor deals. And I do believe that from a transparency and a forward aspect, I don't know that anyone in the industry has ever sort of done them. And that's the level of cost management that we\u2019re going to be going after.", "So with that, let me just bring it home before we get into Q&A. When I took this job, some of you in this room, a lot of people in the business talked about United being sort of the unsolvable puzzle. There was assets and resources and a global footprint that had great promise, but nobody had ever been able to figure out how to actually put that together. And so one of the first tasks we took out is how do we create a team around that with the smartest capable minds taking advantage of that and that's what we\u2019ve created. And despite everything we hear and see and sometimes read, we've got a plan that we're very, very confident about. ", "You heard that strengthening our hubs is critical, not just to our growth and competitiveness, but to profitability. I think that\u2019s an important aspect of what we're doing. The numbers we've chosen, the things that we've done about maximizing profitability. And again as Andrew Nocella talked about driving revenue on all aspects of our business, but you heard him specifically say that every day he shows up to work, there is even more opportunity. ", "So the opportunity set from my perspective, as I talk to the team, specifically, we talk about the great sort of confidence of things to be touched ahead and for the unsolvable puzzle piece, when you think about the mid-continent and the gap aspect of there, that's where the opportunity lies and that\u2019s why the growth that we're doing is going to be focused on high cost business, efficiency and productivity, all of that continues to be, I think, Andrew just laid that out very well and so ladies and gentlemen, that's our plan. ", "That's what we're headed out to do. There will be lots of questions and concerns about different numbers, but that is the fundamental plan and our confidence level is high the numbers we\u2019ve reached. To provide you some sense of our comfort and our confidence, we are giving you what we think is a greater level of accountability and transparency with the EPS numbers that we're providing. More importantly, we're making the big strong pivot to the strategy, not only doing what's right for the business, for our customers and for our employees, but also driving those sustainably higher profits and margin.", "So with that, we're going to stop. I\u2019m going to ask the team up here and we will take your questions for the next time period.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "A - Scott Kirby", "I think Julie is going to \u2013 Julie and Mike are going to bring mics around. Maybe, to Mike? Maybe not.", "Andrew Davis", "Thanks for the update. It\u2019s Andrew Davis from T. Rowe. Scott, as you try to build regional encashment in your hubs, is there a risk that the traffic that you are going to gain from better regional fee incomes and at a lower yield than it's coming at, now, maybe for some of your competitors and the reason I asked is because American just announced some additional expansion of regional feed, there's a lot of geographic overlap between you guys and I'm just kind of concerned that is this the next frontier of competition that prevents you guys from hitting some of those targets you hit today?", "Scott Kirby", "Yeah. And I\u2019d like to answer that Andrew in a more -- in a broader perspective as well, because a lot of the questions we get are, what's the competitive response to this going to be. And I think it\u2019s a perfect way to frame this and think about it. The growth potential for United Airlines, just like for our two competitors is really about the geography of our hubs. And what happened at United is, we had years where we were shrinking, while our competitors were kind of growing 2% or 3% a year and I expect they'll continue growing kind of 2%, 3% with GDP. ", "What we're doing is frankly catching up to some of what we went negative on for years before, but it's a great example, the recent American Airlines announcement. I'll take the Northwest Florida airport, one I know that you like this go to. An American Airlines just announced service to the Northwest Florida airport. It's a really good market for United Airlines and we fly from Houston to the Northwest Florida airport. But it's a market that is almost all connecting traffic. Our largest O&D from Northwest Florida is flying to Denver and that's four passengers a day. ", "Our second largest is Los Angeles and that's two passengers a day. And the reality is, when American starts flying to Charlotte, which is well positioned to serve Northwest Florida and to Dallas, which is also well positioned to serve the Northwest Florida airport, American is going to get some share from us. They're going to -- some of those two passengers a day that fly to LA are going to now connect through Chicago -- or through Charlotte or connect through Dallas and we're going to lose that share and there's nothing we can do about it. What are we going to do, fly a non-stop flight from Northwest Florida to LA to try to protect two passengers a day and try to protect our market share in there. ", "It is just about hub geography and I think Northwest Florida is probably an exception to what I'm about to say, because it's still actually a growing market. But at the end of the day, if it wasn't a growing market, we would wind up adjusting capacity, because our demand would go down. And so I don't think the yields are really going to change in these markets, because if you're in a place now to pick a United example, like Rochester, Minnesota people, live buyers -- frequent flyers that live and travel in Rochester are basically connecting everywhere they go and they can connect in Minneapolis on Delta\u2019s hub. ", "They can connect in Chicago on American\u2019s hub and it used to just be the two of them and they probably had about 50-50 market share. And now, United is in the market and it's going to settle at a third of third of third. And the capacity is going to adjust to whatever the demand levels are. And when I talk about natural share, that's what it means. It's geography. ", "It's not some design to go take on a competitor or have an aggressive response because we have a hub in Chicago where we can connect people to hundreds of destinations and if you live in Rochester, we're well positioned geographically to serve that market. Just like in Northwest Florida, American is well positioned to serve that hub and they're going to win market share from us. But we will wind up with kind of our natural share of -- based on the geography of our hubs and the reason United Airlines has more growth opportunities than our competitors is because we not only haven\u2019t been growing with GDP for the last six or seven years, we were shrinking at the same time, our competitors were growing in those markets.", "Hunter Keay", "It\u2019s Hunter Keay at Wolfe Research. Appreciate the multi-year CASM guidance and you said it includes all labor deals going forward, you're kind of up against the sort of max that you're allowed on your scope right now, Scott and I'm wondering how you can be so confident on that cost guide, when you're probably going to need some give back and scope from your pilots to achieve some of this regional feeds you\u2019re trying to do. So how do you put a dollar amount on the amount that you're going to have to pay for likely scope relaxation? Unless you reject the premise of the question that you don't need scope relaxation?", "Scott Kirby", "Look, I start with -- I completely understand why our employees and our pilots in particular are worried about scope, because they have seen us take, as I said in the presentation, take airplanes out of a place like Rochester to Chicago and put it in Newark Atlanta. And they know that was stupid and they were right. We should not have done that. But we're now doing it the right way. We're not just asking them to believe us, we\u2019re making commitments, where actions speak louder than words. ", "We're up-gauging back in markets where we should be up-gauging and we're putting the regional jets in the right market. But our plan is predicated on having -- it's a critical element, having that high yield flow come through our hubs and we shouldn\u2019t have been finding regional jets in a market like Newark, Atlanta but we're going to have to fly regional jets in places like Rochester, Minnesota or Elmira, New York or Columbia, Missouri. We're going to have to fly regional jets because that's the size of the market and we can't grow the mainline if we don't have that high yield flow coming through hubs. ", "And so there is a win-win. The reality is, we will grow the main \u2013 the reason pilots want scope and don't want us growing is because they're worried about jobs. But we're going to create more pilot jobs by having the right kind of aircraft flying, having the right kind of regional jets flying, which then gets to the next point. In the past, we could fly 50 seaters and we've got a temporary surge in 50 seaters in 2018 because we don't have a choice today. But in the long run, we can't be flying in a market like Rochester, Minnesota with a 50-seater if our two competitors are flying two class regional jets. ", "We will have an uncompetitive product, just like we had an uncompetitive product in Newark to Atlanta for the local market, we will have an uncompetitive product for Rochester to the world and we won\u2019t stay in that market. And that's bad for the mainline, because if we can't feed that high yield revenue into the hub, then we can't make it work. And I\u2019d believe our pilots understand that. ", "Because they've been burned in the past, they're going to want some kind of commitment from us, but I think the deal winds up being, we don't need more airplanes, but we can wind up turning 50-seaters into larger regional jets, but we make some kind of commitment to them, whether it's a growth commitment or jobs or some kind of commitment that says, we're not just asking you to trust us that we're going to do the right thing, but it's not about buying scope relief. It's about addressing the issue and the issue is about jobs for them. And they've seen their jobs get outsourced and we do that. ", "That is a win-win-win for all of us, because it\u2019s something we need to do anyway as we talked about extensively in the network deck and that's a win for our pilots and that's really what they want. The protection, they're not trying to protect themselves against Rochester, Minnesota. They're trying to protect themselves against us doing that Dallas to Chicago and we shouldn't be doing it in a market like Dallas to Chicago. And so, we are talking to them and I think we're going to wind up with a win-win-win that fits within our CASM guidance. So, we wouldn\u2019t have given that CASM guidance today.", "Dan McKenzie", "Thanks for the presentation guys. Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Couple of questions here, just one housecleaning. I guess, as you provide the EPS outlook for this year, does it factor in some potential upside that\u2019s tax reform driven or is there some potential revenue upside beyond what you\u2019ve guided? And then if you could just address, I think investors are pretty shell shocked from the pricing shock that occurred in 2017. Obviously, the guide doesn't factor in, maybe you can't talk about pricing, but it would seem that, maybe that's in the in the rearview mirror?", "Andrew Nocella", "We do have in that guide of course tax reform, but we don't have anything explicit about that driving higher demand. And you guys can back into what our PRASM number is and I'm sure most of you've already done it. Some of you may have even published research reports on it already as we talked, which annoys me, because then you aren\u2019t listening, I\u2019m kidding. But we don't have anything explicit in there. We also don\u2019t have anything explicit that there's going to be another pricing and I don't think there will be. Frankly, I always bet the over. I think everyone knows that. ", "But with fuel at $2.11 a gallon, I think that chances of some bad pricing thing happening gets more than not zero, but with fuel $2.11 a gallon, which is what we've got embedded in those numbers, I think the chances of that are smaller and you can back into the numbers and recognize that our forecast kind of at an industry level is probably more conservative than some of you. ", "And I hope you're right, but we've put out a number that we feel really good about and that we think we have some ability to deal with some ups and downs that might happen. We obviously not everything, there are things that could happen that caused us to miss, but that we have some ploy in there to deal with the inevitable, something bad happened somewhere in the world. We're not going to have a perfect year. We're going to have something most years, but we could also have some good things, but we don't have anything explicit kind of from tax reform built into the numbers yet.", "Dan McKenzie", "Understood. Follow-up question. I'm wondering to what extent an up-gauge strategy in \u201918 or in \u201919 or \u201920 plays into the non-fuel cost guide. At some point, does it make sense for A319s to free up 75 seat RJs, so that those 75-seat RJs then could go, free up 50 seat RJs. Are there any 50-seat RJs that come off in your capacity purchase agreements to give you that up-gauging opportunity?", "Scott Kirby", "Couple of points I guess. First of all, the up-gauging which has been a steady upward pace over the last few years, it does pause this year, starts going up again in \u201919 and \u201920 based on our fleet plan. We do have a lot of flexibility with our regional jet contracts, particularly the 50-seater. So we do have the ability to -- we do have a lot of flexibility with that in the next couple of years. So I\u2019ll probably leave it at that as far as how that works, but we do have that. So, our hope is that we can replace 50-seaters with bigger regional jets or in some cases, it might be what you describes, maybe small narrowbody mainline airplane in its place. So stay tuned", "Mike Linenberg", "Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. So the 4% to 6% out over the next few years, I mean, they\u2019re big numbers. If -- can you talk through maybe some of the key underlying elements in those numbers, like how much of it is better utilization or productivity like Andrew, you talked about huge opportunities to improve asset efficiency. How much of that is driving the increase in ASMs as well as what percent are in and out of hubs? Is maybe all that is hub flying or are there -- are you looking to expand in to focused cities, et cetera?", "Scott Kirby", "I\u2019ll go in a reverse order, because that\u2019s one is the easiest. 100% is in and out of hubs. Our strategy is about strengthening our hub\u2019s \u2013 everything I talked about is better hubs and all of our growth is going to be in our hubs. I don't have an exact number on the breakdown of how much is utilization and -- but you can get an idea and we have better numbers for 2018. We\u2019ve done more refined analysis. You can get an idea from the chart that Andrew showed about efficiency. Those are all asset efficiency. In 2018, another way of looking at it is, I think to approximately 2 points of our growth is Hawaii and that\u2019s still real growth, but it's a different kind of growth than just flying in domestic markets. ", "And by the way, our Hawaii growth is really a lot more focused on flying from our hubs, like Denver to Hawaii and then off the West Coast, much more competitive and we have grown there too as well. And we both have a history of knowing how well those connecting hubs can work to funnel people. Again, it\u2019s funneling people through the hub and -- but two points in 2018 are from that. A big chunk of our growth in 2018 is actually this temporary surge in regional jets, which doesn't last. ", "So there's every year there will be kind of those explanations, but you can get to pretty good numbers from looking at Andrew\u2019s chart on the utilization, both of aircraft and gates and employees, just to get a good mix that you look at this year and at least half is kind of that kind of utilization type of line that's really efficient on the assets. And even the stuff that's not explicit in that category winds up fitting somewhat in that category, just because we aren\u2019t adding gates anywhere in 2018. And I suspect in \u201919 and \u201920, we will have a picture that looks a lot similar, in a lot of ways similar to that. With more gauge, one of the things that\u2019s going to drive it in \u201919 and \u201920 is also gate as well.", "Andrew Nocella", "And then Scott, just to add onto that, some of the new routes that you're flying, some of these longer haul are ultra long haul flights that you're adding where you have because of your hubs, you're probably uniquely positioned of any US carrier to fly, say a Houston-Sydney or an LA-Singapore. I get that Houston-Sydney obviously competes with Dallas-Sydney with Quantas so for flow traffic, but it does seem like that that's also driving a sizeable chunk of the ASM growth. And again, there's nobody else really in some of those markets, they are very unique. You're the only game in town.", "Scott Kirby", "That's a really good point. And you're right. I mean, Houston-Sydney, I don't know the exact percentage, but it's probably a high single digit percentage of our ASMs in 2018. From a single route, then it\u2019s an example of -- and it\u2019s an example of the power of a hub. I mean, literally, 85% of the people on Houston-Sydney are going to be connecting from other destinations and it's a phenomenal route, because if you live on the East Coast, if you live in Oklahoma City or New Orleans, today, if you want to go to Australia, you basically have to fly to the West Coast and at least in one direction, spend the night, check into a hotel near LA or San Francisco and spend the night. ", "But if you're going through Houston, you can do day trips each direction. And so it is for the whole rest of the country flying through a hub like Houston is the most efficient way to get there and it's just an example of the power of a hub and utilizing the power of the hub, not just for the domestic network, which we focus on today, but even for great international opportunities, because you would never fly that without the power of a hub behind it, supporting that market.", "Jamie Baker", "Good evening. Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. So 2017 was supposed to be the transition year, margin contraction and various reasons that at sort of this time last year, you were talking about that. The problem is the midpoint of the guide for 2018 implies another year of margin contraction, but obviously the ambitious 2020 guide speaks to the potential for margins to inflect. So my question really is, when is the transition year -- transitioning to higher margins instead of lower margins and what are the most important drivers of that from tonight's presentation, because it's not really clear to me the timing or the contribution and you're guiding down again year-on-year, when and what really drives the inflection, give us some confidence there?", "Andrew Levy", "Well, I think we\u2019re guiding to essentially flat next year and that's what the $1.6 billion fuel headwind. That's the difference in 2018. And we've got an embedded assumption of industry revenue and forecast was in our number, which we aren\u2019t going to tell you, but you can probably back into it and figure it out. And I think most of you have a more ambitious forecast and I hope you're right. And look, I think, you can make the case that particularly with fuel at $2.11 a gallon, revenues will come in better. But we are conscious of the fact that fuel prices are up $1.6 billion this year. And are we going to be able to pass through 100% of that or not, because essentially that's the math, because we've got flat to slightly -- flat to down CASM. So when fuel goes up 106 billion, we got to drive 1.6 billion on the revenue side. ", "We got to drive it all on the revenue side and that's a pretty big decline when you think about it from that perspective and that's how we get to the numbers. Our margins frankly inflect and get better, because the curve is slightly backwardated and you're continuing to drive flat to down CASM with higher RASM. It's just -- it's math. And we have created numbers that are probably more conservative than you have. Others will have numbers that we feel good about making a commitment to you that we feel confident, we are not 100%, can never be 100%, but that we believe we can hit even when we get thrown some curve balls going forward.", "Kevin Crissey", "Kevin Crissey at Citi. So Scott, how does the low cost competition in your hubs affect your ability to drive the margins that maybe Delta sees and some of the hubs that maybe has less LCC competition in the hubs? How does that affect?", "Scott Kirby", "It matters. The best way to be able -- first the best way to compete with a low cost carrier is master prices. Half our revenue approximately comes from customers that are mostly shopping on price. And we cannot ignore half of our revenue and we can't let our low cost carriers have price advantages in our hubs and no one chooses to fly on an ultra low cost carrier, if they can get the same price on United Airlines. Nobody, at least, if they know what they\u2019re buying and so it's entirely within our control whether they succeed or fail in our hubs. ", "And our advantage that we have when we compete with them and the advantage that Delta has that\u2019s better than us is high connectivity, because if you can fill an airplane with 80% connecting revenues in a market, then they're left competing for 20% of the market and they cannot succeed in that environment, but the higher your percentage of local revenue is, the more able they are to compete, because they're just competing for local revenues in the market. ", "So we're going to be \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to have an aggressive competitive posture vis-\u00e0-vis ultra low cost carriers, but the biggest strength we have is the connectivity of our hubs and the higher that connectivity is, the harder it is for them to succeed. I mean, look at a place like Charlotte, no low cost carriers in Charlotte, because it's so much connecting revenue that the local market is too small, is too small of a percentage for them to try to pick off even big markets. And that's one of the benefits that we get as we grow connectivity and our hubs.", "Kevin Crissey", "Thanks. And if I could follow up with a second one. Andrew, this is for you. Like, I try to come up with kind of rules of thumb, things that work in the industry from talking to airlines around the history and one of the things when you were at Allegiant was that you adjusted your schedule really aggressively, seasonally and day of the week. Why is it different, the economics of that different at United than it is, at say Allegiant?", "Andrew Nocella", "Well, I think, they are two completely different businesses. I mean, just in every single respect, the business I was with, we built it to do exactly what it did. So we have a very high variable cost, a very low fixed cost. This is the exact opposite. We have very high fixed costs with not a lot of ability to vary them. So it's just completely different economics and the only thing that matters is that your RASM exceeds your CASM. So the marginal RASM is to exceed your marginal CASM, which drives profits, we think that the right thing to do here is what we've outlined today and we expect that it will work -- it will drive margin and it's just \u2013 it\u2019s kind of night and day from what I've been involved in the past.", "Unidentified Analyst", "[indiscernible]. Just looking at the ASM growth and all the things you\u2019ve said, there's a lot of moving pieces here, but should we assume that domestic ASM growth over the three year period will exceed international or is there no assumption we should be making in that at all?", "Scott Kirby", "That's our expectation that domestic will be higher than international. I would expect international to, over a long time horizon, sort of be growing with GDPish. In any given year, it might go up or down because as Mike pointed out earlier, you add one route, then it\u2019s a full point of growth. So in any given year, it might be a little different. But over -- if you smooth it out over time, it's probably going to look GDPish.", "Savanthi Syth", "Savanthi Syth from Raymond James. Just on the growth again. If I look at 2017, it looks like if I look at your competitors, much of their growth was small mid-markets, but if I look at United, the growth was kind of large, small, mid pretty evenly. As you look in to 2018, \u201919, \u201920, how is that growth mix? Is that going to be similar in the next few years?", "Scott Kirby", "It will and in fact, they\u2019ll start this year as we have more regional jets coming. It will be probably more biased towards small markets, but what's really happening is, we're displacing -- the reason it looks like that in 2017 is we\u2019re displacing regional jets in the big markets, because today, we're flying regional jets in big markets and we're displacing them. So, it\u2019s a huge increase in percentage ASMs in a market like Newark to Atlanta or Dallas to Chicago. As you go back to the kind of airplane we had six or seven years ago, and you put the right airplane on it. And that will continue, but because we're taking more shelves of regional jets, there would probably be a little \u2013 there be more, a disproportionate amount that's moving into the small and medium sized markets, as there is more shelves available to do that kind of line.", "Savanthi Syth", "Just a follow-up on the fixed cost question, is there any kind of discussion to rethink how the labor contracts are written where you can imagine close to the reality today, which is that the US is a mature market and to maybe have more less of a treadmill or more even seasonal flexibility where you don't \u2013 where your minimums are a lot lower in the kind of off peaks and you can have a higher kind of time spent in that peak?", "Scott Kirby", "I think the short answer is yes. There is a desire to give ourselves more flexibility to manage through the seasonality in a way that's more cost effective than what we are able to do today, but you have to -- you do have to take the employee perspective into account and these are people who live on their salaries. And if there's a -- we try to do with things like voluntary leaves and we can do a lot, because there is a lot of people that are willing to take voluntary leaves and willing to fly less in certain months, because it\u2019s good for their life. But you can't have the kind of 22% decline that we have -- we don't have that many people to do it. And we're not going to get contractual flexibility, we can just say to people big change in your life in January compared to the rest of the year. It\u2019s going to have to be something that works for each of our unions before we\u2019ll get it done.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Hi. Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Oscar, a question for you. You came to investors and provided some healthy targets but then things started to move around as it relates to capacity and some of the other goals, how do you assure investors that that doesn't happen this time around? And then I have a follow up for Andrew.", "Oscar Munoz", "Thank you for asking me a question. I was feeling lonely up here. Kind of building transparency, we use the words constantly. I think the EPS targets are the best measure as we\u2019ve talked about. We've gone through the absolute versus relative. We did the Investor Day a year ago. It was hard to try. A lot of the feedback we got from all of you that it was just difficult. And so we thought the best way to do it is just to go to EPS and not only do it for the year, but for -- give you an hour target as well. So that's how you can measure us and that\u2019s how we measure ourselves and that's what the guardrails are for us to make sure that all the decisions we make stay within that or above it as you might think.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Thanks for that. And then Andrew, can you just provide a walk of your old CASM guide to the new CASM guide and what impact does capacity have? Trying to get sort of an underlying clean number as far as what's changed versus before on a three year look?", "Andrew Levy", "Yeah. Every time you say Andrew, I have to wait to hear what the question is to see which Andrew. So, the short answer is, I don't have a quick answer to give you. I can tell you that old CASM guide, I think you're referring to what we talked about at Investor Day, which was not -- I wouldn't characterize it as a guide. I think what we're giving you day is a commitment that we're making. That is very different than what we talked about in November 16. So I think that's important to point out. That was a three-year view that we felt we would be between flat and 1% based on an assumed rate of capacity, which was a complete theoretical assumed rate of capacity. ", "I think we made it very clear that that's all that was. The reality is not much has changed since then. I can honestly say, I think, adding regional jets, that's something that's different. We didn't expect that to happen when we came up with those numbers back in the \u2013 it was probably early November of 2016 when we put those numbers to bed. So I think that's probably the single biggest change that's occurred, but as we talked about, we have a better appreciation for the opportunities that we have to drive productivity and higher levels of efficiency, which really is a -- that is a huge part of the CASM story. ", "I mean, there's other things too. We're scrutinizing our expenses in a level that we haven't done at least in a while, I'm told, having been still a relative newcomer, but we just went through a very rigorous budgeting process to try to make sure we understand we're spending our money on and eliminate areas where we can instill, de liver great product for our customers. But we can work with the offline to try to give you a bridge, but we didn't have one prepared at the moment, although I think that realistically, it's really the regionals for the most part. Everything else is pretty much the same, for the good guys on the productivity.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Good afternoon, everyone. This is Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. So hate to be critical, two earnings calls in a row here, but look, there's a lot of investors here that look at the group and say, these stocks are at least optically cheap on today's earnings, but a lot of folks won't buy your stock because the belief is we're on a long term trajectory to just dilute margins and take profits right back to breakeven and you have problems with balance sheets looking forward. So a lot of analysts in this room believe things are truly different this time, but Oscar, I hate to say it, just feels like this meeting is again contradictory. I think you opened it up saying the focus at United is on margins. ", "That was clearly the message in 2016 as well. And I think the problem that people have measuring this is because you widened the margin gap in 2017 with a strategy that was outgrowing the market. We show up today, it will take the strategies again to most likely outgrow the market that's based on your own forecast, it looks like revenue underperforming cost performance, so margins again are likely to track below the industry, so the gap is going to widen for a second year in a row and what is a very robust economy so where is the confidence that you can instill in your investor base that we can believe those 2020 targets are actually achievable from here with a strategy that seems for the next three years to be a repeat of what we've already seen?", "Oscar Munoz", "I would just quibble with the optics of what you just said, this plan -- the details of this plan, the aggressive guide with regards to CASM, I think we are very confident and focused on that and I think as we accomplish. I think what Scott said earlier and what we're comfortable with and giving you at this point in time, so indeed we don't sort of provide numbers that are maybe too high and we lose confidence. I think it's important to know that what we have in front of you is a pretty darn good plan. I think the growth aspect of it as it's been outlined and the component pieces of it and the reasons why and the profitability there in, I think are important and doable. ", "We've already, and starting in the fourth quarter, our CASM experience has been great. So we are norming and forming a team that's really getting at the bowels of this. And so I wouldn\u2019t project this plan and this guide and this outline in any way, but a really positive view and you may disagree with me on that as well, but I'm not going to defend our numbers in any other way other than the details are here. I've been in this industry for a long time and I've never seen and you\u2019re not seeing the level of detail that we see with regards to Andrew Nocella who hasn't been asked a question either. ", "So we\u2019d get to you. The level of detail, OD pair, ordering by destination with the profitability expectation of where we're growing, how it measures up, it's the work that we did in our summer program and is the peak that was one of the first concerns about capacity was we went back and looked at it really hard as to hub, are we better off after that summer peak of growth than we would have. We were significantly better off. And so from my perspective, as I harness the energy of this team is, is growth good? It is in the right places at the right time in the right way. ", "Would that gain us profitability? We've done different model at different numbers and this is where we have come out that it has the highest profitability and then we control the things that we can, which is CASM and that's what we've done. We give money back to share owners. So we're confident about this plan and we're going to -- the trick is to deliver on it and margin contraction, the 1.6 billion of fuel that we\u2019re overlapping, I think when you take all of the things into account, it's better than you -- I would tell you that it's better than you think. You may think differently, but we're going to be very focused and energetic and communicating this in a very positive way to our company, so that we deliver.", "Brandon Oglenski", "If I could just follow up with Scott too, I think you said 4% to 6% capacity growth for the next three years. Is that right?", "Scott Kirby", "I said 4 to 6 and similar in \u201919 and \u201920.", "Brandon Oglenski", "Okay. Now look, I'm just an analyst, I don't run anything. So I definitely respect your opinions on the hubs and where your opportunities are in the network. But as investors and analysts agree to believe that at some point this plan is going to result in stimulation in your natural share, such that your revenue is going to significantly outperform your markets and I just want to ask that in the context of your Rochester example that you'd spoke a lot about, because I think it was a very right question that aren't you just going to be taking flow off from some of your competitors, so what's the competitive response going to be? I think your response was that the ASMs will sort themselves out between the competitors. So do you believe that incrementally you're going to win at the expense of some of your larger domestic competitors?", "Scott Kirby", "Look, I\u2019ll let you say it that way. And I won\u2019t characterize it that way. I think all of our hubs, if you grow them to their fair size, you're going to win your fair share of those small markets. And just like we will not be able to defend all of our market share from the Northwest Florida airport. Our two competitors can't defend all their market share from Rochester because it's just a function of the geography and the connecting hub that you are flying into. And as sort of Andrew showed in your numbers, we think in year one, those come in at lower than system average RASM, as you're moving into a market and the same would be true at our competitors. ", "What's different at United is, we\u2019ve spent years shrinking, while our competitors were growing. And we're not going to say that\u2019s the new baseline and we're not going to accept 10 margin point lower profitability in our mid-continent hubs. I mean, that's the key. And growing our hubs to have the kind of connectivity that our competing hubs have, I don't think by the way we\u2019ll get all the way there. There's reasons if we want to talk about the specifics hub by hub, we won't get all the way there, but we'll get close on the profitability of those mid-continent hubs by driving higher connectivity in those hubs. ", "We absolutely, I mean, really it is math. We will get close in those hubs and we will always have higher profit margins in our international gateways. And that's what's going to drive profitability for United in the long run. And even in the near term, as we do that. Now, there will be times, there will be quarters where stuff happens. I mean, you look at, like we have one bad -- really bad quarter this year, the third quarter, where every exogenous event happened in that quarter, whether it was Guam hurricane, Pacific weakness as you also see price war that lasts for three months and we had some self-inflicted wounds in the same quarter. But that doesn't make the trend for what the fundamental strategy. ", "And the whole point we were trying to say today on laying out the network strategy is the intellectual rationale for what we're doing. And I would fundamentally disagree with some of the statements that preceded the question about our under performance in 2017 was about growth. That wasn't the issue. It was a whole bunch of other stuff. We did have issues. It was a whole bunch of other stuff, but it wasn't about the growth and the growth, particularly for growing in places like we're growing, one of the other issues in \u201917 was lots of competitive capacity. We think it was happening in San Francisco and other places. Our growth and strengthening our hubs is absolutely the critical, essential element to driving higher absolute and relative margins at United and that's just -- I'm absolutely certain of that.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Darryl Genovesi, UBS. Thank you. Scott, it's true that I can back in your RASM forecast, it's also true that I have. I guess what I can't necessarily see is what your underlying macro economic assumptions are and by the same token, I can\u2019t see how you sort of view your own RASM performance over the next few years relative to the industry. So can you kind of help us understand that and also try to help us understand kind of sensitivities around your underlying assumptions?", "Scott Kirby", "So Andrew tried to hint at it without giving you specific number, so I'm going to hint as well without giving you specific numbers. We know that growing faster in the short term drives lower relative RASM. We know that higher competitive capacity growth in our markets drives lower relative RASM. We do have a lot of tailwinds. Andrew talked about them, Gemini being probably the biggest one segmentation, but those aren't necessarily -- I mean I think a lot of those are relative tailwinds because we're behind where our competitors are. But those aren't just relative tail -- those are tailwinds relative to not doing anything, but it doesn't necessarily -- our competitors aren\u2019t going to sit still. ", "Delta and the American didn't fire their whole yield management teams, just sit on their hands with your management systems. I think our 1.2 points that we're already seeing from that is going to be meaningfully better than they get, but they're not going to be zero. And so we try to give you a flavor, we do have specific numbers that we have internally. But we're not going to talk about our growth forecast, but you can \u2013 I mean you can do the math and get -- probably within a reasonable range of what we think our relative performance is going to be, given what we have said. ", "And look, I know because I\u2019ve read all of your reports. I know what you forecast that we are more conservative at a macro level and I hope you're right. But again, what we don't want to do is put an aggressive forecast out here today that things are going really well and we missed the absolute forecast. We're trying to make absolute commitments to you here today. And while I said before, we're not 100% certain we'll get there. We feel like we can deliver on these numbers in 2018 and on 2020. And we want to be able to deliver and so we're probably more conservative than you and I hope you're right.", "Darryl Genovesi", "Oscar, just a quick one. How frequently are you intending on updating this guidance?", "Oscar Munoz", "We haven't talked about it. I think, we are definitely going to give you every quarter an update on everything we\u2019re doing. Our EPS doesn't track ratably or sort of move around, but I think every quarter and possibly sometime two or three quarters down, I think it would be important to give you a sense, the scorecard that we have out there and other scorecards that we have. So we'll be a lot more visible, I think, more importantly, you'll see certainly me a little bit more often with either Andrew Levy or Scott with all of you investors that we've been focusing, I've been focusing on a lot of things and a lot of places and I think I had a key learning on the year, especially towards the tail end is that this part of our world is incredibly important. And then so we'll give you the updates as we see, but mostly -- hopefully we just want to give you some good results that track along the things that we're doing, which is why we're putting those EPS targets out there.", "David Vernon", "David Vernon with Bernstein. Scott, I really appreciate the color on what you need to do to build out the network and manufacture that connectivity. Can you give us a sense for how the financial returns from that strategy will pay off as you implement it? I imagine, you're expecting a little bit lower load factors, you mentioned before that yield should be okay. How do you think the cadence of the payoff from the strategy is going to play out between \u201918 and \u201920?", "Scott Kirby", "So actually, growing the network ought to drive higher load factors. You look like if that was Vegas example and you put ten more options for connectivity, it ought to do two things, especially as we get the yield management system tuned. One on peak demand days during the summer, we can spill off some of the lower loads because it was just, city X had the lowest yield and now city Y, one of the new ten cities has higher yields and we can take the city Y passengers into city X. But also in off peak periods, you can now fill -- where you run a 70% load factor today, you can run a 75% load factor because you have more demand. ", "So the hub stuff ought to drive higher demand. The place where we have a lower load factors is what Andrew talked about, which is on the yield management system, which we had a built in bias in the yield management system to dramatically under forecast. And when you're under forecasting demand, you're saying there's fewer people left to come. And so even in your peak period, you're selling too soon. You're selling out far in advance. And so what's happened now, as we've got the yield management system is you're not selling as many seats far in advance and that leaves more seats to be sold close in, which are at much higher yield as Andrew pointed out, two point higher yield in the test, but since you ran a point lower load factor, because you didn't see all of those.", "David Vernon", "I made I guess \u2013 I heard your response to the first question around the yields not necessarily taking ahead from growing the capacity, and if load factors are going to go up and \u2013", "Scott Kirby", "That was really a competitive question about what's going to happen when we add service into these small cities. And I don't think, I think ultimately capacity doesn't happen overnight, but I think capacity in those small city adjusts to the level of demand. None of the big network carriers go into small cities and try -- or any cities and try to stimulate demand by lowering prices. The pricing structure when we went, as we've gone into small cities and we've gone into a bunch of them in the last year, the pricing structure never changed. ", "What changes is there's more capacity and demand changes and moves across airlines and it's not like some executive sitting on a table like this, says, oh, because American Airlines started flying to Northwest Florida, let's go cut one flight. It happens from the bottom up, because you see -- we'll see less demand than we otherwise would have seen in Houston to Northwest Florida and I'll never even know what happened and Andrew won\u2019t know what happened, but somehow, capacity will adjust because we've lost demand in that market and our system and our processes and our scheduling department will make those adjustments. ", "This is really a competitive question and I get the competitive question all the time about our growth. And I know it's complicated. People don\u2019t like the natural share answer, but it really is and it really is about geography and we're not the only ones getting our natural share. It's just that we start further behind and because we start further behind, we have more near term growth to make up until we get back to where we were seven, eight years ago relative to Delta and American.", "David Vernon", "And maybe just Andrew as a quick follow, I commend your confidence in putting a narrower guidance range out in 2020 than for 2018. Can you give us a sense for what are the assumptions around economic growth, oil price when you build that long term forecast, like what do you have to believe that you can't control to put those numbers, those $11, $12 numbers in play.", "Andrew Levy", "And I think what you might have been asking is I think is kind of what\u2019s your 2019 number? Is this the hockey stick, because you talked about the cadence I guess. I think that, I t think we gave you a fuel number or you'll see a fuel number in there. It\u2019s $2.11. It uses the forward curve. It is slightly backwardated. So we get some benefits in \u201919 and \u201920. As far as GDP, we haven't shared that. I will tell you that we\u2019re not assuming anything out of the ordinary. I think it would be fair to say, so we\u2019re not assuming a recessionary environment or acceleration of growth, but we're using forecasts from companies that we\u2019ve hired to give us long term macroeconomic forecasts. So, and I'm not sure if there's another part to your question. But I mean those are some of the \u2013 CASM, we talked a little bit about that. I mean, we\u2019ve tried to give you a sense as to what we're going to do in \u201918 and to get better in \u201919 and \u201920. I mean, it's not a 20-20, every year, we're going to do that. And you get to the number, so you can make the assumptions about RASM.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks. Might be a better question for the board, but I wanted to ask you about the incentives in these earnings targets, which are positive, but to the extent that those are actually tied to your incentive comp. So there were some important changes made last year, where it moved much more to a relative margin expansion. I think the waiting on ROIC and ROIC improvement actually went down. And if memory serves, it was a 2017, 2018 measurement period, which feels like this would be the payoff year. So the question is, do you see those formulas changing and are you explicitly going to link your compensation to these earning star gets that you\u2019ve offered today?", "Andrew Levy", "Yeah. The relative aspect has always been part of it that will continue to be that way. These particular targets, obviously, we're just rolling them out are comfortable and will meet here in the next month or so on established targets going forward. So of course, they will be tied with. The only other changes I think we're seeing now is on the customer service angle, that\u2019s going to amplify those a little bit. And so, the board is still -- the company is still working through that. So I don't want to get ahead of them in what they're thinking. But relative margin is and will continue to be a big part of our long term incentive plan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Not explicit earnings.", "Andrew Levy", "Again, I don't think so, because we haven't, but again the complement, you will have to work through that. I don\u2019t want to commit them.", "Joe DeNardi", "Joe DeNardi, Stifel. Scott, one of the areas of the business where you don't have to worry about competitive response is the credit card. We\u2019ve talked in the past, it\u2019s about 1.5 margin headwind for you guys. What's the strategy for closing that?", "Scott Kirby", "So, look two things. First, I would quibble with the start because it is competitive. And Houston where the natural player if you're Houston, Denver to have the credit card, but in the rest of the country and there is a bunch of markets that are jump balls. If you're in Kansas, if you're in any of the cities that aren't hubs, it's a jump ball and the kind of people that get frequent -- get the credit -- airline credit cards are the kind of people that travel and need to fly. ", "And they have a -- not -- just like a Houston based customer is naturally biased to have the United Airlines credit card, a Kansas City or Wilmington, North Carolina customer as a natural bias to have the credit card of the airline that is biggest in that city, because that gives them the most optionality for flying. And so it is a competitive issue. It's not just about our RASM. We underperform and we would expect us to underperform in places that aren\u2019t our hubs, because if we're number three, it's harder to get, it's harder for our customer to have the rationale to [indiscernible]. So competitive position matters, not just for the hub scale and passenger revenue, but it matters for the credit card.", "The second issue that we do have is, I think, in spite of that, we have a real opportunity to grow the number of customers that are signing up for a card. It is one of our big initiatives. We didn\u2019t talk about today. It is one of the things that Andrew and his team are working really hard on. I am too. And look, Andrew Nocella and I \u2013 we\u2019ve said a bunch of times today, we're not reinventing the oil. We\u2019ve both been involved at our two previous airline and step function increases in the card revenues at those airlines and it's not exactly the same situation, it\u2019s not exactly the same playbook here, but we do have a good partner in Chase and Jamie Baker just ensured me he is going to help me get this done and, but we have a very partner. ", "But we've got to work through it and we're two big companies and I wish it was happening faster, but we are working with them to drive particularly higher originations and higher card signups for us with Chase and we have some ways that we have some cards in our hand to help make that happen. It really is twofold. We can do a better job with our existing relationship and if we're small in all these small cities, we're behind the eight ball in trying to get people to sign up for our card.", "Michael Leskinen", "I've been reminded that we have a cocktail event. So I know there are a lot of questions and all of our executives are going to stay in the room for the next hour plus for questions.
