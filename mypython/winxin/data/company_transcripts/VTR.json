At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would like to turn the conference over to Ryan Shannon, Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Ryan Shannon", "Thanks, Liane. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017. As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.", "The projections, predictions, and statements are based on management's current beliefs, as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events.

Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Ryan. And good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas third quarter earnings call. We are very pleased with our results this quarter, our prospects for the full year and the accelerated execution on our strategic priorities.", "Today, I'll touch briefly on our positive performance and full year guidance, highlight the extraordinary recent efforts of our leading care providers to keep residence and patients safe during natural disasters, introduce some exciting opportunities we are pursuing and conclude with the few words on public policy and the excellent cohesive Ventas team. Following Bob's review of our financial results, we will be delighted to take your questions.", "At Ventas, we continue to focus on delivering reliable cash flows from a diversified portfolio of high quality assets on a strong balance sheet. The third quarter continued our patterns of resilient results as we grew normalized FFO to $1.04 per share, driven principally by increased property NOI and accretive investments. During and following the quarter, we recognized over $500 million in games and sale mostly from our accelerated exit from the skilled nursing business with attractive pricing.", "Our financial strength improved as well with enhanced liquidity and even better credit stats sequentially. We are also delighted to improve our full year expectations for company-wide same-store NOI growth by 25 basis points to 2% to 2.5%. This improvement and property NOI growth expectations enables us to maintain the midpoint of our normalized FFO per share guidance range, despite the previously announced $0.04 reduction in earnings impact from our accelerated SNF sales. Our resilient diverse portfolio gives us confidence.", "Now, I'd like to take a moment to focus on the recent natural disasters and the tremendous efforts of our operating partners who is employees and executives kept residence and patients safe. Thanks to the excellent preparation and actions taken by care providers including Atria, Kindred and Brookdale, all residence, patients and personnel remain secure through evacuations, flooding, hurricanes and wild fires.", "Emergency preparedness and evacuation for seniors and an acutely ill patients is logistically complex, complicated further by dangers and impediments based by on the ground caregivers and their family. In the face of extreme conditions, the level of heroics and personnel sacrifice by employees of our business markets was overwhelming and humbling.", "Successful disaster preparation, effect evacuations and secure sheltering in place, our examples of why we play such a high emphasis on doing business with financially strong, capable and caring business partners.", "I am happy to report that virtually all of our communities and facilities are back to normal and on behalf of all of us at Ventas, I'd like to thank those in the executive offices and on the front line who kept residence and patients safe.", "The natural disasters also highlight the value proposition and health wellness advantage of senior housing. That message seems to be resonating as demand and penetration rates nationally continue to rise and more individuals are choosing to live in community based senior housing.", "We are also hardened by other positive trends. In the third quarter, construction starts in senior housing fell to about half their level from two years ago at the cyclical peak. In fact this was the third consecutive quarter where starts improve significant from the same period two years ago.", "So as we work through the timing mismatch in certain market between deliveries and operator execution, we know there is a powerful upside in senior housing when the growth rate of the senior populations accelerate.", "Turning to strategic decisions, we want to give you early insight into two exciting opportunities we are actively working on. Our proposed venture with institutional investor and the creating of a new relationship with an experience and highly regarded senior housing management team.", "First, we intent to form a new joint venture with an institutional partner on a senior living portfolio we currently own continue over 70 communities. The portfolio is currently operated by Elmcroft Senior Living under a Master Lease with the Company. We are in detailed preliminary discussions and look forward to partnering leading global capital source on a successful joint venture.", "The joint venture will continue diversifying our capital sources and could expand to provide a competitive advantage as the company continues to grow. Second, we formed a strategic Kai Hsiao and his long time colleagues on the creation of a new senior housing operator. With over 50 years of combined experience across senior housing, this management team has a demonstrated track record of success and value creation. To see the new company, we intend to transition operations of the Elmcroft portfolio to Kai and his team, whose company will be a valuable addition to our existing operator relationships.", "While we still have a lot of work to do to finalize these attractive potential transactions, we are well down the path and expect to complete them in early 2018. We believe the benefits to Ventas will include further diversification of capital sources, capital recycling for either get pay down or reinvestment, expansion of our relationships with X1 operators and the ability to capture this powerful upside from the portfolio overtime.", "Turning to our attractive office portfolio of university base life sciences and medical office buildings which now comprises 25% of our NOI. It is a fantastic example of Ventas value creation and our continued investment opportunities. Bob will discuss the good performance and outstanding metrics of our MOBs and I'll highlight the momentum and our exciting institutional life sciences vertical.", "Since our initial investment of $1.5 billion in September 2016, we have already expanded this business by over a third and our pipeline of attractive opportunities continues to grow. University based life science and innovation centers remained a number one capital allocation priority.", "Here is some key updates. Recently we welcomed anchor tenants and top tier research universities Duke and Brown to our Class-A Chesterfield and South Street Landing buildings. The Chesterfield is already 85% leased and South Street Landing is a 100%. It is really awesome to see buildings that began as tobacco factories and power plants experience world-class renovations that repurposed them for cutting hedge health, innovation and research uses.", "We are further building out our institutional life science business through development and acquisition with existing university relationships and newly created ones. Recently we committed $60 million to develop a research and innovation center. It is 80% preleased to Brown University, Johnson & Johnson Cambridge Innovation Center. The project recently broke ground on the development site we own near South Street Landing.", "We expect this market to continue gaining traction as a medical research and innovation hub, speared by increasing interest from universities, academic medical centers, entrepreneurs and major companies.", "In addition to growth with our existing university base, we are also expanding to other university campuses in our life science business. We expect to acquire another cash flowing Class-A life science and innovation center affiliated with a AA rated university that is a top recipient of NIH funding and a recent awardee of a Gates Foundation grant to support its ground breaking work. This property is 82% occupied and we expect occupancy and NOI to further increase.", "As I discussed in our last few calls, healthcare and senior housing assets are highly covered by investors of all types including REITs, pension funds, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and other institutional capital. Global demand for cash flowing real estate with strong forward demographic demand continues unabated.", "As a result there is strong bid across the board for assets in our verticals making them more valuable than they have ever been. The low cap rates paid in several recent MOB transactions is a strong point.", "Within that environment, we are happy to note that we've already invested $1.4 billion this year at unlevered going in cash yields in the mid-sevens. And our investment pipeline is robust not only in life science but across other asset classes. Consistent with our recent approach, we are carefully picking our spot and allocation capital where we have a strategic objective, a competitive advantage or a customer relationship. We also continue to invest in our future growth by funding selective ground up developments and redevelopment projects at attractive risk adjusted returns.", "I'm also delighted to report on the significant stride we have made on environmental, social and governments matters where Ventas' leadership was recently recognized by two permanent organizations.", "We're included for the first time in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ranking in the upper quartile of all North American real estate company across a broad spectrum of ESG metrics. And Ventas ranks first among three listed healthcare re-participants in the 2017 GRESB real estate ESG assessment.", "Turning to public policy, as I stated last quarter, Washington focus has moved squarely and almost exclusively to tax reform which could have significant consequences for public and private real estate companies.", "As an industry associated with 20% of the country's GDP, real estate has an important role to play in furthering sustainable economic growth, capital formation and job creation.", "At Ventas, we are focusing principally on pasture rates in the treatment of reaching their shareholders, potential limits on interest expense deductibility, state and local tax treatment, 1031 exchanges and reform or repeal. We are highly engaged in the policy debate and closely monitoring the tax legislation as it evolve.", "I believe that tax reform are simply tax cuts have a higher chance of passage than major healthcare reform did or does. While this specific outcomes of tax reform are too early to call, we are ready to optimize our opportunities as soon as the final framework emerges.", "And that brings to my final point. Ventas has successfully managed through different capital markets, healthcare, political and economic cycle successfully for nearly 20 years. That's because of our aligned skilled teams, whether with macro forces like the financial crisis, industry trends like changes reimbursement, investment opportunities in immerging areas like medical office, Canadian senior housing or university life science or specific cases like our Kindred 2013 and 2015 lease maturities. The Ventas team has consistently stayed ahead of the curve and driven superior outcomes for shareholders. And questionably our strong culture and excellent experience people create a winning competitive hedge and underpin our long term growth, reliability and performance.", "With that I am happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst.", "Robert Probst", "Thanks Debby. Our high quality portfolio showed continued momentum in the third quarter with all segments contributing to a 2.1% overall growth rate versus prior year. With solid year-to-date performance, we are updating and improving our same-store growth outlooks for the year by 25 basis points at the midpoint.", "Let me unpack these results for the quarter. Starting with our triple-net business, which represents 38% of our NOI. The triple-net portfolio grew same-store cash NOI by an attractive 3.8% for the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by in-place lease escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net lease portfolio for the second quarter of 2017, believe its available information, health study at 1.6 times sequentially. In our triple-net seniors housing portfolio, trailing 12 months, same-store EBIT arm coverage was steady at 1.3 times. With the majority of our NOI, clustered around the portfolio coverage average.", "We view seniors housing triple-net coverage of 1.2 to 1.4 times to be within normal market ranges through cycles. Our strong lease protections and diversification also provide additional security.", "As Debbie mentioned earlier, given our intention to enter into a joint venture for over 70 senior housing assets currently lease to Elmcroft, we are now excluding these assets from our triple-net coverage and same-store supplemental reporting in current and prior periods.", "In our post-acute business, IRF and LTAC coverage declined in the quarter by 10 basis points sequentially to 1.6 times, driven by rent increases, the continued impact of the LTAC reimbursement change and labor wage pressures. We expect to realize the benefits of patient criteria mitigation in our coverage ratio starting in the first half of 2018.", "Having now received the majority of the proceeds from the sales our Kindred SNFs, skilled nursing will soon represent just 1% of Vantas' NOI. SNF industry volume and mix headwinds continue to lower coverage in the segments. However, our remaining SNF portfolio has very healthy lease protections that provide additional security and rent reliability.", "Finally, Ardent delivered terrific performance in the first half of 2017 with volume, revenue and EBITDA improvements ranking among the top performers in the industry. At the asset level for the Ventas properties, rent coverage remained stable at three times in Q2. Ardent integration of the LHP Hospital is right on track and budgeted synergies are being realized. With encouraging year-to-date triple-net results, we are raising our full year 2017 triple-net same store NOI guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint to now grow between 3% and 3.5%.", "Moving on to our senior housing operating portfolio. We are pleased with our SHOP results in a third quarter, growing same store cash NOI by 0.6% versus prior year. Continued profit growth in the context of industry-wide challenges underscores the quality and resilience of our portfolio and the strength of our operators.", "Looking at the SHOP P&L, occupancy increased sequentially by 40 basis points to 88.7% in the third quarter. As expected, the Q3 year-over-year occupancy gap widened to 230 basis points versus the 200 basis point gap we saw in the second quarter, driven by the impact of continued new competition in select markets.", "Encouragingly, rate growth was solid in the quarter at nearly 4% which was ahead of our expectations. Rate increases and the high barrier-to-entry markets continue to trend southerly above our portfolio average, while rate in markets with new supply is also growing overall despite price competition.", "Our operators also did an excellent job of cost containment in the third quarter. Overall expense increases where health just 1.7% despite continued wage pressures.", "In addition to flexing labor with occupancy, our operators held non-labor costs essentially flat. Reduced performance incentives also benefited the quarter. At a market level, we continue to see momentum in high barrier-to-entry locations such as Los Angeles, Boston and Toronto which drove very strong top and bottom line results. Performance in Canada continues to grow from strength to strength, growing NOI approximately 10% in the quarter, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit gains.", "Partially offsetting the strength was performance in geographies affected by new competition most notably within secondary markets. While still at elevated levels, new openings in the third quarter were delayed relative to Nick projections. At the same time, new construction starts in our trade areas were flat in the third versus the second quarter.", "As a result of both of these factors, new construction as a percentage of inventory in our trade areas picked up by 20 basis points in the third quarter underscoring that the impact of new deliveries will carry forward into 2018.", "From a demand perspective, we were very pleased to once again see greater than 3% absorption gains in the third quarter, suggesting a continue trend of increased penetration rates for senior housing.", "The security of our residence during the hurricanes is yet another example of the value proposition of senior housing and the potential to raise the penetration rate among seniors above the current 11% level.", "For the full year 2017, we're updating and narrowing our SHOP portfolio same-store NOI guidance to now grow between a 0.5% and 1.5% versus the previous range of 0% to 2%. The new guidance midpoint implies a modest year-over-year NOI decline in the fourth quarter. That said, our SHOP operators are sharply focused and incentivized to positively close out the year.", "Rounding out the portfolio view is our highly valuable office reporting segment, representing 25% of Ventas' NOI and comprised of our university based life science portfolio and our high quality medical office business.", "To help bring the quality of our office portfolio to life for investors, we have expanded our disclosures on tentative versification and credit strengths in this quarter's supplemental reporting.", "Our life science operating portfolio continued to perform very well through the third quarter. Sequentially, total occupancy remained excellent at 97.5%. We have been really pleased with the reliability of our life science cash flows. In fact, 75% of our rent is derived from investment grade credits for companies with a billion plus in equity market capitalization.", "In our medical office business, same-store cash NOI in the third quarter increased by 1.5%. We delivered 91.8% occupancy through new leasing and tenant retention that exceeds 80% year-to-date.", "This retention rate underlines the strength of our diversified MOB portfolio. A few other quantitative examples include over 95% of our NOI is affiliated with leading health systems. Our portfolio is well diversified with our top five health systems representing less than 20% of our MOB base rents. And our tenant's credit profiles attractive with 75% of NOI affiliated with a health system that is rated single A or better. These attributes help drive third quarter revenue up over 2%.", "Expenses outpaced revenue growth in the quarter principally from lapping a real estate tax credit in the prior year third quarter. Adjusting for this item, expenses grew modestly below revenues.", "With solid year-to-date results on a valuable platform, we have raised the midpoint of our guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 1.5% to 2% for a same-store medical office assets in 2017.", "Before diving into our company's overall financial results, I note on the financial impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the quarter. Total direct cost for Ventas resulting from the hurricanes including property damage and other costs approximated $10 million or $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2017. These expenses reduced our income from continuing operations and NAREIT FFO in the quarter, but have been executed from the company's reported NOI and normalized FFO. So we have appropriate coverage. We have not recognized any insurance proceeds in the quarter or in our guidance, because the timing and amount are still uncertain.", "With that, let's review our overall Q3 financial results. We are pleased to report another quarter of earnings growth together with even more robust financial health. Third quarter 2017 income from continuing operations per share grew 5% to $0.44 compared to the third quarter of 2016.", "Normalized FFO per share in the third quarter grew 1% to $1.04 compared to the third quarter of 2016.", "Third quarter results were driven principally by accretive investment and improved property performance versus prior year, partially offset by the impact of dispositions in loan repayments.", "Ventas funded investments of over $80 million during and immediately after the quarter, notably including life science development spend for projects currently underway.", "We are excited to have received $570 million of the $700 million of value creating Kindred SNF sales at a 7% cash and 8% GAAP yield. Thereby reducing our SNF NOI exposure to nearly 1%. We have recognized gains exceeding $500 million on these sales.", "The accelerates SNF disposition timing represents a $0.04 reduction from the high end of our prior normalized 2017 FFO guidance range, and a $0.07 incremental reduction to FFO in 2018 relative to 2017 due to the sales and use of proceeds for debt reduction.", "We also increased our liquidity and flexibility to renew an innovative $400 million revolving structure facility to fund our exciting development pipeline anchored by our life science business. The result of this cumulative activity is a robust financial position at quarter end, including improvement in net debt-to-EBITDA to 5.7 times, lower total indebtedness to gross asset value of 39% and steady fixed charge coverage at an exceptional 4.6 times.", "Let me close out our prepared remarks with our updated 2017 guidance for the company. Specifically, total portfolio same-store cash NOI is anticipated to grow 2% to 2.5%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint. We expect income from continuing operations to range from $63 to $74 and NAREIT FFO to range from $4.07 to $4.12 per fully-diluted share. Both modestly lower than previous guidance to principally to the $0.03 per share hurricane related expenses.", "Our normalized FFO per share is forecast to range from $4.13 to $4.16. The midpoint of our narrowed normalized FFO per share range remains unchanged from previous guidance because improved property performance offsets the accelerated completion of the Kindreds SNFs sales.", "Consistent with previous practice, we have not included any further material investments, dispositions, loan repayments or capital activity in our outlook. We assume approximately 359 million weighted average shares for the full year 2017.", "To close, we're pleased with the excellence we have delivered thus far in 2017. However, this track record of Ventas excellence extends over decades not just years and the team that has delivered it remains tight, collaborative and cohesive.", "And one of course is Debbie. We are particularly proud that Debbie was once again recognized by the Harvard Business Review as one of the best performing CEOs in the world. She is one of 23 CEOs named to the Harvard Business Review list before consecutive years and one of only two women on this year's list.", "Ventas's financial performance rank 32nd out of nearly 900 companies globally for over 18 years, that is truly excellent to stand.", "With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hi, good morning and thanks for the time. I was just hoping you could talk to on the idea side, the sustainability of the lower expense growth year-over-year and maybe if you could detail the software costs that you kind of added back and what that was for?", "Robert Probst", "Sure Juan. Bob here. We're really pleased to see the expense growth the 1.7%. We have given guidance early in the year and that's helps me true of about 4% I call it constant volume wage pressure and we continue to see that. So what obviously therefore happening is the operators doing a great job of managing down the other costs not labor costs together with flexing labor with occupancy and that's what's driving the benefits in the quarter.", "I believe a lot of those costs savings remain sustainable and particularly flexing labor with volume is to go back in time and look at historical occupancy levels, we still have plenty of cushion relative to where we were at lower. So there is still opportunity there and for those with scale which our operators have to continue to drive that to reduce and hold non-labor cost, so still room to run there.", "In terms of your second question on software implementation costs, that's a onetime cost with Sunrise and putting in the software for care and so we've adjusted that out as non-recurring.", "Juan Sanabria", "And what kind of software, it's like managing software, or if you could just talk about?", "Robert Probst", "It's for care compliance Juan, really to be able to when care is provided to a resident to be able to monitor and track that and ultimately bill for it, so.", "Debra Cafaro", "And do it more efficiently and more accurately in terms of the level of care and related pricing for that care.", "Robert Probst", "Right, so onetime software upgrade basically.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. And then just switching gears to the across joint venture, could you just give us a sense of kind of how that portfolio is tracking in terms of rent coverage kind of current occupancy levels and kind of the potential valuation on that portfolio what it was generating and in NOI basis here how you thinking about the value from capital or price basis?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah, so I'll be happy to take that. Good morning. So this is a good portfolio of over 70 private pay communities. It was in the heat map and is no longer in the one-one to one-two bucket. We think that it is a great portfolio and well positioned a large - the largest part of it of course is stable kind of reliable growing asset and then there's a portion that we think can drive some significant upside as I talked about this powerful upside potential and senior housing and we want to enjoy the benefits of that with for Ventas and also for with the joint venture partner.", "Juan Sanabria", "Do you think this vehicle could grow and maybe acquire some of the assets that may come loose from whatever is transpiring there?", "Debra Cafaro", "The joint venture?", "Juan Sanabria", "Yes.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I do think the joint venture obviously will be initially focused on this portfolio, but it is a competitive advantage as I pointed out if there were assets to acquire that that would be another source of capital should we wish to grow in that joint venture and if we thought the assets were appropriate to go in there. It's one of their diversified capital source should we wish to add asset. But we're focused right now on completing the first step of that process.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. And do you own a stake in that new management team, the management operation?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we've been known to do that before. We have established a really significant strategic relationship with the new management company and we excited about being in business with them and it would be possible that we would have an ownership stake going forward, yes.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thank you very much.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open.", "Smedes Rose", "Hi, thanks. I just want to ask you on just the Elmcroft mechanics a little bit, say the natural lease was expiring and you're basically just allowed to say to them they are pulling this contract completely from you, they don't have any recourse to maintain management if they wanted to or if it's something that you work out?", "Debra Cafaro", "We have a good relationship with Elmcroft. They have been good partners, we've known them for a long time. They originally where at Vencore many, many years ago and spun off as part of the original atria. So the relationships we have with them go a way back and we are working with them collaboratively to transition the portfolio and so that's how we are making it happen.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay. And then just sticking with your triple-net portfolio for a moment, you're - I think in the past you said that the Brookdale facilities are kind of in line with the overall the coverage, is that still the case or they improving more or underperforming relative to the group as a whole?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah, on a triple-net senior housing side, I say there's a lot of consistency there Bob mentioned and a lot of clustering including Brookdale around the segment average. So very consistent.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay, okay. And then Bob, just you mentioned that some construction I guess will continue into 2018 because of delays this year on the operating portfolio side. What are some of the other I guess puts and takes that you're hearing, I mean we always ask you this, is it anything on the financing side from banks for lending to senior housing and also just anything you're hearing from the operators on the labor cost into 2018 if that's kind of a building at all?", "Robert Probst", "Sure. Well, anecdotally we continue to hear it's more difficult to find difficult to find operators to get financing, to find good locations in terms of supply, Debbie quoted some of the steps in terms of starts relative to two years ago which are down nearly 50%. So both the anecdotes and the facts would suggest there's a positive trend there which we're pleased with.", "As we think about labor going into 2018, obviously a bit early to give guidance. I do think wage pressures will continue, labor pressures will continue into 2018 there. Therefore we're going to turn to price again. I'd emphasis how pleased we are on the rate side with 4% we saw me a year and again we're seeing that across the portfolio and that's really encouraging.", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean one thing on the construction side too with the hurricanes, there is going to be tremendous demand on construction, labor and materials and so on for the rebuilding that's going to be necessary in Texas and Florida. And that's an additional constraint on new development.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Smedes.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Yeah, yes, good morning everyone.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Good morning. Quick question under triple-net portfolio, I'm just trying to understand some of the moving parts because you do have a guidance increase for the same store NOI, the cash seems to NOI, but occupancy was down year-over-year in the quarter, coverage is still flattish, I mean its coverage expected to kind of go down going forward, I'm just trying, this seem to all the parties moving in different directions and I'm just really trying to understand how it all comes together?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Bob do you want to start with that?", "Robert Probst", "Sure. Let me differentiate between underlying asset performance and our triple-net same-store. Our triple-net same store has performed very well year-to-date and the race to 3 to 3.5 really reflects the fact that we've done three quarters of the year. And really see stability in that portfolio everything about the rental income. So that through guidance for us. In terms of trends in the underlying portfolio, I think the same the same store senior housing triple-net portfolio same headwind to the industry. And so we probably will see some pressure on that 1.3 times as we go forward here. But again we think got to within underlying norms within the industry.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. That helps a bit. Debbie, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about hospitals at this point in the cycle given all the healthcare reform, what you're bringing trying to kind of see from some of the public hospital systems?", "Debra Cafaro", "Absolutely, I mean here is how we're thinking about it. First of all, we love a diversified portfolio and we think that that is the path to success a value preservation and value creation and we followed that issue now for a very long time. Within that, we've made some great investments in the hospital space, we've been extremely selective. It is performing very well in that series through the third quarter on our property performance and we will continue to look at selective opportunities both with them and in the market generally. So it is the same as always. We think it's a big potential opportunity but one where we are going be very selective and we've been very successful so far and we want to continue that track record.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Got it. Okay. And then lastly you talk a little bit of I just thought your international markets and how they're generally doing?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I mean we have a beachhead investment in certainly in Canada, obviously that's doing exceptionally well and that was our first real international investment that we started back in 2007 and we cut that trend early and we have some investments in the U.K. that are performing very well also. We continued to look in the continental and in the U.K. and have done a lot of good work there and those markets can be attractive, but we will be very selective there as well.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.", "Michael Knott", "Hey, everyone, question for you on SHOP. On the U.S. versus Canada just curious a couple things, is a degree of divergence surprise you at all this year and then would you expect that huge Canadian outperformance to continue in 2018?", "Robert Probst", "We've been really pleased Michael with Canada of course two consecutive quarters now of double-digit growth. And when you look within the occupancy nearly 95%, what course we have is a supply demand equilibrium in Canada, we have great assets in Canada very well operated. And in light of the high occupancy, we've been pushing price again. I think that's a big driver of this performance. So I hope it will be top obviously next year but the fundamentals are there.", "On the U.S. side, it's very much as we've portrayed I think if you go back to beginning of the year and the framework on guidance we laid out there that's where the year is really kind of very consistently so we really know the surprises so far.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. And then just to follow-up again on Brookdale and their disclosure last quarter they showed a triple-net lease coverage of one point zero two times on EBITDA and then we know H-City and Wall Tower [ph] 1.5 to 1.2, it sound like if we were to take your EBITDA I mean adjust downward EBITDA, you would suggest you're somewhere in the 1.1 range. Is that about right?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, again we look at this if you look if you think it's relatively consistent with the rest of our senior housing triple-net as we talked about which has been stable at 1.3. We would say that - the reason we look at EBIT arm and again this is a subject on which we have tremendous experience with Kindred and others. When you look - we look at EBIT arm because when you look at operators and how they make decisions and what their incremental cost management is and or stated another way how much overhead they're truly able to get rid of if they shed asset. That number tends to be much closer to kind of 1%, 2%, 3% depending on the operator and the asset type. And so we think that EBIT arm is really a good place to look. And so it's pretty clear depending on how you look at management, see what the math is, but we are in that consistent kind of stable coverage area.", "Michael Knott", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Nick Ullico with UBS. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning. This is [indiscernible] here on with Nick and thanks for taking our questions. On supply you\u2026", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. On supply, you touched on this in your prepared remarks in a little bit after but it looks like new supply in your top 20 markets rose to roughly 7% of stock. So could you give a little more color on what changed you during the quarter in your major markets because this is where you're seeing the best rate growth, how much of a threat is the new supply to for results if you're looking to drive results through that great growth.", "Robert Probst", "Sure. Well, two things as we think about construction that are important which is deliveries and new starts. And in the quarter, this quarter we did see delays in deliveries and that together with flattish new start is what drove the ratio up. And therefore again a step back, I think there's clearly a carry over to 2018. The underlying trends for the industry in terms of starts, we believe will part of our portfolio equally. Within that from a market point of view, one also had to look at demand of that supply growth and for our engine room markets as I described them, we consider this a very, very strong performance and that's LAs, Boston and the New York as I've highlighted. So though in certain areas there have been some new access coming online, again the engine room is strong and the rate is particularly strong in that. So we are feeling good about it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. I'll follow-up if I may. You talked about the recently announced JV, I know you just announced it today, so it's fresh. Could you possibly talk about how the JV is being valued and how is demonstrates the value of your portfolio?", "Debra Cafaro", "As I mentioned in the call, we are going to have to move on, we have a few many other colors that we have to take. But as I mentioned there is a strong bid across our asset type from all types of capital. And so as we move forward with this transaction, we'll be happy to provide additional valuation metrics. But again to repeat the sematic I would say that people are very interested in asset types because they are resilient, because they is demographic demand, because of the cash flows, and so valuations are strong as I said.", "Q -", "Thanks for color.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay, thanks. Let's go to the next caller.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Richard Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.", "Richard Anderson", "Thanks, good morning. So Bob you mentioned negative SHOP for the fourth quarter in terms of the same-store growth, does that presume 9% plus growth in Canada again?", "Robert Probst", "Continued strength\u2026", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi Rich.", "Robert Probst", "Yes, hi Rich.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning to you.", "Richard Anderson", "Thank you. Trying to talk first.", "Robert Probst", "I'll try to. The applied fourth quarter is really U.S. dynamic and really again it's down to the views of deliveries in pacing of new supply. I mean that midpoint really assumes. We have something more compression on the occupancy line. So we'll see but that's what driving that assumption.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay. And back to Brookdale, not to deliver, but I guess 2019 you start to, the expirations start to or happening, do you anticipate attacking that situation early, could we see a transaction in sort of addressing the expirations and maybe even next year or two put a trust?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, you are right, we're more than two years away from that. And as you know we've gone to lease maturities time and time again here at Ventas. And I think that we are always open and active about working with all of our relationships to find positive outcomes for both sides.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay last question. Okay. That's good enough. And then last on the relationship with Kai, is it really him will maybe taking on many of the Elmcroft you know kind of people thereby reducing the disruption that might come from this type of transition?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, you know Elmcroft is a good company and they have a lot of good people there. And the expectation is that as it's almost always the case in these transitions that virtually all the property people will be carried on and interrupted.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks Rich.", "Operator", "You next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Michael Carroll", "Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Debby, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the investment pipeline is robust in life science and other asset classes, can you give us some color on the deals you are tracking outside of life science and what asset classes are more attractive right now?", "John Cobb", "And I think - This is John Cobb. We have seen robust pipeline in all poor verticals, we see it in the life science, the hospital sector, the senior housing sector and the medical officer. You know quarter-in quarter-out, we are seeing you know a good pipeline.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, now these mostly comprised of any larger portfolios or smaller transactions or how should we think about the deal size?", "John Cobb", "I think - as you seen over the last three or four years, you seen us do smaller deals and the medium deals and we also see at big deals, so we look at them all.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "John Kim", "Thank you and congratulations on the continued recognition.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, John.", "John Kim", "You discussed the breath in the investor market for healthcare real estate in general, but can you discuss the nature of the investor on the joint venture?", "Debra Cafaro", "That more to follow, I think that that's - what we are trying to do as investors have ask us to do is in some cases where we can give them some early insights into our activities and strategies and where we are doing that in this case provide some early transparency. Certainly happy to disclose more as the pieces come together.", "John Kim", "Okay and then given this portfolio, the Elmcroft portfolio has a low EBIT arm coverage, is it fair to assume that a cap rate would be higher than what you have been selling it recently and the rent maybe reduced?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, again this is about portfolio existing performance in NOI and about potential performance. And as I mentioned there is a biggest part of this portfolio is nice stable growing cash flows and there is outsized performance portion of the two. So that obviously is attractive both to us, who wants to stay in the portfolio and get the benefit of that and also to a potential partner.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then finally, can you disclose what you revenue enhancing CapEx was either this quarter or year-to-date?", "Debra Cafaro", "And we'll look at that in respond and let's move on to the next caller and we'll get to that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Your line is open.", "Karin Ford", "Hi, good morning. With the Kindred sales winding down, what is the disposition pipeline looking like from here?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah, well, you know currently we're expecting you know maybe another including the Kindred 100 or 150 in the near term.", "Karin Ford", "And are you thinking about being active on the self-side as you looking to 2018?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we continue to evaluate things. I think what's been really good about Ventas is we've had a balanced position over the last couple of years as we have both sort of elevated quality and mix of our portfolio with this SNF spin and dispositions. And we've also found attractive opportunities to grow as I talked about this year will a 1.4 billion and attractive risk adjusted return investment. So we like to again deliver strong cash flows and to take opportunities both to divest as well as to invest. And that's I think where we are right now Karin.", "Karin Ford", "Thanks. And just one quick clarification on the Elmcroft portfolio is, is that going to be converted from a triple-net lease to a sharp deal?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, as we stated it's going to be managed by the new company and importantly the reason for that is we want to enjoy the benefit of the potential outperformance in the future with our ultimate joint venture partner.", "Karin Ford", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Jordan Sadler", "Thanks for squeezing me in.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay, good morning.", "Jordan Sadler", "Good morning. Go ahead.", "Debra Cafaro", "Bob is going to quickly answer the prior question.", "Jordan Sadler", "Go ahead,", "Robert Probst", "The question was the profit adding capital spend and it's 200 year-to-date. It's really split between life science and SHOP.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Jordan, now to you.", "Jordan Sadler", "Thanks Debby. So on Elmcroft, I think you had on the books $1 billion, what portion of that would you look to monetize, would it be a majority of that or minority?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah, I think your number we may need to talk to offline, they are little high. But the - we would expect to stay in for you know a significant piece for the reason stated.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. And then lastly on SHOP, the occupancy guide for the year was down 200 basis points I believe on average for the full year, can you give us a little bit of insight in terms of how we are tracking for the rest of the year, Bob?", "Robert Probst", "Sure. And I think the number is still pretty good, pretty good having, that's going to here there about the same.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay, so well in the year down probably a little bit more from year based on what's baked into the last quarters worth the guidance?", "Jordan Sadler", "The range is either on the high end, assuming we'll have a bit of timing year-over-year and on the low end that we may gap out a little bit but I think that's going to be from where we were in the third quarter.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay, thanks for the time.", "Debra Cafaro", "The range kind of straddles that. Yep.", "Jordan Sadler", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Jordan.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Chad Vanacore", "Hi, good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Chad Vanacore", "Just about the - good morning. Thinking about the $10 million add back related in natural disasters, it seems relatively high especially in respect to Brookdale, which took a $9 million hit, they are the largest senior housing operator out there, so why such a relatively large impact you are SHOP, and how many properties were impacted and is the $10 million all on the expense side?", "Robert Probst", "Yeah, so let me break that down a little bit for you. The 10 million is really split call it 50-50 between property damage and other direct costs the other half associated with things like evacuation, meals, lodging et cetera. We have not to emphasis assumed any - yet any insurance proceeds reimbursements. We have insurance obviously to covers those types of events. We have recognized you got the light of the uncertainty of timing and amount. So that's a gross number. It is flowing through the other expense line of the P&L, so it's below NOI. And as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, therefore it's still continuing including in but excluding from NOI and normalized FFO.", "Debra Cafaro", "The other thing I would mention to is that I am sure how Brookdale did it but to the extent that there are manager for others I would guess that there is any expenses incurred there would be to the property owners then not Brookdale.", "Chad Vanacore", "Alright, thanks. And then just one more, could you layout the strategic rationale behind moving in JV agreements in comparative right there or say triple-net?", "Debra Cafaro", "Could you rephrase the question?", "Chad Vanacore", "Yeah, so you are going to starting in few JV agreements, why the JV agreements versus where you would normally do either triple-net?", "Debra Cafaro", "I am not sure I understand the question. What I will tell you is that we own assets 100%, we own them in joint ventures now, we have assets that are leased, assets that are managed, that's part of you know a diversification strategy. And what we try to do all the time is to customize a structure with the appropriate you know asset type and where is it in the life cycle and so on and so forth. So we think the benefits of what we are intending to do really are diversification of capital sourcing, having another tool for growth, aligning with a new really high quality manager. And we are excited about all that.", "Chad Vanacore", "Okay. I'll follow-on with you on offline, thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay, thank you.", "Robert Probst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Hughes", "Hey, good morning. Just one from me.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi.", "Jonathan Hughes", "Hi, good morning. Just kind of an extension of next question earlier but looking at the SHOP portfolio and on a construction within the trade area, that's about 7% of inventory your top 20 markets, what is the number look like when you include non-stabilized inventory?", "Robert Probst", "We don't differentiate in that analysis, so stabilized versus non-stabilized, nor do we in same-store at close in. I think the thing that's important to continue to look at when you look at the construction pages, the demand side of the equation then harking back to our framework where we have on average 3% demand as our equilibrium point. And so many of these markets where there is new construction coming online, there is high demand as well.", "Jonathan Hughes", "Okay, fair enough, I'll follow-up offline. Thanks for the time.", "Debra Cafaro", "Alright, we look forward for it. Thank you. Okay, we got a couple more.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Your line is open.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi Dan.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Hi. One quick question on SHOP, and the secondary market is really what's in hurting your NOI growth there, it seems like looks like construction supply came down in the secondary markets, can you talk a little bit about the fundamental there and what you see coming in the next say 12 months in secondary markets?", "Robert Probst", "Sure. The secondary markets is where we did see the blunt of new competition and I'd highlight markets like Salt Lake city for example flow into that secondary market segmentation. And it is - when we looked our portfolio and segmented it to say where do we have equilibrium versus a surplus. Many of those markets where we have surplus are in the secondary markets, so that's where we are seeing the impact and you can see quite clearly in the quarter.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay. And do you see fundamentals there might be improving at all or is that stable?", "Robert Probst", "I think the supply dynamics I mentioned in terms of new deliveries will carry into 2018 no double in some of these same markets.", "Debra Cafaro", "And then starts as they reduce obviously effect the forward environment. So that's where you talk about this powerful upside when you have - you are where you are in the occupancy cycle, you have starts ticking down then you have the acceleration of the seniors growth in population and that's where you get this powerful upside I discussed.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay. And uncrossed assets are mainly in secondary markets?", "Debra Cafaro", "The uncrossed assets are very good real estate and interestingly have very, very limited new supply in the market.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay, that's good to know. I'll hope off, I know it's been a long call.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yep, it is. So thank you, welcome back. Okay, let's finish it on.", "Operator", "Last question is from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Your line is open.", "Sheila McGrath", "Good morning. Bob you mentioned that even in the supply challenge markets that rent with growth, I am just wondering it's most of the positive rental growth you think driven by the higher rent upon renewal and any insight you might have on how new lease rents compared to expire rents of recently vacated units?", "Robert Probst", "That's a great question and shame it's the last one of the day, it's really interesting. And we are seeing the rent growth, the growth as I mentioned in some of those markets they have new supply. And that is a combination of what I call the releasing but also it is base rent increases. And what is very important and our operators do a very good job is understanding how that releasing spread is trending overtime. And I think in our portfolio generally we feel pretty good about that releasing spread being within norms that are acceptable. So the rate side of the equation is really held us.", "Sheila McGrath", "Okay, thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you. Are there any other further questions? Okay, well I want to thank everyone sincerely for your attention today and for your interest in Ventas. I continue to believe we're in a great industry that has tremendous potential even a high quality diverse and resilient portfolio that generate strong cash flow. We continue to see attractive investment opportunities and have access to diversified sources of capital to fund them. And we are super lucky to have a cohesive team at Ventas, who can capitalize on all those things to deliver long term security of performance for you. So thank you again. Look forward to seeing everyone soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may all disconnect.

My name is Dave; I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Lori Wittman, SVP of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please proceed Ma\u2019am.", "Lori Wittman", "Thank you, Dave. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter and the quarter ended March 31, 2015.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws.

Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks, Lori. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to Ventas' first quarter earnings call.", "This morning we are happy to share our excellent Q1 and year-to-date accomplishments and results, discuss our strategy in areas of focus, and provide our outlook for the balance of the year. Following my remarks, Ray Lewis, will discuss our portfolio performance; and Bob Probst, will review our financial results. Then we will be happy to answer your questions.", "Although we are only four months into it, 2015 is shaping up to be highly productive and value-creating one for Ventas. Year-to-date we have closed over $3.5 billion of investments, received almost $0.5 billion in disposition and loan repayment proceeds, made a strategic and accretive investment in the US acute care hospital space, and announced a spin-off of most of our skilled nursing or snip portfolio to create two faster growing more focused company. We've also selected a name for new pure play REIT, Care Capital Property or CCP.", "And we also delivered a very strong quarter in line with our expectations; our enterprise generated normalized FFO per share of $1.18 representing 8% growth from the first quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations increased by 21% in total and 9% on a per share basis compared to the prior period. And our first quarter dividend per share grew in line with that strong cash performance. We believe our recent announcements that we intend to spin-off most of our skilled nursing portfolios into CCP, a pure play REIT, as well as our pending entry into the US hospital spaces; our innovative decisions that will deliver significant benefits for our investors, lenders, customers and employees. They also fit squarely with our track record of thought leadership in our industry, value creation and capital stewardship.", "The Ventas team sets the bar high for extreme productivity year-in and year-out with a focus on elevating our enterprise and sustaining the excellence we stand for. Let me recap some of our highlights so far this year; first, capital markets activity, maintaining our commitment to financial strength and flexibility, we access the debt and equity markets in January on attractive term and positioned ourselves for today\u2019s outstanding, debt-to-enterprise value of 32%.", "Turning to capital allocations, we have had a terrific start to the year closing to $3.5 billion in deals so far. First of course is the completion of our HCT acquisition on January 16. The transaction is accretive and consistent with our strategy; we priced HCT in 2014 in anticipation of the increasingly strong bids we see for healthcare and senior housing assets in the market.", "So in closing we've been fully integrating the HCT assets and customers into our portfolio. We continue to be pleased with the portfolios composition of principally newer medical office buildings or MOBs affiliated with excellent hospital tenants and senior housing operating assets managed by quality care providers, all of whom are performing well.", "You will see the improvement in several key metrics of our best-in-class middle bridge MOB business, and this quarter supplement materials as a results of the HCT acquisition. Finally, I am happy to report that the NOI from both, the HCT and the holiday deal we closed last year, are on track with our original NOI projections using constant currency as of the date of the announcements last year.", "We also expanded our footprint in the UK this quarter; we invested $86 million to acquire five mostly private pay care homes in the London market, operated by Canford Healthcare. The properties are subject to a long-term triple net lease yielding over 6.5% on an initial cash basis after-tax. We identified Canford as an experienced knowledgeable management team we believe we can grow. Already we are working with Canford on a second follow-on investment to build out there and our senior housing business in the UK. So, now we own both hospital and care home properties, leads by quality care providers in the UK.", "We also made an attractive investment during the quarter in 12 skilled nursing assets with an existing customer at an initial cash yield exceeding 8% and good cash quarter rent coverage. These facilities will be spun to care capital properties and represents an example of the type of extra loan growth opportunities available to CCP as an independent pure play REIT. We also recently committed to participate in the new high-end $86 million ground up senior housing development project with Atria in Northern California. In this deal Ventas will contribute 25% of the equity capital, and are in place joint venture partner and State Pension Fund will contribute the bell [ph]. We expect the unlevered NOI yield upon stabilization to approximate 9% of the total project cost. The development is located in an installed barrier entry market with superior demographics.", "As you know we are very excited about our recent agreement to purchase Ardent, a top ten US hospital operator. This is an exciting strategic and accretive investment for us in a massive rapidly consolidating hospital sector. The hospital sector is one we've been studying for a long time, attracted by its size, capital intensity, fragmentation, limited public ownership, and position at the top of the food chain in the US healthcare delivery system. The sector is currently benefitting from the major positive trends such as demographic, the affordable care act, positive reimbursement, and an improving economy. All of these trends are driving growth in admission and emergency room visit.", "Ardent itself is a high quality company that generates over $2 billion in annual revenues, and most importantly has an experienced management team and scalable platform to grow. Ardent operates in three key markets where they enjoy significant market share. While there are several moving pieces to the deal, in summary, at closing we expect to have about $1.4 billion invested in ten high quality hospitals subject to new long-term triple net leases with the operating company.", "The operating company which we are designing to be strong and profitable is expected to be owned by the Ardent management team, Ventas with up to a 9.9% stake and other equity sources. We expect our unlevered going in cash rent yield to exceed 7% with approximately 2.5% annual rent escalation. As a further update to our recent announcement, we are well underway with the formal marketing process to choose the equity partner for the Ardent Hospital Operating business. Because Ardent is an attractive and rare opportunity to invest in a quality hospital provider, we are seeing significant interest in the deal from potential equity players.", "Our overarching strategy is a combined Ardent\u2019s management capabilities and our real estate capital and hospital customer relationships. With a knowledgeable equity capital partner, as the majority owner of the Ardent operating company. Together we expect to be a leader in hospital consolidation. Because the Ardent acquisition shares many characteristic with our highly successful lower bridge and Atria acquisitions. In that we have a nucleus of high quality assets, strong management team and a scalable platform system. We are excited and confident about our ability to build a formidable business in the US hospital states overtime.", "Turning to the other side of the capital allocation, let's talk about capital recycling and strategic separation. Already this year we sold and received loan repayment proceeds of almost $500 million which we expect to re-deploy later this year to partially fund our Ardent acquisition. More importantly, our proposed spin-off of most of our portfolio of skilled nursing asset to appear price net gained traction. We expect Ventas and CCP to be two faster growing companies with focus differentiated strategy.", "Upon completion of the spin-off Ventas will also improve its NOI contribution from privately assets to a market leading 83%. Derive 83% of our proforma NOI from Top 20 care providers, and improve our post-acute quality mix to 78%. Our segment balance and diversification will also be enhanced by the retention of our post-acute portfolio lead by national public care providers such as Kindred, Genesis and [indiscernible], and the addition of a hospital segment. We will also retain significant scale at over $30 billion dollars at an enterprise value. Financial strength a high quality SHOP portfolio, best-in-class MOB franchise and best dividend growth with a most attractive payout ratio in our sector. In fact, we intend to increase our combined dividend by at least 10% at the time of the spin-off.", "Looking forward we are also pleased to raise our normal full year FFO per share guidance. Please note that our guidance doesn't yet incorporate any impact from the spin-offs or any additional acquisitions. We continue to see tremendous opportunity, both domestically and abroad to invest capital. You can see from the plethora of deals in and out, that investment possibilities are abundant, while you should assume we look at virtually every deal in the market, the key for us is continue to be as it always has been to serve as steward capital and remain ahead of the herd. It goes without saying that we seek investments that presents good, risk-adjusted returns are consistent with our strategy and will create value for our shareholders.", "As I am sure you can tell, I am about as fired up about Ventas\u2019s business and the future of the company as I've ever been. With our skillset, opportunities, access to capital, customer relationships and track record I'm confident we will end 2015 with two attractive companies positioned to thrive and deliver for our shareholders.", "And on that note, I'm happy to turn the call over to Ray Lewis, our President and CCP\u2019s incoming CEO.", "Ray Lewis", "Thank you, Debbie. Our balance in the diversified portfolio of more than 1,600 senior housing, medical office, and post-acute properties continue to deliver strong growth in the first quarter. Same-store cash NOI for the total portfolio grew by 3.2% for the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014, and was led by strong growth in the triple net lease portfolio.", "Let me start with our seniors housing operating portfolio; with the closing of the HCT acquisition in January we now have a total of 305properties of which 269 are operated by Atria and Sunrise. The total SHOP portfolio generated NOI after management fees of $149 million in the first quarter, growth of 21% year-over-year, driven primarily by the addition of 68 new properties since the first quarter of 2014, and solid same-store performance in our Atria portfolio.", "Average occupancy in the total portfolio at 91.3% was 70 basis points higher in first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. Our portfolio occupancy exceeds the average senior housing occupancy reported by NIC in its Top 99 markets by 100 basis points. NOI in the 234 properties in our same-store portfolio increased about 1% in the first quarter of 2015 over the first quarter of 2014, adjusting for approximately $2.2 million of non-recurring, real estate tax credits in the first quarter of 2014, the same-store NOI grew 2.7%.", "Year-over-year occupancy growth was strong at 60 basis points and occupancy increased in both, the Atria and Sunrise portfolios. Year-over-year rate growth was also strong at 3.1% driven by the Atria portfolio. However, as we told you during the fourth quarter call for both Atria and Sunrise we are seeing some pressure on expenses, particularly in wages, benefits, insurance and utilities which manifested in 5.2% year-over-year expense increase in the first quarter.", "On a sequential basis, the 269 properties in our same-store portfolio performed in line with our expectations for the first quarter. Consistent with historical patterns occupancy declined in the first quarter versus the fourth driven by lower move ends around the holidays, the impact of the flu season and the in climate weather in the northeast, rate was up 2.8% driven by annual rent increases in most of the portfolio and expense were up 2.2% driven by the wage, utility and other expense items that we discussed when we gave our guidance last quarter. Based on our seasonal trends we anticipate that occupancy, NOI, and margins should increase through the rest of the year.", "Looking at the broader senior housing landscape, construction starts were on par with recent quarters, and construction as a percentage of inventory was about 4.2%, also in line with recent quarters. Due to the high barrier to entry, infill locations that are typical of our SHOP portfolio construction as a percentage of inventory in the three-mile trade area around our buildings was only 2.3% and our portfolio continued to outperformed as a result. When compared to the net Top 99 markets, our same-store stable occupancy at 91.7% is a 140 basis points higher than the NIC average, and our RevPAR at approximately $5,700 per month is 66% higher than the NIC senior housing data.", "Next I'll cover our triple net lease portfolio which accounts for 50% of our portfolio NOI. This diversified and productive portfolio of 952 senior housing, post-acute and hospital assets delivered another quarter of strong and stable performance. The 837 assets in the same-store pool grew 4.8% in the first quarter of 2015 over the first quarter of 2014, driven by our contractual escalations and approximately $5million dollars of anticipated fees. It is important to note that this not include a $37 million payment that we received from Kindred in connection with the agreements regarding benign snips which we announced at year-end.", "Cash flow coverage in our same-store triple net lease portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2014, the latest available information was strong and stable at 1.6 times. Since we last spoke to you there have been a number of positive reimbursement developments out of Washington. First CMS released its proposal for 2015 medical rates for post-acute and hospital services which would take effect in October of 2015 but will remain subject to review and comment.", "Skilled nursing got a growth of 1.4% increase, L-Tax received a proposed 1.2% increase, excluding the impact of patient criteria rates which are not expected to impact Kindred until the fourth quarter of 2016. First received a proposed 1.7% increase and acute care hospitals received a proposed 0.3% increase. Note that these proposed increases are industry averages and will vary by individual provider. In addition, legislation was enacted to provide for a permanent solution for the Doc [ph] entailed pay for us by the post-acute and acute providers that were significantly better than have been previously anticipated. This is great for the doctors many of whom occupy our MOBs and removes a significant overhang from the industry.", "Finally, our markets leading low bridge MOB business turned in another solid quarter. For the first quarter 2015 NOI in the total consolidated portfolio of 358 properties was $92 million, an increase of 27% over the first quarter of 2014. Performance was driven by solid same-store performance and the addition of 83 properties from the HCT acquisition in January. Occupancy in the total portfolio was up 80 basis points to 92.4%, and margins increased by exceptional 310 basis points reflecting the quality of the properties we acquired.", "In the 273 properties in the same-store portfolio, cash growth was 2.2% or 3.6% on our share, this was driven by a 2.6% increase in rental rate and an increase in margin of 80 basis points offset by a decrease in occupancy of 60 basis points which was anticipated in our budgets for the year. Since the closing of the HCT portfolio, Lillibridge has internalized the management of 25 buildings. Our best practices in property management should lead to increased profitability in these buildings overtime. And our sector leading MOB platform is a unique advantage that enables Ventas to compete and win in the MOB space.", "Before turning the call over to Bob I would like to say a few words about the spin-off. Most of our portfolio of skilled nursing properties to a new share play read, we have named Care Capital Properties. We are very pleased to have filed the Form 10 with the SEC as of this week, and we are proceeding full speed to execute the transaction as quickly as possible which will likely be no earlier than September. As we discussed in our call two weeks ago, the company is going to have a diversified portfolio of over 350 primarily skilled nursing properties with overall lease coverage of 1.8 times and a weighted average remaining lease term of 10 years and relationships with 43 operators. We will deliver external growth by investing with quality regional and local skilled nursing operators to consolidate this highly fragmented $120 billion dollar market.", "And as Debbie mentioned, we are already working on building a pipeline of transactions so that we can hit the ground running. We will also grow internally through this escalations and redevelopment. Our balance sheet will be strong with projected leverage of about four and a half times and we should have access to multiple sources of attractively priced capital which we can use to invest and grow the business.", "Finally we are going to have a seasoned management team that has learned the ropes at Ventas and brings a wealth of talent to the new company. I am extremely energized by this exciting opportunity to build a great skilled nursing REIT and I look forward to sharing more about the Care Capital Properties with you as the spin-off progresses.", "With that I am happy to turn the call over to Bob to discuss our financial results and outlook. Bob?", "Bob Probst", "Thank you, Ray. Let me start with the numbers for the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter Ventas delivered record normalized FFO of $387.5 million, an increase of 20% versus prior year, and in line with our expectations. Q1 normalized FFO for diluted share was $1.18 versus $1.09 in 2014, an increase of 8.0%. The strong Q1 growth over 2014 is primarily due to the positive impact of accretive acquisitions in same-store portfolio, NOI growth of 3.2% led by our triple net portfolio.", "As expected, we benefitted early in the quarter from approximately $7 million in fee income or approximately $0.02 cents of FFO per share. This solid FFO growth was partially upset by an 11% increase in share counts in Q1 driven by the close of the HCT transaction mid-January, as well as equity issuance under the ATM. Weighted average due to the shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2015 increased to 329 million shares compared to 296 million shares in Q1 of 2014.", "FFO increased 16% for the first quarter of 2014 to $359 million. On a fully diluted share basis FFO which includes the deal cost associated with the significant acquisition activity in the quarter grew by 4% to $1.09 for fully diluted share, up from $1.05 in the first quarter of 2014. Normalized VAT for the quarter totaled $1.08 for fully diluted share, an increase of 8% over last year.", "Foreign exchange rates for the Canadian dollar and pounds sterling in the quarter were in line with the rates previously incorporated into our guidance. The dividend for the quarter totaled $255 million or $0.79 per share paid in two installments. Our payout ratio remains strong at approximately 67% and provides upside in for future dividend growth. Dispositions in loan repayment year-to-date raised $477 million at a cash yield of 6.8% and a GAAP yield of 7%. Dispositions included the MOB portfolio previously discussed, as well as the senior housing and skilled nursing assets.", "Cash flow after recurring CapEx totaled $323 million, growth of 20% over the first quarter of 2015. We accessed the debt in equity markets in January raising $1.4 billion dollars. In a fixed income market we lengthened and staggered our maturity schedule and raised $1.1 billion in the US and Canadian markets at a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%, maturity of 15 years. And we raised $290 million in equity at $77.38 per share under our ATM.", "Consistent with our philosophy of having consistent access to all capital markets and a conjunction with replacement of our expiring shelf registrations payment in in March, we reestablished our after-market equity program although we have not used it. The new program remains in effect for three years. As expected our net EBITDA at quarter end was a strong 5.7X. At quarter end floating rate debt represented 16% of total debt while fixed charge coverage was an excellent 4.6X. Currently we have $1.7 billion available under our revolver, thereby providing a strong liquidity position.", "Let me now turn to our updated outlook for the full year 2015. As a reminder, our previous expectations as outlined in February was to deliver 2015 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.63 to $4.71, translating to 3% to 5% growth over 2014. We are pleased to increase our guidance for 2015 normalized FFO for fully diluted share in our range between $4.67 and $4.75 representing 4% to 6% growth over prior year. The primary driver of this increased guidance is the acquisition of Ardent Health Services.", "As previously quoted, we expect that on a leverage neutral basis Ardent will add $0.08 to $0.10 of FFO per share accretion on a full-year basis. We are now incorporating at July 1 closing in our 2015 guidance. We have assumed no further acquisitions or speculated fee income in our guidance. This guidance also does not take into consideration any impact from the spin-off of Care Capital Properties. Ventas plans to update guidance once the spin-off transaction is completed.", "In terms of quarterly phasing, we expect to see a sequential reduction in FFO per share in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis Q2 FFO per share and same-store growth is expected to slow in the second quarter with growth accelerating in the second half of 2015. This is due principally to receive a significant disposition and loan repayment proceeds and fee income in the first quarter with expected reinvestments in our current Q3. We continue to project total company same-store cash NOI growth of between 2.5% to 3.5% in 2015. Same-store growth expectations for the SHOP, MOB and Triple Net segments also remain consistent with previous guidance.", "Finally before opening the call for questions, I am pleased to report that we have further expanded our already excellent disclosure in two ways this quarter. First, on Page 19 of our supplemental disclosure, we have provided additional information on our investments and dispositions completed during the quarter and year-to-date. Second, on the map page located on the Ventas website, we have added a link where you can directly access our full property listing including address information. We strive to be as transparent as possible and welcome feedback on these additional disclosures.", "With that operator, please open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first line comes from Juan Sanabria at Bank of America. Go ahead please.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hi, good morning, thanks Debbie. I was just hoping you could speak a little bit more about the SHOP portfolio, I guess I am too front. First if you can get us any color on what the HCT portfolio - how that's growing? How we should expect that to impact the same-store pool? And if you could also give us a little bit more color on the current same-store pools for the margin expectations given the comments on costs pressures.", "Debra Cafaro", "Juan, this is Debbie, I will just take one small part of that and turn it over to others but the HCT is performing in line with our expectations, we would expect that NOI to grow on a moderate basis over the course of the year. It will not be in same-store this year and will appear in same-store in the second quarter of 2016 when we've earned it for a full-year. So Juan, the current same-store I'll turn it over to others to answer your question.", "Bob Probst", "Juan, it's Bob. In terms of the margin question on same-store, you saw decline in the first quarter that was in line with our expectations, you have the seasonal decline in the quarter together with the wage and other cost inflation we had anticipated. In fact it was exacerbated to some degree by flu and weather in certain parts of the region but as we think about the balance of the year debt occupancy will pick up really beginning in the second quarter and accelerate through the back half, that will drive in our minds the operating leverage together with the rate we saw in the first quarter, it's about 3.1% year-on-year to really try to hold those margins for the full-year. So that's really what's in our outlook for the same-store guidance.", "Juan Sanabria", "Just to make sure that that guidance is staying the same at 3% to 5% growth per year?", "Bob Probst", "That's correct.", "Juan Sanabria", "Great thanks. And I was just hoping you could may be elucidate or give more color on the type of hospital opportunities you see in the marketplace, who the sellers might be, it is too far to look into US markets or you're also looking at hospital opportunities overseas?", "Debra Cafaro", "Great questions, so as you know we own the three high quality hospitals in the UK, I would imagine though that the Ardent external growth opportunity are going to be principle if not exclusively domestic, there are couple different categories of potential acquisitions that we would hope to work with our Ardent; one is a classic purchase of no-for-profit hospitals, and that is probably the biggest kind of pipeline, it's what Ardent has been good at in the past, and certainly it's the path that many of the public hospital operator take advantage off because they will buy these assets and make them more efficient. Another avenue would be potential spin-offs or sales by public companies, some of their hospitals, and a third might be really the acquisition of the other smaller hospital companies that are for profit companies. But I do see the first one with the not-for-profit to own the majority of hospitals in The United States as probably the principle pathway to external growth with Ardent.", "Juan Sanabria", "Just a quick follow up on that, do you have any preference for geographies or sort of a Top 30 MSAs or you kind of agnostic to that as long as it's a hospital with a good market share and good coverage potential?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I mean I think we would really be looking at hospitals with the significant market share where Ardent could drive efficiencies, utilize and scales it's platform, and have significant negotiating leverage in the market with payers. And so that would be key for us. And also we like Medicare expansion state, things like that; growing populations and demographics, those would be the key things we would be looking at for additional acquisitions.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Juan.", "Operator", "Thank you, the next question is from the line of Nick Yulico at UBS. Go ahead", "Nick Yulico", "Good morning, I think of couple of questions are you still targeting a $0.53 to $0.55 dividend there per share based on that account?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes Nick, we are.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. And then reading through the Form 10 filing, it says that SpinCo is going to be purchasing a senior housing valuation firm in exchange for SpinCo\u2019s stock of about $11. Can you just explain what's going on there?", "Bob Probst", "Yes, that is an opportunity that we've sourced where we think there are some strategic benefits to aligning with a valuation form who is going to be further up the stream potentially in transaction opportunities. This is a very well-known group that has a lot of relationships with long standing relationships with our potentially customers. So it's a way for us to expand an acquisition network without a significant investment and in fact a cash return.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay, and who is this firm?", "Bob Probst", "I'm not able to disclose that at this point.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay but it's one that will help you do acquisitions basically.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, it will be an income for investment - in addition we'll have ancillary benefits of having lots of industry relationships that could lead to more pipeline for SpinCo or I'm sorry, Care Capital Property.", "Nick Yulico", "And then just on the initial purchases here, it looks like this portfolio was purchased from healthcare REIT and you guys had to reset the lease agreements. Can you just explain the coverage of this portfolio and how the cash yield decide - sort of affected by - you guys have into re-do the lease agreement?", "Debra Cafaro", "Sure. I think it's a little bit different from what you're saying. Actually this is a customer of ours who assumed a purchase option for the asset that was exercised, and so our customer took over operations of the assets which of course and we brought the assets with them and in support of them and that we basically entered into a new lease based upon the purchase price for the assets which would be what is typical. And the coverage is a strong coverage, I believe we quoted above 1.1 [ph] and the lease rate is about 8% or more of our investment. So it's just like any acquisition that we would make with the customer of ours.", "Nick Yulico", "And then just lastly, your booked exposure went down by 15 assets and purchased some of these assets from you guys, can you explain what was going on there - was there a purchase option that happened and did that take place prior to all this news coming out that?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, thank you for asking that. We actually did sell some assets to Brookdale in the first quarter, that was part of $0.5 billion that I mentioned. This was really a collaborative transaction there was no purchase option, there were assets that were not performing as well as I think Brookdale, one of them to perform and we reached a favorable transaction with them where we were able to sell them back to Brookdale and we both came out I think where we wanted to. So it was a very collaborative deal.", "Nick Yulico", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, the next line of question is from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Smedes Rose", "Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask you in your Form 10, the NOI from CCP was looking like it's around $290 million to $295 million, and I think the guidance is $315 million to $320 million and is that just reflecting the 12 that you acquired in the quarter and we will get spunned to them or is there some other way to get that NOI number?", "Lori Wittman", "Hi, its Lori. It's not only the 12 but it also the 18 assets from HCT that will be coming over, so there is a total of 30 that were purchase of subsequently in 2014 and so when you add those and that's how you get to the range.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay, thanks. And then on your senior housing operating portfolio, it looks like - you break out the secondary and primary markets it looks like a lot of the pressures you talked about were in the primary markets and results outside of those were fairly strong. Do you expect those kinds of wages pressures to trickle down into other markets and with kind of rising course as the $15 minimum wage. Is there any way to kind of quantify the impact that might have cross portfolio, if any?", "Ray Lewis", "That's a good observation and I think if you look at a primary market results a couple of things that need to be taken into account. One, our primary markets are weighted much more heavily towards the northeast where we had obviously the negative impacts of the weather which resulted in increased expenses overtime utilities maintenance costs. The $2.2 million real estate tax credits that we mentioned were also in the northeast. And in the primary markets so again those should be taken into account for consideration and then yes you know there are some wage pressures generally in those markets, which are reflected in the annual increases that felt in the first quarter, it should not continue to grow throughout year in fact, as Bob mentioned that we are occupant and leverage to those cost better in place.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay. And then any thoughts around minimum wage or is that not - are your people generally making above that anyway so it doesn\u2019t matters much.", "Ray Lewis", "Well, you know people are making above that in our buildings, I would say that it does sort off push up the spread - the spread needs to be maintained, so it does have some upward pressure and wages in our building.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay. Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Andrew Resovach [ph] at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning. I was also ask a question to JD that's something about healthcare and real estate.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay, go for it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "We kind of panned out recently and [indiscernible] across the healthcare spectrum I was wondering when you acquired these business and you're active or this could potentially be an issue, do you have any recourse if they were completely out of operations prior to owning the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay, I will answer that question. So we have very - obviously, a lot of experience in underwriting and understanding healthcare businesses including regulatory side, so we have an extensive due diligence process that we go through when we deal with these types. And very extensive sort of risk management processes. In general, when we acquire business and have PropCo/OpCo separation, the OpCo is responsible for those types of obligations should there be any. So prior to and after closing.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it. [Technical Difficulty] When you look at some of these investigations, some of them tempted to be dated back to the early 2000s, is there ever any responsibility for the vendor at all who further performance have actually soldiered the assets?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well again that depends on the type of acquisition and the particular terms of the transaction in a public-to-public merger, for example, they are typically as you know in any type of public-to-public merger, everybody is on the run after closing. If there are private transactions it all depends on what the terms of the purchase contract say in terms of indemnification for pre-closing obligations. I think again the key takeaway that you should understand is, when we are real estate owner, and we're doing these PropCo the operating company or the tenant is typically responsible for both pre and post-closing reimbursement items, and we typically conduct very rigorous due diligence.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right, it's the tenant but not the capital sponsor statistically?", "Debra Cafaro", "The tenant, yes, the tenant and that's again why it's important that your tenants have significant financial and operating results [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Terrific, that's a lot of help. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay, you're welcome.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Josh Raskin at Barclays. Go ahead please.", "Josh Raskin", "Thanks, good morning. First question just on the art and transaction, I'm curious to get a little bit more color, you mentioned that there was a lot of interest on the operating company, I'm assuming those are private equity shops that are looking at that - correct me if I'm wrong. And then what happens if you can't agree in a timely matter on potential valuation and ownership etcetera of that entity. What happens with the overall transaction?", "Debra Cafaro", "I'm so glad you asked that. So first of all, yes, there is significant interest in - from private equity shop and to be the majority equity owner of the Ardent OpCo and we're very happy about that. And as is typical with Ventas, we have very experienced field teams, multidisciplinary deal teams and so we typically have multiple ways to complete a transaction, and this case is no exception to that. So on the off chance that there is an outcome that is unexpected, in terms of interest or valuation for the OpCo, we have a Plan B, C and D that we could pursue and we would indeed close the acquisition, the transaction with (6th 2:55) under our purchase contract with them.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay, so you guys would just own the OpCo for however long it takes to\u2026", "Debra Cafaro", "No, no, sorry, if I communicated that. We have - again, multiple sort of backup transaction plans that would continue to limit Ventas\u2019s ownership in the OpCo pursuant to the re-rules to under 10% of the tenant.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay. And it sounds like you guys have made a lot of progress and you're assuming a couple of months from now. So is there any sense of what the valuation on that OpCo would look like at this point if they are sort of an acceptable range, even if the broad range that you're thinking about?", "Debra Cafaro", "I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you. No, we're very - I think we're in a very good spot on that compared to our underwriting expectations.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay. And then just a second question on SpinCo or I guess CCP now, we're going to get used to saying that.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, thank you.", "Josh Raskin", "Is there an estimate for what we call dissynergies, additional cost that are incurred just trying to figure out RemanCo [ph] or Ventas NOI versus CCP NOI as we - now that we've seen the Form 10.", "Bob Probst", "Sure, I'll take the Ventas side. If you look at it, although we haven't included in our guidance I'd give you the back of the envelope that says that the reset of FFO if you like arises from the Spin. If you assume the beginning of the fourth quarter, it would be called the $0.20 reduction in FFO per share for Ventas, the composition of which is through the NOI which is being spun, G&A synergy and then the interest savings rising from debt reduction following a dividend from SpinCo to Ventas. So the net-net of that is about $0.20, obviously the timing is uncertain that's why we haven't included in our guidance. But I think you've got somebody else to capture the quantum for Ventas as RemanCo.", "Debra Cafaro", "I think that G&A, dissynergy, are about $15 million.", "Josh Raskin", "$15 million?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes.", "Bob Probst", "On the SpinCo side.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay. And then I'm sorry, when you said the $0.20 FFO, do you know what's in annualized number on that?", "Bob Probst", "As soon as the quarter.", "Josh Raskin", "There is no difference, it's $0.80 for you.", "Bob Probst", "You can roughly multiply by four year.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay. Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Kevin Tyler at Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Tyler", "Good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi Kevin.", "Kevin Tyler", "Ray, you know going back to your question or I'm sorry, your comments in the triple at lease portfolio, can you help us breakout some of those pieces of the 4.8% same-store NOI growth. You said the payment wasn't in there but there was a $5.5 million of fees if I heard correctly. But it seems to me the growth is still high for the portfolio, largely triple net with least escalations in there; one in two to three percent. Any additional color you can provide would be helpful.", "Bob Probst", "Yes, so the fee that I referenced was $5 million, and then we do have some escalations that kick-in in the first quarter but from some of our larger tenants that are driving that.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay, thanks. And then turning back to Brookdale for a second, obviously a sizeable partner for you guys, but could you elaborate on the conscience you may have and your leases should sail or transaction come together and then how much you work with them to get the best outcome for both; so you and Brookdale in a situation like that?", "Debra Cafaro", "So as we mentioned we did a collaborative deal with [ph] in the first quarter that worked out well for both sides, part of our new emphasis on capital recycling and improving our portfolio. We have an excellent relationship with Brookdale, we have excellent agreements with Brookdale, and we very supportive of the company.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay, so no specific color you can provide on the consensus at this point?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think that we feel really good about Brookdale as a leading tenant and we have a good relationship with them Kevin.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay, fair enough, thanks. And then last one for me, just turning to shop for a second and some of the CapEx numbers that have been reported, I know you split it out between revenue enhancing and other buckets but it seems like the numbers have run in the double digits as a percent of NOI. And I was hoping you could shed a little bit of light on how you think about allocating these dollars and maybe why they have accelerated in recent quarters and how you think about it over the long term?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think our commitment to maintain our assets at the highest level, they are generating - they are premium properties and great markets that are generating premiums, reports, where we talked about well above NIC averages. So we're committed to continuing to keep those assets up to good standards, excellent standards. And I think in general we're spending a little bit north of 2000 a unit, we're projecting in terms of CapEx on the SHOP portfolio.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay. And the last one I had just turning back to the expense side of the equation for a second SHOP. Ray, you commented earlier just about labor and the components of expense growth, but specifically the labor - do you guys have a number that you think about in terms of percent of staff that might be subject to higher wages offered by TJ, MacDonald\u2019s, etcetera; I know that part of the staff is highly skilled that deals with higher acuity patients but what portion if you had to come up with one would you say is exposed to wage increases like that?", "Ray Lewis", "So it's really going to be the line staff in the building and certain areas of the country where there are minimum wage. So I don't have a specific percentage on that but the variable costs and the building is tend to be about 60% - the largest component of that being the line staff. You also have the folks that are in the kitchen and the housekeepers as well as that would because subject to that.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay, that's all I had. Thank you very much.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Michael Carroll", "Thanks. Can you give us some color on the potential not-for-profit hospital transaction, well I didn't take those hospital operations over and convert them to four profit.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi Mike, the - yes, I mean this is a well trident path in the hospital business, I'm going to guess - again, the majority hospitals are not for profit, many of them have lower margins but good footprints in their markets. And what the for profit hospitals will typically do is either buy one of the hospitals and then make it more efficient or they will partner. Yes, in that example, Ardent would go in and be the new operator and overtime increase those margins through driving efficiencies, often times as in the case of our Amarillo facility. In Ardent there might be a 20% or other minority stake that community not-for-profit hospital would retain and that's also a very common model. So that the not-for-profit system could get some of the benefits of those increased efficiencies, so again a very round trident path.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And then how many assets does the inferred outside of the recent deal that was completed, I know you indicated in your comments that there is more opportunities for you to expand a bad operator.", "Debra Cafaro", "Canford owns assets - Canford manages assets that we acquired and we are working with them to jointly acquire a nice newer portfolio in and around London that they would manage and we would own.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, great. And then my last question, can you give us some color on the 12th fund rising assets in Canada. It looks like that the NOI from those assets rebounded pretty good in the middle of last year but over the past few quarters it seems like they kind of - fall back down a little bit.", "Bob Probst", "Yes, so - Canada I think continued to recover in the first quarter. Obviously the year-over-year was quite good on a constant currency basis, NOI was up 7.6%, and occupancy was up 380 basis points, we're coming off of fairly weak comp. On a sequential basis the occupancy was down due to the seasonal trends that we normally see in the portfolio, and then we did have the same impact on whether in the greater Toronto area that we saw and northern New York and into Massachusetts. And then we also have the labor problem there. I would say consistent with what I said last quarter, we would like to see Sunrise make progress on expenses in Canada, and I think in our conversations with them they\u2019ve acknowledged that's a priority.", "Michael Carroll", "Are you still happy with the transition of the new employees put in the place?", "Bob Probst", "I'm sorry?", "Michael Carroll", "While merchant [ph] that's performed thoroughly because you had\u2026", "Bob Probst", "You're talking about the leadership and the building. Yes, I mean I think the top line continues to be good. Again, I think the ability to manage the expenses is what we want to see them, now start to deliver.", "Michael Carroll", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Mike. Let's move on, we have a few more questions to take.", "Operator", "Thanks. The next one is from Rich Anderson at Mizuho Securities. Go ahead please Rich.", "Rich Anderson", "Thanks, good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Rich Anderson", "So do you have a kendrid only coverage, do you provide that?", "Debra Cafaro", "We used to and since hundreds - I think 9% of our business right now it's mixed in with the rest of coverage.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. Could you say it's in the range of what the broader coverage number is?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I mean if you - it's going to be in the closure to wish, a cash flow to red coverage for the kinder grant.", "Rich Anderson", "Do you have speaking in terms of PropCo / OpCo comments you made earlier, do you have any hesitation to take on an ownership stake in OpCo\u2019s in light of some of the events of the recent with some of the DOJ activity?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think we have a great risk-reward proposition at Bencash [ph] for our shareholders which is really reliable growing cash flows, limited volatility, and leases at the top of the capital structure and so on. I do think as the business has evolved and we've been at the forefront of that, there have been different models that we have come up with in different circumstances, both to create alignment with operators, as well as to make money for shareholders, a guard rail sort of way, and we can see that potentially with the 9% stake we may take in Ardent or things like that. So obviously we're careful about what we do and how we do it, we take it very seriously. First and foremost, we want to do business with the best operators, and we believe that we do so. And we're very careful when we do take these equity stake.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. And do you have any comment about [indiscernible] specifically but generally about some of this activity potentially becoming more of a mainstream conversation for the entire asset class?", "Debra Cafaro", "Look, again, I think we do business with good operators, Kendrick for example and the other operators we do business with have excelled compliance programs. But as you and I have discussed from time to time in healthcare you do see some of these things occur and I think it's important in any business, no matter how successful you are to remain humble. And the main thing in this situation is that you have good operators, that they good risk programs, that they have good financial [ph] so that they have the ability to - if any of these things do come up to work through them in a position of strength in an orderly way.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, great. And I just have one suggestion, you could give same-store disclosure for MOBs and SHOP, I would throw my hand and say maybe we can have the same thing for triple net, just a suggestion. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. The next question is from the line of Vincent Chao at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Vincent Chao", "Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered here already, just - I know it gone around a couple of different ways in terms of the hospital opportunity, but I'm just wondering quite simplistically of the 5,000 or 6,000 hospitals out there in the US, I guess what percentage of those do you guys consider in the investible universe?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, there is 3,000 owned by not-for-profit, so even if you took half of them it would be a pretty big number. And importantly these are large single opportunities and I would imagine that we and Ardent together, if we acquired one or two of these things a year, I mean we would be on fire. So the thing I love about the hospital business is, you only need it so big, you only need a little bit of success to be very successful. And I do think that we will put together a really great try ad of top hospital client, TS over 400 hospital clients or have a good private equity partner, hopefully and we'll have our real estate capital and all this capability. So hopefully we can find one or two of the 3,000 not-for-profit here to drive growth.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from John Kim at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "John Kim", "Thank you, good morning. I have questions on Tier capital. Since you made the announcement, have you been approached by any third party\u2019s to buy some more all the assets being spun out?", "Debra Cafaro", "We're really focused on completing the stand and getting our Form 10 filed as we did yesterday.", "John Kim", "Would you consider any alter step that were made to?", "Debra Cafaro", "Again, I mean I think Ventas is always interested in creating the maximum value for shareholders and right now we're very focused on completing the Spin as it's been announced.", "John Kim", "Also if the assets are being transferred to CCP at booked value and it's net of cumulative depreciation, was there an option to transfer the portfolio at the fair market value or you basically implying that this is the fair market value?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay, the company is going to be worth $5 billion or upwards of that and [Technical Difficulty] accounting document so policy accounting rules which are booked value.", "Bob Probst", "There is no judgment in this, it's simply a transfer book, those are the rules.", "Debra Cafaro", "The Form 10 reflects the booked value, it is not in any way attempt to reflect the market value of those assets which is quite high.", "John Kim", "Right, okay. I'm just wondering if you had made an acquisition, you would put the full value of that acquisition on your book and basically CCP is taking the net asset value?", "Bob Probst", "Yes, and I think it's important to remember that a number of these assets were - Ventas added very inception in 1997, and before that Invencore were acquired in a pooled accounting method and never written up. So, I mean the basis on these things in some circumstances goes back to 80s. So\u2026", "Debra Cafaro", "So I think the way you should think about it is we are creating a lot of value.", "John Kim", "Got it, okay. And then also there is going to be an extra $43 million of merger related cost this year and approximately $25 million related to the Spin off. Is Care Capital paying a similar amount as far as their portion of the transaction cost?", "Bob Probst", "Just to clarify, the increases in the deal process I think you see in the table and the press release is really a function of the Ardent transaction which is a significant increase in change from where we were last guidance. As I said, we haven't included any cost in our outlook here, including those costs are separation for SpinCo, so that's not in that number.", "John Kim", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of George Hockland [ph], Jefferies. Go ahead please.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Why don't you just give a little bit of additional color on the potential impacts of the recent CMS proposals on the Q-care and L-Tax side especially since there seems to be a bunch of moving pieces on the L-Tax side where the client could be as high as 4.6%?", "Debra Cafaro", "Happy to do that, I think that the rate increase itself is up 1.2%, and as we expected and as everyone knew the L-Tax are going to have patient certification criteria come into play, for tenders that's not going to start until the fourth quarter of 2016, and there is a two-year phase after that. So there will be some individual hospital ups and downs as it relates to that. But in general, this is something that has been expected for some time, and I think you will see it play out over the kind of 2017 plus period.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you. We have time for couple of more questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Todd Spender at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning and thanks for staying on.", "Debra Cafaro", "We're happy to do it Todd, go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Bob, just that I get it right, you highlighted that you might expect some decline in Q2 results I think due to recent disposition volume. But when you look at same-store, what kind of offset can we expect maybe due to seasonality and senior housing, I guess how much seasonality is there specifically an independent living thing? And maybe can you comment on the recent holiday portfolio.", "Bob Probst", "Okay, in terms of phasing on same-store, you will see a slowdown in the phasing of same-store, quarter-to-quarter sequentially, that is really a function of the fees I talked about which we realized in the first quarter, don't expect it to recur in the second quarter. Offset in part to your point on SHOP where we will see an acceleration in growth beginning in the second quarter due to that seasonality. So those are dynamics there but net-net for the size of those are such that you're going to have slower growth. At a more macro level we talked about the growth slowing year-on-year and down sequentially, I mean that's really a function of disposition proceeds versus the reinvestment, so disposition really largely realized, reinvestments in our beginning in the second half as we discussed. So it's really a timing issue in all cases.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks Bob, and any specific comments you can make on how holiday is trending?", "Bob Probst", "You want to take that?", "Ray Lewis", "You know a holiday is generally in line with our expectations and performing as expected.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Jordan Satla [ph] at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning, thank you. So as it relates to the reimbursement question as a follow-up to George\u2019s question, can you respond also as it relates to the Q-Care reimbursement levels and how they may have foot relative to your underwriting and expectations on Ardent?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, yes. So hospitals are proposed rule, again all these rules are proposed, they are subject to comment and they will be finalized in July or August. So in the case of hospitals, they are giving a market basket increase of almost 2%, there are some offsets to that relatively to productivity and affordable care act, and those are again very much in line with our expectations on Ardent. Ardent is doing well, they are performing well, I think we have - and they have modest expectations in the go forward numbers for Medicare increases, and really what you have to do is where you have these markets leading positions in markets, you have to drive commercial pay hour rate increases which really tend to be higher than Medicare rate increases and drive volume and cost efficiencies.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thank you. And then, I heard you in the prior question as it related to SpinCo or CCP rather, reference $5 billion plus number in terms of valuation. So should we assume sub 6.5% cap rate, am I thinking about that correctly?", "Debra Cafaro", "Go for it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So that math pencils then, right? I'm thinking about that correct relatively to the $5 billion plus?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, that's close enough for government work, how is that?", "Unidentified Analyst", "That's perfect. Last one, quick one is on the Ardent transaction, I know in guidance it's July 1; is the funding assumption embedded in guidance Bob, is that funded on the line or is that at your average borrowing rate? Is there some equity layered in there, what's hitting the guidance there?", "Bob Probst", "Yes, it's consistent with our capital structure so you're going to have - and the disposition proceeds, so we're going to have a mix of funding sources there very consistent with our overall capital structure. Our leverage needs the assumption.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you. I'll take one more question and then we'll wrap it up.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein at Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Last but not least. I guess one question I have is, in the beginning of the call you talked about stronger bids or anticipating of stronger bids, I look at the 7% or so on Ardent, 5.7% on the MOBs you sold that looked like smaller, tertiary MOBs. How should I think about where cap rates have gone for the last six months to down 25 basis points to 50 basis points, so I'm thinking 7% on hospitals, is it really low five\u2019s and seniors in MOBs for good high quality portfolios?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think we have seen - as we saw in June of last year, a compression of cap rates for quality healthcare assets because of the good cash flows and demand profile for the assets. And so I would say for high quality MOBs and senior housing you're definitely are going to be sub-six, and in some cases for B\u2019s assets, you're going to be potentially six or below if it's a large portfolio. So there has been compression and we're glad that we're early and large owners of both of those asset types.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay, I'll hop off, it's been a long call. Thanks.", "End of Q&A", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Well, thank you for hanging in there with us and I thank everyone else for joining us today and for your support of both, Ventas and CCP. And we look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Jess, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. David Smith, Manager, Investor Relations and Capital Markets. And you have the floor, sir.", "David J. Smith", "Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I'll now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, David, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas third quarter 2011 earnings call. We're so happy to be with you today, reporting on excellent results that for the first time include a full quarter of those on Atria and NHP acquisitions. Together, these acquisitions improved our private-pay NOI percentage, significantly diversified our business, increased our percentage of NOI from high-quality private-pay senior housing, and we're accretive to earnings. And importantly, all of these occurred with a very, very strong balance sheet. First, I want to thank more than 60 investors and analysts who attended our New York Atria property tour on October 20. The tour showcased 7 of our high-quality private-pay senior housing communities managed by Atria. Those who attended undoubtedly could see why we acquired the portfolio. These communities knock your socks off in terms of physical plant, location and wealthy sub-markets and high service levels. ", "Atria, the fourth largest assisted living operator in the U.S., also highlighted its commitment to delivering a gold standard customer experience for its residents and its track record of delivering high returning, environmentally focused redevelopment projects. Today, I'll provide a brief overview of the quarter and discuss how we are executing on our larger, more diverse platform. Ray will review our portfolio performance, and Rick will end with a detailed review of our financial results. Following our presentation, we'll be happy to take your questions. ", "In 2011, Ventas completed $11 billion of acquisitions and today, we're a $20-plus billion S&P 500 company, with multiple avenues for growth that generates 1.4 billion of diversified NOI from over 1,300 properties with the lion share derived from private-pay sources. We continue to focus on delivering consistent superior total return to our shareholders by growing cash flows and managing enterprise risk. ", "Ventas' balance sheet, ratings and liquidity continued to be excellent, aided by our Atria and NHP acquisitions. Our current net debt to EBITDA is an outstanding 4.7x, and our current fixed charge coverage well exceeds 4x. These industry-leading credit statistics position us with significant dry powder as additional, attractive investment opportunities come our way. ", "The rating agencies have recognized the benefits of our diversified platform, size, increased tenant-operator relationships and strong balance sheet. Both Fitch and Moody's upgraded Ventas' credit ratings during the third quarter to BBB+ and Baa2 respectively. We have also continued to reduce our borrowing costs and increase our liquidity. Not only did we issue $700 million in 10-year bonds in May at 4 3/4%. We also closed a new $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility in October. This new facility added $1 billion of liquidity, extended the maturity from early 2012 to late 2016, and significantly improved our pricing. At LIBOR plus 125 basis points, we currently have the lowest healthcare reach spread in the revolver market. We will remain relentless in our focus to drive down our capital cost, as well as maintain financial strength and flexibility going forward. These dual attributes will allow us to be both opportunistic and safe. ", "Our NHP integration efforts are proceeding well. Our teams are working effectively together and we are on track to realize the $15 million in G&A synergies we previously announced, a savings of 50% from the NHP run rate. We're also executing on the growth aspects of our powerful consolidated platform. In October, we closed over $150 million of investments, which included 2 MOBs under our Lillibridge platform, one seniors housing asset that will be added to our Atria portfolio, and another triple-net lease seniors housing asset with a new highly desirable operating partner. ", "We had a great quarter as a result of our acquisitions and our teams' execution. Ventas reported normalized FFO per share of $0.88, a 20.5% increase over the third quarter of 2010. Our NOI is growing and diversifying. Our FFO and cash flow per share are increasing, and our balance sheet is industry-leading. Even if you choose to eliminate all of our net noncash income, Ventas' FFO would be $0.82 per share this quarter, representing 12.3% year-over-year growth, and extremely high-quality results. With the benefit of NHP, we now expect full year 2011 normalized FFO per share to range between $3.34 to $3.36 per share, an increase of $0.15 at the mid-point over our prior range. So in sum, we're very pleased with our position both financially and strategically, following our recent transactions, and we look forward to harvesting the benefits of our assets and our platform going forward for the benefit of our shareholders. Ray?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Thanks, Debbie. With the Atria and NHP acquisitions, our balanced portfolio now includes over 1,300 properties in 47 states and 2 Canadian provinces, contains over 100 tenant-operator relationships, and is diversified by asset class and payer source, with the vast majority of our NOI coming from private-pay assets such as seniors housing and medical office buildings. Ventas' portfolio continues to provide consistent and reliable cash flow growth. For the third quarter, our same-store portfolio of 597 properties provided strong cash flow growth of 3.4% over the third quarter of 2010 after adjusting for a $2 million cash payment received from Sunrise, and equalizing the management fee in the 2010 comparison period. Moreover, our same-store cash flow growth statistic includes only those properties that we owned in both periods and, therefore, it does not get the benefit of the high-growth Atria-managed assets that we acquired in the second quarter of this year. ", "First, I would like to discuss our triple-net-lease portfolio. This portfolio now includes all of the NHP properties, and accounts for 61% of Ventas' NOI. It contains over 900 properties, and is well diversified across the seniors housing, skilled nursing and hospital asset classes. Cash flow coverage in the entire triple-net portfolio was a solid 1.7x rent through the second quarter of 2011, the latest date available. Furthermore, same-store cash NOI growth was 2.7% over the prior year, driven primarily by contractual rent escalations. ", "As a point of clarification, we report our triple-net-lease coverages 1 quarter in arrears. As such, this combined coverage information is only for the legacy Ventas portfolio, and excludes the NHP portfolio, which we did not own in the second quarter. In order to provide visibility into the consolidated triple-net-lease portfolio, including the NHP assets, we have provided 5 quarters of historical occupancy and coverage data by asset class in our supplemental. For all 3 asset classes, seniors housing, hospitals and skilled nursing, coverages were stable and occupancies were consistent with historical levels during the comparison periods. ", "As many of you know, Ventas has strategically invested with a goal of diversifying its portfolio and increasing its private-pay revenues. As a result of the 11-plus billion dollars of acquisitions that we have completed, private-pay assets now provide nearly 70% of our NOI. In addition, our skilled nursing portfolio continues to perform well. Consolidated skilled nursing portfolio cash flow coverage, including our Kindred portfolio, was a healthy 2x in the second quarter. Assuming a 13% cut to Medicare revenues on average and a 25% mitigation on average by our operators, coverage would still be a healthy 1.7x, all other things being equal. So we continue to believe that our skilled nursing rents are well covered and should provide sustainable cash flow to Ventas. ", "Now let's turn to our seniors housing operating portfolio. As previously mentioned, this is the first full quarter of operating results for the 117 communities managed by Atria that were acquired on May 12. Combined with our 79 highly productive assisted living communities managed by Sunrise, we now have a portfolio of 196 senior housing operating properties, which account for approximately 25% of our annualized NOI. This portfolio is located primarily in high barrier to entry coastal markets, with strong wealth demographics, and contains some of the very best assets markets and operators in the industry", ". ", "Ventas' Sunrise's portfolio of 79 high-quality mansion-style communities continue to deliver solid performance, generating $40 million of NOI for the third quarter, which is a sequential increase of 1.2%, and represents the second highest quarterly NOI since we acquired the portfolio in 2007. Year-over-year NOI increased a strong 5.6% after making the previously mentioned adjustments for cash payments and management fee in the 2010 comparison period, and year-over-year average daily rate grew a solid 4.1%. Resident occupancy for this portfolio increased 120 basis points sequentially to 90.6% compared to the second quarter of 2011. And based on recent performance, we expect average occupancy for our Sunrise portfolio to be up slightly for the fourth quarter as well. So as you can see, our Sunrise portfolio continues to perform right in line with the assumptions we provided in February for rate and occupancy in 2011. ", "Before I leave Sunrise, I just want to give a quick reminder that we negotiated a reduction in the management fee that we pay to Sunrise at the time we purchased Sunrise minority interest in our portfolio in December of 2010. Beginning in January 2012, the base management fee will return to 6% of revenues from the current 3.75% level. ", "Now let's turn to Atria, which also delivered solid performance in the third quarter, and was in line with our expectations. NOI for the third quarter, our first full quarter of ownership, was $47.5 million. This reflects high single-digit growth over the prior year when Atria owned the portfolio, and is consistent with what we projected when we acquired the portfolio. And like our Sunrise assets, the Atria communities also experienced positive occupancy trends during the third quarter, with average unit occupancy up 60 basis points to 87.4% since June. ", "During the quarter, we moved 2 assets from redevelopment into the stabilized pool, one high-end assisted and independent living community on 86th Street in New York, which achieved 95% occupancy during the third quarter and another asset in Sunnyvale, California, which was at 94% occupancy during the third quarter. We also commenced redevelopment on one asset during the quarter, and our redevelopment pool now consists of 6 properties, which contributed $1.2 million of NOI in the third quarter. Both lease-up and rate growth trends in this portfolio are very positive. For example, we opened one asset in Glen Cove on Long Island in September that is currently over 40% occupied, separately, another green-assisted living community in Westchester County that opened in April is now over 2/3 occupied with rates of approximately $7,000 per month, over 60% above the rates of the building generated prior to redevelopment. We continue to be impressed by Atria's unmatched redevelopment expertise. We are excited about the redevelopment opportunities in our portfolio, and look forward to announcing additional projects in the coming quarters. ", "So both our Sunrise and Atris portfolios are performing well, tracking the guidance that we provided earlier this year. And as the largest owner of seniors housing in the U.S., Ventas should continue to benefit from the positive supply-demand fundamentals in the industry. Construction starts compared to overall inventory continued to be very modest, and totaled less than 1% of overall inventory for the third quarter. Moreover, demand is increasing as the 85-plus population, which is our target market, continues to grow at 3 times the rate of the overall population. These positive fundamentals should continue to drive performance in our seniors housing operating portfolio, where we are the direct beneficiary of the NOI at the communities. ", "Now I'd like to briefly discuss Ventas' medical office building portfolio, which accounts for 11% of the company's NOI. Ventas' owned medical office portfolio now totals over 230 medical office buildings, and including our managed properties, spans across approximately 14 million square feet. The vast majority of these medical office buildings are on campuses of leading hospitals and health systems. As you know, Ventas' medical office portfolio has grown significantly over the past 5 quarters due to our Lillibridge acquisition in July of 2010, along with our recent NHP acquisition, which came with a strategic relationship with Pacific Medical buildings and exclusive rights to over 1 billion of future development for Class A medical offices. As a result, Ventas is now the largest, fully integrated owner, manager and developer of medical office buildings in the United States with a coast-to-coast presence. ", "Our medical office portfolio delivered another quarter of consistent performance. Our total owned same-store medical office portfolio delivered another year of consistent performance with year-over-year cash flow growth of 2.6%. Year-over-year, our 57 consolidated same-store stable assets generated $12 million of NOI, consistent with the comparison period and an occupancy of 93.5%, which is comfortably above industry averages. Sequentially, our consolidated same-store stable portfolio contains 63 properties that delivered similarly strong and consistent performance in NOI, and grew occupancy by 30 basis points. ", "With the addition of NHP, our stable-owned portfolio now contains 169 properties, an increase of 106 properties over the Ventas stable-owned portfolio in the second quarter of 2011. This portfolio is 91.6% occupied, and accounts for over $137 million of annualized NOI. Trends in our medical office business are very positive. During the third quarter, we experienced an increase in leasing activity, including new and expansion leasing. ", "During the third quarter, our same-store weighted average tenant retention rate was 84%. We are also experiencing an uptick in requests for proposals on new development, with 8 projects totaling about $80 million for which we have been awarded exclusive rights to work on development. With over 14 million square feet owned and managed, our MOB portfolio provides the scale and financial performance to leverage the full-service capabilities of our Lillibridge platform. Coupled with our partnership with Pacific Medical, we now have the fully-scaled, multi-capability medical office platform that we set out to create just 4 years ago. ", "Just a quick note on acquisitions before I turn it over to Rich Schweinhart. As you know, we closed our acquisition of NHP at the beginning of the third quarter, and we've been intensely focused on integrating and assimilating this transaction since we announced it in February. With respect to the external environment, conditions remain very fluid. During the third quarter, moderating expectations for domestic economic growth, volatility in the capital markets and the impacts of larger-than-expected CMS reimbursement reductions injected some caution into the markets and serve to reinforce the value of diversification, private-pay revenues and stable, growing cash flows, 3 important strategic themes in our acquisitions of NHP and Atria. However, as the capital markets began to stabilize and improve in September, we also saw an uptick in actionable senior housing in MOB investment opportunities, and our pipeline is pretty active heading into the fourth quarter. In fact, we have about 200 million of primarily MOB properties under contract and at various stages of diligence. In addition, subsequent to the quarter end, we closed 3 separate transactions, totaling $150 million at an average yield of 7 3/4%, and comprised of 2 seniors housing assets and 2 medical office buildings. With these transactions completed and under contract, our originations team will have acquired approximately $1 billion of asset-level deals in 2011. ", "Looking forward, we are well-positioned to find and win transactions with our regional origination capabilities, our numerous strategic relationships with operators and health systems and our strong balance sheet and competitive cost of capital. However, while we should have sufficient opportunities to deploy capital, we intend to continue to invest with discipline, focus on delivering reliable and growing cash flow to our investors, and grow our portfolio in a strategic and thoughtful manner. Rick?", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. There were 3 major events in the quarter and one following quarters' end. First and foremost was that on July 1, we purchased Nationwide Health Properties Inc. by issuing 100 million shares and assuming debt of $2 billion. NHP's result are included in our consolidated statements of income for the entire third quarter. Second, also in July, we borrowed funds on our revolver to repay $339 million in NHP's maturing senior notes, and $200 million in Ventas' 6.5% senior notes due 2016. Third, in August, we received our litigation award of $102.8 million from HCP, and used the proceeds to pay down the revolver. ", "Now let me talk a little about third quarter results. Third quarter 2011 normalized FFO was $0.88 per share, per diluted share, an increase of 20.5% compared to the third quarter of 2010 per share results of $0.73. Normalized FFO increased 120% to $255 million compared to last year's third quarter of $115 million. Normalized FFO in the third quarter includes a full quarter of our second quarter Atria acquisition and a full quarter of our NHP acquisition. It excludes the net benefit totaling $9.2 million from net litigation proceeds and income tax benefit, partially offset by merger-related expenses and deal and integration costs, mark-to-market, adjustment for derivatives, loss on extinguishment of debt and amortization of other intangibles. ", "Third quarter normalized FFO increased from last year's third quarter due to NOI increases in all 3 of our segments: triple net, seniors housing operating and medical office, as well as income from loans and investments. Triple-net lease revenues grew to $211 million from $118 million last year, primarily due to NHP and also due to contractual escalations. Seniors housing operating NOI increased $48 million, in part from improved Sunrise operating results and principally due to the Atria acquisition. ", "The Sunrise-managed portfolio grew to $40 million this quarter from $39 million last year. Last year's results included a $2 million cash payment from Sunrise for expense overages. Third quarter medical office building NOI grew to $41.3 million from $18.3 million last year primarily due to NHP. Both periods include $1.3 million in unconsolidated joint venture earnings. ", "Income from loans and investments increased to $10 million this year from $4 million last year due to NHP's portfolio. On the expense side, consolidated interest expense increased to $74 million this year from $45.5 million last year, reflecting the assumed debt in the Atria and NHP acquisitions, as well as all the debt activity in the last year. Looking at sequential results, normalized FFO increased $113.5 million to this quarter's $255 million. The principal reason for the increase is the NHP acquisition, effective July 1, and a full quarter's results for the Atria portfolio, which we acquired mid-second quarter. Interest expense increased by $20 million in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, primarily due to assumed debt of NHP and a full quarter of Atria. Even with that increase, our interest expense coverage is fantastic at over 4.5x. We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flow from operations. ", "At September 30, our cash balance was $57.5 million, and we have $474 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility and $250 million outstanding on our $800 million term loan. With our new revolver and assumed term loan, we currently have net liquidity of $1.8 billion. With our new revolver, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years. At September 30, our credit stats were net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA at 4.7x, our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 4x and debt-to-enterprise value, 31%. ", "Let me recap our third quarter dividend, which was divided into 2 installments on account of our NHP acquisition. On July 12, we paid a dividend to stockholders of record to the -- prior to the NHP acquisition of $0.1264 per share. On September 30, we paid a dividend of $0.4486 per share. The combined amounts totaled $0.575 per share, which is the same dividend we paid for the first and second quarter. Our FFO payout ratio is an excellent 65%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were 291 million shares, an increase of 84% over the third quarter of last year and 63% over the second quarter. Our fully diluted share count already covers all the shares we are likely to issue when our 3 7/8% convertible senior notes mature on November 15, 2011. We are increasing our 2011 normalized FFO per share guidance, and tightening the range of our guidance to $3.34 to $3.36 from $3.17 to $3.23. We expect our fourth quarter normalized FFO per share to range between $0.87 and $0.89. ", "This increase in annual guidance is the result of better operating results and the inclusion of about $0.12 of net non-cash earnings in the second half, primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments. Many of the non-cash components will burn off over time, so we are going to try to call them out separately in the future, so you can see movement in the cash portion of results. Because of the increase in our FFO and large change in our weighted share count, it is possible that the full-year computation of FFO per diluted share could be as much as $0.04 higher than the sum of the 4 reported quarters, that's why we have provided separate fourth quarter FFO guidance. Operator, let's take our shareholders' questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] First up, we have Mr. Michael Bilerman with Citigroup.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Question on the development, which you include now in the supplemental on Page 17, you have about 131 million of spend that's listed, the majority of which is the one asset for PMB and then Brookdale. And then Ray, I think, you talked about $200 million or $80 million of potential new MOB development that you're targeting, how should we think about development sort of spend and that portion on your business in terms of driving growth?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Michael, I think we'll always do a modest level of development relative to our total portfolio size. And as you see on the schedule on Page 6 on our supplemental, it's a reasonable pipeline of development. We look at development as an opportunity for us to add new properties to our portfolio, enhance existing relationships and drive higher yields than the acquisition side, so put a little extra also in the portfolio. And this pipeline of opportunity should do that.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And you expect it to grow, I guess, adding that $80 million that this probably could be a $250 million to $400 million pipeline over time?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, I would say at the upper end, yes.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "And that's again, it's about less than 2% of our total balance sheet, even at $400 million.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Thinking about just from a tenant and asset management perspective, one of the benefits of doing a lot of these transactions was diversifying your tenants and your top 5 tenants have gone from 86% of NOI down to 62% of NOI. But those under 1% jumped dramatically from under 4% of NOI to over 26%, so just a lot of smaller individual tenants that came out of the NHP portfolio. I guess, as you've taken those over, what are you sort of -- before, you used to have -- you had 5 people you called, and you got a pretty good sense of your portfolio and how the tenants were doing. Now, they have much bigger exercise, and I'm just curious from a management perspective, how you're dealing with that and then sort of what the health is of a lot of those smaller tenants that you have?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, that's a great question, and we're very happy that we further diversified our portfolio and have increased our tenant relationship 6x. I mean, that was one of the positives of the NHP transaction. As you correctly point out, there would be a different asset management style and perhaps, tenant [ph] control when you have multiple smaller relationships. And Ray and our Head of Asset Management, Tim Doman, who are here with us today, have been spending a lot of time basically dealing with organizational structure going forward. We've obviously retained the NHP asset management group, and that has the historical knowledge of the portfolio. And we would expect to have a larger asset management group as we go forward to manage that portfolio. But it's a real positive again that we have multiple tenant relationships. Those are areas for future growth, and they also minimize risk in the portfolio.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I would just add one point to that, Michael and that is that before we acquired NHP, we had a highly scalable asset management system. And we've been able to get the NHP data uploaded into the Ventas asset management system, and that's enabled us to continue to have visibility and to all of our tenant operator relationships. So a lot of focus on that during the integration phase.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And this is my last question just in regards to the HCP Ventas lawsuit, Jay Flaherty has said both in August and on his recent call that the litigation has been expensive and distracting, and that they would prefer to settle the matter if reasonably possible. And I'm just curious, are you in settlement negotiations? Or has a settlement amount been proposed to you to resolve the matter? Or are you just progressing forth to the court case in February of next year?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, couple things. We did receive the $102.8 million compensatory award, as Rick pointed out in the third quarter. We -- the punitive damage trial has been set for the 21st of February, 2012 in the Louisville Federal Court. HCP has filed a petition for the Supreme Court to hear its case, and they filed that on October 25 of this year and we've obviously, opposed that petition. And finally, beyond that, I think, I just wouldn't comment other than to say that we have never been offered any amount to be paid for the HCP litigation from HCP.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just to start maybe, I guess, it's a Rick question, a little more color on sort of the noncash items, and you talked about them burning off, but any sense of what that tail looks like because it does move the numbers a lot?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, it does. And this -- I think this is a really important aspect of our earnings, and we're really endeavoring to be excessively transparent, if you will, in the way that we have reported this quarter's earnings. And I do think that's a value that we have and something that we consider to be important. The -- let me give you some -- so again, just to repeat, our earnings, our normalized FFO earnings are $0.88 a share. That's fantastic, 20-plus percent year-over-year growth. What we've done is tried to call out that there's about $0.06 in there that is kind of non-cash GAAP required earnings. And then even if you took all of that out, which by the way, most companies have some non-cash earnings in their normalized FFO. So that's why, I mean, we're being, I think, excessively conservative and transparent in the way that we reported it. But the kinds of things those are will burn off at various times to the extent they relate to a lease theory. They'll extend over the whole lease term. The best example I can give you is really on the interest side, if we took over an NHP senior note, say, and say that senior note was a 10-year note at 7.5%, but it matures say, next year. We would have to book the interest expense at the 1 year rate of Ventas' borrowing rate. So that's a pickup in earnings. Now when we go to refinance that and we do a great job and say we get 4.5 or whatever, our cash results will be better, but the way GAAP books it, our GAAP results will be a little bit worse on that particular component. So it gets a little complicated. It depends on the various lines. But what we expect to see and the reason in part we're calling this out is that we would expect to see the cash portion going up and the noncash portion over -- tailing off over time, depending on what the various noncash items are. So hopefully, in an effort to be transparent, we haven't really confused you but...", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Well you probably have, but it may just be me.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay. GAAP is very confusing, I would say.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And it's not like one nice, neat item. It's basically spread in a bunch of different places.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It is. Yes, it is. And it's really a function of doing a lot of acquisitions and what the purchase accounting rules are.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And just sort of optically, I don't know if you have this or maybe you can do it when you do a fourth quarter guidance for next year. So optically, if we think about that $0.06 a quarter, obviously, it continues into 4Q.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Burn-off, if we think about it just through 2012, is there any material burn-offs through 2012? Or I should think that $0.06 just stays with me..", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, we'll get -- that's a good suggestion to -- that we can provide more on when we report the fourth quarter. But for now, it's probably as good as anything else to carry that on.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then just a couple of other things, if I could. Just view on the dividend, I mean, obviously, you've got this great earnings growth. I think you calculated with the noncash of 65% payout ratio, which is wonderful. Just -- I mean, how are you thinking about dividend, maybe as a ratio to FAD or FFO? Or should we be thinking of more growth on the dividend side?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we -- a couple of principles that we'll state and some past practice. We believe that dividend growth is an important part of delivering total shareholder return which, obviously, is the holy grail for us. We have about an 8% dividend CAGR on the Ventas dividend for the last 4, 5 years. We typically do look at the dividend in the first quarter of the year. And we will look at those FFO payout ratio and again, right now, that's about 65%, very, very strong, a well-covered dividend. And we'll look at it in relation to cash flow as well, but I think Ventas is -- again, this is a very important investment attribute of Ventas, which is the prospect of dividend growth -- history of in the prospect of future dividend growth.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And so based on what you're saying, I'm assuming that in first quarter, we'll get a dividend increase and we may need to think about it more on a cash basis than with this noncash stuff?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's both. I mean, I think you look at FFO coverage and you look at the cash as well and you triangulate to a good outcome that in the past has been very positive for shareholders. So hopefully, we'll be able to continue that in the future.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "All right. Last thing for me. Obviously, all the Medicare stuff, I don't necessarily want to hold rehash of lease coverage. But are there any items in your portfolio, property income portfolio either with the Kindred or with some of the smaller operators where you expect either lease terminations on maturity or renegotiations? Is there going to be any noise as we get into kind of fourth quarter, first quarter because of the Medicare rate stuff?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "So Jerry, as I said in my remarks, I mean, even with a 13% cut in Medicare reimbursement and the 25% mitigation, we'd be at 1.7x across the portfolio. That's consistent between our Kindred and NHP assets generally. So we've got a large diversified portfolio with a number of operators in it. There is nothing material that we would anticipate in the fourth or the first quarter that would arise as a result of the announced cuts in reimbursement.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "As you're evaluating your acquisition pipeline, I was curious how you think about balancing the triple-net exposure versus MOBs and then the senior housing operating?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "When we look at our portfolio, right now, we -- the combination of the NHP and Atria transactions did a number of things for us. It decreased our triple-net-lease exposure to currently 61% on an NOI basis. And it increased our seniors housing operating assets to about 25% of the total portfolio. And I think because we're in a very good part of the cycle on seniors housing with low construction and growing demand, I would guess that, that part of our portfolio is generally going to be in the 25% to 33% range over time. I would again emphasize though that it's not so much the percentage that we care about, it's the kind of assets operators and markets that we're having in that operating portfolio because we really have with Atria and Sunrise, as you know, the best market, best physical plans and the best operators in that operating portfolio. And as a result, and you can see this from some of the trends, that we believe that has more upside and a more protected downside. And so when you have operating assets, that's really how we think about it. But again, we would expect that to be between sort of 25 and 1/3. And then on the triple-net lease side, again, with the NHP and Atria transaction, that part of our business is 61% now, down from 68% previously. The triple-net leases gives us a good year-over-year kind of growth rate in good times and in bad, and we would expect that to continue to be a significant portion of our portfolio. Maybe it will shrink a little bit over time, but it is an important part of our business, and will continue to be so going forward.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then are you comfortable underwriting skilled nursing acquisitions at this time? Or is that an asset class you'll probably stay away from in the near term?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, I mean, we -- having been here for 12 years, I think we really understand the skilled nursing business. I would say that it -- there are some positives about the skilled nursing business. It's a low-cost provider, which is an important part of the long-term sort of healthcare delivery systems to seniors. And we think in the right time in the cycle at the right price and the right structure that it's a valid part of someone's portfolio. I think I'll defer to Ray in terms of what you could expect from us going forward.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, I would just echo what Debbie's saying. We think it's an important part of the healthcare continuum. It is a low-cost provider. It is going to be, going forward, an important part of the healthcare system. So we will continue to have an interest in owning skilled nursing buildings. That all having been said, there's not a lot of activity in the marketplace right now. I think people are very internally focused on making sure that they mitigate the -- that they focus their efforts on mitigating the cuts, that they are working on their operations rather than thinking about monetizing their portfolio in a relatively less certain environment. So I do think we're going to see a lot near term. That being said, as this plays out, there may actually be some good buying opportunities, and we're going to keep our eyes peeled for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Could we talk about the rent reset from Kindred and when -- I think it's 2013 that things start to expire, is that correct, re-expire?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, you're right. There's a portion of the Kindred portfolio that's up for renewal in May of 2013, and some of that has a reset rate in it in Ventas' favor.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. So where would you say -- you said in Ventas' favor, where would you say rents are in light of CMS and everything else where rents are relative to market today?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, so the assets that are up for renewal with Kindred in 2013, it's about 9% of our total NOI and it's currently covering EBITDARM about 2.1x, so very, very strong coverage. So with sort of you can call it a 15% reduction on the Medicare side and maybe 1/3 of mitigation or something like that gets you back to about a 10% impact. It's still covering quite well. There's about 40% hospitals in there, which have received an increase in Medicare reimbursement recently, and about 60% skilled nursing. So net-net, I'd say about market rents for that portfolio, it's a profitable group of assets even after changes -- known changes in reimbursement.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Just getting back to the non-cash element to your FFO, was there any thought to not having that normalized FFO, so that we weren't having this conversation or a portion of it?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, the answer is no. I mean, the answer is no because this is really -- I mean, it is really normal FFO. And as I said, most companies have a significant amount of kind of non-cash items. If you look at their cash flow statements in their regular FFO and we do too. It just happens that because of the volume of the acquisition activity, we happen to have a bunch. And so we tried to call it out for you. Again, I know the REIT analysts are always trying to make a better FFO or make a better FAD or what have you, but I really like the income -- or the cash flow statement because that's a GAAP statement, and you can look at it. It's apples-to-apples pretty much for everyone, and so it is normal FFO. It's just we're trying to make it, again, conservative and very transparent for you.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "When you underwent that purchase accounting change as you described it, did this noncash income, I know there's several kind of parts of it, but did it come from someplace else? In other words, it was maybe viewed as cash, and now it's non-cash or something like that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No. And in fact, that's why our guidance is going up and it's going up more than the noncash items because the -- we typically underwrite on a cash basis, obviously, because that's what we care about. And so that comes -- the cash part is coming in, better than we expected, and then the non-cash part is an add-on on top of that, if you will, so we...", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. That's fine. And then last question is the element of your increase that was kind of the outperformance as I think, Rick described it. You had in line, Sunrise in line, Atria, where did it come from? Was it from the NHP portfolio? Or is it kind of all over the place?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's all over the place, a little bit from NHP, a little bit from better cash interest expense, et cetera, better capital cost, lower deal cost, that sort of thing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Sorry to beat a dead horse on the non-cash, but when \u2013- you said you underwrite to -- on a cash basis. When you quoted your pricing on NHP back at the time of the acquisition, I think it was like an 18 times FFO multiple, that does not include \u2013 that was a cash basis, right? That does not include this noncash income?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Essentially, yes.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And is there a breakout of how much of the $0.06 is specifically, NHP purchase accounting related, or is that all of it?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's everything, it's -- yes.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just a question on the senior, the operating senior housing on Page 13, it looks like the Sunrise portfolio saw same-store expenses grow on a year-over-year basis, and sequentially such that margins came down despite the occupancy increase. Can you just talk about what types of expense pressures you're seeing in the portfolio?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Right, so I think year-over-year, if you adjust for the $2 million cash payment and equalize the management fees, the margins were actually spot on at 33.8%. Sequentially, they were down 40 basis points, and that relates mostly to utilities and a little bit of hurricane expense in there.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then final question, I guess there was a recent 20% cut in Medicaid payments in the State of California. I know you guys don't have a -- you have some properties there, some [indiscernible], some hospitals, do you expect it to have a significant impact on your portfolio on your coverage in anyway?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We've got 9 nursing homes in California, and there really wasn't a Medicaid cut. Let me just clarify what happened, and that is there was a 10% deferral of Medical payments. So it's a deferral. It's not a reduction in the rate and it's 10%, so we feel fine about it. We have 9 nursing homes there, and the hospitals really aren't Medical. It's not a material portion of the hospital business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Milam with Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Sorry to do this as well. The $0.06, none of that...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Let's talk about the -- $0.82 to $88.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Hopefully, this is quick, but that doesn't include any straight-line rent?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, it does. It's the -- it's basically the non-cash earnings. It's the sum of all of them.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, so sum of that is in there. Okay, great. The next one just on the same-store MOBs, I know that, that portfolio is going to shift the mix over time, but just looking at the same-store NOI, it's been declining for a few quarters now. Can you just talk about the leasing environment and what the rental rates are in that? And when you expect that to move the other direction?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Actually, James, the cash NOI and the same-store MOBs was up slightly year-over-year, and as I mentioned in my remarks. And I think when you look at the trends, the leasing activity is actually pretty good. I mean, our portfolio at 93.5% occupied is certainly above industry averages. We're seeing a great retention rate at 84%, and we're starting to see leasing activity pickup, I think, in our portfolio. So, we think the portfolio is performing pretty well.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. I'm just looking, it looks like it's 12 and 12.3 year-over-year of NOI, but...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Again, same-store NOI cash is up 2.6% kind of year-over-year, and that's what...", "Raymond J. Lewis", "On the total portfolio, including our consolidated and unconsolidated, so you're looking at just the consolidated there, and that also is a different pool of non-stabilized assets in one period to the next. So it's not easy to divine from that -- the growth.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I'm glad you said that, because that's obviously why I'm asking the question, so that makes me feel better. Can you guys just \u2013 on the line of credit, it sounds like there's about $450 million outstanding now, is that right?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we have about $750 million outstanding -- we have $1.8 billion of available liquidity. We have about $750 million outstanding on the line, and we have the term loan as well that has $550 million of availability.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then the debt, the interest rate on the acquisitions, the debt that you assumed, was that around 6% or so or...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The $37.7 million on the $150 million of acquisition?", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Yes.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's in the 6%.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just the last one on the integration cost and expense G&A savings, of the $15 million that you expect to receive or to earn, how much of that have you guys already cut out of the G&A line?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, we're -- a lot of it, but we'll continue to try to make efforts to bring the benefits out of the NHP transaction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Sekino with Barclays Capital.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the development opportunities for the MOBs. With the Lillibridge under your belt for a year, and the $1 billion of the PMB development pipeline, can you kind of tell us, what the hurdles are to ramping that up, given the extra yield that you do get from development?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "There really aren't any hurdles internally to ramping that up. It's really the market activity, which has been accelerating, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. I mean, Lillibridge has its development capabilities and PMB has internal development capabilities, which are scalable from their current level. So we feel pretty good that we're going to be well-positioned to field the opportunities as they accelerate.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So just a function of more of a pull business and seeing the opportunities in the market accelerate is what you'll see -- is what will get you to up your development?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, and we've been seeing an increase in the number of RFPs that are coming across our desk, I mean, request for proposals, that have been coming across our desk. And so if that trend continues, hopefully, we'll see continued growth in our development pipeline.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "You've talked about the 25% mitigation number for Medicare reimbursements a couple of times now. And I was just curious about how you came up with that number. What kind of confidence you have in that estimate, and whether you think that would be different for the Kindred portfolio versus some of the legacy NHP assets?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, it's a very high-level analysis. I think that you can see from the public operators what their comments are. I think many of them have stated they expect 50, 5-0 percent, mitigation. But we're taking, I think, a measured approach in terms of what we think the operators can do in overhead costs and technology improvements, for example. What I think about the difference between the public operators \u2013 and I won't speak for anyone of them, they speak for themselves, versus though the smaller local and regional operators is that the negative impacts on the larger national operators of the cuts will be on the higher end because they have therapy businesses. They were really getting the benefit of the full RUG-IV improvement, and so the impact on them will be greater, and they'll have a greater mitigation sort of necessity, if you will. On the local and regional operators, it's a bit of a different story. They did not get as much of a benefit from the Medicare RUG-IV. They don't, by and large, have the therapy ", "businesses. So the reduction in rate to them will be at the lower end, and they'll have less mitigation effectively to do. So it's a little bit of a different story for both of those kinds of portfolios. It's again, depending on your business model, your quality mix, et cetera.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Fuller with UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Its Ross Nussbaum here with Derek. First question, do you have any acquisitions in your fourth quarter guidance?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No, no.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Second question and I'm going to continue to beat the dead horse, could I make a huge suggestion? Could you guys post a schedule to your website that breaks out that non-cash $0.06 adjustment in terms of what was -- what's in there from a gross basis on a gross-dollar basis as well as a per-share basis? Because I think...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, I mean, it's in the cash flow statement, and that's already posted. There's only one wrinkle, so I mean, I can just tell you right now, it's 4 lines and then 900,000 on another line, but we'll -- yes, we'll be happy to point you there or post some things...", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, that's where I wanted to go because I've spent a lot of the time on the call sort of trying to go through those numbers, and I'm coming up with $5.5 million of straight line rent, $10 million of FAS 141, $9.5 million of debt amo. So I think that's part of the issue is everybody is sort of struggling to get those numbers from the cash flow statement to understand exactly what they are?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay. So just everyone, just so you don't struggle, it's amortization of deferred revenue and lease intangibles, other noncash amortization, stock-based comp, straight lining of rental income net, and then 900,000 of below-market ground lease, which is in the other line, so -- and that line is 1315. So, again, it's intended to be transparent. It's right there on the GAAP statement other than the ground rent and\u2026", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And the change in value of financial instruments? Is that one of the adjustments?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's not because that's not in normalized FFO.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay because I think the other struggle that some of us are having here is your definition of normalized FFO is perhaps gone one step beyond what other REITs typically do with the exclusion of some of these items. So I think that's part of a struggle as well. I'm trying to understand how you're defining it versus how we typically define it.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, I think, for example, we've excluded some normalized FFO, the proceeds of the litigation award et cetera, again, because we've had $11 billion in transactions, we've excluded deal costs, et cetera. So I can understand that we need to spend some more time walking everyone through it. But again, the purpose of just putting everything in a bucket there for you was to make it easier and I can see that we need to do -- we need to spend some more time with people just to further clarify. I think the bottom line again is $0.88 versus $0.73 is fantastic. Many companies would have all of that in their normalized FFO. Take it all out, if you like, it's $0.82. It's over 12% growth, and we're extremely happy with our performance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Couple of quick questions. The same-store numbers for the Atria and Sunrise portfolio, Page 13 of the supplemental, I'm just trying to figure out same-store NOI growth, that actually occurred in each of these portfolios on a year-over-year basis, if you could help me with that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right, well, since we didn't own the Atria portfolio last year, obviously, we don't include it in our same-store. And so that's why you can't see it on Page 11, but or on 13. I would say that Ray talked about Atria, as we have from the beginning, being in high single digits year-over-year NOI growth and right in line with our expectations, and then you have Sunrise there.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "If I just look at the Sunrise piece, I'd back out the 2 million from 3Q '10. Am I really looking at the 7.5% type growth?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well, there's a -- you have to normalize the management fee, which will go in the other direction and it's really more like 5.6%.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Is that helpful?", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes. That's helpful. And then, second question, the Page 5 of the disclosures and the lease rollovers, I understand the situation. Just kind of looking at 2013, where you have a decent amount of rollover, we've talked a little bit about the Kindred piece, could you talk a little bit about the hospital piece and what's going on there?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, that's what I referred to when we talked about the 2013 Kindred rents, which in total, is about 9% of our NOI. And of that, about 40% is the hospitals and 60% is the nursing homes, so that's -- okay?", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, helpful. And then going -- I'm not going to go  into the whole normalized FFO. That's definitely an offline conversation. But on the MOB side, just going back to Mr. Milam's question of what is trends there in regards to just mark-to-market? Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in regards -- it sounds like many of your other peers, they're starting to see mark-to-market trends slowdown somewhat, and I'm just kind of curious what you're seeing, and if you're kind of seeing anything in any particular regions and kind of across the portfolio as a general trend in regards to lease rates.", "Todd W. Lillibridge", "Yes, this is Todd. I think, overall, it varies, as you said, market by market. We're seeing in our secondary and tertiary markets, we're able to push rents. Those are markets that anywhere from St. Louis to Indianapolis, Austin, Columbus, Ohio. In the primary markets such as Chicago, Atlanta, we have difficulty in terms of pushing rents. The rest of the market, we find stability. As Ray had mentioned, we are seeing some very strong leasing activity again being driven by, not only the industry consolidation, but the employment of physicians. And we're the recipient, obviously, of the continued trend towards out-patient. So from that standpoint, leasing activity continues to build the momentum up. Keep in mind, the employment rage, we're just starting to see that as a result of a lot of activity in 2010. So we're optimistic about the activity, and we think that, again, translates into increased occupancy, but it is market to market, and I think we're going to continue to see that over time as with varied supply.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up, and it comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So the one thing I want to do is to ask as a follow-up was on the Atria properties, you had these ones that were owned by NHP that I think you're going to move into the RIDEA structure, if I remember. And I was just curious about sort of that process and timing, because it may move the numbers a little bit.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, I mean this is another fun one for you, so buckle your seatbelt. So essentially, the way this worked is those assets went on our balance sheet and were owned and were managed and owned by us on our balance sheet and managed by Atria when we acquired Atria. When we merged with NHP, we eliminated a liability of a couple of hundred million dollars. So it was already on our balance sheet as an owned item. Atria was managing it, and everything sort of got collapsed when we then closed NHP. So it's very straightforward now, but there were various steps along the way.", "Operator", "All right, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the question-and-answer portion for today's event. I'd now like to turn it back over to Ms. Debra Cafaro for closing remarks.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay. Well, I want to -- on behalf of all of my colleagues, I want to thank you again for joining us today. We really appreciate your interest in the company and your support of the company. We'll be happy to spend some more time with you on any of the detailed results, but we're again very pleased with where we are, and we look forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT and take care.

After the speakers' remark you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].", "I will like to now turn the call over to your host for today Mr. T. Richard Riney, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Sir, you may now proceed.", "T. Richard Riney - Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel and Secretary", "Thank you, Katie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement yesterday regarding its results for quarter and year ended December 31st, 2007.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions, and certain other statements to be made during this conference call, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws.

Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in this presentation in it's most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available in the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Miss. Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman, President and CEO of the company.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Rick, Good morning, everyone, I want to welcome all of our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas year-end earnings call.", "2007 was the productive and transformative year for the company. In 2007, Ventas became a larger more reliable enterprise at lower risk and a higher long-term growth profile. We expanded and diversified our business platform and assets. We delivered our sixth consecutive year of double-digit FFO growth. We provided our shareholders with a 12% total return. We maintain a strong balance sheet and significant liquidity. And we positioned the company to future value creation. And I don't need to tell you that we did our best in a very challenging capital markets environment.", "2008 has also started off on two high notes. We recently received our second investment grade ratings from Standard & Poor's. This very important decision by S&P recognized that the improvements we have made to the company and our financial strength and flexibility. It should enhance our access to capital and lower our borrowing costs, both of which are significant competitive advantages, especially in today's environment.", "I'm sure that many of you feel the best part about our upgrade is that you don't have to listen to me talk about it anymore on our earnings call. Secondly, our board recently increased there dividend by 8% providing our shareholders with above average dividend growth coupled with a still conservative payout ratio.", "Over the past five years, we've grown the company to $9 billion in value, while maintaining a focus on delivering long-term consistent outperformance to our stakeholders. In fact, Ventas was the only REIT to be in the top five performers of the RMS for all of the one, three, five and 10 year periods ended 12/31/07.", "And there been a sustainable business, we've been very mindful of risk management. We want to be prudent stewards of your capital. So as we talked about a major focus over the last five years has been a systematic reduction of enterprise risk at Ventas. We have reduced risk through discipline and diversification of our tenant base, our assets classes, and our sources of revenue.", "Through management of the balance sheet in terms of total leverage, the aggregate maturities and presence in multiple debt and equity linked capital market, and through development and infrastructure and internal control. These attributes are often overlooked or even scorned in a property market. But, are more appreciated when the world changes.", "We believe that Ventas should continue to deliver good long-term cash flow growth from our high quality diversified portfolio of healthcare and senior housing assets with the protected down side from highly structured triple-net leased assets, and potential upside from the Sunrise portfolio.", "During the balance of today's call, I want to discuss our excellent 2007 earnings, our portfolio performance, and our outlook for 2008. Then Rick is going to report in detail on our financial results. Following Ricks comments, we will be happy to take your questions.", "First normalized FFO per share was $0.66 for the fourth quarter, and $2.69 for the year, up 10% over 2006. This favorable outcome was driven by internal growth, accretive acquisitions, and strong performance of our operating portfolio of senior housing assets managed by Sunrise.", "On the guidance front, we expect full year 2008 normalized FFO to range between $2.75 and $2.82 per share. Rick will discuss the key assumptions embedded in our guidance. You can be assure that we would spend all our effort this year as we have in past years towards driving earnings in cash flows and improving our ultimate performance.", "Turning to our portfolio review, our triple-net leased asset continued to perform well with excellent coverages and occupancies across the spectrum of independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. We get 55% of our revenue and 79% of our NOI from our strong pooled multi-facility mez [ph] releases. The key take-away here is that operating results in our triple-net portfolio was very stable through Q3 2007.", "Remember that the pooled multi-facility highly structured mez releases we have with credit tenants, are designed to provide good steady contractual cash flow growth to Ventas. We expect to receive our RENO cash flow streams from triple-net leased assets, while occupancies and EBITDARM to our tenant operators may even flow overtime due to changes in the market and/or reimbursement cycle.", "The Sunrise and medical office building assets we owned provide the granular highly diversified revenue streams in our portfolio. Here too the results were positive. First to the 79 Sunrise communities, we own in North America, total community NOI for the fourth quarter was a strong $33.7 million. Our share of annualized NOI for the two full quarters, we have owned the portfolio is between $112 million and $113 million, which is at the high-end of the range we predicted when we acquired the portfolio.", "In the 72 stabilized Sunrise community, fourth quarter total community NOI was $32.6 million ahead of our projections. Importantly, in the stabilized portion of our portfolio revenues were up 2% sequentially from the third quarter and occupancy for the fourth quarter exceeded 93%.", "The average daily rate per resident and the stabilized portfolio is $171, up 2.3% over third quarter. The six new Sunrise Mansion communities, we currently haven't leased up showed good sequential increases in occupancy improving from 61% in the third quarter to 68% in the fourth. This feels high-end new independent living community in Toronto that we acquired in Q4 averaged 23% occupancies during our ownership period and is already home to almost 80 residents.", "The community contains resident capacity of 250 sects and should be cash flow positive from operations in the second half of 2008. The Sunrise lease up portfolio as a whole ADRs holding firm. So the key takeaway here is that these seven communities are filling without great pressure.", "Finally, our MOB portfolio is also performing well. It's growing portion of our business which now exceeds 1 million square feet of mostly on campus product is producing aggregate unlevered yield of about 8%. 150 million of MOB assets be acquired in 2007 other than the two leased up are delivering yields to Ventas between 7% and 7.5%. We remain enthusiastic about the short-term and long-term benefits of owning healthcare and senior housing real estate.", "Our sector provides steady cash flow and cash flow growth as recession resistant, demand is growing inexorably and it's relatively inelastic, the price under control, and private-pay case senior housing in all of its form, is attaining higher consumer acceptance, which should lead to increase market penetrations by our care providers. The V3 sense I believe the fundamentals in our sector are superior to those in other real estate today and while our healthcare and senior housing assets should continue to gain greater institutional acceptance and ownership.", "As we begin 2008, we remain cautious yet optimistic. We believe our portfolio will continue to perform well. And you can expect us to remain financially strong and liquid. To that end earlier this month we raise equity capital to fund debt payoff and free up leverage, and revolver capacity.", "With our strong balance sheet we are well positioned to be opportunistic in 2008. Execute on transactions that are strategic, provide attractive risk adjusted return, and continued to improve our company on your behalf.", "With that I'll turn the call over to Rick for review of our 2007 financial results.", "Richard A. Schweinhart - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Debbie. Fourth quarter 2007 normalized FFO per diluted share was $0.66 compared to $0.67 last year. Full year normalized FFO per share totaled $2.69 per share, up 10% over last year. Fourth quarter normalized FAD per diluted share was $0.60 versus $0.62 last year. The decreases are primarily due to our strategic diversification program specifically the acquisitions of Sunrise Senior Living REIT in April of 2007.", "Normalized FFO totaled $88 million compared to $71 million for the fourth quarter last year. Normalized FFO and earnings are reported after deducting minority interest for the Sunrise assets. Normalized FFO excludes the net benefit of $12 million of non-cash income tax benefits, and merger costs.", "Normalized FFO increased $17 million from last years fourth quarter principally due to acquisitions. Revenues increased $116 million, $11 million of which was rent increases and $107 million due the newly acquired Sunrise REIT properties, resident, rental, and services fees.", "NOI by segment for the fourth quarter was triple-net $118 million versus $112 million in last year's fourth quarter. Sunrise managed $34 million versus zero last year, and medical office was another $3 million versus $1 million last year. Interest expense increased $17 million from the fourth quarter 2006 due to primarily the acquisition borrowing. Our fourth quarter effective rate, interest rate of 6.7% improved from 7.2% in the fourth quarter of 2006 due to our issuance of convertible senior notes in late 2006, and this year's assumption of Sunrise REITs property debt, which came on at attractive rates.", "General, administrative, and professional fees including stock-based compensation for the fourth quarter of 2007 totaled $11.5 million compared to $6.7 million last year, and $9.3 million in the third quarter of this year. The quarter was high due to several unusual items as a percentage of revenue these expenses totaled 4.9% versus 5.7% of revenues last year.", "In 2008, we expect G&A to approximate $36 million to $40 million of that amount $8 million to $10 million would be non -cash stock-based compensation. Weighted average diluted shares grew to 133.7 million in the fourth quarter up from 105.7 million shares in the fourth quarter last year. Sequentially fourth quarter 2007 versus third quarter 2007 normalized FFO per diluted share was flat at $0.66 exceeding our expectations. Sunrise portfolio and MOB asset performed well.", "On February 1st, 2008, we issued 4.5 million share of common stock producing net proceeds to the company of $192 million. These funds are being used to repay revolver borrowings and secured mortgage debt to fund acquisitions and for other corporate purposes.", "Unused revolver capacity currently stands at approximately $610 million. Pro forma our net debt-to-total capitalization is 34%. Our guidance for 2008 is between $2.75 and $2.82 per share. Key assumptions are that Sunrise NOI from our 79 assets ranges from $140 million to $145 million that we use our cash balances to repay mortgage debt and/or for acquisitions, and that G&A ranges from $36 million to $40 million.", "We have not included acquisitions, dispositions, our other capital transactions in our guidance. Remember that for Sunrise operations we expect quarterly NOI fluctuations in the business, and NOI should build certainly throughout the year. In addition, our triple-net leased escalators tick-in at various points throughout the year including the Kindred rent increased that occurs May 1st, 2008.", "All-in-all the company had a great 2007, and we have started off 2008 with a sizable dividend increase, and an important investment grade rating. We look forward to another excellent year in 2008.", "Operator, we will take questions now.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jeffery Doctrow [ph] from Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Well happy Valentine Day all. I just had a couple of things, one sort of an operating assets, and then just acquisition environment. On the operating assets, I wonder if you can just give us a little bit more color, I think Rick gave us sort of your assumptions in terms of overall NOI, but the rate growth is running and much stronger, and we typically been modeling and I just if you can give us any more color in sort of maybe what your assumptions are? How you see that playing now?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes, I think Jerry, if you look at...", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "This is Ray.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "This is Ray, I'm sorry. I think if you look at the guidance that Rick outlined you are talking about sort of 3% to 7% NOI growth on average and you should assume as we did sort of a flat occupancy with 5% to 7% growth in rate and then sort of a constant margin, and you will come up with a range that will get you... get you right there.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "And then... and continued lease up of the other properties as well-", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes, that's true Jerry, although you know obviously the stable portfolio is much larger than the development portfolio and really drives the performance.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. And I guess I mean my sense is that there is potential upside above beyond your guidance just given you know the current rate levels. If those would continued you did be well above what you are talking about?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "From your lips to god ears.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. And then just acquisition environment if you could chat a little bit more about that, I think we've heard kind of mix things Debbie I think you can use that at various times, there is still spread between they didn't ask [ph] you talked about being opportunistic, if we can get a little bit more color, your whether you've got continued interest in MOB platform, whether there is anything else out there potentially strategic in Canada specifically or perhaps in the U.S., so just any color on acquisitions will be helpful?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Sure Jerry I think you know, as far as the MOB front goes, we continue to focus on that as a core to our acquisition strategy, we are seeing plenty of deal flow in that base in fact our pipeline is very strong and fully loaded with good affected MOB opportunities. So we think that that market continues to yield, I think good... good deal flow to us. The market is a little bit of... in a bit of a price discovery period, and we are certainly watching the data point as is everybody else very closely to try to determine, what if any impact is flowing through to you cap rates, and I'll say that the data is inconsistent and in conclusive that we've seen so far. I think as far as opportunities north of the border, our Canadian portfolio performs extremely well. We like the Canadian market we have had meetings with Canadian operators, and we would like to expand our presence there, what if any investment volume comes out of those activities remains to be seen, but it's certainly an area that we have a great interest in growing.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "And how about just to ramp it out maybe just two things, one is just any color on sort of the North America and the other property types? And then if you can just remind us what you've got in terms of the pipeline from Sunrise that you could buy out of development?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Well I'll take the second half of that first I think on the development front just to remind everybody on the call, we have exclusive rights to first off run on all development that Sunrise does in Canada. We also have exclusive rates to first offer for any development within competitive rings around our U.S. facilities. We continue to see a fairly study flow of development opportunities from Sunrise. We are pretty selective in our approach to those one could find, the properties that we think are in the best markets provide us the best yield. And so I think we feel like there will be good opportunities coming out of that and I have already been working on a number of attracted deals.", "As far as other property types in North America goes the senior housing market has been relatively quite, I would say over the last quarter not lot of data points to really point to there at all. I think we've seen some opportunities certainly in the... on the debt side and mez side and the hospital sector is also I think starting to provide more opportunities for us. So I think looking out into 2008, I think we are going to see a lot more opportunistic plays in senior's housing and potentially on the debt side and I do think we will see some more opportunities in the hospital space.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "And then just on that's helpful. On Sunrise any just sense because there have been big volumes development actually may begin since result in startup loses in some cases. So is that two properties, five properties, 10 properties and what's kind of our likely ranges in terms of what you are going to buy or in terms of dollars that you better yet?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know, Jerry why don't we differ that until we actually committed to do anything I mean you know that we don't like to provide guidance about acquisitions of any kind including development.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And so we're actually going to do them, and so if you could just let us refer that answer we would appreciate it.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "All right. Thanks.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "hanks, and good morning everybody.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Rich.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Hi Rich.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Hey, Debbie you mentioned reduced enterprise risk as a key over to your company, would you say that from a development standpoint that despite with by raised comments that maybe you are eying [ph] going to be even more selective about entering into new developments at this stage of the game, which his environment in front of us?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes I mean look I think that we, we have an option, and options are very good for the option holder. We like the Canadian market, and we like Sunrise's development capabilities, but every opportunity will be examined in light of overall macro market conditions and specific property market conditions. And so as things change you change your delta if you will is to how you look at all of our acquisitions including development, and so I think what you said is a fair statement nonetheless if we have good opportunities or good assets and good properties, and good markets at appropriate returns that are risk embedded then we'll, we are absolutely in a great position to execute on those.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Then you're building a nice little liquidity basket I guess, lets say and you mentioned Canadian marketplace are some public Canadian REITs on your... in your cross fairs [ph] or is that...", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Just because you're a Canadian bank you know go ahead, you won't let me take that.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "No Rick I mean look, we've always said that we think that continued industry consolidation in the healthcare REIT makes sense and that is true in the U.S. and in Canada. We are going always agitate for that, we are going to continue to work on things, so you know...", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We've got our special agent Lisa Brush up there in Canada who is with here today, so...", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Exactly and so you know you should just expect that we are going to continue to work every acquisition angle that we have in Canada.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay just a quick one, just on my note here that the 4Q outperformance do I just right it was just Sunrise that better than expected performance and also the MOB portfolio is that right that would guide you $0.02 above your guidance range?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I mean... we... that's a fair summary.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Just a more quick ones any comment on the entry fee model and how that might be impacting the independent living model?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well we it's important to say a couple of things, we don't own any entry fee CCRCs.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We owned five rental CCRCs and those are doing fine, and those are in triple-net leases as is virtually all of our independent living and which again is all rental based and that's all in triple-net leases.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, but do you have any sense of the market if they are seeing any pressures on that?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes I was just about add to Debbie's comment I think at the margins we are seeing a little bit of pressure in the lifestyle drill in, independent living and certainly more so the entry fee CCRC space driven by sort of the, you know the depression in the housing market. I think if you look at the data that next publishing for instance, you're saying maybe 100 basis point reduction occupancy rates there, and so as Debbie points out all of our independent living is in triple-net leases with good strong operators, good coverages at the property level. So we are well positioned to whether whatever marginal down turn has happened in that space.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then lastly what would you say Moody hang up is?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Look we have good dialogue with all the rating agencies, I really want to give a shot out this wine heart here who has worked really tirelessly to build our balance sheet and work with the agencies to get our Q investment grade ratings that, I made a joke, but you all know how long and hard we worked with that rating and I think we will continue with Moody's to demonstrate the strength of our company and the risks, I mean we talked about reducing enterprise risk, I think every year for the last five years because we've always said is we can reduce risk and grow earnings then we win and we are making a better company. So I think its the next step as you point out it to focus on our dialogue with Moody's and continue to talk about how we improved the company and I feel assured that we will get there.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "What does that one step into investment grade save you, do you think on a basis point?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, by the way there is another point I would like to make is that year or two the Lehman high grade index. The investment grade index change, so that if you have two of the three agencies and investment grade you will be in the high grade index. And that's where we are now. So we should substantial benefit from being in that index. The... if you would ask me the question before I would have said... in the normal market I would have said 25 to 50 basis points on incremental borrowings. The... recently I think our bondholders are more little ahead of the agencies and our bond actually were trading quite well, so right now I think they are trading at about near 10 years and about 6.5%, and so if we could execute in or around that at this point in the market, maybe with a little bit a new issue premium, I think that would be excellent.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Rich.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Craig Melcher from Citi. Please proceed.", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "Hi. Could give us a little more color on the medical office portfolio during the quarter, it looks like occupancy came down a bit on the stabilized in the sub portfolio?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I will be happy to that. You know as I said I think our MOB portfolio is actually doing well as you point out on the eight assets that are the same-store stabilized occupancy went from 98% to 95% Q4 06 to Q4 '07, and that's essentially 5,000 to 10,000 square feet in a building in Houston, which we expect to be sort of leased up to normal levels that maybe by the end of the summer. And then on the lease up, last quarter we had one MOB and leased up and it was 50% occupied and now we've two assets and leased up and they are 56% occupied. So I think we made good progress there. So our portfolio is actually doing well and I hope that answers your question.", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "Yes. And on Sunrise I am just trying to give out some more how... how revenues are coming in relative to expectations and expenses, you know, NOI is coming ahead, but it just gets more top line or how the expenses are coming in?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, revenue is going up nicely and expenses are increasing probably a little bit more than we would like, but net-net on balance the NOI was coming in ahead.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes, Craig, I think we have said in the third quarter was that you should expect the fourth quarter to be a little bit softer because typically people aren't moving there parents into the community during the holidays and there is always sort of year end expense through offset that come through and what we actually ended up seeing was pretty strong occupancy throughout the entire fourth quarter and the expenses that true ups that we expected did come through, so you saw a little bit of margin compression during the fourth quarter, but remember you're going to see some seasonal fluctuations in the portfolio, we'll keep tracking it, but I think that's sort of consistent with what we had expected going in and perhaps the little bit better on the revenue side.", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "Okay. And what's the rate of debt maturing that was sort of rated [ph] debt maturing in 08 and the timing of that?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "It's approximately 7% to 7.4% if you in that kind of break down the maturities its broken down like half and then lot more towards the end.", "Craig Melcher - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And next question comes from the line of Rob Mains from Morgan Keegan. Please proceed.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Rob.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Just a follow-up on the question about the Sunrise stabilize. Do I differ then that in terms of seasonality might see a little bit of a margin that been the winter quarters compared to the summer ones?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I mean I think seasonally you had tended to see softness in Q1 for the operators.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Great.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And as Rick said in his remarks I mean when you look at 08, you would expect the NOI to sort of ramp through the year.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Right. Well Ray's comments would suggested is that either you get lesser ramp up maybe even a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter as well because of the moving?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "What we looked at historically, when we looked at from the Sunrise results for this particular portfolio what that, we saw some softness in Q4 and Q1, and those are who knows why I mean it could be year-end normal expense throughout, could be a little softness in occupancy and so on. Now what we did see in the fourth quarter was strong occupancy and strong rate growth, so that's why the portfolio really perform better than our fourth quarter expectations. But, you are right to say in Q1 I think most of that analyst and operators who would agree tends to be this soft this seasonally... seasonal quarter.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Great, Okay. Then my only other question Rick, you alluded to one-time items affecting G&A in the quarter. What were some of those please?", "Richard A. Schweinhart - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We went through and obviously just had to do some of our year-end true- up with compensation and some professional fees, deal cost so, it was kind of one-time in nature and unusual. So we figured that if we end up [ph] kind of tell you what the go forward rate risk, that would be a net go forward.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Right okay, fair enough that's all I needed, thanks.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Rob.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc. Please proceed.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Good morning, not to beat the expense question to debt, but I know you said in your 08 guidance, you're expecting margins to be flat. We've heard on another call that Sunrise Senior living may not be doing as good a job as some may think they should with expenses. Do you think potential upside if margins could be improved next year?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you must be going to the school as Jerry there. We're giving you our best shot to what we think the Sunrise portfolio NOI is going to be for next year at 142 to 145 total sort of NOI. And we think that those are attainable objectives, which are 3% to 7% NOI growth also of the second half run rate. So I mean that's a good growth rate and it make... there's multiple different rates that you can get there rate occupancy expense, but that's sort of where we're targeting and that's why I would encourage you to focus as well because we don't want to get to on the one hand we will all say well there's a housing thing and then on the other hand we're saying well there's lot of upside in these numbers. So we've really tried to give you our best projection of where we think these assets would stand in 2008.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. I know it's early in the election process, but can you just give your outlook on what the regulatory environment could be doing in an election year?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes I mean the short answer is nothing.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We expect to... we had some really good legislative and regulatory occurrences for the Kindred SNFs and LTACs that... came up in the fourth quarter and first quarter namely a three plus percent Medicare increase for the SNFs and then good legislative improvement that Kindred was lobbying for regarding the LTAC, and then about 3% proposed increase from CMS for the freestanding LTACs in terms of rate. So we are in a good spot here, and I think it's very difficult to get anything done in an election year. And so I think we have a good visibility on reimbursement looking forward.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great thanks. Finally you had a nice milestone a nice ruling in the HCP litigation in December, can you just tell us what the next milestone would be and what the timing is in that process?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I think what Karin is pointing out is that we did prevail in an motion that HCP filed to dismiss our case which is pending in the Federal District Court in Kentucky. The next is not really a milestone, but the next process or phase of the litigation, which were involved in right now is the discovery phase where you sort of examine the fact on each side in separations for the actual trial, that's where we are now.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dustin Pizzo from Banc from America.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Hi, Thank you. Good morning.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Dustin.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Hi, Dustin.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Debbie, I just want to follow-up on Richard's earlier question on the balance sheet. I mean it seems as though there was really pressing need for the money from the recent equity raise. So should we further that there is something larger potentially coming down the pipe or is it more of an indication kind of us to review on the current state of capital markets and that you think things may get worst from here and you wanted to just be in a good position?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well as we said, and as everyone on the call knows what the capital markets have been extremely volatile. And as we look into 2008 I really think that we are... we want to be mindful of that and we want to be strong and opportunistic. And in this environment we believe that it's much better to be liquid and strong, and we are working on a number of things that are very attractive, and we want to be in a position to execute without worrying that this week some... some bank is going to take another $20 billion worth of write-offs and everybody is going to sell the RMS or something. So I love where our position is, as we look into the year, and it's a very deliberate... it's a very deliberate outlook, as we do an upside, downside analysis but we say SG for cautious and we are wrong, we haven't really given up very much maybe a little bit of hold money on the balance sheet. But, if we are right we are going to be really glad that we were right, and the benefits of that for exceed the other side of the equation. So I hope that gives you a little bit of color on our thinking.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Yes, definitely. And then I guess given your strong balancing position and ability to be provide our capital on the current environment. Would you look to potential get involved in any mezzanine situations and specifically the one that comes to mind given your relationship is potentially Sunrise whether that will go private?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yeah, I think on the mez front that something that we've said now for the last quarter. We would be interested in making investments in that category, I think as we look at that, we really want to find the right risk adjusted returns. We want to make sure that we're doing it in manageable chunks and spreading our exposure across a number of different investments. So I think that would be sort of our strategy there with regard to specific situations, we will deal with those as when they come up.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just lastly you may or may not be able to answer this but, Debbie what's you've taken and what's happening internally on Sunrise I mean if you had any indications to whether or not they may get their financials out on time since one of your other peers think that's a very solid possibility?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as you know Sunrise is said that it expects to file in financial statements filed by March 17, 2008 deadline that it has. we do get very detail property level financial information from Sunrise, and so we feel good about that. We really think that Rick Schweinhart [ph] the new CFO there has been an excellent addition to the company, and we've confidence in him to file the statement, and so if we were to predict we would hope that Sunrise does in fact file the statements by March 17th and I think there's a very good chance that they will, and that would be very positive for them as the company, a big milestone for them.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pike from Merrill Lynch Please proceed..", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning, everybody.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Hi, Chris.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Back to the whole debt leverage issue, I guess you know looking at the net debt of pro forma EBITDA at 5.4 that does not take into consideration the equity offering, correct?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It does then. Its still...", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "So, you bring that... so you take out 192 million that brings you down for lets say 5.1, is that a comfort level for you guys. Would you look to perhaps like to be a little lower than that? What do you draw from that?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we don't want to be... look we want to be... we think that historically, the healthcare REIT to investment grades have been in the 5 to you know 5.5, 6 times leverage level, and we are comfortable with that, and I think we've got... as you say we've got liquidity and capacity, and we could acquire quite a bit now throughout the balance of the year, just as we are.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.With respect to the equity raise, was there anything that may be stopped you from issuing a bit more equity maybe advised that too much equity would be hard to digest, what your talks on that?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think on a lot of these issues at the margin you could go either way whether it's a dividend increase, whether it's a... how much debt or equity if you have raised at any given time. I mean we just... it's a, we think the amount we have raised is just about right to deal with our medium term expectations, and again puts us in a good position. So you could go either way on that, but we think it's just about right, it sort of Goldilocks outcome.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "And then are there any secured debt opportunities baked into the portfolio at this point in other words adding more secured debt extracting or monetizing some value equity?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I mean we've got capacity in terms of unlevered and partially levered portfolio to be either top up or put mortgages on them. We don't have any current plans to do so but that capacity absolutely exists.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "And how much capacity, how much dry powder do you think would exists if were to start to tap into that that area?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know several $100 million.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's all for now. Maybe we can just catch up little later. Thanks.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, Chris, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Lehman Brothers.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, great. Thanks. Good morning.", "Hi Kevin.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Lehman Brothers", "You talked about you know stronger occupancy in Q4 to Sunrise assets than you thoughts on the impact of the weak flu season there. Does that contribute or do you believe its just more function of your portfolio that was being living non-entry fee just I am look more insulated from the housing market?", "Lisa M. Brush - Senior Vice President, Senior Housing Development and Operations", "Hi, Kevin, this is Lisa Brush. No, sometimes the flu can give us problem through the winter month, we haven't seen anything like that throughout the portfolio. So actually I mean the occupancy held really strong and you know compared to Q3, we expected a little bit more of a deep and a rate growth continued to grow. So we are not seeing that I mean its that it couldn't happen in Q1. We could feel little bit more of deep due to flu or just poor weather in certain areas, people may not want to move it, if they have that choice. Of course in most of our Mansions we have a much higher acuity [ph] and people often regardless will be moving in. So that certainly helps our occupancies very strong and pretty stable.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, great. Can you tell a little bit more about the CapEx in the quarter I'm used to senior living operators talk about CapEx of kind of 500, 600 per unit annually which would be affectionately your current run rate as even if you see things ramp up and we'll be spending, alright, I got two questions what's driving in the quarter is Q4 good run rate its into the guidance might be assuming it comes down a little bit?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well on the senior housing assets when we acquired Sunrise given the really high-end nature of these assets we told everyone that we expect between 800 and 1000 per door in annual CapEx and that's what we are looking forward to in 2008.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. So the run rate that you have now is kind of more like 12,000 that would be something closer to 5,6 [ph] 12 million is that because our 5 million to 6 million if it did into 1 million is 1,000 is the rest just MOB or does that number come down a little bit from where your run rate is?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think if you look forward if you just put in 1000 a door on Sunrise that should be about right.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, and how much MOB CapEx would there be?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well on a recurring basis its really going vary, depending on lease roll over and so on. So may be I don't know $0.56, $0.60 a year.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, great that's helpful. And then last question on MOBs can you talk about the MOB market a little bit more it seems that virtually every operator is looking to build that platform out there even some non-healthcare REITs getting involved in the space do you get worry about development in that space over the next few years or what do you think about actual capacity growth?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes I think there are two things going out on that question one, there's definitely a lot of institutional demand for medical office buildings, I think other investors as does Ventas look at the space as a very stable investment opportunity. We have very high retention rate, we've got good stable growing cash flows, its the front edge of where the baby boom demographic is going to touch the healthcare system. They will be receiving care and a medical office building before they all need care in a assisted living facility our a nursing home for instance. So all of that and its also relatively recessionary system, which in this environment is particularly attractive institutional investor. So all of that I think is coming together to create good demand for the product on the development front there are natural barriers to entry for medical office building development and that is really driven by the amount of land available around the campuses of the hospitals themselves, as well as the hospitals sort of dictating what development takes place I mean they don't want to have half empty or empty medical office building sitting on their campuses. So we are not seeing a tremendous amount of development in that space. And what we are seeing is being driven by the hospital pursue into pretty well thought out in rational capital plans.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I just want to add one thing which is as Ray mentioned previously there's a really quiet bit of supply, and so while there is a lot of demand I would say that's really being matched by the supply of assets for sale. Hello?", "T. Richard Riney - Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel and Secretary", "Hello, lost connection...", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "My god, you'll be killing me.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Kristin Brown [ph]. Ma'am you may proceed.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Katie? Katie?", "Operator", "Yes.", "T. Richard Riney - Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel and Secretary", "Can you hear us?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Can you hear me?", "Operator", "Yes, I can hear you, I can hear you nice and clear.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, we had a bit of a interruption on our end. So can you just I assume the investors and participants in the call are still connected?", "Operator", "Everyone is still connected, ma'am.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. We'll go ahead then, thanks.", "Operator", "Okay. Kristin Brown.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, Good morning. I just wanted a follow-up on that question on MOB supply on sort of the senior housing side, I mean you kind of mention that supply generally in check on. What you characterize as sort of uniform across markets or the original pockets are concerned?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Just to clarify Kristin are you talking about senior housing supply and new development.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Okay. Yes I would say that in general the senior's housing supply remains in check. We've been tracking the net off shore [ph] construction data pretty closely and I think if you look at the number of new units that are projected to be delivered and construction starts. They are sort of well within historical penetration levels given the increase in the aged incomes qualified population that's expected over the next year or two. So on a macro level we look at it and say that the supply that the new supply that's coming out and appears to be very reasonable although at a higher level then it had been in the early 2000 when it essentially nothing was getting built. Market-by-market I think the high barrier entry markets say for instance where our Sunrise portfolio is located. We think we are probably not going to see very much of anything developed that will compete with our products there given the long lead-time and the high cost to development. In some of the secondary markets or Sunbelt states you may see more product delivered in those markets, but again I still think in general, we are not seeing any place that I could point to you where we would be concerned about over building at this point.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes I mean the other really its a good and bad things, but clearly from the financing side what banks for financing construction two years ago, one year ago and then product will be delivered and as a result to that. In limited amount as Ray indicated I would tell you that as a forward, if you look forward that the banks are definitely pulling in or not and that actually is a very good, that is a very good thing, because it will limit supply appropriately and I expect that to be very positive for this day.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "And my colleague to the right Lisa Brush is holding up her red and white flag with a maple leaf on it indicating that and it's very true Canada is a market we think that is pretty well under supply not a tremendous amount of development going on there and really strong occupancy in performance statistic. So we think there is a some good opportunity there.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, that's really helpful. And I just have one more question just in terms of acquisition have you made any adjustments to your underwriting or hurdle rates in the current environment?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well every time that we look at acquisitions our methodology is really to make sure that: a) we're getting good risk adjusted return; and b) that it is, it exceed what we believe is a reasonable cost to capital and provides good returns on equity. So methodology is always the same, there maybe we may impute a little bit higher risk premium to assets in this environment, obviously we look at cost to debt as those metrics change overtime. So all of those factors are embedded in our sort of ever evolving underwriting regarding acquisitions.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Thanks, Kristin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan from Green Street Advisors. Sir you may proceed.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Thanks good morning", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jim.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Hi, Jim.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Ray when you are talking about cap rates may become and the cap rate data is inconsistent and inclusive, in a context you're talking about mez debt it seems like the pricing of mez debt is perhaps even more inconsistent, and more inclusive how do your price mez debt in the current environment and how do you determine whether the risk adjusted return is better than what you can get in more traditional equity investment?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes I think that is the trick Jim, it's... what you really want to make sure you're focused on our loan-to-values and loan-to-sustainable values. So you really sort of look at what you think historical levels should be for a particular asset class and make sure that as you look forward you have an exit scenario in pretty much any normal lending environment and if you can get yourself comfortable that you're in the type of investment, then I think that sort of threshold or getting decision, and then once you past that is really a matter of looking how far up or down stack you are and trying to draw relative comparisons from other transactions that you've seen clear the market and say okay in my more or less, risky and am I getting a better or worst return. But, it is a shifting target, you kind of have to think ahead a little bit and test the market. Clearly this is not a market in which you just want to take what comes to you. You want to be selective. Did that help?", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Yes that's helpful. It sounds like you are willing to move up and down the capital stack depending on the parameters of the specific opportunity?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes we are and off course it also depends on the asset type where you want to be in the capital stack.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes, right.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And when you give loan-to-values obviously, you would generally impose sort of normalized valuation levels and you look at cash flow coverages which I think is really important element of determining your comfort level with a given investment at a given traunch on a capital structure and Ray is obviously an lender and we look... we've originated and we've purchased NASDAQ in the past, and so I feel very interested in doing that again a manageable size as we look at 08.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Look Jim here the deal is when you're making an investment like this is you want to get paid back. Okay, the first and foremost thing is getting your money back. You look at it as if you going to hold it all the way through maturity, and so you have to underwrite what your exit is going to be either on the basis of what you think the loan-to-value is going to be at that point time and what you think that dynamism built into the cash flow is. So ECS situation where cash flow has some pretty dramatic upside potential and you may be more willing to step a little further up the capital stat going into the transaction, if you are a firm belief that cash flow is going to be realized overtime. It's a judgment call, but at the end of the day you got to look at as if you are going to hold this to maturity and...", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And there is a refinancing...", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Andthere is a refinancing that's going to take you out. And if you can't get comfortable if that's the case then its not a deal you should be doing.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "That's helpful. I will be interested in seeing what turns out. Switching to Sunrise, to the sense of Sunrise's ownership structure changes, what's the impact on your management contracts on their minority position in some of your assets, the rights are first, offer that you mention before. What happens, do you have any approval rights that will provide you some leverage into even better deal for yourself or is really a risk if... the ownership structure changes and they for example wanted to sell their real estate interest to somebody you would want them sell it to?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We can answer that. First all the contractual rights and obligations that we have relative to the Sunrise portfolio including right to first offer and so on will remain in place regardless of the ownership structure Sunrise regardless of whether it's public or private. In terms of being partners with them as you would expect, if those partnership interest where sold or in some cases financed we would have consent right there, with that but we do not have and more could a public company give you sort of a change of control right over the top level at Sunrise. So that's where we stand and whether that ultimately creates opportunities there for us, we will be yet to be seen and we were really focused on having them other financial statements and really you know be in good standing and I think that's going to be a big step forward if they can accomplish that.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Okay. And then my last question relates to the earlier CapEx question, it does seem like the CapEx during the second half of the year was striking well above the guidelines you've provided, was there differed maintenance in the portfolio that required you to put additional money in?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No I think as you might imagine in operating assets, people they will only spend their budget in the first of the year and remember we were and so you might see some non-quarterly spending over the course of the year, but we definitely standpoint what we say which is about a 1,000 in 100 to 1,000 a door for the Sunrise stock.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome. Thanks for listening.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow from Stifel, Nicolaus. Sir you may proceed.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "I just had a quick follow-up, could you give us the actual occupancy on the stabilize Sunrise stuff to the 93 and 93, you said at one point it was actually north of 93. I am just trying to get a sense of the more specifically at the occupancy?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It was 93.1.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "And what was the prior quarter?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "93.3.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay, so it did move down a little bit. Okay there is tenth of percents matter so. All right thanks I just wanted to check", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Wait everything matters. I agree, I agree, okay. So operator is there any other questions?", "Operator", "Yes ma'am, you have a final question from the line of Chris Pike from Merrill Lynch.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, Debbie. With respect to your comments regarding resilience in your senior housing, which you would obviously share and perhaps this question is better suited for law be interested in the room there and if I have chance to ask her, but based on your collective experiences is there been a time were you know significant economic shock as kind of entity armors [ph] you will with respect to absorption across the Alphorns [ph] sector.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Chris this is Debby. Look there is no sector, no business that is immune form large macro trend. And we don't suggest that our sector is but when I look across the real estate state and look I at fundamental. Over a medium term horizon here there would be no sector that I feel better about its owning and investing in, in the healthcare and senior housing space I think it is important and that's why we've given sort of guidance that we have, I think it's important to be realistic that this is going to even flow overtime and we acquired the portfolio, but we see good about the fundamentals we think that demand is going to continue to grow, and market penetration is going to continue to increase and that the combination of our long-term triple-net leases which are provides great cash flow growth with real solid sort, we are going to get those cash flows coupled with its higher potential growth on the Sunrise assets. Its going to provide a really excellent SOX platform for our investors going forward.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So if we don't have any additional questions. I want to thank the rest of my partners here at Ventas, and I want to thank our investors and participants in the call. We really appreciate your interest and support to the company, and look forward to speaking to you all again soon. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. And you may now disconnect.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Katie.", "Operator", "You are welcome have a great day.", "Debra A.

My name is Heather and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. T. Richard Riney, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Ventas. Please proceed, sir.", "T. Richard Riney - Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel and Secretary", "Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement yesterday regarding its results for the quarter-ended March 31, 2008.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions, and certain other statements to be made during this conference call, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These projections, predictions and statements are based on management's current beliefs, as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events.", "The forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, certainties and contingencies and stockholders and others should recognize that actual results may differ materially from the company's expectations, whether expressed or implied. We refer you to the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2007, and the company's other reports filed periodically with the SEC for a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and other factors that could affect these forward-looking statements. Many of these factors are beyond the control of the company and its management.", "The information being provided today is as of this date only and Ventas expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations. Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman, President and CEO of the company.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Rick and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants and welcome to our first quarter 2008 earnings call. We are very pleased with our first quarter results and the strong condition of our company. Overall, our normalized FFO per share of $0.68 for the quarter is slightly ahead of where we expected to be. Our Sunrise portfolio NOI is in line with our projection.", "Our liquidity position and balance sheet at 34% debt-to-enterprise value are exceptional, and our deal pipeline is very active, with strategic and accretive opportunities. When we spoke to you in February about our outlook for 2008, I said that we were cautiously optimistic about the year. Now, I would say that we are optimistically cautious. This improvement in our outlook is based upon the opening of the debt market, albeit at widespread, and the sense that some buyers and sellers are narrowing the bid/ask gap that has postponed transition activity so far this year.", "Today, we will discuss our earnings portfolio performance and expectations for the balance of the year. After our CFO Rick Schweinhart reports in our financial results, we will be happy to take your questions.", "First, normalized FFO per share grew 3% versus Q4 of 2007 at $0.68 this quarter. As I mentioned, this result was slightly ahead of our expectations. We have also today reaffirmed our 2008 guidance of between $2.75 and $2.82 per share. As we always have, we intend to dedicate our efforts for the rest of 2008 to driving earnings and cash flows for the benefit of our shareholders, while we continue to build an excellent high performing enterprise.", "In the second half of 2007 and the first quarter of this year, we built liquidity and financial strength by expanding our revolving credit facility to $850 million and by raising almost $200 million in equity. And recently, we sold $68 million in healthcare assets, generating a $24 million gain. All of these actions put us in a great position to ride out the problems in the credit market to get a head start on upcoming debt maturity and to invest opportunistically.", "Turning to our portfolio review, our triple-net lease assets continue to perform well, with stable occupancies and solid cash flow to rent coverages across the spectrum of independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals through December 31, 2007. A key takeaway here is that our triple-net tenants continue to perform well. In fact, Kindred just yesterday reported an excellent first quarter, which should strengthen our healthcare asset triple-net lease metric when we report next quarter.", "It is important to remember that these triple-net lease investments are designed to provide our shareholders with good, steady, predictable cash flow growth, as well as significant cash flow coverage, credit and security. We expect to see changes in occupancies and operator cash flows at properties and to receive our rents irrespective of ebbs and flows in asset level occupancies and EBITDARM experienced by our tenant operators from economic or reimbursement changes.", "Touching quickly on Medicare reimbursement, the headline here is that we have good visibility into Medicare rate for skilled nursing facilities and long-term acute care hospitals through the fourth quarter of 2009.", "On the SNF side, SNFs will receive a 3.1% \"market basket\" increase offset by a 3.3% decrease due to administrative changes in their Medicare rate effective October 1, 2008. This would result in essentially flat year-over-year Medicare reimbursement for SNF, if adopted, as proposed. These rules are subject to a 60-day comment period and maybe improved as a result of industry efforts.", "At Ventas, we have been projecting a zero percent increase in SNFs Medicare rate and the corresponding compressions in operator EBITDARM. So, as the landlord at the top of the capital structure, we are quite comfortable with the CMS proposal and are pleased with the forward certainty it provides.", "For the LTAC, net Medicare rates were increased about 2.5% for the 15 months period, beginning July 1, 2008 and ending September 30, 2009. We expect the LTAC to be in a period of improved reimbursement tone for several forward reimbursement cycles.", "As I have stated countless times, Ventas shareholders benefit enormously from the strength of our pooled multi-facility master leases with Kindred. We have a built-in structural hedge in our master leases, because they contain both SNFs and LTACs which are on different Medicare reimbursement cycles. The important point is that the ups and downs in SNF and LTAC cash flows and reimbursement rates have balanced each other over time. The combination of these two different asset types, coupled with their strong cash flow coverage and Kindred credit support, provide incredibly reliable future revenue stream to Ventas.", "Now I want to turn to our operating portfolio, our 79 Sunrise communities and our medical office building portfolio provide the granular, highly diversified revenue streams in our business. First, Sunrise, for the 79 high-end, private-pay communities we own in North America, total community NOI for the quarter was $33.4 million. This is a definite win, flat versus the fourth quarter despite the typical softness we expected from first quarter results, as well as the anticipated lease-up losses been incurred as we fill the new 229 unit Steeles, independent living community we acquired in mid-December 2007.", "In the 73 stabilized Sunrise communities, first quarter total community NOI was $32.7 million. Note that in this quarter, we reclassified one asset to the stabilized pool from lease-up. Average daily rate was up 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter and occupancy in the pool was 92%. Expenses in the quarter were relatively controlled, and when coupled with rate increases, accounted for the positive NOI result. We also have fixed new Sunrise Mansion communities in lease-up including Steeles.", "Importantly, the five lease-up communities we owned for the full fourth quarter of 2007, showed excellent first quarter 2008 results. Occupancy increased by 6 percentage point sequentially improving to 72%, and NOI for these five communities rose from $600,000 to $1 million sequentially, a 57% increase.", "Our new Steeles asset continues to lease up nicely and currently is 43% occupied. We expect Steeles to reach positive NOI from operations toward the end of this year. Our 14 stabilized medical office buildings mostly on campus delivered $3 million in NOI during Q1 2008, which is consistent with our Q4 2007 result.", "Within this pool of 14 assets, we own one building that we're actively repositioning in its market and it accounts for virtually all of the incremental MOB vacancy you see this quarter. In the aggregate, these 14 MOBs are producing unlevered yield to Ventas of over 7.5%.", "Looking forward, I have to say that I am as excited as I have ever been about the multiple prospects we have in front of us and about the Ventas team we have in place to convert those prospects into reality.", "The opportunities we see are varied and have potential to provide additional dimension, diversification, growth and accretion to our company. We now have the financial capacity scale and organizational experience to execute on transactions and initiatives we believe presents strategic advantages and superior risk adjusted returns. We believe that one or more of these opportunities will come to fruition before year-end and we are eager to update you on additional developments, as they occur.", "All in all, we're very happy with where we are at this point in the year, we are confident we can move our business forward in a difficult economic and capital markets environment and we are excited about the opportunities we have to continue building long-term value for our shareholders.", "With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Rick for review of our financial results.", "Richard A. Schweinhart - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Debbie. First quarter 2008 normalized FFO per diluted share was $0.68, compared to $0.68 in last year's first quarter and $0.66 in the fourth quarter of 2007. First quarter results were better than the fourth quarter, mainly due to less interest expense, lower G&A and flat triple-net lease revenue and operating portfolio NOI, offset slightly by increased share count due to our February equity raise.", "First quarter FAD per diluted share was $0.64, compared to $0.64 in last year's first quarter and $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living REIT occurred in April of 2007.", "Normalized FFO this quarter totaled $92.4 million, compared to $72.1 million in the first quarter of last year and $87.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Normalized FFO and earnings are reported after deducting minority interest for the Sunrise assets. Normalized FFO for the first and the fourth quarter excludes the net benefit of $10 million and $13 million respectively of income tax benefits and merger-related items.", "Normalized FFO increased $20 million from last year's first quarter, principally due to acquisitions. Revenues increased to $114 million, versus the comparable period a year ago. Of that, $6 million was due to rent increases and $108 million to the Sunrise REIT properties resident rental and service fees.", "Interest expense increased $14 million from the first quarter of 2007, due primarily to acquisition borrowings. Interest expense decreased $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2007, due to repayment of debt from a portion of the proceeds of our equity offering. On February 1, 2008 we issued 4.5 million shares of common stock, producing net proceeds to the company of a $192 million.", "Our first quarter effective interest rate of 6.6%, improved from 7% in the first quarter of 2007, due to last year's assumption of Sunrise REIT property debt, which came on at attractive rates. The rates also slightly -- improved slightly from the fourth quarter rate of 6.7% due to the decrease in LIBOR on variable rate loans.", "General, administrative and professional fees, including stock-based compensation, for the first quarter of 2008, totaled of $8.3 million, compared to $7.6 million last year and $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses improved to 3.6% from 6.5% of revenues last year and 5% in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Weighted average diluted shares grew to 136.7 million in the first quarter, up from 133.7 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting the effect of our February 1st equity issuance. On April 18th, the company sold seven facilities for approximately $68 million and we expect to report a gain of $24 million in the second quarter.", "We currently have a $124 million of cash and marketable securities and unused revolver capacity of $785 million. Our debt-to-total capitalization is 34% at quarter-end. Our guidance for 2008 remains between $2.75 and $2.82 per share. Our key assumptions remain the same that total Sunrise NOI from our 79 assets ranges from a $140 million to $145 million that we use our cash balances to repay mortgage debt and/or for acquisitions and the G&A ranges from $36 million to $40 million. It does not include other announced acquisitions or divestiture activity.", "In sum, our first quarter results show good improvements sequentially and should continue to ramp up during the balance of 2008.", "Operator, we will now take questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning. A question for you on the $68 million of assets sale. It looks like given the NOI number that was about a 10.5% cap rate on that sale. Can you just talk about, that cap rate seemed a little high, why was at that level and where you see cap rates trending from here?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think, good morning, Karin, and thanks for joining.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thanks.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "The sale of those assets was tremendously good outcome for Ventas. Basically, it was a strategic disposition that we thought was an excellent opportunity to recycle capital, realize the very significant gain, and frankly, dispose of asset that had been under managed. And so, we feel that the outcome and the price for that that we received were quite good and appropriate.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. And where are you seeing cap rates moving, you mentioned that buyer and seller, the bid/ask spread was narrowing, can you just talk about where you see cap rates moving?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yeah, I think, Karin, this is Ray. That's our general sense, although market data right now remains relatively spotty. Most of the market data indicates that rates are generally holding. And so even though the risk premium is widening on cap rates, that is being mostly offset by the drop in the base rate. I think what we're seeing with regard to pricing is the bigger change in the way that buyers are underwriting the cash flow. And specifically, they are really looking at in place income and generally not giving credit to future lease-up or rent bumps, and that I think is probably the bigger impact in the way that yields are being priced and valued in the market today. So, it's kind of hard to peg a cap rate trend, but the underwriting is definitely more conservative.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Helpful. It sounded like in your comments about the Steeles, positive cash flow mark pushed a little bit later in the year, is that the case, and if so, what's driving that?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I mean, we think Steeles is generally on track, we haven't materially changed our expectations for that asset. I may have changed the word a little bit to keep myself from being bored, but I don't think there was any -- you shouldn't read anything more into it than that.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Final question, the joint venture -- the medical office development joint venture, can you just talk about what the economics are on that?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yeah, I mean, basically, Karin, we've got a joint venture in place, with a nationally recognized MOB to developer, with excellent hospital relations and the great reputation on 10 to be built medical office buildings that will accumulated somewhere in the neighborhood of about $150 million in total. The buildings are generally on campus and hospital sponsored. We got the opportunity to basically invest in these assets at sort of wholesale pricing and share the upside in value creation between development cost and retail with the developer.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And do you guys actually fund the development or you take out on stabilization?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "We'll be funding the development subject to minimum pre-leasing standards upfront.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. And what's the time frame for these 10 buildings?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes, they will be coming in over the next 12 to 18 months.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan. Please proceed.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Good morning.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Rob.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "One follow-up on the MOB quarter there, are anything in progress currently, any of the projects?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "The developer has been awarded these projects by the hospitals and they are in various states of planning and development. We have not made any investment at this point.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "And it doesn't sound like any grounds being broken either?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, one or two of these projects maybe relatively near-term, and so as we make our initial investments in grounds broken will report to you presumably in a quarter or two.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Okay. On the topic then MOBs, your same-store stabilized numbers in the supplemental showed a year-over-year decline and a quarter-to-quarter decline, do I assume that's because of the one asset which has been repositioned?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Exactly.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "And could you kind of describe what the repositioning is there?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I can, and basically, we have decided in order to maximize NOI of that asset, to reposition it with different hospital and physician relationship and we are in the process of getting that on track right now and look forward to having some positive news to report when we speak next.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Got you. Sunrise, that's not a non-campus building?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Exactly, not a non-campus building, that's correct.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Okay. And then last question on the Sunrise portfolio, you had a decline in occupancy on the stabilized assets from the fourth quarter to the first. Did you get -- can you attribute anything particularly to aspects like the economy or particularly this year the flu, did you see any -- either of those factors playing a role?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me give you one comment and then Ray will address it Rob. The one comment is that we do expect the first quarter essentially to be the worst quarter, as you who cover the operators understand.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Right.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And so, the results were in line with our expectations, and Ray will talk, I think, in a little bit more detail about the next layer of analysis.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yes, I think Rob just to address a couple of the points in your question. We did see more move outs due to debt and some of that can be attributed to the flu season, which is normally more active in the first quarter. The good news is that the decrease in occupancy was offset largely by the 2% increase in average daily rate, and so NOI was good. Second and third quarters are typically stronger and that's what we are looking forward to as we move out in the year.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Thanks. And then just one follow-up to that, can you refresh my memory, the Sunrise buildings, do they raise rents on the first of the year as at the time of the residency anniversary?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "It's on the anniversary.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Okay. So it's throughout the year we expect it to be?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, although some buildings have gone to a first of the year convention, so it's a mix, Rob.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Good morning.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jerry.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "I just had a couple of things. Just going back to the JV, what's your ownership share, is it, I think you are majority owner, and can you give us the sense what the percent will be?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "It's going to depend upon the economy of the individual transaction, Jerry, but you should think that we're going be the majority owner of the real estate itself, so we'll own between 95% and 99% of the venture that owns the real estate, what will probably end up doing and sharing around 50% of the value creation that comes through the development of the asset and lease-up of the asset.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. Would you own a development entity then or you'll just build economic stability into the real estate?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It would be the economics of the single project.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay, okay, that's helpful. There was a little thing on the supplement on the return on the last couple Sunrise development deals had dropped down from like 9.5% to kind of an 8%, 8.75% range at the low end. So, was there -- has sort of a contractual change been made or just the economics of these deals changed. I'm just really interested what all we should expect go forward on additional development deals?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Jerry, this is Debbie. I'm not certain that those impacts have changed and we'll take a look at it, but our expectations about those developments from, when we originally disclosed the effective stabilized deals are consistent. The Steeles return is lower because it's [inaudible].", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay, get, it's, Steeles and Sunrise of Brooklyn were just lower for some reason.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay --", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. You didn't get back to it. That's fine.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, thanks.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. And then, I was just -- on the acquisition environment, I'm sure, you don't want to reveal trade secrets, but I was wondering if we can get a little color, you talked about it being sort of a very pool of stuff, I mean, any sense of property types, I think, you talked about strategic. So, is it M&A, is it, or are we talking about large Steeles, are we talking about sot of singles, any more color on acquisitions or how we should be thinking about the acquisition or potential acquisition volumes in the second half?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the one thing I want to emphasize, this is just really across the Board and if you shouldn't think about it solely as acquisition that these are dimensional opportunities for our business to really drive growth and strategy going forward, and within the acquisition bucket, if you will. Ray, if you want to comment?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Yeah, I mean, I think, we are seeing pretty strong deal flow across the spectrum, certainly the medical office building portfolio continues to gain traction as we've been working on that now for about 24 months and have developed the number of very good strategic relationships that are providing a nice deal flow for us. There is also, I think, a market opportunity for us with a number of the developers and operators in the market who are looking to line up with an experienced and committed capital partner like Ventas. So, we are seeing more interest in strategic partnerships.", "And then, I think, on the seniors housing side, there continues to be a good flow of opportunities and we are also seeing an increase in the number of inquires we are getting about the ability to provide debt financing to those operators and we think that as the year plays out that could be an increasing opportunity set for us.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. And Debbie, I'm not sure that I meet, I know what dimensional opportunities mean. So, just, I mean, so we could do - we could up M&A, we could do things like more Sunrise REIT kinds of things, other strategic, I'm just trying to understand what you are detailing me?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right, I think we're going to have to let you speculate here. But, we look forward to telling you more as these things develop and I would hope that over the course of the year, as I said, one or more of these things come to fruition.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. I will use my imagination. Thanks.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, excellent. Thanks for joining.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pike with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Chris", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Hi, Chris.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "I guess back to the MOB joint venture, is this the same relationship that you have been building on over the last 24 months, or is this a new players so to speak, a new relationships that you are bringing forth?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "This is a new relationship that we have entered into, although it's a group that we have been having discussion with for a long period of time and have been courting through quite sometime.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And, I guess, my other questions for the most part have been answered. I guess, I will just follow up with Rick offline, just got a couple of housekeeping questions, but thanks a lot.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Good morning. Craig Melcher is on the phone with me as well. Debbie in your opening comment, you said the active pipeline was strategic and accretive, are those mutually exclusive or--?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sometimes they are, but hopefully they are not.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And sort of size-wise, what are you hoping to land one or two of these, give us a sense, I know you don't want to dive too much into what are these, but can you give us sense of size?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, again, it's really a broad range of opportunities and they range from a singles, as, I think, Jerry put it to larger size opportunities that would be very meaningful even on our $10 billion base.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And how are you thinking when you think about accretion, how are you thinking about the financing side of the equation?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's something we spend a little bit of time on because we look at unlevered yields, we look at where we are now on our balance sheet because we have a very, very strong balance sheet, a lot of liquidity. And if we can use that liquidity for, to finance a strategic opportunity, that is accretive, then that would be really terrific. We do assume generally in most normal environments that we fund things 50-50 debt and equity. But at the present time where we are with a $124 million of cash and securities on hand plus virtually all of our line of credit available, we are in a great position I think to do things that are strategic and accretive.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "That's helpful. Maybe going back to the $68 million of sales, which we're 10.5 cap.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And you talk about having a $10 billion balance sheet. You talk about these deals being a strategic exit. I mean how much of the portfolio you classify into this higher cap rates, strategic disposition sort of help the company going forward?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say we classify very little into this category and strategic is probably an overstatement to be honest. It's a more of a tactical exit from a specific investment that actually went extremely well for Ventas. Part of this investment going back five years or more was almost $20 million net loan that we got, 18% interest and principal on, we had a remaining net investment in this of about $42 million. And frankly, the assets were significantly undermanaged and we thought sometimes it's great to take your profits and move on, and that's what we did.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And on the medical office development deals, what is your return on your cost expected to be, considering you'll get the 50% of the development profit?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I mean, we would expect net to Ventas that our returns on an unlevered basis will be in 7.5% give or take range.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "And what type of pre-leasing is necessary for you to move forward on deals trying to gauge the risk that is involved in this?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, of course, we'll look at a number of factors. As Ray said, these are virtually all on campus and they have strong hospital sponsorship. We would really be looking at least 50% pre-leasing and hopefully more in order to invest in the project.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Okay. And on the Sunrise results, sequentially from here, what should we expect from first quarter to second quarter?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think that the major point we want to make is that we said that we expect Sunrise total NOI this year, total community to be between a $140 million and $145 million, and that that will ramp in the year as the lease-up asset continue to lease up as in the stabilized, hopefully continue to grow their NOI and as deals become switches over from a net negative to a positive.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "How was the -- you know how the market is generally doing with the overhangs due to the economy and/or just that was going on in the housing market, how is it performing?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I mean it is need based business, I think the fundamentals is this business are as good as in any real estate asset class and probably better. So because they are need based, I think we're continuing to see very good performance across our triple-net and our Sunrise portfolio. That said when there are huge macro trends, rather they are economic in terms of the slower economy or housing slum, I would tell you that at the margin that has to tamper your expectation.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome. Thank you for joining.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks and good morning.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Rich", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Hi, Rich.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Hey, just to understand this joint venture, you are putting 100% of the dollars to finance the development, is it correct?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Not a 100%, but it is the lion share.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. So the partner got a little bit of skin in the game.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "They are cutting back things [ph] and putting a little bit of skin in a game, that's correct.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And just curious, you are not mentioning who the partner is, is there reason why they don't want to be out? So, you are not going to answer?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "No, Rich, let me answer it, it's just that we are not going to talk about who our partner is at this point in time.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. In terms of Sunrise and the things going on in the Sunrise, the management company, maybe you could talk a little about what you see the progress going there from your advantage point?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, one important aspect is that Sunrise filed its 2006 financial statement and maintained with its New York Stock Exchange listing which was a really, really positive development. The other positive developments, I would point to you are really addition of the new CFO, whom we talked about, so that is a super new development but that was a real plus for Sunrise on a corporate level and recently the addition of Mark Ordan as the Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Investment Officer, as well as some of the corporate governance changes that are being made at Sunrise. We view the moves that Sunrise Board -- that the moves that they are making as very positive and may we believe that Sunrise is really taking step to continue to improve itself over the course of the year.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "What do you think the worse case scenario is with them and you?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "With?", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "I mean in terms of your relationship with them and--?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, right now, I mean.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "With corporate co-investments [ph].", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right now what we asked Sunrise, what we asked of Sunrise is really to be a property manager for us and do a good job, taking care of the senior residents and driving NOI on our mutual behalf and that's really what we'll continue to ask them, whether they are public or private or whomever running the firm or what have you. So that's the basic relationship that we have and one that we expect to continue.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Now besides the management of the properties, they are co-investor in many of the facilities, am I right that, say if you were to sort of had to take out their interest, someone bought them and didn't want to be a co-investment partner, is the number or something like three or five -- $350 million something like that would require for a take out of their interest in the partnerships?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the first point, that's a good question, is a 15% to 25% partner and I think 18 of the assets with us which we first I had to reverse, I'm sorry with 66 or 67.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Right.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And we actually like the partnership structure, because it does create additional alignments for them as the property manager, it's not essential, but it's kind of a nice aspect of the overall relationship. If Sunrise were bought, there is no option for them to put those partnerships interest to us. So we would essentially, if it's such a new person or Sunrise itself wanted to sell those interest to us, then we would have a discussion. But no one has a put of those interests to us nor do we have a call in them. We are partners.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Understood. Last question. You mentioned the Sunrise expenses were relatively controlled your words. So would -- is that a bit of a hedge whether sort of bigger cost pressures this quarter than you thought, and if so, what would form that they come in?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Rich, can I just circle back for one second. There are 61 jointly owned assets in the portfolio.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "On the expense side, I think we always work with Sunrise to manage expenses which has not being as much of a focus of theirs as it is of ours. And we like it and prefer to compliment them, win expenses sequentially we think are recently controlled as they were in this quarter.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And your next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya with UBS. Please proceed.", "Tayo Okusanya - UBS", "Good morning.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Tayo.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Hi, Tayo.", "Tayo Okusanya - UBS", "Hi, just a follow with regards to the JV, I apologize if you have answered this already because if I'm juggling two calls at the same time. But just from trying to understand the economics going to be better, understand you put up majority of the development costs. But in regards to the actual income stream coming from this portfolio, could you talk a little bit about what that sharing is, both theoretically and at the same time if you kind of use some numbers to walk me through it? That would also be helpful.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Tayo, the income stream and the cash flows coming off of the property will be shared [inaudible] in accordance with the ownership positions of the partners.", "Tayo Okusanya - UBS", "Okay.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "And as I said previously, there is also a monetization of some of the development profit to the developer which will occur upon stabilization of the asset.", "Tayo Okusanya - UBS", "Are you saying monetize, you are going to sell the property to a third party and split the difference between what was bought?", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "No, that's a term of our, Tayo, I'm sorry. It's basically a one-time payment that is made based on value creation in the asset.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. I mean you can think of it basically as the paying wholesale which is the difference between the development cost and the profit embedded in the development activity.", "Tayo Okusanya - UBS", "Let's say you -- the some type of payment you will make to developer, so that you could own the property out right?", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Generally.", "Tayo Okusanya - UBS", "Okay. All right. I think it might be helpful, Rick and Deb, maybe if I just give you a call to trying to get, try to understand it a little bit better for modeling purposes. So I'll give you a shot.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. We will be happy to do that. And I am glad actually we are getting questions on this, because we do think this a very positive and important new relationship in the MOB areas that we have developed.", "Tayo Okusanya - UBS", "Great. Good quarter.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the presentation back over to Ms. Debra Cafaro for closing remarks.", "Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Heather. Well everyone, I just want to thank you all for joining on today's call and we, as always, very much appreciate your interest in Ventas and we look forward to seeing everyone then.

As a remainder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. David Smith.  Please proceed.", "David Smith", "", "Good morning and welcome to the Ventas Conference Call to review the company's announcement yesterday regarding its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions, and certain other statements to be made during this conference call, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws.  These projections, predictions, and statements are based on management's current beliefs, as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events.", "The forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and contingencies and stockholders and others should recognize that actual results may differ materially from the company's expectations, whether expressed or implied.

Many of these factors are beyond the control of the company and its management.", "The information being provided today is that of this date only and Ventas expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations.  Please note the quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measures contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now turn the call over to Debra Cafaro, Chairman, President, and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you David.  Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants and welcome to Ventas' third quarter 2008 earnings call.  I'm pleased to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues including Ray Lewis and Rick Schweinhart.", "In the third quarter, Ventas once again delivered growing earnings and demonstrated portfolio and balance sheet strength despite the unprecedented conditions in the financial, economic, and housing markets.  Since mid-2007, we have prepared for a severe credit downturn.  Our actions have been increasingly protective since then as we have opportunistically raised equity to reduce our debt balances, sold assets, expanded our revolving credit capacity, limited our forward commitments and investments, and even killed deals in progress.  Yet all of our steps seem insignificant compared to the magnitude and speed of the recent meltdown in the global financial system.", "In October, we took the extraordinary step of drawing down our line of credit to create real liquidity at the company.  Buying some of our outstanding bonds at a discount, fund near-term debt maturity, and meet other corporate obligations.  Pending use of the fund were paid down of our line of credit, we invested excess amounts in safe US Treasury securities.  Right now, we are holding a little over $100 million in these short-term treasury investments.", "We complete highly defensive actions to preserve and protect shareholder value.  They are, however, a drag on near-term earnings.  So, despite good performance in our portfolio and inline core earnings, we are adjusting our 2008 normalized FFO guidance to $2.71 to $2.74 per share to take into account the impacts of our actions and the negative forward economic environment.  We believe that in this uncertain time, safety and liquidity thrust other goals.", "Ventas remains in an enviable position of safety with very attractive leverage of 31% debt-to-enterprise value at quarter end.  Our debt maturities through the end of 2009 totaled only $219 million, and we already have funds earmarked to pay those maturities without additional draws on our revolver.  So it is fair to say that we anticipate zero net debt maturities until 2010.", "You're probably thinking about it.  Right now we have cash on hand of $106 million and we expect to receive over $100 million in proceeds under a pending loan application.  Assuming this refinancing closes, the combination of cash on hand and refinancing proceeds will cover all of our debt maturities into 2010 without further draws on our revolver.  ", "That leaves additional liquidity of $623 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under our credit facility.  These credit facilities don't mature until 2010 and that doesn't even take into account potential dispositions of between $100 million and $150 million in assets for a significant gain.", "The total amount of potential dispositions includes the previously announced sale of five senior housing assets to Emeritus for over $62 million.  This sale transaction should close in the fourth quarter.  We also expect to sell a handful of other assets aggregating between $35 million and $85 million in proceeds early next year.  If completed, these dispositions will generate significant gains for Ventas and further increase our cash on hand.", "In addition to our excellent balance sheet and liquidity position, we have a high quality portfolio of diversified healthcare and senior housing assets.  Our tenants such as Kindred and Brookdale are performing creditively during a very challenging time.  Furthermore, our property manager, Sunrise Senior Living Inc., has increased to 92% the average occupancy in our 72 same-store stable pool of community it manages on our behalf.", "Today we will discuss our earnings, expected dispositions, balance sheet and liquidity positions, recent investments, portfolio performance, and our outlook.  After Rich Schweinhart reports on our financial results we will be happy to take your questions.", "This quarter\u2019s normalized FFO per diluted share was $0.69, a 4.5% increase over last year\u2019s quarterly result.  NAREIT-defined FFO per diluted share was significantly higher at $0.81 because we received a $17 million net benefit to earnings this quarter which we excluded from normalized FFO per share.  But that $17 million net benefit is very real because it represents the cash liability that we will not have to pay.", "On the investment front, we have been extremely selective all year because our first priority has been to stay safe and liquid and increase financial flexibility.  Big picture on the investment front, we are doing four things: One, making selective investments in medical office buildings or MOBs; two, we are buying back our bonds due 2009 and 2010 at a discount; third, we are acquiring slivers of debt in healthcare operating company; and fourth, we are keeping our eyes open in our powder dry for exceptional opportunities that should arise as the consequences of the credit environment work their way through the real estate landscape.", "Let me explain our rationale and our activity.  First, MOBs.  We are committed to being a leader in the MOB space.  As a result of our strategy and activity, we now own 1.5 million square feet of MOB including those under development.  More importantly, we are now doing business with six quality MOB developers including five of the top 20 MOB developers in the nation.", "Regarding specific MOB acquisitions, we have invested in five MOBs since we last spoke.  Two stabilized fully-occupied MOBs and three pre-leased MOBs under development.  The assets are with three different developer partners, two of whom represent new MOB relationships for Ventas.  Two MOB developments we began in the fourth quarter are the results of the option agreement we previously announced that gives Ventas the right but not the obligation to fund up to ten MOB developments.", "Both of our new MOB developments are with not-for-profit hospital systems having an A-credit rating.  These MOBs are 58% and 88% pre-leased and total cost to Ventas should be about $45 million.  We expect our stabilized yield on those projects to approximate 8% on stabilization.", "One other pre-leased development project represents a new partnership for Ventas with the national developer manager of MOB.  That MOB development is within investment grade rated hospital systems and is 63% pre-leased.  The expected project cost to Ventas is about $21 million and we expect the stabilized yield to be about 8.5%.", "The two Atlanta stabilized MOBs we acquired in the third quarter also represent a new relationship with a prominent MOB owner-manager-developer in the Southeast.  These two MOBs are fully-leased and are located on the campus of an HCA full-service acute care hospital.  Our investment in these two MOBs totaled $40 million and we expect about a 7.25% initial NOI yield on our investment.  We believe these MOB investments and relationships will create value for our shareholders.  They advance our interest in a disciplined measured way and position us to become a leader in the MOB business.", "Second, we have taken advantage of the disruption in the credit market to buy back a $139 million in principal amount of our own bonds at a net discount.  These bonds would otherwise be due in 2009 and 2010.  So we are essentially repaying those near-term maturities without a make-whole premium.  Our return on investment is at or above 9% and we believe taking out these 2009 and 2010 maturities at attractive levels represent a great use of cash on hand.", "Now third, let\u2019s turn to debt investments we are making.  Here we made total investments of under $20 million in the third quarter.  We have said previously that we will acquire debt investments in limited amounts issued by quality borrowers in the healthcare space.  We are looking for superior risk-adjusted returns and especially returns that may be higher than equity returns.  We intend to invest in small principal amounts issued by multiple borrowers, purchase these slivers of debt at a discount and hold the debt to maturity or earlier payoff by the issuer.", "With that backdrop in mind in the third quarter, we purchased debt in three publicly traded hospital companies in principal amounts between $5 million and $10 million per issuer.  Our total investment was less than $20 million and the yield to maturity should be about 9.5%.  We have been disciplined in our approach and we believe these investments will provide good cash flow and the return of principals to Ventas.", "Finally, we are keeping our eyes open for those exceptional investment opportunities that should come along as a result of the credit crisis and constrained capital environment.  We want to stay in a liquid position so we can take advantage of those opportunities when they arrive.  Our strategy has been to keep our powder dry and work to stay active in our space so we can be ready to use our balance sheet and liquidity advantages for the benefit of our shareholders.", "Turning to our diverse portfolio of healthcare and senior housing assets, it is performing well.  First, our triple net lease assets.  Consistent with industry practice, our reported portfolio numbers are through the end of the prior quarter or June 30, 2008.  The Ventas portfolio is a stable, secure portfolio with solid occupancies and cash flow to rent coverages across the spectrum of independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing facilities, and hospitals.  Our triple-net lease portfolio of 418 assets accounts for 76% of our NOI.", "First, let\u2019s look at our triple-net lease private-pay senior housing assets.  You already know that Brookdale last night reported over 90% occupancy in its corporate portfolio at the end of the third quarter.  In our senior living triple-net lease portfolio, without the benefit of the third quarter results, cash flow to rent coverages are stable at 1.3 times, an average occupancy with 87% reflecting trough Q2 occupancy.", "Turning to our skilled nursing and hospital triple-net lease portfolio.  Kindred leases 165 skilled nursing facilities and 38 long-term acute care hospitals from Ventas under pooled multi-facility triple-net master leases that are the super senior secured obligations in Kindred's capital structure.  On a trailing 12-month basis through the second quarter of 2008, Kindred generated $2.20 in cash for each dollar of rent it paid to Ventas.  Remember, these triple-net leases are designed to anticipate annual and quarterly changes in operator performance.", "Following outstanding first and second quarter 2008 results, Kindred\u2019s third quarter EPS was lower than expected due to soft volumes in its long-term acute care hospitals.  Kindred still expects that the 2008 EBITDAR to approximate $563 million.  Kindred\u2019s $80-million swing in expected annual EBITDAR on a $4.2 billion business is well within the normal range of expectations from our landlord\u2019s point of view.  Most important for our constituents, Ventas\u2019 rent from Kindred remains the same and is secure.  Kindred cash flow to Ventas rent for 2008 should be about 2.1 times and operating cash flow at our Kindred hospitals should still cover our $86 million in hospital cash rent by over 2.5 times.", "Our Kindred nursing home which received a 3.4% Medicare rate increase in October 2008 continues to perform well with two times cash flow to rent coverage.  In sum, our Kindred assets are generating excellent cash flows.  At the corporate level, Kindred\u2019s 2008 expected EBITDAR of $563 million exceeds its total expected fixed charges by $200 million.  We continue to have confidence in Kindred and our Kindred assets.", "All in all then, we are pleased with our diversified triple-net lease portfolio which is delivering steady reliable growing rent from a variety of tenant operators and asset types.", "Next, I want to discuss our operating portfolio.  Our 79 assisted living community managed by Sunrise Senior Living and our medical office buildings provide a granular highly diversified revenue streams in our portfolio.  We first want to review our assisted living operating portfolio.  These high quality private-paid mansion-style communities are located in major metropolitan markets and serve a need-based senior population.  ", "Our 79 Sunrise communities account for 19% of then passive total NOI.  These 79 communities produce solid results in the third quarter.  Total NOI for the portfolio was $35.2 million which is consistent with the $71 million NOI level we reported in the first half of 2008.  For the 78 communities we owned in the full third quarter of 2008 and the full third quarter of 2007, total NOI stopped over 4%, average daily rate increased 3%, and occupancies are stable at 91%.  This is very solid performance from our Sunrise portfolio.  For the 72 same-store stabilized communities we owned and Sunrise manages, average occupancy increased sequentially in the third quarter of 2008 to 92%.  ", "A year ago in the third quarter, these 72 assets showed occupancy of 93% versus last year's third quarter, average daily rate is up 3% in these 72 communities.  We also have three Sunrise community that have been leased up including the large independent living asset in Toronto, known as Steeles.", "These three leased-up communities we owned for the full second and third quarter of 2008 showed increasing occupancies and stable NOI this quarter.  Specifically, our two Sunrise mansion assisted living communities that are in lease up increased sequential occupancy by 4 percentage points to 70% in the third quarter versus 66% in the second.  ", "And our new Steeles independent living community in Toronto is showing steady progress averaging 52% average occupancy in the third quarter compared to 46% in the second.  Steeles is currently home to almost 150 seniors.", "So to sum up our 79 communities managed by Sunrise, the third quarter NOI and occupancy performance are generally tracking our expectations.  Average occupancies at the 72 same-store stabilized communities grew sequentially and our three leased up assets show improving occupancy and stable NOI.  We currently expect NOI from our 79 senior living communities managed by Sunrise to total $137 million to $140 million for the year, a downward revision of about 3% since we spoke in August.  Our projections at that time were explicitly based upon a stable economic environment.  In that environment, we expected second half growth and revenue to offset higher anticipated expenses.", "Today\u2019s change in 2008 NOI expectation is based instead upon the current recessionary climate which we believe will result in fourth quarter lapse to lower occupancy, continued promotional pricing, an increase in expenses, normal year-end true up, and the impact of the decline in the Canadian dollar.", "In short, we believe revenues in our Sunrise portfolio are not ramping in the second half as we and Sunrise projected while extensive arising as expected.  Therefore, fourth quarter revenues in the portfolio should show stability or modest decline rather than an increase because the whole world hunkered down in October and now we are heading into the holidays while property expenses are likely to be up pressuring fourth quarter NOI result.  Perhaps our cautious outlooks were proven warranted, but we believe it is realistic and appropriate in the state of current economic headwind.", "As always, we are committed as the management team to giving you are best read on what we see going forward whether we like it or not.  We will be very happy if we are proven wrong.  I want to remind you that our healthcare and senior housing assets are indeed recession resistant and performing generally well.  But, as I said in February, no sector is immune from the very powerful downward forces affecting our economy.  When the world returns to any semblance of normalcy, our high quality communities should show significant upside and growth.", "Turning to the medical office building portion of our portfolio, we added two stabilized MOBs in the third quarter.  In total, our MOBs contributed $4.8 million in NOI to Ventas this quarter.  An average occupancy in our stabilized MOBs with 96%.

These loans totaled $20 million and are secured by lien and four senior housing assets and guaranteed by Sunwest in its principal.", "Sunwest recently became delinquent in payments of principal and interest to us and we have initiated foreclosure actions on the assets and collection action on the guarantee.  We will endeavor to collect all amounts owed to us but have recorded a $6 million allowance to reflect the current valuation and financing environment for these assets.", "On the investment front, opportunities to invest are becoming plentiful and more interesting due to the capital constrained environment.  This period should represent a great investment landscape for REIT.  But for the time being, we are trying to get a better read on the long-term cost and availability of debt as well as where pricing will settle in the real estate market before making any meaningful investments.  ", "We do believe excellent investment opportunities in our sector are beginning to present themselves and we are committed to being patient and disciplined with our capital allocation decisions because we believe that it is in the best interest of our shareholders to do so.  Because we have liquidity and low leverage, we are well positioned to succeed whether we experience a prolonged downturn or we see a rapidly improving market.", "Make no mistake, our top priority remains a quality balance sheet and we don\u2019t intend to compromise that priority.

Added to that, we have over $600 million available on our line of credit which doesn\u2019t mature until 2010 and potential assets sales totaling between a $100 million and $150 million over the next several quarters.

And that spending continued to\u2014that so you know into the\u2014it accelerated into fourth quarter in October, when the market really crashed.  Here\u2019s the way we think about it, we have significant make whole premiums on those bond issues.  We are only looking at near-term maturities because we\u2019re really trading cheaper debt for more expensive debt, and since we know that we have to pay those maturities in the near term, we view that as a very positive trade-out.

Is there any update, or progress you can provide relative to leases rolling in 2010?", "Debra Cafaro", "", "Most of those leases are Kindred leases, and those are all in the pool of multi-facility master leases that are essentially all-or-nothing.

We\u2019ve developed a strategy of really putting in place this network of partnership with quality MOB developer/owner/managers, and we have been willing to allocate limited amounts of capital, to basically put that infrastructure in place with six of those developer managers\u2014again, five of whom are in the top 20 MOB developers in the United States.

Is that still the strategy?  Or have you revisited that at all?", "Raymond Lewis", "Dustin, this is Ray, yeah, I think that is the long-term strategy for the company, and consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re going to start by developing these relationships, and we\u2019re not targeting any specific date by which we want to have that platform.

Just out of curiosity, why is there 72 properties in the same store pool now?", "Debra Cafaro", "", "Well there are 72 in the same store stabilized, which are basically stabilized assets that we\u2019ve owned the full\u2014and that we\u2019re stable\u2014", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "", "There\u2019s 74 in the last quarter though.", "Debra Cafaro", "", "Pardon me?", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "", "There were 74 properties last quarter.", "Debra Cafaro", "", "Well there\u2019s 76 stabilized, and 72 same-store stabilized Rich.  So, there were two leased-up assets that were re-classified to stable in 3Q of 08, so that gets you 74 to 76, and same-store stable at 72 are assets that were stabilized, and we own for the full third quarter of 2007 and 2008.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "", "Okay.

Is there a legal issue there?  Or just a confidentiality?   Or what is it?  It\u2019d be nice to know who you\u2019re dealing with I guess.", "Raymond Lewis", "Yeah Rich, this is Ray, I think that the real reason we don\u2019t want to name the partners, is that they are the ones that are in front of the hospitals with the direct relationship, and we don\u2019t want to be front-running those relationships with the hospital, so it\u2019s really at the request of our partners that we\u2019re doing that.", "Debra Cafaro", "", "Again, some are more sensitive than others.

I still don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t get another decimal point on occupancy and stuff, because it really does create confusion when you report to senior housing.  Is there some reason for that sort of lump?", "Debra Cafaro", "", "There\u2019s no real reason Jerry, other than that we had recently decided to do it basically, kind of rounded, and didn\u2019t really\u2014and don\u2019t really believe that 10 basis points here or there really should make a giant difference in people\u2019s perception of the performance of a large portfolio.  But we will definitely take your comments, which we respect enormously, under advisement and think about whether we should change the presentation in 2009.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Right and when we\u2019re trying to do estimates, the truth is that 10 or 20 basis points does matter, particularly, and they could be as much as 40 or 50 basis points, so we\u2019d love to have the alternative.  ", "Again, a lot of good stuff has been covered.  If we\u2019re just trying to think about 2009, and obviously there\u2019s lots of uncertainty here\u2014well, maybe one question before that\u2014I think you said you had bought additional debt, or accelerated your debt repurchases in the 4th quarter 2008, so any just sense of the volume of that?

So if the market continues as it is, liquidity is paramount as Debbie said, and that\u2019s going to be our primary focus, but if the market recovers, we will have a good liquidity position to invest into that recovery.   The challenge for us is, to sort of figure out when we think the market is recovering, and I\u2019m not prepared to call that in 2009 as I sit here.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "And in terms of the way you think about that, the signs we would look for would be opening up better costs on bank credit lines, or long-term debt?

And so we want to get a little more visibility on that because that should effect evaluations, it should affect our hurdle rate as we make investments, and as Dustin pointed out, if we make capital allocation decisions, we\u2019ll be comparing those kinds of returns to allocating capital to buying in stock and other potential investments.  ", "We\u2019ll be looking at potentially internalizing an MOB platform, and what that would mean for potential returns going forward.  So there\u2019s a lot to think about, and I agree with Ray that it\u2019s a little early to project what we think those returns or acquisition volumes or type would likely be in 2009.", "Raymond Lewis", "But Jerry you\u2019re right, I mean a functioning debt market is going to be the condition precedent to a recovery.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Okay, and preferably longer-term debt, not just credit lines or short-term stuff.", "Raymond Lewis", "I think that\u2019s right.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Just one last question.  In terms of your ability\u2014I\u2019m assuming what you\u2019re doing is refinancing, putting mortgage debt on the refinancing\u2014you\u2019re talking about the $100 million or whatever it was, coming up here.  So how much unencumbered real estate do you have?  How much more mortgage debt capacity debt would you have beyond that refi?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we have tons of unsecured assets of all types, including all of our Kindred assets and that\u2019s because we have successfully become an investment great company, and we value that particularly in this kind of credit market, and we want to maintain a high level of unencumbered assets, and we will.  On the senior housing front, alone, which is as you know, available for agency debt, which remains available and attractive, we\u2019ve got about a billion and a half of unencumbered value at least, and so if we needed to, or wanted to tap that market, that would probably translate into borrowing capacity of about a billion or more.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Okay.

And then you mentioned last quarter Manor Care and HCA were the bond\u2014were the debt you were buying.  It sounds like you\u2019ve added some others into the fold, here, recently.

I think our last quarter certainly brought us as challenging an economic environment as we\u2019ve seen in a long long time.

It\u2019s regarding your cash flow coverage.  And looking at your supplementals, you have your senior housing at 1.3 times.  Can you just give us some commentary on what kind of cushion you have there and where you maybe start getting concerned about the level of cash flow from the tenant?", "", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay.

So we monitor this carefully but we feel comfortable, certainly, with where the coverages are.  ", "", "Brian Sekino - Barclay\u2019s Capital", "Okay.  And do you have a level where you would start to get worried about the coverage?", "", "Debra Cafaro", "You don't know me very well but I worry about everything, all the time.

A question on Sunrise\u2019s operations.  Noticed that the daily rate declined sequentially slightly and same store margins were down year over year.  Were those due to some of the factors you discussed earlier in the call, like promotional pricing, rise in operating expenses, decline in the Canadian dollar, or was there something else going on?", "", "Raymond Lewis ", "No I think those are the factors.  ", "", "[Harv Tinker] - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Okay.  Question on\u2014the interest and other income line in Q3 more than doubled from Q1 and Q2.  There\u2019s some sort of one time item in that, or is this due to the debt investment income that you spoke about?", "", "Debra Cafaro", "No, the debt investment income is in a separate line.  And again you\u2019ll see over time the other income line sort of going up and down.  ", "[Harv Tinker] - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "So, the 1.9 billion in Q3, we shouldn\u2019t look at that as a trend then?", "Debra Cafaro", "No, I mean, again, what I would do is look over time and you can see that kind of goes up and down.  But, I would use maybe a Q2 run rate on that, something like that.", "[Harv Tinker] - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Okay.  And, last question, also kind of housekeeping.  G&A, as a set of revenues, excluding stock option expense, has gone from 2.7% in Q1 up to 3.5% in the third quarter.  Now, can you, maybe, discuss what\u2019s going on there?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes we can.  As Rick pointed out, there\u2019s a couple million dollars of dead deal costs in the quarter.  Which, as we mentioned, we\u2019re keeping our investments very disciplined, and that was one outgrowth of those decisions.", "[Harv Tinker] - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Okay.  That\u2019s all my questions.  Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And, your next question comes from line of Tayo Okusanya of UBS.  Please proceed.", "Tayo Okusanya - UBS", "", "Yes, good morning.  A lot of my questions have been covered, but one property type we really haven\u2019t talked about that much is hospitals and LTACHs.  Debbie, could you give us a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about these properties, especially in light of the tough results that quite a few of the public hospitals have had this quarter?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay, I\u2019m happy to do that.  The LTACHs, for those of you that don\u2019t know, are long term acute care hospitals.  They\u2019re a specialty hospital that is essentially a freestanding sort of intensive care hospital that is part of the post acute continuum.  ", "And, we have always had very good results and coverages with our long term acute care hospitals, and we expect that to continue.  The hospitals did great in the first and second quarter, and had some volume reductions in the third.  ", "But, as Kendra reported recently they\u2019re already seeing increases in that and expect a better fourth quarter.  So, those are assets we\u2019ve gone for a long time they cover more than two and a half times, and we actually like them.", "Tayo Okusanya - UBS", " ", "Okay.  Thank you very much.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.  One more comment on that, just so you know some of the acute care hospitals also have things like bad debt issues and things like that, which, again, the long term acute care hospitals do not have.  Because, they\u2019ll have emergency room admittances and things like that.  ", "So, it\u2019s important to sort of understand the asset class and where it fits into the post acute sector.  And, perhaps, even to review Kendra\u2019s earnings call so you can see where those expectations on the portfolio are going.

Please proceed.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning everybody.  ", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi Chris.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "I think you guys answered my question.  I just want to be square on, I guess this is just a follow-up to Rich\u2019s question, I think, the PIMCO question.  So, I see the contingent reversal in the P&L and I guess based upon one answer in the loan provision, being that it\u2019s baked into property ops, that\u2019s why you\u2019re adding it back on the reconciliation to FFO?", "Debra Cafaro", "No, we\u2019re adding it back because essentially the reversal of the contingent liability and the loan loss allowance are essentially non-returning, effectively noncash items at this point.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "But, the provision loss, it appears it\u2019s baked into the property operating expenses?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, it is.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  So, then it is one time in nature.  So, if we\u2019re thinking about things from a sequential run rate perspective that has to be reversed in forward quarters?", "Debra Cafaro", "Absolutely.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great.  I guess, a follow-up to Karen\u2019s earlier question regarding some type of negative corporate event at Sunrise.  Ownership interest in the properties in which you are joint venture partners, can you just remind us how and what would happen there, to the extent there is a negative corporate event?  Or, would that be more along the lines of court or procedural type issues?", "Debra Cafaro", "", "Okay, well, yes, as Chris is pointing out, Sunrise has 20% interest in about 60 of our assets.  And, those partnerships, in the event of a negative corporate Sunrise event would remain in place.  And, we are the managing member of those partnerships, and so they should not be really affected by any kind of negative event.  And, we control the partnerships and so on.  So, I hope that answers your question.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Well, I guess I\u2019m just wondering if, in the most dire situation, would you be able to buy out the percentage of the assets that you don\u2019t already own?  Or, once again, would that have to go to some type of court and it\u2019s more of a function of procedure, rather then let\u2019s say a right of first refusal or something along those lines?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, there are myriad contractual provisions that would apply to this.  But, we could theoretically buy those consensually.  There are normal partnership squeeze down provisions, for example, where we could become the owner of those 20% interests, if there was a Sunrise bankruptcy for example.  ", "And, again, I think it\u2019s interesting because we believe that Sunrise has billable assets, they have very limited of near term debt maturities.  And, these 20% minority interests they own in some of our assets could be a source of consensual liquidity for them that really could help them meet some of their near term liquidity needs.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and just a follow-up to one of your comments and respect to acid allocation.  It sounds to me anyway, and tell me if I\u2019m thinking about this and a fair way, that you, alongside your publicly traded peers, you\u2019re going to be investing in what you think our top notch operators.  ", "So, from an acid allocation perspective, the systemic issues that may be impacting seniors housing or LTACHs, or ALFs or ILFs, or whatever segment we\u2019re really thinking about, it\u2019s really more of a systemic issue.  And, from your perspective, diversification really starts across segment and then filters down to other areas.  Is that fair?", "Debra Cafaro", "Absolutely.  I mean, I think, because what you find is if you have one nursing home tenant or 20 nursing home tenants when there\u2019s a change in nursing home reimbursement up or down, that\u2019s all correlated.  ", "So, what we\u2019ve been seeking is balance in the portfolio that we think comes most significantly from asset class and payor type of diversification.  And, we think that creates the greatest reliability in forward cash flow, and that has proven to be the case.  ", "I think what we\u2019re talking about on this call is that in times of extreme stress on the economy, or in the financial system, you basically find across all investment pipes, across all sectors, you find high degrees of correlation, for that hasn\u2019t existed before.  And, so we\u2019re in a somewhat unique environment, but we do believe, as you said, it\u2019s the asset class diversification that provides the greatest reliability.  ", "That\u2019s what we\u2019ve worked on most significantly, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to expand our medical office building portfolio.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and just really quick because I know everyone\u2019s got to hop here.  But, with respect to margins, I know you have expectations for maybe a lower growth rate on the operating side with respect to your Sunrise assets expense expected to come in line, so hopefully those two assumptions are fair, can you kind of providers will your margin expectations are in this type of environment versus what you would consider a more normalized environment for both rate and occupancy?", "Raymond Lewis", "", "Yeah, Chris, this is Ray.  I think in a normalized environment we sort of book for margins that are between 30 and 35% on average.  So, you could expect that in a more difficult environment you would tend towards the lower end of that range.  ", "It\u2019s also important to remember when we talked about, the assets when we originally made the acquisition, that we had a very long view of the assets and that we said that there would be more variability in the performance.  So, when you\u2019re looking quarter to quarter you may see things move inside or outside of that range, you really need to look at multiple quarters and trend lines in order to sort of smooth out those quarterly effects.", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and I guess there\u2019s still seasonality within the 30 to 35 as we move through the year as well.", "Raymond Lewis", "Sure.  ", "Chris Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great.  Thanks a lot, folks, I appreciate it.", "Raymond Lewis", "Thanks, Chris.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.  We appreciate it.  Just a follow-up to (01:25:52) question.  In the fourth quarter we bought back $120 million of our senior notes.

(NYSE:VTR) Q4 2008 Earnings Call February 12, 2009 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Debra Cafaro - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer", "Richard Schweinhart - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Raymond Lewis - Chief Investment Officer and Executive Vice President", "David Smith - Investor Relations", "Analysts", "David Toti - Citigroup", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & company, Inc.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO", "Brian Sekino - Barclays Capital", "Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the fourth quarter 2008 Ventas Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tanya and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) I will now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call Mr. David Smith. Mr. Smith please proceed.", "David Smith", "Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company\u2019s announcement this morning regarding its results for the year in quarter ended December 31, 2008. As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call maybe considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws.", "These projections, predictions and statements are based on management\u2019s current beliefs as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events. The forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and contingencies and stockholders and others should recognize that actual results may differ materially from to the company\u2019s expectations whether expressed or implied.", "We refer you to the company\u2019s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2007 and the company\u2019s other reports filed periodically with the SEC for a discussion of the forward-looking statements and other factors that could effect these forward-looking statements.", "Many of these factors are beyond the control of the company and its management. The information being provided today is as of this date only as Ventas expressively disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations.", "Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in the [audio dip] and its most directly comparable GAAP measure as well as the company\u2019s supplemental disclosure schedule are available in the investor relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com. I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman, President and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro ", "Thanks, David. Good morning to all of our shareholders and our other participants and welcome to our 2008 year-end earnings call. 2008 was a positive year for Ventas, despite terrible market and economic conditions. During the year, we remained highly profitable and intently focused on liquidity, safety and balance sheet strength.", "To stay financially strong, in 2008 we sold assets, expanded and extended our [audio dip], raised fixed rate mortgage debt, increased our equity base and limited our acquisition activity and forward commitments. We also delivered positive earnings growth in 2008 in spite of these defensive steps designed to protect and preserve shareholder value.", "First, I want to recap some of the highlights of the year. Normalized FFO per share increased 2% in 2008 to $2.74. Our cash flow from operations was strong exceeding $364 million. We raised over $400 million in equity. We sold assets for $432 million and realized a gain of $47 million.", "We raised $126 million in long-term secured debt at 6.5 %.on nine private pay senior housing communities. We opportunistically purchased $176 million of our bond due 2009 and 2010 at a net discount. We made about $300 million of accretive investments and commitments.", "Total portfolio NOI on our 79 private K assets managed by sunrise senior living was $138.8 million, a 5 % increase over 2007 levels. And Ventas ended the year as one of the largest ten REIT\u2019s. As a result of our efforts, which began in mid 2007 and accelerated in 2008, Ventas remains in an enviable position of safety with very attractive leverage of 40 % debt to enterprise value, net debt to EBITDA of 4.7 times and fixed charge coverage approaching three times.", "Even more importantly, our total debt maturities through the end of 2009 now are only $118 million compared to net un-drawn capacity on our line of credit of $774 million. During 2008, we were proud to receive two positive rating actions. An upgrade to investment grade by Standard & Poor\u2019s and a positive outlook on our investment grade rating by pitch.", "Notably, Ventas received two of the only 12 total positive rating actions for [retail] by all three agencies during 2008. These positive rating actions reward our unwavering commitment to an investment grade balance sheet and our focus on increasing the safety of our enterprise.", "In addition to our excellent balance sheet and liquidity position, we have a high quality portfolio of diversified healthcare and senior housing assets operated by superior care providers. Our tenants, such as Kindred, Brookdale and privately held senior care performed well during the challenging year.", "Our property manager, Sunrise Senior Living has maintained average occupancy during the fourth quarter of 91 % in the 72 same-store stable community it manages on our behalf. During the balance of today\u2019s call, I want to discuss our first quarter 2009 dividends, our portfolio performance and our outlook and guidance for 2009 then Rick Schweinhart will report in detail on our financial results, after which we\u2019ll be delighted to take your questions.", "Our Board of Directors has declared an all cash first quarter 2009 dividend of $0.51.25 per share. We believe our cash flows and balance sheet and our conservative dividend payout ratio support an all cash dividend. Ventas generates excellent cash flow, which we expect to continue in 2009 and we are pleased to share that cash flow with our shareholders.", "Turning to a portfolio review, first I want to discuss our triple net lease assets and then turn to our operating segment. Ventas\u2019s triple net lease assets continue to perform well, with good coverages and occupancies across the spectrum of independent living, assisted living skilled nursing facilities and hospitals.", "We received 78% of our NOI from our strong pool multi-facility master leases and have credit and structural support and down size protection. The key take away here is that operating results in our triple net portfolio were stable through Q3 of 2008. With strong EBITDARM to rent coverage of 1.8 times.", "Specifically, reporting on our 203 Kindred healthcare assets, from which we received 40% of our NOI. The cash flow coverages at our four Kindred master leases are excellent at 2.2 times. Kindred\u2019s full balance sheet stands behind its rent obligations to us and the combination of long-term acute care hospitals and skilled nursing assets in the master leases provides additional reliability to our cash flows.", "Medicare rates for sniff and LTACH increased meaningfully in the fourth quarter of 2008. We will see the impact of these increases in our fourth quarter property level results. In our senior housing triple net leases from which we derived 33 % of our NOI, cash flow coverage remains very good at 1.3 times, stable with prior periods.", "Occupancies in this portfolio rose over 100 basis points in the third quarter of 2008 sequentially to 88.2 %. And many senior housing operators have already announced that fourth quarter 2008 occupancies were flat with the third. So, we feel good about where our triple net senior housing portfolio stands.", "Remember that our pool multi-facility master leases represent the senior-most claim on a tenant\u2019s cash flow. These leases are designed to provide Ventas with good, steady contractual cash flow, evens as occupancies and EBITDARM add inflow overtime due to the economy, reimbursement cycles or other changes.", "Turning to our operating assets, the Senior Living and medical office building assets we own that are managed by others provide the granular highly diversified revenue streams in our portfolio. Together, they account for between 21% and 22 % of our NOI. Here to 2008 results met our expectations. First, we own 79 high-quality private pay senior housing communities in North America that are managed by Sunrise.", "These assets contribute 18% to our company\u2019s NOI. In this portfolio, total community NOI for 2008 was over $138 million within our anticipated range of results and 5% higher than 2007 NOI computed on a full year basis.", "Total community NOI for these assets was $32 million in the fourth quarter. For an NOI run rate of $128 million. In the 72 same-store stabilized Sunrise communities, fourth quarter total community NOI was $29.4 million.", "Although occupancy remains strong at 91% in the fourth quarter, it is down 70 basis points from the third quarter 2008. As we indicated earlier this year, we are seeing declining NOI and occupancy trends in the same-store stabilized communities that accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the result of extreme economic conditions. Bucking those pressures somewhat, our two Sunrise communities in lease-up showed 550 basis points of sequential increase in occupancy in the fourth quarter, improving to 63.7% from 58.2% in the third quarter of 2008.", "Overall, the Sunrise portfolio held its own in a challenging market during 2008. Even increasing NOI by 5% versus 2007 levels, but the fourth quarter evidence as expected, a decline in NOI in occupancy. Finally, our MOB portfolio is a stable, growing segment of our business and now accounts for 3% of our NOI. Our portfolio consists of nearly 1.5 million square feet of mostly on-campus product. Our medical office buildings contributed $5.3 million in NOI during the quarter.", "Looking at our 15 same-store stabilized assets, NOI increased 7% to $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 versus a year-ago period. One of the benefits of MOBs is that the cash flows should be relatively stable due to higher renewal rates. During 2008, renewals of expiring leases in this portfolio exceeded 80%.", "Construction on our three medical office buildings under development remains on schedule with strong pre-leasing in place currently between 65% and 88 %.", "Activity to lease the remaining space has been positive, so we do expect these to be successful projects. We remain committed to being a leader in the MOB space. At the end of 2008, we were doing business with six quality national and regional MOB developers, including five of the top 20 firms in the nation. We believe these MOB investments and relationships will create value for our shareholder. They advanced our strategic plan in a disciplined way and position us to expand this segment of our business rapidly when conditions are right.", "On the disposition front, we sold 12 healthcare and senior housing assets in 2008 for $132 million an achieved a gain of $47 million. We continued this effort in 2009 by selling four private pay senior housing assets for $59 million and we expect to sell a hospital this quarter for $35 million, again all for a gain on sale. Kudos to our asset management team for being a profit center and managing these sales to successful completion in a difficult market.", "Proceeds from our asset disposition were used to pay down our debt and further strengthen our balance sheet. We are not expecting any additional material dispositions in 2009.", "Here is how, we are thinking about the full-year of 2009. Ventas has a great balance sheet, excellent liquidity, highly productive, high-quality diversified assets with strong demand drivers and constrained new supply. Access to multiple debt markets, a quality pool of tenant managers with scale and a management team that is stress tested. As such, we expect to manage through the current environment in excellent happy and to remain a profitable, cash flowing firm.", "Our 2009 guidance is $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share. At midpoint of this guidance range, represents our pro forma fourth quarter 2008 annualized FFO of $2.60 per share and assumes that Sunrise NOI is between $110 million and $125 million in 2009. We also assume that we will complete $200 million of fixed rate financing during the year to pre-fund 2010 debt maturity.", "Our balance sheet strength and liquidity should enable to us to make opportunistic acquisitions when conditions are right. However, we have not included any acquisition accretion in our guidance, consistent with our past practice and due to the uncertainty about timing and size of any investment opportunity.", "In any event, our first priority during 2009 will be to remain respectful of the severe conditions in the debt market and not reach for earnings at the risk of our balance sheet. We intend to take a very conservative approach to maintaining financial strength and flexibility during the year.", "We understood the credit crisis early in mid-2007 and managed our firm aggressively to stay strong for the benefit of our shareholders. We will continue that approach in 2009. The good news is that so far this year, the unsecured bond market has improved significantly, although it is still light years away from the favorable conditions for issuers that existed in 2007. Still, after the carnage we experienced in the fourth quarter, I would say that a functioning bond market is a good bond market, as far as REITs are concerned.", "Fannie and Freddie provide an additional important source of capital for Ventas and the GSEs continue to lend to the senior housing industry. We intend to use our large, high-quality portfolio of stable performing senior housing assets to obtain attractively priced long-term debt capital to meet our 2009 and pre-fund our 2010 debt maturity.", "The bank market is the most constrained at the moment. Although we expect continued efforts by policy makers, we will improve lending conditions. We believe we will enjoy success in extending our line of credit beyond its current mid-2010 maturity. On the asset side, we remain enthusiastic about the benefits and strengths of healthcare and senior housing real estate.", "We believe in the fundamentals of our business, which demonstrates excellent supply, demand characteristics; and there is no other segment of real estate that offers the long-term investment opportunities available in healthcare real estate due to the existing size of the market at about $700 billion and its projected growth to 20% of GDP.", "For the nursing home and hospital assets we own, which generate 50 % on our EBITDA, our tenants and borrowers should enjoy stable to positive Medicare reimbursement through 2010.", "Medicare rates for sniffs increased in the fourth quarter 2008 by 3.4 %; and they increased about 2.5 % for our LTACH as well. Med Tech has proposed flat to increased Medicare rates for fiscal year 2010. Additionally, state Medicaid programs should benefit from funding contained in the Stimulus Plan, which will in turn support hospitals and nursing home care providers. So, we have good visibility on stable to increased Medicare and Medicaid rates for our nursing home and long-term acute care hospital assets through the end of 2010.", "Our Sunrise communities are excellent real estate assets in prime locations. While severe economic circumstances are challenging near-term performance, we believe that when the economy strengthens these Class A buildings should be a growth engine for Ventas.", "In, sum as a company, we are in a great position, we remain quite profitable, we intend to stay strong and we are ready to drive growth when the time is right. In the meantime, we are happy to reward our shareholders with an all cash dividend. After Rick reports on the details of our year and quarter-end, we will be happy to answer your questions.", "Richard Schweinhart", "Thank you, Debbie. Normalized FFO per diluted for 2008 was $2.74 up 2% from 2007 $2.69. Normalized FFO for 2008 increased 16 % or $383 million from $331 million. Triple-net lease revenues grew to $460 million from $451 million primarily due to contractual escalations. Sunrise NOI was $138.8 million in 2008, compared to a partial year in 2007 of $90.1 million.", "Medical office building NOI grew due to acquisitions and was $17.3 million in 2008, compared to $7 million in 2007. Interest expense increased to $203 million from $193 million in 2007, due to 2007 only containing a partial year of the Sunrise REIT acquisition offset by $400 million of debt repayments in 2008. G&A increased to $40.7 million in 2008 or approximately 4.4 % of revenue down from 4.8 % of revenue in 2007.", "Weighted-average shares outstanding increased to $140 million from $123 million in 2007, due to our 2007 and 2008 equity offerings. Fourth quarter 2008 normalized FFO per diluted share was $0.66 stable with $0.66 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and down from $0.69 in the third quarter of 2008.", "Triple-net lease revenues grew sequentially due to contractual escalations. Sunrise NOI was $32.2 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $33.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $35.2 million in the third quarter of 2008.", "Medical office building NOI grew steadily from acquisitions and was $5.3 million in fourth quarter, compared to $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2008.", "Interest expense decreased from both the fourth quarter of last year and the third quarter this year due to debt repayments. G&A was pretty much flat in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2008. The share account increased due to our August equity offering. Fourth quarter FAD per diluted share was $0.61 compared to $0.60 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and $0.64 in the third quarter of 2008.", "Normalized FFO this quarter totaled $95 million, compared to $87.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year and $97.2 million in the third quarter of this year. Normalized FFO and earnings are reported after deducting minority interest. Normalized FFO decreased $2 million from the third quarter principally due to the NOI decrease in the Sunrise managed portfolio.", "Our fourth quarter effective interest rate of 6.2 % improved from 6.7 % in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 6.5% in the third quarter of 2008, due to debt repayments and greater use of our LIBOR plus 75 debt revolver. At December 31, 2008, we had $177 million of cash and $300 million outstanding on our 850 revolving credit agreement with unused capacity of $546 million. We currently have net liquidity under the revolver of $774 million. Our debt-to-total capitalization is excellent at 40 % at year-end and our net debt to pro forma EBITDA is 4.7 times.", "Beginning in 2009, as required by U.S. GAAP under APB 14-1, the company will recognize additional interest expense based on the company\u2019s non-convertible debt borrowing rate on its $230 million, 3 7/8 convertible debt bond issuance. The non-cash interest expense will decrease 2009 FFO by approximately $4 million or $0.03 per share.", "We are initiating guidance for 2009 to between $2.55 and $2.65. The midpoint of this guidance range is $2.60 per share, which is derived by taking our $0.66 reported in the fourth quarter FFO and proforming $0.01 quarterly dilution for the impact of the new convertible securities accounting rules that take effect in 2009.", "This makes a $0.65 run rate fourth quarter times four for $2.66 annualized. Our key assumptions are; the total Sunrise NOI from our 79 assets ranges from a $110 to $125 million constant foreign exchange rates, all of our tenants continued to pay rent, we borrow a couple $100 million of fixed rate financing and G&A will be flat with the fourth quarter annualized.", "Our guidance does not include material unannounced acquisition or divestiture activity or to about liquidity. We have included additional debt maturity tables and debt covenant reporting and both our supplemental data and our website. Excluding normal amortization payments, 2009 maturities are at $118 million and 2010 maturities excluding the revolver total of $289 million.", "To recap, we have focused on our balance sheet, which is strong. We have excellent liquidity, our fourth quarter normalized FFO per share was stable and we look forward to continued stability in the results for 2009.", "Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman - Citigroup.", "David Toti - Citigroup", "First question relative to some of recent dispositions that was pretty widespread in implied cap rates. Can you provide some color as to that range?", "Debra Cafaro", "Which dispositions are you referring to so I can be specific?", "David Toti - Citigroup", "The December dispositions and the January dispositions.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, we can definitely do that. The December dispositions were at about a 6.7 cap on rent and those were a negotiated transaction and I think very favorable pricing. On the January transaction and sale that was about 8.5 % cap. That was pursuant to a preexisting tenant purchase option that within a portfolio we acquired from elder trust back in \u201803-\u201904.", "David Toti - Citigroup", "Okay. Thanks and then just moving over to the MOB space. It is still a pretty small percentage of NOI, but you seem to have fairly aggressive longer-term strategy. Can you frame out some of your objectives for that platform relative to size and whether or not you have preference for acquisition versus development growth?", "Raymond Lewis", "David. This is Ray Lewis. I think we have said overtime that we think our exposure to medical office space is underrepresented in our portfolio and I think overtime we\u2019d like to see that become more like 10% of our run rate revenues. We\u2019ll probably focus more on acquisitions versus development. We\u2019ll probably use development as a way to enhance our yields. But our primary focus will be on acquisitions as and when the market conditions are right from a capital raising and yield perspective, we\u2019ll continue to grow that space.", "David Toti - Citigroup", "Thank you and just one last question. Is there any update on the lawsuit against HCP?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. That lawsuit is scheduled currently for a jury trial in the western district of Kentucky in August of this year.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "Can you talk about just from what your underlying assumptions are in the $110 million to $125 million expectation for Sunrise NOI in \u201809? Just talk about occupancy, margins underlying it.", "Debra Cafaro ", "Yes, great I\u2019ll turn that over to my partner, Ray.", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes, so I think if you look at the fourth quarter run rate $32 million times 4 year at about $128 million. If you assume sort of flat revenues and then maybe 2% or so expense growth that will get you sort of to the upper end of the range. I think, as we look out next year visibility in the general economy, I think is pretty difficult to garner.", "So, we think NOI will likely run a little lower in the first half of the year due to normal seasonal softness and the continued economic challenges. We are hoping that it will recover in the second half and improve, but it may not. So, on the downside, we are assuming that occupancies average about a 150 basis points lower throughout the year and rates drop by about 150 basis points on average during the year and if you couple that with the 2 % expense increase that would get you to the bottom end of the range, which we believe is conservative, but is something that the bottom end of what we would expect.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Next question is just on the balance sheet. You mentioned you don\u2019t plan any additional asset sales for the rest of the year. Should we take that to mean that you guys are comfortable with the sort of overall leverage position where you are today? And that we shouldn\u2019t see expect to see any additional de-levering from here?", "Debra Cafaro ", "Well, we are very comfortable with our leverage position. We\u2019ll continue to look at the portfolio for opportunistic dispositions, but we are not penciling any end beyond the announcement that we have. We have tremendous cash flow that we can use even after payment of the cash dividend to continue reducing our debt balances.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Do you have an estimate as to how much the de-levering activities of 2008 and then sort of the negative spread and the cost to carry on the cash that you are holding on your balance sheet has on your \u201809 guidance? Do you know how much that affected the numbers?", "Debra Cafaro ", "Not really, because we just started with the world as it is, but clearly the defensive step that you take to hold cash to make sure that you are reducing leverage and to potentially term out debt and push out maturities by taking on new fixed rate debt does have a diminishing impact, obviously on earnings growth and that\u2019s based into our new guidance range for 2009.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Just a final question, looks like you guys have some substantial rollovers coming in 2010. Just was wondering if you guys are starting to work on those rollovers already this year and if so, what your expectations are for rent?", "Debra Cafaro ", "Most of our rollovers are really Kindred 2010 renewal and it\u2019s about 100 and a handful of assets and when this occurred in 2008, Kindred renewed all of the assets and like the 2008 renewals, the 2010 renewals have really excellent cash flow growth. So, I mean they are very important to Kindred\u2019s business. So, we are looking forward to renewals on those.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "Maybe just to dissect a little bit the \u201809 guidance if I could, the $0.04 I guess there is $0.03 or $0.04 convertible notes charge may not have been in the consensus number of 282, but the other factor that may be beyond the Sunrise occupancy declines and all that sort of stuff is foreign exchange. You mentioned that you expect it to be sort of stable over the course of the year, but on a year-over-year basis, do you have an estimate of how much foreign exchange might have impacted your guidance relative to 2008?", "Debra Cafaro ", "Well, where we are starting is really the run rate for the fourth quarter adjusted for a penny a quarter in the convert accounting, which takes effect in 2009. So, that\u2019s the 260.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "Does the fourth quarter run rate compare to the previous quarters of 2008, I guess is the question?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I can tell you that the Canadian dollar weakened considerably in the fourth quarter versus the third, as you know you\u2019re with a Canadian firm; and the impact was over $1 million in the quarter on NOI relative to the Sunrise portfolio. So, it was significant. Now, we\u2019re assuming that fourth quarter 120, let\u2019s call it exchange rate persists in 2009, so changes will be embedded. Any changes up or down, are embedded essentially in the Sunrise range of NOI that we have provided, but, if it changes wildly from the 120, it obviously would have a bigger impact, but we\u2019re just assuming 120 throughout 2009.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. So there is a meaningful impact year-over-year on your guidance relative to 2008.", "Debra Cafaro", "Curios on the NOI, there is less impact on FFO because we borrow in Canadian dollars, maybe half of that.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "So, I think that had offset hedges it?", "Debra Cafaro", "No, it is hedged on the FFO side, but it is significant when you look at Sunrise NOI and things like ADR, because the Canadian portfolio is 15% to 20% of our total Sunrise portfolio, so it is significant.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Any update on Sunwest?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, that\u2019s going well. We had receivers appointed for the four assets and the assets are sort of break-even cash flow NOI. We expect the foreclosures to be completed in due course and our asset management team is working to maximize value on those.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "All right, so then you have a new management team in place? Or considered to take over the operation of the assets?", "Debra Cafaro", "Absolutely, we are ready to go.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "But you haven\u2019t disclosed who that is yet?", "Debra Cafaro", "No.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Do you have any, although I know it\u2019s not in your guidance, do you have any designs on doing more debt pre-purchases for a gain in 2009?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, as you know, we exclude those gains from FFO and if I told you, I\u2019d have to kill you. So, right now we\u2019re assuming that those stay outstanding.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "I may not mind.", "Debra Cafaro", "It is not so bad.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "Ray, for you, the 6.7, or 8.5 was a pre-purchase. So when we look at the 6.7% Cap rate on the asset sales in December, how would you say that compares to maybe a year-ago where those assets could have been sold at?", "Raymond Lewis", "Rich, I think looking at the market right now, it\u2019s pretty difficult to gauge what Cap rates ought to be. I think there is just not a lot of data and whatever data there is, is kind of noisy because they are either not ARMs length transactions or they are sort of distressed situations. So, I have a lot of hesitancy about taking a Data Point in this market and putting too much weight in it and saying that\u2019s what the market is. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Cap rates have increased over what they were a year-ago and they\u2019ve increased in an order of magnitude of 100 to 200 basis points. I would say at a minimum.", "Debra Cafaro", "I would say, Rich that in an ARMs length, transaction in this market, what you would see in senior housing is a little bit what you see in multi, which is that the existence of agency financing for the buyers is keeping cap rates in our sector in a much closer range to where they were a year or two ago than you are seeing in other real estate asset type because debt drives value in real estate and so to the extent that the agencies were able to provide Meredith, which bought the December assets with attractive financing at 6 % or lower, that 6.7 cap rate worked for both sides. So, it\u2019s a real advantage in term of doing net asset values for our sector. It\u2019s an advantage in term of owning a good, large senior housing portfolio.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "When did you start working on that portfolio sale?", "Debra Cafaro", "It was pretty recent. I mean it was in the late third and fourth quarter. It was not one of the ones that lingered for 12 months or something.", "Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, last question. Your counterpart HCN got added to the S&P 500 recently and you guys are neck-and-neck in terms of the size of the organization. With that in mind, do you have any sort of designs on the company being added to the S&P 500? Or is it sort of you just wait for the phone call?", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean, we have designs on being an excellent company that rewards our shareholders and that\u2019s our obsessive focus that has been true for the last ten years and will be true for the next decade. That said, I think it\u2019s great for our industry when the healthcare REIT\u2019s are recognized by the major indexes and included in the indexes and I would hope that we have the characteristics going forward that will allow the index committee to include Ventas as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "A couple things, in the quarter the G&A was bit higher than, I think we had been running and again, since it is built into your guidance. I was wondering, if I could get a little bit more color as to why it\u2019s kind of popped. I think on a percentage revenue basis it\u2019s closer to 3.8. I think we had it maybe a three earlier in the year. Are the litigation costs or cost of their transactions, or other things and it\u2019s all of that stuff really we should be assuming continues?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think you said, you should assume that it\u2019s a run rate of about 44 and it is a combination of factors; professional fees, stock-based comps, etc. and we do expect that to continue. I will tell everyone listening also, this hasn\u2019t seemed to have been coming up in other calls, but the accounting rules are changing in \u201809 also to acquire the expensing of yield cost that would have typically been capitalized. I think most people like us will exclude those from normalized FFO, but that is an accounting change that you should be aware of.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, but you\u2019re comfortable with that as a run rate?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes we are.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "Back to Sunrise, maybe it has been discussed already. There were a couple of things. One is in some of the NOI numbers you were sort of backing out the impact of currency exchange. On the average daily rate drop, thinking particularly the quarter-to-quarter change? Is that adjusted for currency or that just there is a little bit of currency baked in there and again, I was also wondering we have had a number of people now pre-announced where they are talking about flat occupancy and rate increases. What color you can give us and why Sunrise rates are declining while others may not be, even your own triple-net?", "Debra Cafaro", "Jerry, one point of clarification is, in giving the range, we\u2019re assuming the same exchange rate of 120, but we\u2019re not really excluding changes. That\u2019s sort of baked into the numbers, if there is variation, but our assumption, you have to make some assumptions and so the assumption is it is 120 and on the ADR that you\u2019re talking about in Sunrise, virtually all of the decline in the fourth quarter versus the third was because of foreign currency changes. That went from basically one-to-one to weakening Canadian dollar at 1.2. So, it\u2019s almost all should be diverse to that.", "Raymond Lewis", "In U.S. just a little more color on a U.S. was basically flat on ADR.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, I thing I had changes somewhat the picture, for the deterioration you get on the particular so metrics. So, even so though, you saw other companies talking about, I guess you probably year-over-year rate increases. Say, at best, your numbers maybe before flat. Any just more color? I mean the Sunrise reputation impacting it, do you think? Or is there anything else you can give us as to what the dynamics maybe are in that portfolio?", "Raymond Lewis", "No. I think there are a couple of things that are going on. I mean there\u2019s been some promotional pricing at the assets in order to move vacant units. I think that has sort of flattened out the rate. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s any different than other operators. I mean, I think as we look at what we have been doing in January, we have seen, on the turnover, they been able to push through 3% to 5% increases without a lot of resistance but, on the move ins, if you assume that they are going to be giving away a month free or whatever as a promotion, that\u2019s going to offset that annual increase on your existing residents and could in fact, decrease ADR slightly throughout the year.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "Just shifting gears, the drip numbers, in term of numbers of shares and stuff were down in the quarter, I think compared to what you had before, again you are projecting that out. So is there anything else going on with the drip and does that assumption seem reasonable to go forward with?", "Richard Schweinhart", "This is Rick Schweinhart. Nothing is really going on with it. It is running pretty flat.", "Debra Cafaro", "Jerry? We gave you your decimal, come on.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "The only other detail is, can you tell us what\u2019s through finally outstanding on the 8 and three quarters. You bought back some and you back bought of the other one.", "Debra Cafaro", "There is less than $50 million outstanding May 1, of \u201809 8 and three quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "Debbie, in your opening comments you were talking about the unsecured market, I mean you said that it is improved, but it is obviously still broken in a big way. Have you tried to gauge at all where your costs would be if you were to go in and raise unsecured today?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I would, I think take exception with the idea that it is terribly broken. I think it is expensive compared to where it was in 2007. But, compared for example, to the CMBS market, which is closed, I think having access to debt capital for real estate companies is a really good thing. We are very close to the debt guys. I would say that if we went to market on a five-year, we\u2019d probably be in the low 9s. And then a 10-year, we\u2019d be higher than that.", "Of course, it changes everyday. But, there has been $80 billion or so of investment grade issuance this year, which is a staggeringly good number. The fourth quarter, I mean it was just the fourth quarter it was horrible, it was carnage. I do think and I know that certainly investment grade REIT\u2019s and particularly those at the high BBB and A ratings, I do believe they could access the bond market. Yes, it would be expensive. But, you know what? Access to capital is a really good thing.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "I know you guys are being cautious, but obviously you are probably looking at some opportunities out there. I mean, have the yield and return hurdles that you are working through moved at all? I guess, either way, are you in the mid teens today? Are you in the 20s on things that you are looking at from an IRR perspective?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I would say we are being very judicious with capital. We have used our capital principally to improve our balance sheet and buyback bonds at a discount, our near-term maturities. And we also would use very selectively discreet amounts of capital to do good deals for Ventas that also improved the profile of important relationships. So, we think that would be kind of a win-win situation. On new investments, I would say, we are going to have a high bar and I\u2019ll let Ray address whether you\u2019d be looking at mid teens or what have you, but we are going to be very judicious.", "Raymond Lewis", "I really think it is a function of your cost-to-capital at the time that you are considering making the investment. I think as Debbie said, up until this point I think in the near-term, we are focused on continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet and have liquidity and as the market continues to improve its functioning on the debt side, which will lead to hopefully more stability on the equity side we\u2019ll get a better deed on what the cost of capital is and be able to price an accretive spread over it, so it\u2019s a moving target, unfortunately. I think it\u2019s right now, if we were to put capital out it would be opportunistic and by definition those would be higher returns.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes and we are definitely positioning the company to be able to take advantage of those opportunities when they arrive.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "The interest in other income lines this quarter; was the fall there primarily just due to the decline in rates in market or was there anything one-time in there last quarter?", "Debra Cafaro", "We had a non-recurring pickup of $1 million or something last quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya - UBS.", "Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 UBS", "Just a couple quick questions. Given the overall cautious view of the credit market and the economic backdrop going into 2009, how do you think about renewing the line of credit come mid \u201810, what rates could potentially go to? And is there any risk in regards to what the size of the line could look like going forward? And then again, just according to pre-fund or your plan of pre-funding some of the 2010 debt maturities, what do you kind of think your funding cost look like when you pre-fund versus what they look like currently?", "Debra Cafaro", "Those are important questions. We have enjoyed really good support from our lenders for the last ten years and we feel confident that we will be able to extend our line of credit before it matures in mid 2010. That said, we recognized that the banks are under pressure and maybe we\u2019ll loose a little capacity and certainly we\u2019ll have to increase pricing, but the revolver is really a short-term use of capital for working capital and acquisitions until we do long-term funding and so, we are happy to renew it and to pay market the rate in order to do so. If we pre-fund 2010 debt maturities, I would say that our cost of funding on a long-term, ten-year basis, is going to be higher than 7. If you look at the, if you are doing secured sort of Freddie and Fannie and if we, for whatever reason decided to tap the bond market, it would be at rates then obtaining in that market.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS", "Then with the \u201809 guidance, Sunrise NOI of 110 to 115, is that for the, just for your portion of the NOI? Or is that the entire thing?", "Debra Cafaro", "The range of 110 to 125 on Sunrise NOI is really the total community NOI, which is how we report it consistently", ".", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS", "Since the quarter has now passed, has your view in regards to the outlook for Brookdale or Sunrise changed in anyway versus the last earnings call?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think, consistently we think Brookdale is a good company that is going to weather this; they have a very cycle-tested management team. We have a lot of confidence in them. On the Sunrise spread, I think they are showing that they are working through their corporate balance sheet issues and their banks have been working with them and so, I think pretty much status quo view on Sunrise.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS", "One quick question for Ray, could you just give us a sense of what you are seeing in the market right now with cap rates across the different property types?", "Raymond Lewis", "As I said earlier, it\u2019s a very difficult market in which to define what cap rate should be. I think we\u2019ve seen a couple of transactions probably the most notable was the portfolio of Sunwest assets that was purchased by Lone Star and that\u2019s sort of a mixed bag. There is some nice stuff in there, there is some stuff that is probably not as attractive and that was pegged at a nine cap from the information that I have seen, but again, with the problems that Sunwest is having it is not really sort of a market transaction, as much as it is a liquidity need that\u2019s being filled there. There is just not enough data points in the market to be able to sort of state with confidence what things would transact at right now.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS", "If you were to guess on the hospital side and as well as on the sniff side, what would you say?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we are selling a hospital for seven to eight cap on rent this quarter. So that\u2019s about the best information that we can provide.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Could I take Tayo\u2019s question kind of one level higher, Ray? Realizing there is a kind of a posse of transactions out there. Is there any change that you can see in the type of assets that are kind of crossing your desk?", "Raymond Lewis", "When you say type?", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Hospitals versus senior housing versus nursing homes. Are there any, looking forward to when the capital markets loosen up in their transactions again, are there any asset classes that you think there is for sale of now than there were when the curtain came down?", "Raymond Lewis", "No. I haven\u2019t seen any sort of shift; I would say generally, if people aren\u2019t bringing assets to market at this moment in time unless they have to. I think they\u2019re probably are a few more senior housing assets just because of what Debbie described and that there is financing available through the agencies for those assets, but I think when the market shifts it\u2019s going to be driven by capital availability. I think we\u2019ll see pretty good opportunities across the board.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Fair enough and then one Sunrise question, if you X out the FOREX issues. Is there a difference in the performance that you are seeing in the U.S. and Canada? Is it any better north of the border than here?", "Raymond Lewis", "Well, I think the Canadian occupancies have been stronger than they have in the U.S. they certainly haven\u2019t experienced the same issues that we had here in terms of the housing market. I mean, certainly they are not insulated from the general economic conditions, but they didn\u2019t experience the same housing bubble. The occupancies have been strong up there, so yes, I think there is a little bit better performance on the top line in those communities.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Is pricing equal in both areas? Or is that strong in Canada, too?", "Raymond Lewis", "Well again, I think if you have got a better occupied community, you can push pricing a little bit more.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO.", "Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO", "Just on the bond DOI, I have a few questions. Just on the 2010 bonds. What\u2019s the outstanding on that one now, six and three quarters \u201810?", "Debra Cafaro", "About 135.", "Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO", "Okay and then in terms of timing for the bond deal that you might bring, you mentioned, is there any further ability to kind of just tell us how you\u2019re thinking about timing that?", "Debra Cafaro", "Maybe we can do a deal right here on the phone.", "Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO", "I\u2019ll take it a 12 %.", "Debra Cafaro", "I think that we didn\u2019t say we were going to do a bond deal. We are looking at indicative pricing. We are monitoring the market regularly with people who have good visibility on to the market and our whole job, since mid 2007 through 2008 and into 2009 is not to have to go to the market. I think we need to keep that objectives and so you will be our first call, when we\u2019re ready.", "Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO", "I have a couple more. In terms of Moody\u2019s, they seem to be lagging in high yields rating territory, high BB, but have you made any progress there? Do you think you have any insight on when they might actually follow pitch and S&P?", "Debra Cafaro", "We believe that we deserve three investment grade ratings. We\u2019re committed to that and we had continued our dialog with all the agencies to that point.", "Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO", "In terms of the use of secured debt, I thought I heard you mention something about secured debt potentially in the sort of 7% to 8 % range. As I think about your capital structure, are you still essentially thinking of an unsecured bond capital structure?", "Debra Cafaro", "Absolutely, it is consistent with our aspirations, our commitment to an investment grade balance sheet in our own business plan to overtime, reduce our reliance on secured debt. At this particular time in the market, it is a huge benefit including to our bondholders to have access to good, attractive, long-term fixed rate capital in modest amounts through the agencies. So, I think you\u2019ll see us continue overtime with our plan to reduce reliance on secured debt and maintain an unsecured bond profile.", "Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO", "One last question, just I guess more of a perhaps theoretical, but certainly seems like it could be practical, too. With bond yield, for example around 9% to 10 %, basically lately for unsecured bonds, that would imply like the cost of equity has to be back of the blond so sort of, is it nine to ten on the bonds. Your cost of equity is north of nine to ten into the double-digits?", "Debra Cafaro", "I can\u2019t disagree with that logic.", "Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO", "So, therefore given that and given your cost of debt doesn\u2019t really get the tax shield benefit. If you think of weighted-average cost of capital it can\u2019t be less than 9 % and therefore I\u2019m trying to reconcile that with cap rates under 7 %. How do you kind of think about that in terms of valuing assets with a cap rate of 6.5% or 7%?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think again. It goes exactly to what we talked about is that we\u2019re seeing some buyers in senior housing business paying cap rates of 6.5% to 9 %, let\u2019s call it. That\u2019s being driven by access to let\u2019s say 6 % to 7 % agency financing and that is relatively, those numbers work. Another asset type in real estate, I think you would not see the same low cap rate, exactly because you cannot obtain good debt capital to acquire those assets.", "Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO", "As you look at your company, if you were to buy an asset.", "Debra Cafaro", "I didn\u2019t say we were buying assets at that cap rate. Is that be said the office is.", "Mark Afrasiabi - PIMCO", "No, I hear you on that just going forward. If you were to you\u2019re buying asset given your bond yields and your cost of equity, like we went through the math. Would it make sense to do a deal at a cap rate like less than 9 %? Is this just you\u2019re not really like mark-to-market, you are sort of M&A, internal M&A, acquisitions to your current capital structure on mark-to-market?", "Debra Cafaro", "We care deeply about your cost of capital as it relates to our acquisition yields and what we just talked about in terms of what the hurdle would be for investments in this current environment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Sekino - Barclays Capital.", "Brian Sekino - Barclays Capital", "Most my questions have been answered, but one last question here. It looks like in your lease-up portfolio; the occupancy increased substantially despite moving what I presume is the higher occupancy facility to the stabilized portfolio. Can you kind of discus what the dynamics in those markets were, were those two remaining lease-up facilities there?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, absolutely. We have two lease-up assets as you said. Indeed, occupancy increased sequentially by 550 basis points, which is strong. One of those assets is in Canada. It\u2019s a really kind of four seasons-quality, large independent living community and occupancy there rose dramatically in the quarter. It is in earlier stages of lease up so, that\u2019s why I think you are seeing a bigger move there, both because the building is bigger and it\u2019s at an earlier stage so it moves the needle more.", "Brian Sekino - Barclays Capital", "Do you have any expectations for when the lease-up for both of those will be complete?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we just view it as a trend. I mean --", "Raymond Lewis", "Well, I think the only asset we\u2019ll have in lease up for most of next year will be the Canadian assets, the Steele\u2019s asset and so, and that we\u2019ll continue to lease-up through the balance of this year and into the next year.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I think we had originally said stabilization in Steele\u2019s was 2010, 2011 something like that. It\u2019s a very large asset.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors.", "Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors", "First question about MOB\u2019s I understand that on the whole demand for medical office buildings is more elastic than other property type, but what about the pace of lease-up for recently developed or un-stabilized assets? Does the slow lease-up of Ventas is un-stabilized properties reflect that sensitivity?", "Debra Cafaro", "I didn\u2019t understand exactly the question.", "Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors", "Well, I guess I noticed that the MOB in lease-up, the two MOB\u2019s in lease up have been have not made much lease up progress over the past year and I was wondering if you would attribute that to more generally to lease up of MOB\u2019s in this economy or is that the particular assets?", "Debra Cafaro", "There is one particular asset in that that has definitely not met our lease-up expectation. On the three MOB\u2019s that we have in development, those were substantially pre-leased. We\u2019ve got 65% to 88% pre-leasing activity there and good activity to drive those to a successful outcome. So, I would say that there is no part of real estate or business generally, that\u2019s immune from these powerful negative trends we have in the economy, but I would say that the lease-up assets that we have, that you are referring to, it\u2019s really more just one specific asset that hasn\u2019t met our lease-up expectations and on the three that we have ongoing, I mean those seem to be going relatively well.", "Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors", "Then on the Ameritas deal that was done, how much did the seller financing affect the price?", "Debra Cafaro", "Our financing as opposed to debt GSE financing?", "Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors", "Right, the $10 million loan that you made to Ameritas?", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean I think it affected it minimally. I think what was a much bigger driver was the level of proceeds and the 6% or lower GSE financing.", "Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors", "And then why did routine CapEx increase in the fourth quarter and what\u2019s your forecast for \u201809?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good question that Ray will talk about sort of how CapEx tends to trend during the year and why it was in the fourth quarter and what our expectations are for next year.", "Raymond Lewis", "I think there is a lot of projects that get started mid-year and accelerate in the fourth quarter of the year as people are finishing up their budgets and completing a lot of their CapEx projects for the year and heading into the next year, when we sort of reset the bar I think we are looking at $7 million to $7.5 million CapEx budget for our Sunrise portfolio next year.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I mean a lot of it\u2019s human nature and it\u2019s very consistent with what you see in real estate which is, if someone has the CapEx budget and they don\u2019t get around to spending it and they realize they might not keep it if they don\u2019t use it. They tend to use it in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I will now like to turn the call over to Debra Cafaro for closing remarks.", "Debra Cafaro", "All right Tanya. I want to thank everyone for joining our call. We really appreciate your interest in the company. We look forward to seeing our investors at the upcoming city conference and thanks again for dialing in.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

", "Debra Cafaro", "", "Thanks David and good morning to all of our share holders and participants and welcome to the Ventas 2010 first quarter earnings call. My Ventas colleagues and I are pleased to be joining you today from our Chicago office. Today, we will have a brief overview of the quarter followed by a portfolio performance review and investment outlook from Ray Lewis and a detailed discussed of financial results from Rich Schweinhart. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to answer your questions.", "Ventas first quarter results showed continued strong and improving financial results including and normalized FSO per share at $0.57 at the clinical growth rate of 1.6% in an ally for our Sunrise managed portfolio and reliable and increasing rent in our tripe net leased portfolio. Overall, our portfolio of high quality productive senior housing and house care assets enjoying 4.3% same store cash NOI growth in the quarter compared to last year. During the quarter, we were very pleased to share our growing cash flows with our stock holders by paying the cash dividends at annual rate at $2.14 per share. This represents a 4.4% increase from our 2009 dividend level and demonstrates the confidence we have in our company, our assets our assets and our process. We have also made continued significant progress on the credit rating and liquidity side. ", "We believe strongly and have stated consistently that reducing our cost of capital and managing risk. Our team measures of our ability to succeed on behalf of shareholders. Having three investment grade ratings and a recent positive outlook revision for S&P will help us achieve our goal of lower debt cost. They also serve as important indicator that we continue to manage the firm prudently on your behalf. Turning to our balance sheet, our unsecured line of credit stand at a $1 billion of committed capital, maturing in 2012. We have received a total of $410 million in additional commitment since we extended our line in March 2009 including over 200 million of additional commitments received from the beginning of this year. This liquidity condition creates excellent financial flexibility and provides a ready source of capital progress. We are sincerely delighted to have a great lineup of quality vendor, those long time Ventas supporters and new institutions backing us on with their participation in our line of credit.", "Finally, I want to emphasize the consistency and reliability of a tax growth in the health care and senior housing real estate phase. Throughout the recent and severe economic downturn, Ventas delivered positive same store underlying growth and FFO.

Or should we expect that going forward?", "", "Richard Schweinhart", "No, the margins have with respect to the senior housing assets in many ways, David, the margins have pretty consistently trended or arranged within the 30 to 33% range. I think we\u2019re pretty squarely in the middle of that range, from quarter-to-quarter you may get some fluctuation of margins depending upon expense, trend, seasonality et cetera but I wouldn't draw any particular conclusion from the margins in this quarter, I think they are within our normal tolerances.", "David Shamas - Citigroup", "Just turning to opportunities, can you just give a little bit color about what you are seeing in the market right now with respect to enterprise level or just operating transactions and what's your appetite right now for larger scale deals?", "Rick Schweinhart", "Sure, as I said in my opening remarks, the improving economic conditions are definitely going to leave the increase in transaction activity, we are seeing a pipeline building in both large and individual property transaction across all sectors, we are still very interested and continue to grow and diversify our company, we find good large transactions that are strategic fit for us, we are going to pursue them aggressively.", "David Shamas - Citigroup", "And you mentioned earlier that obviously it is going to get a lot more competitive with respect to the amount of potential buyers. So have your expectations for pricing shifted at all, as a result?", "Rick Schweinhart", "Yes, I think pricing is going to be competitive for transactions, I think we positioned the company well to compete in that situation, we have low cost to capital, access to multiple capital markets and undrawn revolver, a strong balance sheet with plenty of leverage capacity. So I do expect that the market is going to be competitive, but I think we are very well positioned to succeed.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.", "Craig Schmidt - Bank of America", "Just a little more clarity on the acquisition market. Do you feel like you are looking at as many deals as you hoped to be looking at? It is just that it is getting more competitive that might limit the amount of transactions you do? Or are private holders of healthcare real estate not really bringing their assets to sale?", "Rick Schweinhart", "So Craig I think that\u2019s an important point. The pipeline is active, it\u2019s full, I think transactions are still taking a little bit longer, there\u2019s a little bit of a price discovery exercise going on right now between buyers and sellers. There\u2019s also the effect of improving markets tend to cause sellers to delay their decisions.", "If you wait a little bit longer, you might get a little bit better deal and so I think what we are seeing is the beginning of the activity, but I don\u2019t really expect it to turn into transactions happening until perhaps later in the year, but we are definitely seeing a lot of inbound inquiries, we are working on stuff, we are going to preliminary pricing exercises and things that will I think lead to good transaction volume down the road.", "Craig Schmidt - Bank of America", "Where do you think the Sunrise portfolio might end occupancy by the end of this year?", "Rick Schweinhart", "I think what we\u2019ve said as we\u2019ve provided our guidance is that occupancy will be up slightly from where it ended last year.

Are you funding operating? Just a little more color?", "Debra Cafaro", "It\u2019s small mortgage, first mortgage debt that has really great, we believe great risk-adjusted return.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "And a couple we have already talked about sort of investment prospects. In terms of property types, I think of you guys as sort of focusing more on MOB as kind of being your first choice. If you have a sense of priorities, what kind of property types you focused on?", "Rick Schweinhart", "MOBs are focus of ours given the opening remarks. We like that sector a lot; we have an investment thesis there that is based on strong growth and demand for that real estate going forward. We really like seniors housing as well. We think the fundamentals in the market are excellent from a supply and demand perspective and we think that in a recovering economy, those assets are poised to do very well.", "We think there\u2019s going to be some good opportunities in skilled nursing as a number of the private equity firms who have made investments in that space over the last three to five years, look to get liquid.

Or just generally?", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "I think generally. But Sunrise may be the bulk of it.", "Ray Lewis", "Yeah I think that\u2019s right. The CapEx is typically built towards the end of year. You start the year with your budgets and projects get kicked off and then you stand and complete those projects as the year goes on, so I would expect that to increase through the balance of the year.", "Operator", "", "Our following question comes from Brian Sekino with Barclays Capital.", "Brian Sekino - Barclays Capital", "", "I just wanted to make sure my math is right. With your current guidance for the Sunrise portfolio, 128 to 138, with the results you did in the quarter, kind of at the mid-point, the remainder of the year, your NOI could be slightly down, is that correct?", "Rick Schweinhart", "", "So Brian I think, we provided you with that guidance in our call on February. As we look at the first quarter certainly squarely within the range, we are happy about that, you know the 128 to 138 we still feel very comfortable with that as the range and as the year plays out we would be happy to update that guidance as that becomes more clear what the balance of the year holds for us?", "Brian Sekino - Barclays Capital", "", "Okay. Then just shifting over to the acquisitions that you mentioned, I know someone mentioned about the RIDEA structure becoming more in play. Are you seeing competition increase also for buyers looking to do that kind of structure? And maybe that might be a way to keep pricing where you are willing to do it? Make acquisitions?", "Rick Schweinhart", "I think I follow your question. The RIDEA structure is not really a new structure, it\u2019s been in the market place for a long time. Private equity firms have been doing managed deals for a long period of time. So we are not really seeing any change I think in the market place in terms of either people offering more RIDEA structures, people asking for more RIDEA structures.", "I think it really goes back to whether or not the asset has more dynamic cash flows and if it does, maybe appropriate for the REIT to employ a RIDEA structure on that assets, so if it\u2019s an expansion or something where the cash flows are going up, you might want to do a RIDEA structure participate in that. And if it\u2019s a asset with more static cash flows where you are more likely to track CPI overtime then it\u2019s probably more suitable for a triple net lease structure.", "Debra Cafaro", "I am going to compliment my colleagues here. And we really have a lot of continuity with excellent members of our senior management team who have tremendous field structuring capabilities. I mean that includes our Head of Tax, Brian Wood and we have a lot of proprietary capital and deal structuring experience that really allows us to be very competitive in all kinds of situations because we are really able and willing to do the work to figure out the structure that that works for a seller.

If you annualize the first quarter NOI, you get something like $135 million or so of NOI. And you mentioned I think previously, that 1Q is a seasonally low quarter, you are getting some lease up and steals, is it sort of, are we thinking about this right? Are you really heading toward the top end of that range?", "Rick Schweinhart", "I guess, I can\u2019t really answer that any differently, Karin. Like I said we are a month or two into having just provided that guidance, the portfolio is performing well. We\u2019re happy with that and as the year continues to play out then we\u2019ll be happy to update the guidance.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc", "The next question was just on lease term fees, you mentioned in the press release you are expecting some associated with the asset sales you are in the process of. How much will they be in and is that include in your FFO guidance?", "Debra Cafaro", "It is as it always has been as we have sold assets it is a de minimis amount Karin, a couple of hundred thousand.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc", "Okay. Just final question is for you Deb, how much time would you say you\u2019re spending these days on the General Growth Board?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, that\u2019s my second shift, when I grew up in Pittsburgh a lot of people worked two jobs.

And I was just wondering how much, you talked about liquidity, $1.1 billion or whatever, how much of that is really available to you before you have to raise equity to do something in order to keep your credit status?", "Debra Cafaro", "I am really glad you raised the investment grade rating because as you know we\u2019ve really been committed to moving up the credit curve. And we were really happy to get recognized for that at lower our cost to debt which at the end of the day it's really what it's all about because we want to use that to make more money for shareholders.", "So I don't believe that it reduces our flexibility at all. And I think we\u2019ve always managed the company to really be an investment grade quality company, I think we\u2019ve had really excellent balance sheet and risk management which we would expect to continue.", "And so I only see the rating agencies to doing any constraints on that, that are not goals that we set for ourselves, which is release and balance, growing tax growth and continually managing risk and that's what we always do and that we will continue to do.", "So if you look at what we\u2019ve said to all constituencies at overtime we would expect to manage the firm at about a five times EBITDA level we are about four times now.", "And then over time that could vary may be a turn plus or minus for short periods of time so if you look at that and at about $5 billion.

But every quarter and with every motion and you appeal and all that, you are whittling away at whatever you might get out of that. At what point does this whole process become almost too burdensome in that when you net all the costs associated with it, that it becomes not so much for shareholders?", "Debra Cafaro ", "Well we have always tried to make the best decisions that we can for shareholders and I would say that today our investment has certainly produced an exceptional return, assuming that we can maintain that. And now we are in the appeals process. And I would say the costs are de minimis but the bottom-line is that if we haven\u2019t verdict, a unanimous jury verdict for over a $100 million in our favor that secured by a letter of credit.

Or is that kind of like at the very top end, or beyond the top end of what you would expect for the year?", "Ray Lewis", "Yeah the first quarter of last year, Rich was probably the lowest quarter in terms of NOI since we have owned the portfolio so you obviously get a benefit of our growing off of a low base. So, no I wouldn\u2019t expect that to be sort of the implied growth rate going forward, but certainly the performance at the properties has been st6eadily improving since the second quarter of last year and that\u2019s encouraging.", "Debra Cafaro", "And I think if you look at our 2010 guidance range compared to resolve from last year and you can see what our expectations for this growth for this year making.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "And then last question kind of following on Karin\u2019s last question about time spend on the GGP board.

The last couple of years including in connection with the healthcare reform bill, the federal government has extended, I think $25 billion or more in FMAC payments which are mapping funds to the state Medicaid program. So, that\u2019s the policy that these are obviously feeling the impact of the recession and so there are differences so, those kind of balance out and we are seeing kind of relatively steady Medicaid rate and overtime what we have seen as Medicaid rates range from the annual increases of zero to, when I first got here rates was increasing by 9%. So, we typically assume Medicaid at sort of an inflationary level and it kind of goes up and down overtime and doesn\u2019t really affect out rents, because they are so well covered and we have credits that work at various points and time changes in reimbursement to compress or extend margin at our operators. But again that doesn\u2019t really affect our rent which continues to be secured and reliable.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co.", "So at this point that you don\u2019t have like any major concern of several states cutting Medicaid rates significantly that could impact the tenant that has major exposure to those states?", "Debra Cafaro", "Right we agree that we feel fine about it and I would tell you that that\u2019s one important reason that we had geographical diversification at that type of diversification.

My name is Alika [ph] and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will have a question-and-answer session at the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions).", "At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Smith. Please proceed.", "David Smith", "Good morning. And welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.", "These projections, predictions and statements are based on management's current beliefs as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events.

And good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas 2010 third quarter earnings call. My colleagues and I are pleased to join you today from our Chicago office.", "I'd like to address our recent acquisition activity and this quarter's excellent earnings. Ray Lewis will cover operations and investments. And after Rick Schweinhart reviews our financial results in detail we'll be happy to take your questions. Ventas has been very active since the beginning of the third quarter. We closed our Lillibridge acquisition, announced a mutually beneficial deal with Sunrise Senior Living, we agreed to acquire the real estate assets of Atria Senior Living Group and we made important organizational moves.", "First, we closed the acquisition of Lillibridge Healthcare Services, adding 96 medical office buildings to our portfolio and becoming the national leader in integrated medical office building ownership, development, property management and advisory work. Both the MOBs and the Lillibridge service businesses are performing well, slightly ahead of our expectations and the combination of our firms is complete. We are enjoying our new relationship with Todd Lillibridge and his organization and we look forward to building our businesses together.", "Second, we were very pleased to announce an attractive transaction with Sunrise Senior Living to purchase all of its real estate interest in our Sunrise managed high quality assisted living portfolio and amend our management contracts with Sunrise. Our collaboration with Sunrise and its management resulted in a multi-faceted transaction that benefits both companies and we are working together to close that deal in the coming weeks. We are really starting to see the benefits of the focused efforts of the Sunrise team and the quality of our Sunrise managed assets as our NOIs and occupancies in our Sunrise portfolio continue to improve.", "Third, we recently agreed to acquire the real estate assets of Atria Senior Living Group for $3.1 billion. This exciting and transformational investment will add 118 high quality private pay seniors housing assets to Ventas' portfolio and will make us the largest donor of seniors housing in the U.S. We are acquiring high quality assets in superior locations with excellent growth prospects.", "As structured, the transaction will increase the amount of Ventas NOI derived from private pay sources to fully two-thirds, improve our tenant operator diversification, expand our scale to over 700 assets and a $14 billion enterprise value and last, keep us in a strong and safe balance sheet position.", "Finally, Atria is a fantastic operator of seniors housing with a robust scalable infrastructure and an excellent team committed to high quality care for seniors. Atria will be owned by Lazard and the management team as an independent private company, following the closing. Supply demand fundamentals in the senior housing sector are extremely favorable and Ventas is well-positioned to enjoy the benefits of these powerful demographic trends through our ownership of over 35,000 units of independent and assisted living.", "Importantly, the best assets in the best markets are Sunrise and Atria assets, are in a management contract or RIDEA structure so the growth in these assets will flow directly to Ventas shareholders. We strongly believe that the Atria transaction will create value for Ventas stakeholders. It represents our sixth major acquisition since 2004 and advances our strategic vision of building an excellent, high performing enterprise composed of diverse and productive healthcare and senior living assets.", "Earlier this week, I was genuinely delighted to announce the promotion of my colleague, Ray Lewis to President of Ventas. Ray's promotion is well deserved and recognizes his many contributions to our success, his leadership and his commitment to our Firm. Ray will continue to supervise all of our investments and our asset management function for our soon to be $14 billion portfolio.", "Overall, we are very fortunate to have a dedicated group of professionals with a lot of continuity at Ventas. It is the combination of our cohesive team and our growing diverse asset base supported by powerful demographic trends that position Ventas for another decade of success and excellence.", "Moving to the quarter, we're very happy to report positive news on many fronts. We have excellent normalized FFO per share this quarter of $0.73, an increase of 11% over the prior year, improving occupancies and NOI in our Sunrise portfolio that Ray will discuss in greater detail.", "Year-over-year, same store NOI growth for our whole portfolio of 5.6%. Cash flow from operations growth of 8%, compared to the 2009 same period. A great balance sheet with low leverage of 4.3 time\u2019s net debt to EBITDA and 26% debt to enterprise value. And, as a result of all of these factors, we are increasing our 2010 normalized FFO guidance to $2.84 to $2.86 per share. At the midpoint, this would equal 6.3% year-over-year per share growth.", "With that overview, I'd like to turn the call over to our newly appointed President, Ray Lewis.", "Ray Lewis", "Thanks, Debbie. Our diversified portfolio of roughly 600 properties experienced another quarter of strong performance. These high quality assets have Best-in-Class tenant operators and will be complemented by our recent announcement that we will acquire 118 senior housing properties from Atria, the country's fourth largest operator.", "Upon the closing of the Atria transaction, Ventas' portfolio will increase to over 700 assets in 44 states and two Canadian provinces and will be well diversified by tenants, operator, pay or source and asset class. Let me start by talking about the performance of our triple-net lease portfolio where Ventas receives approximately 69% of its NOI.", "As you'll recall, this portfolio provides stable and growing cash flows backed by pooled multi-facility master leases with credit and structural support from industry leading operators. During the second quarter of 2010, the most recent available, cash flow coverage was a strong 1.7 times. Occupancies in our triple-net seniors housing portfolio continue to trend positively during the second quarter, up 60 basis points sequentially and 270 basis points year-over-year.", "Moreover, same store cash flows to Ventas continued to grow steadily during the third quarter at 2.6% year-over-year, on track with our guidance at the beginning of the year. We continue to have minimal near term lease maturities with less than 1% of the portfolio rolling before 2013 and an average remaining lease term of approximately six years.", "Our tenant, Kindred which currently accounts for 36% of Ventas' NOI and is the largest provider of post acute care in the U.S., reported another great quarter of earnings with operating cash flows up 18% year-over-year and third quarter earnings per share at the top end of its corporate guidance. Additionally, Kindred should benefit from the better than expected final ruling for Medicare Part B therapy was that was released on Tuesday.", "Now let's turn to Ventas' operating portfolio which is comprised of 79 high end mansion style assisted living communities managed by Sunrise Senior Living and 153 medical office buildings managed by Lillibridge and other third party managers. This portfolio accounts for approximately 28% of Ventas' NOI and provided another quarter of strong performance.", "Starting with our Sunrise portfolio, which accounts for 19% of our NOI, the third quarter exhibited strong occupancy gains. Third quarter occupancy in our 78 stable assets was 89.5%, up 110 basis points over the second quarter. This positive trend and stabilized occupancy has continued into the fourth quarter as the portfolio is currently over 90%.", "As the economy has stabilized, these need driven assets are benefiting from strong industry fundamentals as there is limited new supply and a fast growing 85 plus population fueling demand. NOI for all 79 communities during the third quarter was $39 million which includes the receipt from Sunrise of a $2 million cash payment for prior period expense overruns.", "Excluding this payment, NOI was up 11% over the comparable 2009 period driven primarily by the previously mentioned occupancy gains as well as rate increases and increased margins. Quarter-over-quarter for our 78 stabilized communities margins, excluding the cash payment, increased 50 basis points to 33.3% in the third quarter.", "Ventas also has one lease-up asset located in Toronto known as Steeles which continues to march toward stabilization. Third quarter occupancy at this 229 unit independent living asset was stable at 86.7%, though our latest reports on spot occupancy show it trending above 90%. We continue to be pleased with the performance of this property.", "Finally, as previously announced, Ventas entered into an agreement with Sunrise to acquire the minority interests in 58 of the Sunrise communities for $186 million including $145 million of mortgages already on our balance sheet. This represents over a 10% capitalization rate on in place NOI.", "Upon closing, we will own 100% of all 79 Sunrise properties in our portfolio. We also negotiate improvements to our management agreements with Sunrise including a reduction in the Sunrise management fee to 3.5% of revenues for most of 2010 and 3.75% for 2011. After which, the base management fee will be 5% to 7% of revenues.", "Due to the strong performance and the positive occupancy trends we are seeing to date coupled with the favorable restructuring of our management contracts, we are increasing our 2010 NOI guidance for the Sunrise portfolio to $150 million to $154 million, compared to our prior guidance of $139 million to $145 million. At the midpoint, this equates to a year-over-year NOI growth of 16%.", "Excluding cash payments we have received from Sunrise and the expected pickup from a lower management fee, Ventas' year-over-year growth for this portfolio is still an impressive 8.5% at the midpoint of our guidance range which gives confidence to our expectations for the to be acquired Atria assets.", "Now let's turn to our medical office portfolio. The third quarter represented our first full quarter of ownership of Lillibridge which closed at the beginning of the quarter. Combined with Lillibridge, Ventas now owns and manages 153 medical office buildings across $8.6 million square feet and accounts for 9% of the company's NOI.", "Ventas' stable consolidated MOB portfolio of 57 assets continues to post strong occupancy, exceeding 94% and good margins exceeding 65%. Regarding our Lillibridge portfolio, third quarter results exceeded our underwriting projections. During last quarter's call we told you that we expected second half cash NOI to approximate $13.5 million to $14 million. Our latest projection is forecasting cash NOI to equal or slightly exceed $14 million. If achieved, this would equate to a cash yield of approximately 8% and a GAAP yield of over 9%.", "We are pleased with the initial performance of our Lillibridge MOB portfolio, along with the Ventas legacy portfolio. We intend to expand our medical office platform through the combination of Lillibridge's brand, experience, tenured professionals and long standing relationships with highly rated hospital systems along with Ventas' cost of capital, legacy partnerships and investment team.", "Turning to the acquisition environment, the big news at Ventas is our previously announced $3.1 billion agreement to acquire from Atria 118 senior housing properties that Atria will manage under long-term management agreements. Pro forma for the Atria acquisition, Ventas has announced $3.6 billion of acquisitions during 2010. Moreover, we have significantly advanced two key strategic objectives by creating the market leading fully integrated medical office ownership, management, leasing and development company and adding another top tier senior housing provider to our stable of Best-in-Class tenant operators.", "After the closing we will be doing business with four of the five top senior living operators in the US. With regard to market, deal flow has been steadily increasing during the quarter. The pipeline remains strong and we are continuing to see and consider a number of interesting opportunities across the healthcare real estate landscape. We have also announced the addition of John Cobb as our new Chief Investment Officer. Through his years as a senior executive at GE Healthcare Financial Services and Heller Financial, John has developed a deep role of decks of healthcare real estate contacts and an established track record of growing healthcare real estate financing businesses and leading teams of investment professionals. Moreover, John\u2019s recent experience running a senior housing company gives him a unique insight into the operation of Seniors\u2019 housing assets.", "So I am pleased with the progress we have made across the company this year and look forward to continuing that momentum into the fourth quarter and into next year. With that, I will turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart to discuss our financial results.", "Rick Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. The highlights of the third quarter are that on July 1st, we acquired Lillibridge Healthcare Services and their consolidated operating income was up for the last year\u2019s third quarter and also increased compared to the second quarter. Third quarter 2010 normalized FFO was $0.73 per diluted share, an increase of 10.6% compared to the third quarter of 2009 on 1% more shares outstanding.", "Additionally, we continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flows from operations. At September 30th, our cash balance was $34 million and we had $244 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility. Our credit stats remained excellent with net debt adjusted pro forma EBITDA at 4.3 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio is in excess of three times.", "Our September 30, 2010 debt-to-enterprise value is 26%. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 increased to $138 million, from $128 million for the comparable quarter last year, up 8%. We currently have approximately $30 million of cash and $240 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility.", "During the quarter we had three items of note. First, the debt activity. In July, with the acquisition of Lillibridge, we assumed $79 million of mortgage debt with an average 6.3% rate. We also assumed $29 million of debt which was paid one week after the acquisition. In August, we repaid $80 million of maturing mortgage debt with an interest rate of 7.75% [ph]. In September, we closed on a $200 million three year unsecured term loan with a 4% fixed interest rate.", "The proceeds were used to pay down the revolver. Second, normalized FFO includes a $2 million cash payment from Sunrise for the expense overages and third, merger related expenses and deal costs totaled $5.1 million in the quarter, primarily due to our July 1st acquisition of Lillibridge. After quarter end in October, we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of $71.7 million of our 6 5/8 senior notes due 2014 with a premium of $1.6 million.", "Details of the third quarter earnings are as follows. Normalized FFO was $115.4 million, or $0.73 per diluted share. Normalized FFO includes the previously mentioned $2 million cash payment from Sunrise and excludes the $6 million net expense consisting of merger related expenses, integration costs and deal costs which I mentioned before and non-cash income tax expense.", "Third quarter normalized FFO increased from last year\u2019s third quarter due to NOI increases in all three of our portfolios, triple net, Sunrise-managed and medical office buildings. Triple net lease revenues grew to $117.9 million, from $115.8 million last year, primarily due to contractual escalations. Sunrise managed NOI increased 17% to $39 million this quarter, from $33.4 million last year. Third quarter 2010 NOI includes the Sunrise $2 million cash payment as a reduction of expenses. Excluding the $2 million, Sunrise managed NOI increased 11%.", "In comparison, second quarter was $38.8 million, which included $3 million cash payment from Sunrise for expense overages. Due to the Lillibridge acquisition on July 1st, third quarter medical office building NOI grew from $5.8 million to $16.3 million including $1.4 million in unconsolidated joint ventures. Second quarter MOB NOI was $8.1 million.", "Consistent with our projections, Lillibridge contributed $6.5 million in EBITDA in the third quarter, inclusive of all Lillibridge G&A. Partly as a result of the Lillibridge combination, consolidated G&A in the third quarter including stock-based compensation, totaled $15.3 million, up from the $9.9 million in the second quarter. Interest expense was up at $45.5 million this quarter, compared to last quarter\u2019s $43.8 million, primarily due to the Lillibridge acquisition. Weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter at 157.9 million, increased 1% over third quarter of last year and remained fairly flat versus 157.4 million in the second.", "We are increasing our 2010 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance to $2.84 to $2.86 from $2.75 to $2.80. This reflects the positive trends in our Sunrise portfolio, our negotiated Sunrise management fee adjustment and our Lillibridge acquisition. This positive trend is indicative of the growing and reliable cash flows that our diversified high quality and productive portfolio of healthcare and senior housing continues to provide.", "Our key assumption for our 2010 normalized FFO per share guidance is that total Sunrise NOI for our 79 assets including the negotiated management fee adjustment ranges from $150 million to $154 million and consistent G&A for the fourth quarter. Our guidance does not include other material acquisitions or divestiture activity, deal costs, capital transactions, non-cash income tax expense or litigation expenses or proceeds.", "Operator, if you would, please open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Clinton Valleli with Citi. Please proceed.", "Clinton Valleli \u2013 Citi", "Hi, good morning, guys. I\u2019m here with Michael Bilerman. Just in terms of the Atria acquisition, you obviously see some additional upsides in those assets on the RIDEA structure. Of that about 160 seniors housing assets that you own under a triple net lease, do you see some additional long-term upside there and is there any possibility that over time you might want to move them into a RIDEA structure?", "Ray Lewis", "Hi, Clinton, this is Ray. You know, I think there is some additional upside in those assets through redevelopment and we\u2019ve had some discussions with our tenants about ways that we can work together to \u2013 for us to provide capital to them to redevelop some of those assets at Alzheimer\u2019s wings, expand, et cetera. And those are very attractive investments because you get to leverage all the fixed costs in the building and all the common area that exists. So, the returns tend to be pretty high as you can see from the materials we prepared for Atria.", "With respect to transitioning those assets to RIDEA structures, I don\u2019t think we have any current plans to do that. But I think if we talk with our operators and it made sense for both of us to do that, it\u2019s something we would consider.", "Clinton Valleli \u2013 Citi", "Okay. And then maybe just switching to Lillibridge, now that it\u2019s in the platform, can you give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the potential acquisition pipeline and maybe also any new development opportunities that are outside of the development pipeline?", "Ray Lewis", "Yeah, Todd and his team has been out in the market, telling the story to their important hospital relationships and it\u2019s being very well-received and as a consequence, we\u2019re seeing both an increase in acquisition opportunities and development opportunities coming into the pipeline. Development opportunities, as you probably know, are longer lead time transactions. We did announce the Baton Rouge transaction and we hope to follow with more on the heels of that. With respect to acquisitions, the pipeline is pretty strong. We\u2019re working on a number of things that we hope we\u2019ll be able to get done in the near term.", "Clinton Valleli \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rick Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Rick Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning everyone.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi, Rich.", "Rick Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "First question is very important. How is Walter doing?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, you mean Walter Breuning, the oldest man in the world?", "Rick Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Yes, yes.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, he actually recently had to go to the hospital, but we\u2019re all wishing him a speedy recovery. He\u2019s an amazing, wonderful guy.", "Rick Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "I am sure.", "Ray Lewis", "On the good news front, Rich, he\u2019s moved up on the list.", "Rick Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Okay. Question on deal flow, you guys obviously have been very active. Your leverage, post Atria, is up relative to maybe what your benchmark, your comfort level is but still reasonable. But, you know, considering your desire to be conservative with the balance sheet, do you think that you need to de-lever significantly before you can go out and do anything sizable? Or would you be willing to allow your debt-to-EBITDA to get into the 6 or 7 handle range?", "Debra Cafaro", "Rich, this is Debbie. As you know, we have over a long period of time managed the Company to both grow FFO per share, but also to maintain a lot of financial strength and flexibility. And we are committed to balancing those two objectives, which is how we believe we\u2019ve been able to create and preserve shareholder value. And so we\u2019re very comfortable with the pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA with the way we\u2019ve structured the Atria acquisition to be very balance sheet friendly and also \u2013 which is good for our debt holders, but also protects our equity holders as well from market risks. And we are very comfortable with where we'll be which is at about 5.6 times net debt-to-EBITDA on a pro forma basis at closing.", "And we will continue to manage the firm with those two objectives strongly in mind and I think that in doing so, we will continue to really benefit all of our stakeholders.", "Rick Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Did I read right that \u2013 I don't remember if it was Moody's or one of the other agencies, but that they maintained their rating on the presumption that your net debt would drop to five times in short order. Is that correct?", "Debra Cafaro", "Look, I mean, in terms of Ventas\u2019 ratings, it\u2019s first of all important to note that we do have three investment grade ratings. It\u2019s also important to note that our credit statistics really are at a level that even with the closing of Atria would merit a higher rating and we do intend to continue moving up the credit curve. Because Ventas\u2019 cash flows significantly, it\u2019s very easy for Ventas to what I would call de-lever organically or naturally and so there\u2019s no pressure on Ventas at any time to do anything other than close the transaction on the terms that we\u2019ve announced.", "Rick Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Last question is as you\u2019ve gone through the process with Atria and you have what some might call an overhang with the 85% of the stock being saleable at the close, have you gotten any sense from Lazard what they might do with those shares at this point?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean, thank you for answering that \u2013 and for asking that. As we talked about in the original Atria call, we are issuing a $350 billion of equity to Lazard at the closing. They really believe in Ventas and they believe in their own assets and so we have great alignment with them and I think their confidence in Ventas is being rewarded.", "We have a very carefully designed set of contractual arrangements between the two firms that are really designed to continue to support Ventas equity and while 85% of the shares are not technically locked up, they\u2019re a significant sort of time, place and manner governors around how those shares will be held and transferred. And I think most importantly, Lazard has a long history of numerous occasions of being invested in REITs in the past. They\u2019ve been excellent, responsible shareholders and have done what\u2019s really \u2013 what\u2019s in their interest, which is to really care about maximizing the value of that equity and we fully expect them to do the same here.", "Rick Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. One big one and a couple of little ones. Debbie, my sense was that you were about at your limit in terms of the percentage of NOI you wanted from", "senior housing operating assets and so that you would be unlikely to do more RIDEA transactions this size. Is that accurate?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, as you know, Jerry, we are constantly trying to calibrate a portfolio that is balanced in terms of asset type and structures, triple-net operating, et cetera and we believe that that kind of portfolio will deliver value in all kinds of environments and deliver reliable cash flows to shareholders and that's really what we're aiming for.", "And with the Atria transaction, we will have about a third of our portfolio in senior housing operating transactions. We do expect Ventas to continue to grow and evolve over time and we will continue to evaluate different transactions as they present themselves on their merits.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "So you could see yourself having more than a third of NOI from senior housing operating assets?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think, look, we're going to grow the business in numerous ways including medical office, as Ray has talked about and our bread and butter, triple-net lease structure and we will continue calibrating the portfolio in a way that we think continues diversification, balance and this non-correlated reliable cash flows going forward.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. In terms of \u2013 one of the things that's frustrating us I guess in terms of the numbers is you stopped providing maintenance CapEx and I'm trying to understand why and whether we can get some more color on sort of CapEx in general, maintenance CapEx.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. Sure. We don't want you to be frustrated, actually. We actually have a different disclosure that's on our supplemental now that really talks about all of our different CapEx buckets. In terms of the senior housing, really it's, as we've talked about, $1,250 to $1,500 per unit per year. And Ray can talk about the MOBs.", "Ray Lewis", "With respect to the MOBs, it's about a $1 a foot and that breaks down roughly $0.30 routine, $0.70 non-routine, plus or minus.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And as we think about Atria, any significant CapEx demands there in terms of repositioning their assets? I think there was some that you committed to like $85 million or so, but just a sense of how CapEx plays into that.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I'll take the first part of it and then Ray will take the second part of it. In the near term, the CapEx and the eight redevelopment assets is essentially baked into the purchase price and most of it will already have been\u2013 substantially all of it will already have been expended by the time that we close.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.", "Debra Cafaro", "On a longer term basis, I'll turn that over to Ray.", "Ray Lewis", "Well, I mean, I think the CapEx that we're projecting in that portfolio would be comparable to what we're spending in our Sunrise portfolio in that $1,250 to $1,500 per unit that Debbie described earlier.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. And over time there may be assets in exceptional locations where we will choose on a risk-adjusted basis to undertake redevelopment projects and commit capital where we think there will be a 15% to 20% return, as market conditions warrant. But that will all be discretionary after the closing.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Are we likely to see disclosure on the Atria portfolio separate from Sunrise or are we going to see them on a consolidated basis when you \u2013 after the deal closes?", "Debra Cafaro", "That's a great question. I think we're really focused on closing the transaction and I think that at that point in time we'll try to figure out the best way to give disclosure to investors and we actually welcome people's thoughts on what would be most helpful to them.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I opt for separate, if we can and my vote counts.", "Debra Cafaro", "I'm shocked. Jerry, I'm shocked.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And just last thing and I'll jump off. Any other just infrequent items, lease terminations views or anything else in the quarter, we didn't see any and I just wanted to make sure.", "Debra Cafaro", "No.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thanks. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you for joining. We appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Sekino with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Bryan Sekino \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi, good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Ray Lewis", "Hi, Bryan.", "Bryan Sekino \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Just a question on the senior housing operating portfolio. I know you had been cautioning about some margin pressure and I do see the costs came up on an absolute dollar. Would you say it was \u2013 the outperformance in the quarter was more on the top line or lower expenses?", "Ray Lewis", "I think the occupancy and the rate were the biggest drivers for sure and the occupancy certainly being the largest of the two. So, the expenses were within normal tolerances.", "Bryan Sekino \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And I'm not sure if you had given this out, but what was the management fee before the renegotiation with Sunrise?", "Debra Cafaro", "It's been running in the 5% to 5.25% range this year-to-date.", "Bryan Sekino \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "And by the \u2013 just so everyone knows, the reduction to 3.5% is not included in this quarter's numbers but is included in our forward guidance, assuming that the transaction closes. So that will be a \u2013 that will be seen in the fourth quarter.", "Bryan Sekino \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then just on the G&A side, I know you had given out some numbers last quarter for the Lillibridge acquisition. I think $15 million on annualized basis. The increase sequentially, here, of 5.5%, can you kind of call out anything on the increase over what would be normally in that $15 million?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean, if there's \u2013 there's just normal sort of Ventas G&A. It's nothing out of the ordinary.", "Bryan Sekino \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. So this is a good run rate going forward?", "Debra Cafaro", "We do think and our guidance assumes that there's a consistent run rate, yes.", "Bryan Sekino \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Great. And then, can you just give us a bit of an indication on how the occupancy trended year-over-year in the Lillibridge MOBs?", "Ray Lewis", "I would say that it's been pretty consistent, pretty flat.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah. And again, the owned group of assets that we have, the 57 consolidated were at 94.4%, I think percent occupancy which, again, I think our thesis in combining with Lillibridge is really kind of right assets, on-campus, right hospitals\u2013 single and double A hospital systems. So we feel good about that.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Bryan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan. Please proceed.", "Rob Mains \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hey, Rob.", "Rob Mains \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "I will follow-up to Jerry's question on CapEx. In the supplemental, the table on page 17, that $6.2 million number, is that the one to use?", "Debra Cafaro", "That's correct.", "Rob Mains \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Okay. And then I also want to clarify, the 3.5% management fee figure, you said that will be in the next \u2013 that's included in the full year guidance. Does that mean that there will be kind of a catch-up in the fourth quarter on that?", "Ray Lewis", "Yes.", "Rob Mains \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Okay. So if we're going to model that going to 3.75% in 2011 we need to adjust down a little bit, the NOI that you'll have in Q4?", "Ray Lewis", "No. The 3.75% in 2011 will be paid as we go through 2011.", "Rob Mains \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Right. I mean, if there's a catch-up in the fourth quarter this year, then I\u2026", "Ray Lewis", "Whole new run rate.", "Rob Mains \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Yes. You decrement it a little bit. Okay. And then last question on Sunrise and this resolves my last question. Clearly, it seems like things have \u2013 we're past the bottom there. I was looking back, I think the high water mark in occupancy since you've owned the portfolio is 93%. Do you happen to know where it's been historically and I assume there's no kind of structural and market impediments to returning to those levels eventually?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think the portfolio has been as high as 93%, \u2013 I know it's been at 93%. I think it's even been higher than that. Look, we have \u2013 these are great assets in great markets. They're really shining through. I think they're starting to shine through again, through the increases in occupancy and NOI that we're seeing and I \u2013 there's good reason to believe, as the economy grows and things return to some kind of normalcy, that these assets have every opportunity to get back to those levels over time. And the question is how quickly will that occur?", "Ray Lewis", "Rob, the high water mark in occupancy was in the third quarter of 2007 where we were at 93.3%. I would echo Debbie's comments and just point out further, we continue to invest capital in these buildings as we've described to maintain them, make sure that they're best-in-Class that they show well, they're well-located.", "Sunrise is really turning their attention and focusing on operations in a way that's showing results. So we like the trajectory of the portfolio.", "Rob Mains \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks for joining, Rob.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Hi, guys. Good morning, Debbie, Ray and the whole crew. Just two quick questions, one big one and one small one. Debbie, about a year ago I asked you the question about what your goals were over the next 12 months and what basically kept you up at night and you mentioned you wanted to build more of an MOB platform. I think we can put a check on that.", "And then you also mentioned to us that you wanted to build more potential sources of revenue generation. And I think with some of the deals you've done we can put a check on that. So I'm going to say, as you look into your crystal ball, I want to ask you that same question of over the next 12 months, what would you like to accomplish with the company and what keeps you up at up at night?", "Debra Cafaro", "Tayo, I'm really surprised at those answers because my normal answer on what we think about every day is our goal is to create extraordinary value for shareholders. So I guess I must have gone down one layer of the onion to identify the MOB and the revenue generators. And as we sit here today, you're right. We have made a lot of headway, checking those things off the box \u2013 off our list.", "I think right now, again, we're very focused on closing the Atria acquisition, closing the Sunrise acquisition and continuing to make sure we have the right team to make good decisions, to continue to grow the portfolio and to manage risk and that's what we always do and then in terms of staying up at night, honestly, we are so exhausted that nothing is keeping us up, so \u2013 So I hope that answers your question.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "That's helpful. And then second question on the MOB side of the equation, just talk a little bit just if you're seeing any real differentiation in regards to how different markets are performing, especially in regards to rent rolls, rental rates and tenant retention rates.", "Ray Lewis", "Yeah. Tayo, across the portfolio things are performing great, our stabilized occupancy is over 94% which relative to any of the other reported numbers looks pretty good. I think you have different performance in different markets. There are certainly some markets that are stronger than others.", "But what we've tried to do with our portfolio is align ourselves with the best healthcare systems in each market, buy on-campus real estate with those healthcare systems so that we're well-positioned to maintain those above market occupancies and are positioned for the future.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Can you make any generalization about the markets like East Coast is stronger than the West Coast or East Coast is stronger than the Southeast?", "Debra Cafaro", "We're going to ask Todd to take that one.", "Todd Lillibridge", "I think what we've seen is some of the major markets where as you could expect competition would be greater, so some of, again, the primary markets around the country if there's a potential for softening, that would be where it would come. But as Ray said, I think what's more important is really the health systems, the notion that the assets are on-campus", "We're dealing with diversified providers with a broad spectrum of service line. We're seeing a lot of growth in orthopedics and cardiovascular services and oncology and, having on-campus facilities that's where we're going to see and are seeing the growth in our portfolio.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you. Okay. I think there are no further questions so I want to thank everyone for joining us today and we, as always, sincerely appreciate everyone's support of Ventas.", "You can know that the management team here will continue focusing on creating value for all of our stakeholders. We're hoping to see everyone when we get together in New York later this month to celebrate the 50th anniversary of REITs and we hope you have a great weekend.

My name is Angela, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the conference over to your initial host for today, Mr. David Smith, Manager, Investor Relations & Capital Markets. Please proceed, sir.", "David Smith", "Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today, regarding its results for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2010. ", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

", "I'll now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks, David, and good morning, to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to Ventas' 2010 year-end earnings call. Today, I'd like to provide a brief recap of our 2010 activity and 2011 outlook, including our excellent fourth quarter results. After that, Ray Lewis will discuss our portfolio performance and investments; and Rich Schweinhart will provide detailed financial results for the year and quarter ended. After the remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. ", "Ventas had a highly successful 2010. We effectively used our cost of capital advantages to execute our strategic growth and diversification plan and announced nearly $4 billion of acquisition. Moreover, our diversified portfolio of over 600 assets continued its track record of strong operating performance. ", "Here are some of the highlights for Ventas of the year. We earned normalized FFO per share of $2.88, a year-over-year increase of 7.5% despite having 3% more shares outstanding in 2010. Total NOI grew 11% in the year. We delivered excellent shareholder return of 25.4% and our 10-year total shareholder return exceeds 1,500%. Our goal is to deliver consistent, superior total returns to shareholders derived from growth and cash flow and dividends from high-quality healthcare and senior housing assets, external growth and superior risk management. ", "We announced nearly $4 billion of acquisitions during the year, including three significant and highly strategic transactions I'd like to call out. First, our $381 million acquisition of Lillibridge Healthcare Services and 96 medical office buildings, which closed midyear, created the nation's leading fully integrated MOB and outpatient company. ", "Second, our $3.1 billion announced acquisition of 118 high-quality private pay senior living community in premier locations from Atria Senior Living will make Ventas the largest owner of seniors housing in the United States, having a $15 billion enterprise value when complete. That Atria acquisition will be our sixth consolidating entity level purchase since 2004. ", "And last but not least, we completed our very attractive, $186-million acquisition from Sunrise Senior Living of all of its real estate interest in our Sunrise communities in December. Ventas now owns 100% of all 79 of our best-in-class, need-driven assisted-living mansions managed by Sunrise. We achieved an attractive double-digit unlevered return and at the same time, provided capital to our partner, Sunrise, so it could expand its business and begin to re-establish itself as the leading global brand in seniors housing. ", "During the year, we also issued $600 million of unsecured debt at an average rate of 3.4%. This includes our highly successful inaugural investment-grade bond offering totaling $400 million, price to yield 3.23% in November, achieving the lowest five-year REIT bond coupon outstanding.  Our cash flow from operations increased 6% in 2010.  Same-store property NOI from our diversified portfolio of highly productive healthcare and senior housing assets also grew 6% in 2010. ", "We received an investment grade rating from Moody's early in the year and now maintained investment grade ratings on our corporate unsecured debt from all three nationally recognized rating agencies. We ended the year with excellent financial strength and flexibility with 26% debt-to-enterprise value and liquidity of $1 billion. ", "And importantly, we made positive changes and additions to our long tenured and cohesive management team, including the recent promotion of Ray Lewis to President; the addition of John Cobb as our Chief Investment Officer; and the combination with Todd Lillibridge, who is now leading our Medical Office Building business. So as you can see, the Ventas team was active on multiple fronts during 2010, all with a continuing objective of delivering superior risk-adjusted returns for years to come.", "We have also begun 2011 on a positive note, with the announcement today that our Board of Directors has approved a 7.5% increase in our dividends to an annualized level of $2.30 per share. This significant step up in our dividend continues our long-term track record of providing above-average dividend growth to our shareholders. We believe that a strong secured cash dividend is an important part of the total value proposition we offer to shareholders, and we are pleased to continue sharing our growing cash flows with you. ", "Turning to our guidance for 2011. Remember that we forecast earnings without the benefit of additional unannounced acquisitions. We expect our 2011 normalized FFO per share to range between $3.06 and $3.14 per share. At the midpoint, this would equal year-over-year normalized FFO per share growth of 7.5%. ", "We are excited and on track to complete our acquisition of the 118 high-quality Atria assets, which should occur in the first half of 2011. The assets will continue to be managed by Atria following the closing. Atria is currently the fourth largest operator of assisted-living in the United States with an experienced and highly focused management team, a robust reporting and regulatory infrastructure and a long record of providing premier care to over 13,000 seniors. ", "This deal, focused in major Metropolitan markets on the coast, capitalizes on the positive trends occurring in the senior housing industry. We believe the Atria assets will generate above-average growth, and our purchase price represents an attractive entry point of $230,000 per unit. We are also looking forward to growing with Atria, post closing. ", "When the Atria acquisition is completed, our highly productive portfolio with healthcare and senior housing assets will be diversified with no tenant or operator, accounting for more than 28% of our annualized NOI and a terrific balance between operating senior housing communities with above-average growth potential and secure growing rents from our triple-net leased assets.  We truly believe that our Sunrise and Atria communities should command a multi-family valuation because of their quality, their location and barrier to entry market and favorable supply demand fundamentals in senior housing. ", "We are very enthusiastic about our future and believe we are well positioned to achieve another decade of excellence.  Going forward, we intend to remain at the forefront of delivering returns to shareholders through superior internal growth, outstanding and value-creating external growth and rigorous risk management. ", "With that overview, I'd like to turn the call over to Ray Lewis.", "Raymond Lewis", "Thanks, Debbie. Ventas' diversified portfolio of over 600 high-quality, seniors housing, medical office and post-acute properties performed exceptionally well during 2010 and delivered same-store cash flow growth to Ventas of 6% over 2009. ", "Ventas' triple-net lease portfolio, which accounted for 67% of our annualized fourth quarter NOI, delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 2.7% for 2010 over 2009. Cash flow coverage for the third quarter of 2010, the latest available, were stable versus second quarter at a solid 1.7x. This portfolio of pooled, multi-facility Master Leases of senior housing, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals also enjoys credit and structural support. This portfolio provides Ventas with steady and reliable cash flow growth through contractual rent increases. ", "For 2011, we expect same-store cash flow growth in our triple-net portfolio to exceed 2.5%. Our largest tenant, Kindred, which currently accounts for 35% of Ventas' NOI, continues to solidify its position as the leading provider of post-acute care in the United States, with its announcement last week that it would acquire RehabCare Group for $1.3 billion.  Pro forma, the combined company will have a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion and annual revenues of over $6 billion. It will also be the nation's number one operator of long-term acute care hospitals, the number one operator of in-patient rehab facilities, the number one skilled nursing contract rehab provider and the number four operator of skilled nursing and rehab centers. The combined entity will also have a superior quality mix of 80%, deriving only 20% of its total revenues from Medicaid program and conservative leverage at 4.5x projected net debt to EBITDA. ", "Our pooled multi-facility, Master Leases with Kindred continue to have excellent cash flow coverage at 2x and provide Ventas with strong and reliable contractual cash flow growth. Kindred's announced transaction will further solidify the safety and reliability of these Kindred cash flows as Kindred increases its scale, access to capital and clinical expertise to thrive in an ever changing healthcare environment. ", "Ventas' senior housing operating portfolio, which totaled 22% of the company's fourth quarter annualized NOI, is comprised of 79 need-driven, high-quality, mansion-style assisted-living communities managed by Sunrise Senior Living. As you recall, in the third quarter, this portfolio experienced a 110 basis point sequential increase in occupancy, the largest sequential increase in occupancy since Ventas purchased the portfolio in 2007. These positive occupancy trends continued in the fourth quarter with stabilized occupancy up 60 basis points from 89.5% in the third quarter to 90.1% in the fourth quarter. ", "Ventas' Sunrise portfolio also continues to perform exceptionally well compared to industry statistics. Data from NYX showed that average seniors housing occupancy increased 10 basis points from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of 2010, while our Sunrise portfolio experienced 180 basis point increase in occupancy during the same period. We have hypothesized in the past that this high-quality portfolio located in high-barriered entry major Metropolitan markets was well-positioned to outperform in an economic recovery and it seems that 2010 has validated this thesis. ", "Our only Sunrise lease of asset, a 229-unit independent living community in Toronto, known as Steeles, continued its strong momentum as well during the fourth quarter. Average resident occupancy at Steeles improved to 95.4% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 870 basis points from the third quarter. We are pleased that we will be adding this asset to the stabilize pool for the first quarter of 2011. ", "These positive occupancy trends in the portfolio translated into exceptional NOI result for these 79 communities. 2010 NOI was $154.3 million, slightly better than the high end of our guidance range of $150 million to $154 million and equaling year-over-year NOI growth of 18%. Excluding the positive effects of $5 million in cash payments received by Ventas in 2010 for expense overages, NOI was up 14% compared to 2009. ", "Sunrise also continues to make significant progress towards re-establishing the company as the leading global brand of seniors housing, and we are pleased with their continued focus on the operations of our communities. The management team has also worked hard to put the company back on solid financial footing. I'm sure many of you saw the announcement in December of the new joint venture to purchase 29 assisted-living communities. This represents the first major investment in Sunrise asset by a new capital partner in several years and is a major milestone in Sunrise's road to financial recovery. ", "Turning to 2011 NOI guidance for our Sunrise communities, we expect the NOI to range between $152 million and $157 million, the midpoint of the range equals 3.5% growth over $149.3 million in core Sunrise results in 2010. This guidance assumes a rate of growth of about $4 per day in rate, an increase in average resident occupancy of approximately 140 basis points in stable margins. ", "Our portfolio of 158 medical office buildings, covering 8.8 million square feet in 20 states and the District of Columbia accounted for 9% of the company's annualized NOI. We added to our MOB portfolio in December, when we announced the acquisition of five Class A, on-campus MOBs affiliated with the A-rated ThedaCare health system located in Wisconsin. Importantly, this represented our first acquisition under the combined Ventas and Lillibridge umbrella, so the powerful combination of our two firms, Ventas' strong balance sheet, access to capital and investment team and Lillibridge's brand, experience and history with highly rated hospitals and health systems is resonating in the marketplace. ", "Focusing on the fourth quarter performance, our stabilized consolidated portfolio of 63 MOBs achieved NOI of $12.9 million, with occupancies approaching 95% and margins exceeding 66%. For all of 2010, we also continued to realize high tenant retention rates in the portfolio of 85%. ", "Our Lillibridge portfolio, which we acquired at the beginning of the third quarter delivered solid results, slightly exceeding our underwritten projections. Second half 2010 NOI represented an annualized yield on investment of more than 8.25%, and our EBITDA purchase multiple for the full business was under 14x. ", "In addition, we completed the integration of the Lillibridge platform during the third quarter. Todd Lillibridge and his team worked very hard to ensure a smooth transition, and they have been an excellent addition to the Ventas roster. In sum, we are quite pleased with the initial performance of this portfolio and the value of the Lillibridge platform. ", "For 2011, we expect our total MOB portfolio to provide stable performance. Our highly scalable platform should continue to provide attractive acquisition and development opportunities for Ventas, and we look forward to providing you with continued positive news in the quarters ahead. ", "Before I turn to the acquisitions environment, I'd like to spend a moment updating you on our acquisition of Atria, which is proceeding according to plan. When we announced the transaction, we said we expected Atria NOI to range between $186 million and $196 million, and we continue to expect that performance from the portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Atria communities continued to trend positively, with gains in both occupancy and rate, consistent with our expectations. ", "With respect to the investment environment, 2010 was a banner year for investments by the healthcare REIT. Many factors contributed to this record performance, including capital access and liquidity advantages for public REITs over private buyers, positive investment spread over our cost of capital and private equity funds, monetizing their healthcare assets to create liquidity for their investors. As we look forward into 2011, we see many of these trends continuing and perhaps even accelerating as private equity funds seek liquidity and operators continue to partner with REITs to access capital, drive consolidation and achieve scale.", "Across all of our property types, seniors housing, skilled nursing, and to a lesser extent, MOBs, there are a number of unaffiliated regional operators that we will be looking to align with REIT capital or sell to strategic buyers. Our sector-leading multiple and investment-grade balance sheet position us well to compete, and we expect to get our share of attractive investments in 2011. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Rich Schweinhart to discuss our financial results.", "Richard Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. The highlights of the fourth quarter are that we acquired Sunrise's non-controlling interest in 58 of our 79 senior housing communities for $41.5 million; called and repaid the remaining $72 million on our 6 5/8 senior notes due 2014; issued $400 million of new 3 1/8 five-year investment-grade senior notes; purchased five medical office buildings for approximately $37 million; sold one senior living community for $33 million, with a $19.8 million gain; collected $14 million on a mortgage note; repaid over $112 million of mortgages and consolidated operating income was up from last year's fourth quarter and also increased compared to the third. ", "We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flows from operations. At December 31, our cash balance was $22 million, and we had $40 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility. Our credit stats remained excellent with net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA at 4.2x and our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 3x.  Our December 31, 2010, debt-to-enterprise value is 26%. ", "Fourth quarter 2010 normalized FFO was $0.77 per diluted share, an increase of 15% compared to fourth quarter of 2009. Normalized FFO was $121.4 million compared to last year's fourth quarter of $104.8 million. Normalized FFO excludes merger-related expenses and deal cost, totaling $7.6 million in the quarter, a gain on the sale of a senior housing community of $19.8 million, the loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.2 million and non-cash income tax expense. ", "During the quarter, we modified our management agreements with respect to all 79 communities managed by Sunrise. The modifications included a reduction in the 2010 management fee to 3.5% for the period April 1 through December 31, 2010. The modification also limited certain shared cost charge to the communities. The total savings in the fourth quarter was $7.2 million, of which, $5 million is attributable to prior quarters in 2010. ", "Fourth quarter normalized FFO increased from last year's fourth quarter due to NOI increases in all three of our portfolios: Triple-net, Sunrise-managed and Medical Office Buildings. Triple-net Lease revenues grew to $118.2 million from $115.9 million last year, primarily due to contractual escalations.  Sunrise-managed NOI increased 28% to $42.6 million this quarter from $33.1 million last year. Excluding the management fee and shared cost adjustments that pertain to previous 2010 quarters, NOI increased 13% to $37.6 million. ", "Due to the Lillibridge acquisition on July 1 of this year, fourth quarter Medical Office Property group NOI grew to $18.5 million from $6.7 million last year, including $1.4 million in unconsolidated joint ventures. Sequentially, MOB NOI improved in the fourth quarter compared to $18.2 million in the third quarter. ", "Weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter at $158.2 million increased 1% over fourth quarter of last year and remained fairly flat versus $157.9 million in the third. Since year-end, we issued 5.6 million shares of common stock at $53.93 per share, raising $300 million.  ", "Full year 2010 normalized FFO was $2.88 per diluted share, an increase of 7.5% compared to 2009. Normalized FFO grew 11% to $453.5 million from $409 million in 2009. ", "Triple-net lease revenues grew to $470 million from $461 million last year, primarily due to contractual escalations. Sunrise-managed NOI increased 18% to $154 million this year from $131 million last year. Excluding $5 million in cash payments from Sunrise in the second and third quarters for our expense overages, Sunrise-managed NOI increased 14%. Due to the Lillibridge acquisition on July 1 of this year, Medical Office Properties group NOI grew to $53 million, including $3 million in unconsolidated joint ventures from $23 million last year.  Weighted average shares outstanding for the year at $157.7 million increased 3% over last year. ", "We are initiating our 2011 normalize FFO per diluted share guidance at $3.06 to $3.14. This reflects our Lillibridge acquisition, the Atria acquisition, the positive trends in our Sunrise portfolio and a 3.75% Sunrise management fee. ", "At the midpoint of our 2011 normalized FFO per share guidance we've achieved would represent 7.5% growth. This positive trend is indicative of the growing and reliable cash flows that our diversified, high quality and productive portfolio of healthcare and senior housing continues to provide. Our key assumptions for our 2011 normalized FFO per share guidance is that total Sunrise NOI for our 79 assets ranges from $152 million to $157 million. Our guidance includes the acquisition of Atria Senior Living, with an assumed closing date in the first half of 2011, but does not include other material acquisitions or divestiture activity, deal cost, capital transactions, losses on extinguishment of debt, FX gains and losses, non-cash market-to-market derivative income and expense, non-cash income tax expense or benefit or litigation expenses or proceeds.", "Operator, if you would, please open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "I'm here with Quentin Velleley. Debbie, I just want to go in terms of creating this high-quality diverse productive portfolio of healthcare, real estate assets. Post Atria, the portfolio by property types can be about 60% senior housing, about 21% skilled nursing, just over 10% hospitals, and the remaining the medical office, and about half is going to be triple-net lease and 40% will be senior housing. I guess as you think about the potential for transaction activity this year and into the future, where do you want to take that mix of both in terms of pipe and business model?", "Debra Cafaro", "I guess you've been listening with the whole diverse high-quality productive portfolios, senior housing and healthcare assets, because what we're trying to do in order to deliver total return, as you know, we want to deliver good consistent internal growth, powerful, external growth and then manage risk. And the diversification, really, is part of both of those sides to the equation. So you're right with all your statistics in terms of what we look like pro forma for Atria, we're very excited that 60% of our cash flows are going to be coming from high-end private pay seniors housing. At a good point, we believe in the economic recovery and the cycle. As we look forward, I think you will continue to see us grow, and when we look at diversification, we're looking by tenant operator, by geography, by revenue and payor source et cetera, and by operating model, i.e. triple-net lease versus higher growth management kind of deals. So I think you'll see us really invest across the spectrum. I think you'll see us continue to be willing to invest selectively, very selectively, in high-quality post-acute assets. But I think you'll see more of our activities on the seniors housing and medical office building front. And those will be on seniors housing, I think some combination of operating and triple-net lease.", "Raymond Lewis", "Michael this is Ray. I'd just add to Debbie's comments by saying, I think, right now, in the marketplace, we're seeing the most activity in the seniors housing space and to a little bit lesser extent in the skilled nursing area. I think as we look at sort of trends in the medical office building sector and the consolidation that's really starting to ramp up on the hospital side, we could start to see that business accelerate as the year plays out. So I think our three asset classes should provide us with opportunities in sufficient quantity to be very active.", "Debra Cafaro", "The truth is that in senior housing and in post-acute and in medial office, there's a tremendous dynamism that's going on from integration, consolidation among operators and providers, changing investment rules with REIT. And this is probably the most dynamic sector, really, within real estate, which is exciting for us, because I think it creates opportunities to expand and to create value for stakeholders.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "You talked about a little bit about -- you mentioned Kindred a little bit on the call. And I guess, if you look at the hospital portfolio and you look at the skilled part, both of the occupancies have been trending down, Covell just gotten a little bit weaker, not materially but probably on the other end of where you'd like to see it. And as you think about 2013, which is the next big renewal that they have, and I know there's still a year for them to provide that notice. But I guess, how are those discussions going? And how do you think about the portfolio on that side?", "Debra Cafaro", "One thing I would say is that Kindred is really continuing to improve, and as we've predicted, I think, be really a winner in the sort of post-acute phase, as we look forward towards healthcare reform and just changing landscape as it always is in healthcare. So we're very happy for them, and we're happy for us as well. We have really the best structure with our pooled multi-facility Master Leases, the best core property level EBITDAR coverage in the nursing home and hospital sector. With the 4% management fee, I think, it's probably about 1.6x EBITDAR coverage. We've got a great quality mix with 70% of the revenue at the asset level coming from Medicare and private pay. So we really like this portfolio. I think as rents go up, and in the past the trailing 12 months we've seen sort of cost containment measures, and so that accounts for some of the modest erosion in coverages. I think, you know that our coverages are always a quarter lagging, because that's when we get the information. And Kindred and the other operators have had a tremendous fourth quarter lead by RUGs-IV among other things. And so I think you'll see that really improve as we incorporate property level fourth quarter results, when we talk to you in the first quarter. So we feel very good about that. I think, Kindred is continuing to invest a tremendous amount of CapEx in the building. We're in frequent communication with them on doing more things together. And so I feel good that because the assets are very profitable to Kindred that we're in a great spot as we look forward with them.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc", "It's Quentin here. Just a quick question on Sunrise. If you look at the fourth quarter annualized NOI out of Sunrise's, I think, it's about $155 million, which would be at the midpoint of the guidance range that you gave for 2011, and if you think about increasing rates and increasing occupancy and then a full year of the lower management fee, I would've thought that the guidance range would be higher than that. So I'm just wondering what other drivers there are there that we might be missing.", "Debra Cafaro", "I think, one thing that you may be missing is -- and we're trying to point it out, but it's a little bit complicated. We redid our management contract with Sunrise in December, and there was a retroactive expense reduction in the fourth quarter. And Rick talked about a little bit, that the fourth quarter benefited from about $5 million of reduction in expenses that, really, is in 2010 but for the previous period, and so what I would do if I were you in terms of looking at annualizing the fourth, I would take that out of -- I'd take that out and then annualize. Look, as we've said, if you take the -- also, this is even more confusing, but still important. We also got $5 million cash payments in the second and third quarters of 2010 for prior years. And if you take that out as the full year of 2010, the midpoint of our guidance for 2011 is 3.5%. So if we end up in the  top half of our 2011 guidance, I think, you're looking at 3.5% to 5%-ish growth in NOI, which we think is good.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel, Nicholas.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Debbie, just to maybe follow-up on that same item. The margin, which was $37.5, all of those extra payments are basically in as expenses and the adjustments, so the actual margin is lower than as well?", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "In terms of just actual margin performance on the portfolio, sort of net of all that stuff, and I haven't done all those calculation today. Are we seeing any issues on the core expense side, separate from all of your kind of adjustments with them?", "Raymond Lewis", "I think when you back out the things that Debbie talked about, expenses have been pretty consistent and pretty stable, nothing unusual.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And can we get anything more on timing of Atria other than just first half, because, obviously, it makes a big difference one month or the other. I'm assuming there's some licensure issues, and that's a thing you can't fully control. But was it closer to the beginning of the second quarter, late second quarter, any guidance you can give us?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think, that, again, as you mentioned, there are no issues, but we're -- and it's proceeding according to plan, but we don't control the state licensing authorities or their timetable. And so we're just dependent on that, and we're pushing to close as early as possible and working at every day, every week with Atria. We feel confident about the first half, but I think, we'll just have to stick with that until we get a little bit more visibility from the licensing authorities, Jerry.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And in your guidance, is that a big variable, sort of in the range? What do you assume mid-second quarter?", "Debra Cafaro", "It does affect it. A month, does affect it $0.01 or so either way, so that's part of the explanation of the range.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "On senior housing, anything in terms of the proposed changes to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, that might change the availability capital and move cap rates and sort of similarly a Medicare, Medicaid, and anything you're thinking about. How do you think about that risk, as we go forward?", "Debra Cafaro", "Jerry, we bond over being policy wonk.  But I would say on Freddie and Fannie, not clear still what is going to happen there. I think, they have committed to continuing to support multi-family, of which senior housing is a part. I would say, we support the presence of agencies within our sector. There are pros and cons, of course, to the agencies perhaps pulling back from the business. On the one hand, you'd have to get more conventional financing as someone who has great access to capital and the low cost of capital. I think that would be okay for us, and in fact, we've been trying to reduce our secured debt and going unsecured, because that is a positive financial impact for us and creates better financial flexibility. To the extent the operators rely on agencies financing as well, that could present opportunity for us to invest more capital through triple-net leases and other kinds of investments in seniors housing. All that said, I do think Freddie and Fannie support multi- and seniors housing in a positive way, and so there might be some interim disruption to valuations if they, in fact, totally exited. So I think, there could be positive and maybe some interim disruption if Freddie and Fannie decide to exit the sector. I think for now we're assuming they're going to continue to be an important participant in multi- and senior housing. Medicaid, was that the second part of the question?", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Medicare, yes.", "Debra Cafaro", "Medicare, Medicaid. Look,  I mean, I think, you're seeing the positive impacts of RUGs-IV on the nursing home providers in the fourth quarter, which is good. I think, we always try to collar the good and the bad in terms of Medicare reimbursement. It's tends to stay in the range that is acceptable, but it kind of goes up and down every year. And we feel great about where our Kindred assets are. We're glad that there's a little positive lift from RUGs-IV. And I think Medicare, generally, is going to stay in a pretty acceptable range, as far as our position as the landlord and the assets that we have. And on the Medicaid front, I think, there's a little bit more question, which is why we feel good about having the 70% quality mix. But at the end of the day, it doesn't have a major impact. On our coverage, it's really one way or another. And we're sort of expecting Medicaid to be kind of negative one to positive one. So I think we're in great shape on that.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "You and some of the other executives talked over the last couple of days. You've talked a lot about strategic opportunities and consolidations. And I guess, I was trying to get a little more color. I mean, are there big deals, mega deals out there, sort of like Atria, like Manor Care, or is it more kind of more smaller sort of roll ups? I mean, just a little bit -- any additional color you can sort of give us, what you're thinking about?", "Raymond Lewis", "Jerry, I think it's both. I mean, we're seeing some large opportunities that exist out there both in the seniors housing and the post-acute area. So I think there will continue to be some bigger transactions, some bigger fish to go after. And then we're seeing a fairly active pipeline of what I'll call middle-sized opportunities between say $300 million and $600 million portfolios. And then there's still a pretty consistent flow of smaller single and two- to three-property portfolios that continue to come in. So the positive trends in our industry, the availability of capital to the healthcare REITs has I think kept deal flow pretty strong across the board.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And just to clarify one thing, you specifically, also included sort of hospitals and sort of that list of potential strategic things when you talked earlier, Ray?", "Raymond Lewis", "Well, I think what I was suggesting was the trend towards consolidation in the hospital space could create opportunities for us to acquire hospital-related real estate, which in most circumstances, woudld be medical office building, but could also extend to the core hospital itself. I think that's a rarer circumstance, but certainly, could be an outcome of that trend.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Conor's on as well. Debbie, you mentioned the new investments, and obviously, your cost of capital advantage and the $4 billion of transactions, that you've either closed on or identified. Could you talk about just the return expectations as you look out to 2011? And how much of things changed in the last 12 months?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think that, often, in real estate, the interest rate environment and other things do have an effect albeit lagging on kind of what sellers sell for and buyers buy for, and that's been a pretty immutable principle for a while. I would say that over last year and even over the last six months, there's been increased valuations, and that was partly why we were willing to really go hard after Atria, which we believe is a really high-end asset that we bought at attractive valuation. I think current market conditions are really proving that out, and so I think there has been a little bit of cap rate compression over the last even six months period of time. And we continue to try to look for good risk-adjusted, unlevered returns, kind of with an eye on our cost of capital with a conservative kind of capital structure.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And you mentioned, I think, Atria trending consistent with your views that you've identified. Could you talk about comparing the potential NOI growth of that portfolio versus the forecast you've issued for the year of 3.5%? I assume that's not part of...", "Debra Cafaro", "For example, compare and contrast kind of Sunrise and Atria?", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Exactly.", "Raymond Lewis", "Jay, the Atria portfolio and the Sunrise portfolio are a little bit different animals along several parameters. I think Atria is more of an independent living portfolio, Sunrise is more of an assisted-living portfolio. So they're sort of going through the recovery at different stages in the cycle. The need-driven assets tended to recover a little sooner than the Independent living assets, so the occupancies in Sunrise are higher than Atria's occupancies, which give Atria a little bit better growth potential. There are also, I think, different underlying drivers. One of the key benefits of our Atria portfolio is that they're in very high-end markets in coastal locations. There's an opportunity, as we talked about when we announced the transaction, to redevelop a number of these assets to really drive additional rate and occupancy growth above sort of normal industry standards. And I think when you couple those two factors together, you can get to a growth rate in Atria, that at least in the next couple of years, should pretty well outstrip our Sunrise growth rate.", "Debra Cafaro", "And again, remember that Atria has already redeveloped a number of these assets. They came on for a partial year, say in 2010, and so they'll really have high growth rates in '11. And then there were other assets, the eight that sort of just came on, that we should see higher growth rate in. So this is embedded kind of within the portfolio that we're acquiring.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then on the MOB side, can you talk about what sort of rent growth expectations you anticipate for those lease rolls?", "Todd Lillibridge", "This is Todd. Two fronts, one, I think, we see, given contractual rate increases in the 2% to 3% and I think we continue to see pressure on a new leasing, albeit given the marketplace around consolidation both in terms of the providers, as well as positions themselves. So again, I think we're going to see pressure around rent increases, but we've put a number of tactical elements in place to fort that activity. And we do have new leasing occurring, and so that on that end is very positive.", "Debra Cafaro", "I think it's a good stable asset class, and I think we'll be able to drive growth through the scalable platform, that's kind of the thesis on the investment.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And just final question on the loan receivable from Manor Care, is there any expectation that gets repaid this year?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, definitely. I think, we've modeled that in as a receipt in the first half, assuming that the whole Manor Care debt piece gets paid off. And that's $112-ish million, I think.", "Operator", "And your next question, ladies and gentlemen, comes from the line of Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Ray, I want to make sure, on the Sunrise, if  I heard you right. $4 a day, ADR, and did you say 140 basis points occupancy?", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes, that's right.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Is that occupancy number -- is that year end to year end or is that average over the year?", "Raymond Lewis", "That's an average over the average.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "What was the average for the year on the portfolio in 2010?", "Raymond Lewis", "It was 89.1%.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "So seen an increase from the fourth quarter levels?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "And then in terms of pricing, I know that it's been a little bit of a challenge in environment where occupancy has been sort of soft. Now that we're above 90%, where do you see the opportunities to maybe push price to something more on the 4%, 5% range?", "Raymond Lewis", "Certainly, we're very focused with Sunrise in going through our portfolio asset by asset and even unit by unit within each asset to identify which of the properties and which of the units are the most desirable to make sure that we're driving rates on those assets, and so that's a big focus of our asset management team this year. We're hopeful that we can drive above market rate increases in those assets. But remember that the portfolio, as a whole, is coming out of the recession, and as we do that, there will be some residents that have been in for a long time, whose rates have escalated quite a bit that will be rolling off, and we'll be picking up new residents coming in. So that will potentially have a dampening effect on the amount that we can drive growth, even in a rising occupancy environment, but that should be temporary.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Follow-up on the acquisition environment. Skilled nursing facilities, couple of them, obviously, a really big transaction, was announced, and then also, as you alluded to the favorable experience operators have had to date under the RUG-IV system. Are you seeing that sort of being an impediment to deals getting done in terms of unrealistic pricing expectations?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, one thing that we have really pounded the table on for a long time is that these cash flows from very well covered, well structured, sort of top of the capital structure, Master Lease rents should get a lower cap rate, if you will, lower discount rate, higher valuation. And again, there's a lot of different nursing homes as you know and a lot of different operators and a lot of different structures. And so in some ways, I think the enhanced pricing on nursing home asset is something that we welcome and support and have been a proponent of for a long period of time. So that's to the good side. I think we continue to take a very kind of strict underwriting view towards coverages and structure and everything like that on nursing homes, because as we know, the changes in Medicare and Medicaid over time do create some significant ebbs and flows in operator cash flow, and we always want to know that our rents are money-good and very collectible and that our tenant is very creditworthy. And so in our mind, the valuation for the right kind of assets, fine. But asset valuation, you really need to get great assets. They need to be very carefully underwritten. It needs to be a great operator. And you need to have a very tight structure. And so that's how we look at the business, and it served us very well for a long period of time.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, your next question will come from the line of Dustin Pizzo with UBS.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "It's Ross Nussbaum here with Dustin. Obviously, over the last six months or so, we've seen a ton of RIDEA-like structures. And I guess my question is, in a broader context, is the sale-leaseback structure dead for assisted-living? Is every regional operator out there's saying, \"Let me turn into a manager, maybe with a smaller ownership position.\" I mean, is RIDEA that much of a game changer?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think that -- as you know, we sort of started this management structure when we acquired Sunrise in 2007. And to directly answer your question, the sale-leaseback business is alive and well. And we're looking at some transactions like that, and we're looking at some transactions that would be more in the management structure. I think, each deal has to kind of stand on its own, each seller has its own objective. And we have our own objective. For us, it's not an accident that these sort of Atria and Sunrise, very high-quality assets, which we've said, and I hope you didn't miss that, we believe deserve a multi-family valuation. It's no accident that so far the assets and the operators and the markets that we have in our management structure, because we believe they provide higher long-term growth and lower downside risk. And that's where you want to do a management contract. A difference, for example, for skilled nursing, where I think, you would want to do a triple-net lease and some other kinds of senior living assets and some other kinds of operators. You'd want to do a triple-net lease deal. So I think each transaction has to stand on its own. I think it's great that we have different structuring arrows in our quiver and can continue to provide customized solutions for our operating partners. And that creates, I think, more opportunity and more deal flow, and that's I think, partly why, again, we're poised to continue to expand. I think, having these different options help deal flow and transaction activity, because there's more ways to make the lines cross and provide solutions that work for both parties.", "Raymond Lewis", "And Dustin (sic) [Ross],  obviously, I'll just add to that from the operators' perspective, I think, different operators will value different things in a particular transaction. Some people really want to capture the upside. For them a lease transaction's an ideal solution for that. And some people just want to generate stable fees. And for them perhaps the management structure is more attractive. And I've always said to operators, when I sit down with them, I talk about different capital structure alternatives for them, they should have a little bit of all. They should have some assets they own, they should have some asset that they lease, and they should have some assets that they manage, because that gives the most balance and flexible capital structure, and I think that's how most of the operators are trying to approach it.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "And part two of that question is, Debbie, I did catch the comment on what multi-family valuations and that comparison.", "Debra Cafaro", "You got it twice.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "How do you think about, clearly, the CapEx on assisted-living, it looks like it's been running higher than multi-family, so if we want to make a comparison, we should probably do it on a post CapEx basis. And on that front, seniors housing is probably still higher but not as wide as it may seem. Do you agree with that?", "Debra Cafaro", "We couldn't argue with the methodology that took recurring CapEx into account in the business. I think you'd have to compare, for example, in the case of Atria, the CapEx that would be similar to a portfolio in New York or Boston or things like that and then do the computations, I think you would still find that the senior housing has a higher cap rate, i.e. lower valuation. And I think over time, you will see those potentially converge, because the trends are very strong, the asset quality's very strong, the demographic demand is excellent. And so I can see those cap rates converging over time, admittedly, taking CapEx into account.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Life science, where is your thought process on that segment of the world right now, in terms of life science office?", "Raymond Lewis", "It hasn't changed. I think we said that, that's an area of interest to us. We believe it has a place in a healthcare REIT portfolio. We have looked at a number of different opportunities, but we're still trying to identify the right partners and entry point into that space.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, your next question will come from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group.", "James Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC", "There's been a lot of discussion about senior housing and the margin comparison. And I think in the prepared comments the phrase was used in terms of your guidance that you project margins to be stable, but of course, there were so many things going on in 2010 between the expense adjustments as well as the positive impact at the operating level. I just thought I'd try and get a start at trying to phrase what's going on, how we should think about it. But the stable margin, I guess, means back out the one-time expense items in 2010 reflects the higher management contract rate for your agreement, and that, that would be offset by the positive operating trends. Is that the best way to think about that?", "Raymond Lewis", "Jim, let me just clarify, with respect to stable, I was referring to the Sunrise portfolio margins. And yes, I think the way that you're thinking about it is right if you backed out the one-time items. What we're looking for going forward would be a stable margin off of that rate.", "James Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And then in terms of the MOB portfolio, just a couple of questions. First of all, I think the comment was that you would expect stable performance. I wonder if someone could address the outlook for the non-stabilized portion of the MOB portfolio, number one. And number two, there was the indication that there would be more activity in terms of acquisitions and development, and I guess, maybe Todd could address this moving from the private to the public world, with the access to capital that he now has. How he thinks about maybe the shape of his portfolio changing as more deals become possible in the current environment?", "Todd Lillibridge", "I think, first question, really come to non-stable. We have six in the portfolio compared to 63 in our stable portfolio, which again is enjoying a near 95% occupancy. We do see growth in our non-stabilized portfolio, which is currently almost at 74% and rising, and we predict that to increase here this calendar year. On the acquisition front, we are seeing a series of opportunities, although, I think what's important to us is we remain very consistent with both our investment pieces, which quite frankly is what we brought forward from Lillibridge, but also very consistent with the legacy business that Ventas built. So we don't see, Jim, really a change in our approach and investment in type of assets that we have been familiar in developing, let alone, acquiring. Again the combination, not of only with a high occupancy, but, again, portfolio-wide, we have a 90% on-campus percentage of assets, which again, continues to be really important, especially in this time of consolidation both in terms of hospitals and physicians. And we've enjoyed this past year, an 85% tenant retention, which I think, is was also very important statistic, even given the comment I made earlier on this downward pressure on rent. So we're seeing opportunities, but I think what's important is that we've been at this long enough to we know what not to buy. And we seen through at least a good downturn both economic and to consolidation, and again, what to stay away from and then what to pursue. On the development front, I think, as you know, development activity dropped off considerably across the country. With the rebalance, if you would, of the balance sheets and the pressure of the finance community for not-for-profit healthcare in particular, kind of the early end or end of '08, if I would. I think what we're now seeing is a pickup, although capital remains very scarce, especially with a number of the major systems. But we are seeing more development activity. We currently have two projects underway, we have three additions that we have awarded and we have a pipeline of five additional, and if you put that altogether, it's a little under $200 million in total development projects. Majority of it, I would say are for fee, which will be generating fee revenue. But I would say the majority of pipeline opportunities are for ownership. There's no doubt, obviously, Lillibridge having the strength and the capital, and quite frankly, the flexibility that, we, Lillibridge, didn't have as a private company. So having great access, great cost of capital is certainly key. And obviously, we're combining that to leverage our brand, our history, our diversified portfolio, which is now across 20-some-odd states and about 60 different markets. So we're excited about what lies ahead in our side of the business, but we also know we're going through a period of time of transformation. It's important we make the right deal.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Brian Sekino with Barclays.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital", "Just want to follow up on the margin question before. And I think you said your margins would be kind of stable, excluding the impact of the overage expenses in 2010. For your guidance, you're giving growth in the occupancy as well as on the rate. Is there something in the cost that you can call out as to why we can't see some margin increases in 2011 similar to what you've gotten over the last year?", "Raymond Lewis", "Bryan, I think, as we look at the expenses, I mean, there are a number of things that potentially could be increasing this year. Utilities and food come to mind as potential expense drivers. But I think we're sort of looking at a 4%-ish year-over-year expense increase, not entirely inconsistent with what we've seen historically.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Dan Cooney with KBW.", "Daniel Cooney - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I guess, if we could just stay on the margins with Sunrise. I know it's a little early to talk about 2012, but I mean, do you think it's likely to actually see margins contract a little bit just as the management fee structure returns to that 6% level?", "Debra Cafaro", "Again, we're going to have the three entry quarter percent management fee in 2011. And then we have a structure where the management fee would be between 5% and 7% in 2012, depending on where portfolio performance is on the NOI line. And I think what you'll see is it depends, I mean, if the portfolio is occupied at 95% in 2012, I think you'll see perhaps some but very limited margin contraction year-over-year. But at that point, and if not, you'd see a little bit more margin contraction, obviously, as you move the 3.75% management fee to 5%, you lose a little bit on the NOI line. But we're really looking for ultimately is continued demographically-driven, strong, demand for these assets with rate increases and increasing NOI. And we feel good about that long-term projection.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital", "I guess, just on the Lillibridge side, can you maybe talk a little bit about the potential to consolidate the ownership of that portfolio? I mean,  if you look at your partners there, are they likely long term owners or more likely to be looking for an exit over the next year or two?", "Debra Cafaro", "That's a good question, because when we bought the 96 Lillibridge assets, there's the wholly-owned portfolio that Todd mentioned, being 95% or thereabout occupied. And then we own 5% and 20% of a portfolio, and we're the managing partner of that, where pension fund capital owns the balance. And we have the right of first offer on the balance of that portfolio. And over time, I think, it could generally be assumed that these are limited life investments. We're very happy to have them as our partner now. But over time, if they choose to divest, I believe we would be the appropriate counterparty for consolidation.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I want to ask the obvious question on Sunrise, if I could. Isn't there like a fair amount of conservatism being styled into this? You're going from 18% to 3% growth year-over-year. I understand all the metrics and all that sort of stuff, but if the business is really buzzing now, and you have a lot of good things going on within assisted living business over all, aren't we really just being super conservative?", "Debra Cafaro", "Remember when you were pitching and the umpire said \"We call them like we see them.\" And I would tell you that we are doing the same with respect to both our Atria acquisition and our Sunrise projections. I think, we, really, are giving you our best view as to what the portfolios will deliver. And again, at the midpoint it's 3.5% growth, if you take out the $5 million of cash payments we got in '10 that related to prior years. And we are working with Sunrise, as Ray said, to really try to drive that higher, but we don't want to commit that it will be higher, because we want to deliver to you consistent reliable projection that we think, again, with our guidance, worth at 7.5% per share FFO growth, that's pretty outstanding, I would say. And we're calling it like we see it. We think Atria has higher growth. Maybe we'll be growing in both fronts and Atria will be a little less and Sunrise will be a little bit more. But right now, we think the Atria's in the high single digits for the reasons that Ray articulated. And we think Sunrise at the midpoint about 3.5%,  and we'll work our Asset Management department to death talking to Sunrise to try to drive that number higher. Right now, that's where we see it.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Did the full year of Steeles fully occupied move the needle on the overall number?", "Raymond Lewis", "Not particularly, maybe a million dollars or so.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Question on the idea and kind of a conceptual one that I kind of come back to almost every quarter. But I assume you wouldn't have wanted to be tied up with the RIDEA structure and say 2000 and 2001, when the assisted living business went to heck. And that's kind of what I'm worried about with all these, and I'm kind of wondering how you feel about RIDEA, not so much for now, when things are going well, but for the next 10 years, when you can have overbuilding and assisted-living and we could have problems while the pool potential residents is kind of much smaller than it is for multifamily. And so, I just wanted that comment, if you could comment on that for me.", "Debra Cafaro", "This is important question, I think that we think a lot about. And what we're trying to do that to really about portfolio management and creating a diversified; and again diversified by business model, by geography, by payor source, by operator; a diversified portfolio that will deliver consistent performance over long periods of time and in different cycles, because the cash flows come from different sources from different people and maybe some are more granular and have higher growth in an economic recovery and lower growth in a recession as you point out. I think we have confidence in assets that we put in a management structure with Atria and Sunrise. We do think the fundamentals in seniors housing are positive in the near and intermediate term, because there's very limited supply, and there is growing demand. We think they're great operators with the ability to give us good public company reporting information, good data, so we feel really good about that. But the key point is that overall, we're creating a high-quality, balanced portfolio that's going to have growth from triple-net contractual escalation, and hopefully higher growth from this management deals with Sunrise and Atria. And we'll be able to perform and do well in all environment. That's what we're trying to create. I think we're not trying to go all one way or all another way. I would remind you relative to your stated worry that I think we are in a good time in the cycle. And I really think you need to think about the fact that you love multi-family, multi-family is an all-variable business and again, commands a very high valuation, despite the fact that it ebbs and flows with economic cycle. So I think, we feel good about the balance that we're creating, we good feel good about the high-quality assets that the own and that we're trying to acquire and the structures that we're putting them in as well as the operators. And hopefully, we'll be able to maintain that balance, and as we see it, as we see where we are in the cycle with the different kinds of asset types and continue to drive value through that portfolio management.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I think the population of potential residents for senior housing that was a bit more fragile than it is for multi-family...", "Debra Cafaro", "But when you say that, that over 85 population is the fastest-growing. Both are very demographically-driven that over 85 is the fastest-growing segment of the population, and there's limited supply. So they're fragile people and individuals in house potentially but the...", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "No, I don't mean it that way.", "Debra Cafaro", "But the demographic data is very strong, it's analogous to kind of echo boom thesis in multi.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Growth of a smaller number looks big in percentages. I guess that's the way I would say that but...", "Debra Cafaro", "But anyway does that address not this last part of the conversation but the earlier part of our portfolio management and balance and high-quality assets that are that have different activity. And does that help answer your question?", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "It does, but, still you're going to be close to 40% RIDEA when Atria's done. And if today we were to have the problems in 2000 again, that would really hurt you guys. That's a big number 40%. And that's my only point. I'm not saying it's going to be...", "Raymond Lewis", "There's a couple of points, I think, Rich, I'd like to add to what Debbie said. One, we've been very careful as we constructed our portfolio to select assets that are in higher-barriered entry, in-fill locations, in major metro areas. So our RIDEA portfolio is constructed around that profile. The second point, I think, is that there really hasn't been very much new construction in the seniors housing space. There's not a lot of available capital for it at the moment, so at least in the near term, to get that stuff started, to get it out of the ground and open and start loosing up, we are a ways off from that, even if it we're to start today, and there's really no signs of it starting today or any capital available to really do it at any scale. So I think that's why we are comfortable with being where we are in the portfolio at this moment in time. And as Debbie said, we're constantly monitoring the market conditions and adjusting our portfolio as we grow and diversify.", "Debra Cafaro", "And just before we close this topic, I just want to add one thing. If you look at the performance for the Sunrise portfolio through the financial crisis, the recession and Sunrise's corporate challenges, the variability of the NOI was about $10 million or so in a given year. Our current NOI is about 708 in the denominator and with Atria would ", "be maybe closer to 900. So if that variability is in -- if it continues to be in that range of variability for Sunrise and maybe a similar range for Atria, we're really talking about a very manageable variation in annual cash flows at Ventas. And again that's what we're trying to create, which is an entity that can deliver good performance in different kinds of environments, growth-year environments and more challenging environments.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "On the Kindred deal, with their acquisition, do you see that providing a pipeline of potential acquisitions for you guys?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think we really have a good --  and I give a lot of credit to Paul Diaz for this very excellent working relationship and partnership with Kindred now. And one of the benefits, honestly, of growing Ventas is that we will have the opportunity to do business with Kindred. And I know that Kindred trusts us to deliver for them. And I would hope that in a larger scale that we have, that we do have more opportunities to do business together because of that relationship of trust that has developed between us.", "Operator", "And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I would now like to turn the call back over to Debra Cafaro for the closing comments.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Angela. Look, if you can tell from all of our comments, we're tremendously excited about the future here at Ventas and the landscape in the Healthcare and Senior Housing business. I really believe that the sector is the most dynamic in all of real estate, with the large and growing highly-fragmented business, growing demand from the over 85 population and baby boomers, consolidation among those asset owners and operators, integration of post-acute care, healthcare reform, the need for increased capital sources among both healthcare systems and senior housing care providers as well as the evolving investment rules on the healthcare REIT front. This environment is very compelling for us, because if we are right about having cost of capital advantages, experience, resources and the right team, I think, we can really make the most of this external environment and create long-term benefits for all of our stakeholders. So we really appreciate your participation today. We thank you for your support, and we look forward to seeing you soon.

I mean I always think -- and then I'm the biased advocate, I'll be the first to admit that, that we should be rated about 2 notches above where we always are rated. So you have to take my response with a little bit of a grain of salt. But I think Ventas really should be and is frankly sort of like a BBB+ quality, credit quality company. And I think the bondholders acknowledge that in the way that we tend to price our paper very -- with great spreads. And so the bondholders I think really appreciate what a reliable credit we are and have been and how we've managed the company for the benefit of all of our constituents over time, and they know that. And so I would look really towards getting to that BBB+ rated level whether we can persuade those with the pen of that. I'll let you to decide, but we're bullish on our credit anyway.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Debbie, on the question on acquisitions. Can you just give us some sense as to where you see values today whether they're fair or perhaps a little bit pricey? And as you think about whether it's senior housing or perhaps life sciences or MOBs, but just trying to get some sense of how you think about valuation, whether you're looking for a little bit of a pullback over time to perhaps deploy capital as you've talked about?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think we have always averaged into our investments over time. And I think that we -- let's take seniors housing as an example. I mean I've seen on my soapbox a I little bit about this. But here you have high-quality infill locations and assets that have shown tremendous resilience. They're need-based, they're demographically driven, major metro location. And the Atria ones, for example, we're buying at let's call it a 6.5% cap on the stabilized assets. And to me those should trade at something like multi-family cap rates. And so I think that those assets, I mean, are well-priced and that's why we're buying them. And I think the market has come to appreciate the resiliency of the cash flows and the potential for growth in those cash flows. So it really varies by sector. And I think as Brian mentioned, as you look forward at skilled nursing, we don't really know what the pricing will be in this kind of period of uncertainty but those may be attractive pricing as well. And the other asset types I would say generally are in kind of the fair range, let's call it. So that's how we see it.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Helpful. And also just following up on the CMS proposal, I mean do you think that 2012 is a starting point i.e. this could go further in out-years as well or do you think that 2012 is really what they're looking at, and then that's where they stop?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I mean, look, we have lived the sort of nursing home CMS story consistently over the last -- since I got here in 1999. And the truth of the matter is as the guys who cover healthcare as opposed to real estate know, there are constant kind of ebbs and flows in Medicare reimbursement. And I think we've been in a flow. And now I think on skilled nursing as distinct from hospitals, which -- our L-tax [ph] just got on an increase in Medicare reimbursement. I think we're in a period of a little bit of ebb, and we have been talking about that where we think there will be some cost pressures on the operators that will reduce the rate of growth in reimbursements or even some reduction. And this is something that we've been through over time and they tend to go in fairly predictable cycles. And so we think it's likely to be sort of a multi-year period where there is margin compression at the operators. We don't think it's going to be drastic in any way. But there will be these cost containment measures that come from both the budget issues in Washington as well as just the idea that CMS maybe got a little ahead of itself with RUG-IV. And that's part of the ordinary ebb and flow of the business. And that's why again it's important to be the landlord with operators who have the ability to manage through these changes, which occur every single year and have the kind of coverage that we have.", "So I don't -- operator, I don't think we have anymore questions. And so I want to thank everyone for participating in this quarter's call. We very much appreciate your attention and your support, and we look forward to seeing everyone in June in New York. So thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. All parties may now disconnect.

Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks, David, and good morning to all of our shareholders and participants, and welcome to our first quarter 2011 earnings call. ", "Today, I'll provide a brief recap of the quarter and discuss our pending transactions and strategy. Our President, Ray Lewis, will provide an overview of our portfolio performance and investment outlook; and our CFO Rick Schweinhart will end our prepared remarks with a detailed review of our quarterly financial results. After that, we'll be delighted to take your questions.", "Ventas had exciting and productive first quarter with normalized FFO per share, up 12% year-over-year, good growth in occupancy and NOI in our private pay Sunrise-managed communities and cash flow from operations, up over 13% from our diversified portfolio of senior living, hospital and skilled nursing assets. Most importantly, during the quarter, we announced our highly strategic $7.4 billion acquisition of Nationwide Health Property, a well-respected, diversified healthcare REIT with a successful 25-year history. We expect the NHP acquisition to be immediately accretive to 2011 earnings per share, and we continue to expect a third quarter 2011 closing. ", "Separately, NHP announced earlier today excellent quarterly earnings and $600 million in year-to-date acquisition volume at a blended initial cash yield of 8%. We are working hand-in-glove with our colleagues at NHP to run through the finish line and execute on our strategic vision of creating the leading diversified healthcare REIT that will continue to deliver superior value for shareholders. NHP CEO, Doug Pasquale, and his team are doing an incredible job working for our collective constituents. ", "As an update on our pending $3.1 billion acquisition of 118 high-quality private pay senior living communities operated by Atria Senior Living Group, we expect to close that transaction shortly. Atria is the fourth largest operator of assisted living in the U.S., and our acquired assets are located principally in attractive barrier-to-entry coastal markets with affluent demographics. The Atria assets continue to perform well, and we look forward to integrating these exceptional properties into our portfolio and working with the dedicated and experienced Atria's senior management team. ", "We are enthusiastic about our strategy and our positioning for the future. In just 3 quarters, since June 30, 2010, we have expanded and reshaped Ventas to deliver another decade of excellence for our shareholders. After our acquisition of the Lillibridge Medical Office Building business on July 1, 2010, and following completion of our pending Atria and NHP acquisitions, we will be a better, faster-growing and more reliable and diversified enterprise, with an enhanced cost of capital advantage and multiple avenues to exploit the $1 trillion fragmented universe of healthcare and senior housing real estate. ", "We continue as a management team to look forward and to try to stay one step ahead of the rapidly evolving external environment as we make decisions and allocate capital on your behalf. ", "I think it's worth taking a moment to explain what we expect Ventas to look like compared to just 3 quarters ago at June 30, 2010. ", "First, our private pay NOI will increase to 70% of our annualized NOI, significantly improved from 57% in mid-2010. During that period, we have systematically reduced our NOI from skilled nursing assets from 28% to 22%. Ventas will be the most diversified healthcare REIT by asset type, operating model, tenant and geography. ", "Kindred, the largest provider of post-acute care in the United States, will represent only 19% of our pro forma NOI. Seniors housing operating assets with Atria and Sunrise will comprise 26% of our business. And we will have a well-balanced portfolio with 29% seniors housing triple-net lease assets, 11% medical office buildings, 8% hospital triple-net leases and 22% post-acute triple-net leases. ", "NHP and Ventas are combining the 2 strongest balance sheets in the industry. Financial strength and flexibility preserve shareholder value and provide optionality for growth. We have already achieved momentum towards higher credit ratings from all three agencies, which should result in lower debt spreads. With over $6 billion in combined debt outstanding, improving debt cost should result in better earnings for Ventas shareholders. ", "With Atria and NHP, we will be doing business with the leaders of the healthcare and senior housing industry. The NHP acquisition will expand our customer relationship by 6x, providing Ventas with built-in opportunities to grow as our customers expand, monetize additional assets or consolidate. ", "Ventas will become one of the largest publicly traded REITs, with a pro forma enterprise value of $23 billion and the leading healthcare REIT by equity value. Compared to June 2010, our total enterprise value will have expanded from $10 billion to $23 billion. Moreover, we will be the largest owner of private pay seniors housing in the U.S., an asset class we find attractive due to compelling supply-demand fundamentals. The quality and location of our Sunrise and Atria operating portfolios are second to none. ", "With our Lillibridge transaction in July of 2010, Ventas acquired a national leading integrated platform in MOB. Now with the addition of NHP's MOB business, we will own or manage 14 million square feet of MOBs nationally; enjoy relationships with high-quality healthcare and hospital systems across the country; and succeed to NHP's attractive, exclusive $1-plus billion pipeline with excellent developer, Pacific Medical Buildings. ", "Ventas and NHP both enjoy excellent dividend coverage and the combined company has the potential to offer superior dividend growth and reliability to our shareholders. ", "And finally, with our improved size, deal, diversification and relationships, including NHP's strong regional investment business and deal team, and Ventas' expertise in completing large highly structured transactions with national operators, we will be positioned to do any deal, large or small, operating or triple-net, in any subsector of healthcare and senior housing real estate. All of these attributes should drive our future growth and total return. ", "We have always believed that the way to create shareholder value is by growing cash flows from a productive and diversified portfolio of high-quality senior housing and healthcare assets, operated by excellent tenants and managers, while we also prudently manage risks. All of our acquisitions over the years, 7 in 7 years, including Atria and NHP, fits squarely within that framework. ", "We look forward to completing and realizing on the power and the potential of our 2 pending acquisitions with the benefits of our shareholders. Ray?", "Raymond Lewis", "Thank you, Debbie. Ventas' portfolio currently consists of over 600 diversified and productive healthcare and seniors housing assets that produce reliable and growing cash flows. ", "During the first quarter of 2011, same-store NOI for our total portfolio grew 3.7% over the first quarter of the 2010. Starting with our long-term triple-net lease portfolio, where we derived 68% of our first quarter NOI, cash flow coverages remain stable at 1.7x through the fourth quarter of 2010, the latest date available. The triple-net lease asset in our portfolio are structured as pooled, multi-facility master leases, have a weighted average remaining lease term of about 6 years and encompass both seniors housing and post-acute asset classes. These leases have strong tenant credit and contractual growth escalations that continue to provide Ventas with steady and reliable cash flow growth year-after-year. ", "Same-store cash NOI on the 392 assets in our triple-net lease portfolio grew 2.7% year-over-year and remained on track to exceed our 2011 same-store growth projection of 2.5%. The majority of Ventas' post-acute assets are leased to our long-standing and successful tenant, Kindred Healthcare, which currently represents 36% of the company's annualized NOI. Our Kindred portfolio has an excellent quality mix of 71% and maintain strong cash flow-to-rent coverage of 2x for the fourth quarter of 2010, the most recent available. ", "The contractual rent escalations in our pooled, multi-facility master leases with Kindred delivered a net rent increase of 2.6% on May 1. Corporately, Kindred continues to be the leader in the post-acute space bolstered by its recent $1.3 billion acquisition of publicly traded RehabCare. Moreover, Kindred has a strong credit profile. Pro forma for the RehabCare transaction, Kindred has an attractive balance sheet at 4.7x adjusted debt to EBITDA, a diversified business mix spanning the post-acute continuum and over 2x EBITDAR to rent coverage. ", "Next, I would like to discuss our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio, which includes 79 high-quality private pay, mansion-style assisted-living communities managed by Sunrise Senior Living. This portfolio currently accounts for 21% of Ventas' first quarter NOI. Occupancy in the Sunrise portfolio was up 140 basis points year-over-year to 89.7%, which compares favorably to the 90 basis points year-over-year increase reported for assisted living by net in the first quarter of 2011. ", "Current occupancy in the portfolio is hovering at 90%. NOI for our Sunrise portfolio increased 7.3% over the first quarter of 2010 to $36.3 million. Our Sunrise NOI benefited from the previously mentioned 140 basis point increase in occupancy, a 3.1% increase in average daily rate and lower management fees payable to Sunrise, offset by higher expenses. Our 3.1% year-over-year rate growth compares favorably to the 0% year-over-year assisted-living rate growth reported by the NIC for the first quarter of 2011. ", "This quarter, our Steeles property in Toronto joined the stabilized portfolio from the lease up portfolio, as it continue to perform exceptionally well with current occupancy over 98%. We are also reaffirming our NOI guidance range of $152 million to $157 million for our Sunrise portfolio, which equates to a 3.5% year-over-year growth over normalized 2010 Sunrise NOI at the midpoint. Corporately, Sunrise has made strong progress during the first quarter by entering into a new revolving credit facility, raising capital through the sale of convertible notes and building its asset bass with a purchase out its majority partners interest in 44 of its senior living communities. ", "Turning to Medical Office. Our portfolio of owned and managed medical office buildings is comprised of 160 properties with 9 million square feet. Our MOBs are 90% on-campus and affiliated with investment-grade health systems. Medical office buildings currently account for 9% of the company's annualized NOI. The Lillibridge platform, which we acquired at the beginning of third quarter of 2010, continues to deliver steady performance in our own portfolios. Our consolidated same-store stabilized pool of 58 MOBs maintained strong occupancy, above 94%, and provided first quarter NOI of $12.7 million, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010. ", "Also, during the first quarter, Lillibridge rolled out a new branding initiative aimed at showcasing the combined benefits of our two firms: Ventas' strong balance sheet, access to capital and investment team; and Lillibridge's brand, full-service capabilities and performance track record with highly rated hospitals and health systems. ", "Finally, it is worth noting that Ventas' MOB presence will grow significantly upon the closing of the NHP acquisition, as our combined owned and managed portfolio will encompass over 230 medical office buildings containing 14 million square feet. We will also have relationships with over 50 not-for-profit and investor-owned hospitals. From a fit standpoint, NHP's Pacific Medical Buildings platform focused on the West Coast complements Ventas' Central and Eastern U.S. focus very well and will provide Ventas with coast-to-coast MOB market coverage that will be able to provide full-service real estate capabilities to hospitals and health systems nationwide. ", "Before turning the call over to Rick, let me just touch briefly on acquisitions and investment environment, which continues to be robust and attractive for both Ventas and NHP. ", "Obviously, Ventas has been active in the large deals space with the announcements of Atria and NHP. Likewise, NHP has been productive in the small and medium-sized deals space having closed nearly $600 million in new investments so far this year. These transactions run the gamut from seniors housing to skilled nursing to medical office, deals include both follow-on investments with existing relationships, as well as new relationships with good local and regional operators. ", "Moreover, a number of these transactions were off-market deals that were identified by NHP's network of regional originators and priced at attractive yields, averaging 8%. So with $600 million closed so far, another $170 million under contract, an active pipeline, a strong originations team, NHP seems well positioned to exceed historical origination levels in 2011. ", "Deal flow in the market remained strong as private equity and other owners of healthcare real estates seek liquidity to recapitalize their balance sheets and grow their companies. At the same time, capital alternatives for those with liquidity and growth needs are still relatively limited, with secured debt being underwritten to very conservative standards. Ventas continues to have access to multiple capital markets on attractive terms. As a consequence, we are seeing a steady flow of attractive investment opportunities both large and small in all of our asset classes. And through the combination of NHP's excellent regional acquisitions platform, Ventas' large transaction capabilities, our track record, extensive relationships with leading operators and our attractive cost of capital, we should be exceptionally well-positioned to continue to grow our company. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Rich Schweinhart to discuss our financial results.", "Richard Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. First quarter 2011 normalized FFO was $0.75 per share, per diluted share, an increase of 12% compared to the first quarter 2010, per share results end up $0.67. Normalized FFO was $121 million compared to last year's first quarter of $105.2 million. Normalized FFO in the first quarter excludes $20 million composed primarily of merger-related expenses and deal costs totaling $6.4 million in the quarter, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.5 million, offset by a $3.2 million income tax benefit. First quarter normalized FFO increased from last year's first quarter due to NOI increases in all three of our segments: triple-net, seniors housing operating and medical office buildings. ", "Triple-net lease revenues grew to $118.6 million from $116.3 million last year, primarily due to contractual escalations. Seniors housing operating NOI increased 7% to $36.3 million this quarter from $33.8 million last year. In addition, during the quarter, we received proceeds from repayment of loans receivable and sales of marketable debt securities totaling $43 million and recognized income of $2.5 million. ", "Due to the Lillibridge acquisition on July 1 of 2010, first quarter Medical Office Property group NOI grew to $18.4 million from $8 million last year, including $1.4 million in unconsolidated joint ventures. Finally, first quarter normalized FFO also benefited from our fourth quarter acquisition of Sunrise's non-controlling interest in our 58 of our 79 senior housing communities for an equity investment of $41.5 million. This purchase added approximately $2 million to our earnings in the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year. ", "Looking at sequential results. Fourth quarter 2010 FFO totaled $121.4 million compared to this quarter's $121.0 million. The principal reason for stable sequential performance relates to our deal with Sunrise completed at the end of last year. That deal included a modification of our management agreements with respect to all 79 communities managed by Sunrise. The modifications included a reduction in the 2010 management fee to 3.5% for the period April 1 through December 31, 2010. The modification also limited certain annual shared cost charged to the communities. The savings reflected on our fourth quarter results totaled $7.2 million. However, $5 million of that savings was attributable to prior quarters in 2010. 2011, Sunrise management fees were set at 3.75%. ", "As a result, in the fourth quarter 2010, Sunrise managed NOI was $42.6 million. Excluding the $5 million out-of-period cost savings and accounting for 2 more days in the fourth quarter, the comparable Sunrise fourth quarter NOI would have been $36.8 million, consistent with the first quarter NOI of $36.3 million. ", "Sequentially, Medical Office NOI in the first quarter of 2011 was $18.4 million, also stable compared to the fourth quarter segment results. Interest expense improved by almost $3 million in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Also due to the late fourth quarter acquisition of Sunrise's minority real estate interest in 58 of our communities, FFO improved by approximately $2 million, sequentially. ", "We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flows from operations. At March 31, our cash balance was $42 million and we had $8 million outstanding on our $1 billion revolving credit facility or net liquidity exceeding $1 billion. In the quarter, we issued 5.6 million shares of equity for $300 million, used those funds to prepay mortgage debt of $307 million. This capital activity is consistent with our announced funding strategy for the Atria acquisition of reducing secured debt and improving our credit profile. As a result our credit stats improved to outstanding levels at March 31. Net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA is at 3.8x, and our fixed charge coverage ratio substantially exceeds 3x. ", "Our March 31, 2011, debt-to-enterprise value is an industry-leading 23%. Weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter at 162 million shares increased 3.2% over the first quarter of last year and 2.4% over the 158.2 million in fourth quarter 2010. We are affirming our 2011 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance at $3.06 to $3.14. ", "At the midpoint, this represents 7.5% growth versus 2010 and is the result of expected improving property operations at Sunrise and our pending Atria acquisition. Normalized FFO per share guidance includes the acquisition of Atria Senior Living, but does not include the acquisition of Nationwide Health Properties or unannounced acquisition or divestiture activity, deal costs, capital transactions, losses on extinguishment of debt, FX gains and losses, non-cash mark-to-market derivative income and expense, non-cash income tax expense or benefit or litigation expense or proceeds. ", "Operator, if you would please open the call to questions.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Just a question on the NHP deal. Clearly with having completed almost $800 million year-to-date, that's clearly in excess of what the run rate they've been on and I think probably ahead of where they thought they would be. What's happening in terms of approving deals, and I would've thought in the first quarter with all the stuff on the merger that the time probably would have been in reverse. They wouldn't have been able to do as many deals. So I'm just wondering if there's been a change at all in terms of how those deals are being sourced or what's closing or what's being approved. And ideally then, given the higher acquisition volume, that ideally should lead to better underlying FFO in which case the deal probably is going to be more accretive at least in the near term and essentially going forward if this pipeline grows even further.", "Raymond Lewis", "So Michael, I'll take the first part of that question. I think with respect to moving transactions through the pipeline, NHP is continuing to run their business. You'll recall when we announced the transaction that one of the primary benefits we described was the value of the regional originations platform in the pipeline if they're able to generate. And we've been laser-focused on making sure that we don't lose any traction on that and that we -- when we close the transaction, we are running at a full gallop with the originations platform. So John Cobb, our Chief Investment Officer, has been working hand-in-glove with the originations team to make share that we are tracking the transactions that they're running, that we are on board with the way that they are underwriting and evaluating them and that they're moving quickly through the pipe and that there aren't any bottlenecks. So we have been extremely focused on that aspect of the transaction.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "And I assume then from the perspective of accretion for the deal, I don't think you guys were probably underwriting $800 million so early in the year out of the NHP platform just given how conservative you are in underwriting. I guess this issue would mean that once the deal closes, it's probably a little bit upsize given the fixed exchange ratio in the transaction.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, Michael, as you know we are super excited about the transaction, and we really think it gives us more ways to grow in the future. And we are maniacal underwriters as Doug eloquently explained at your conference. We said when we announced the deal, there were about 250 closed and another 250 or so in the hopper on acquisitions. And we give NHP a ton of credit for continuing to really drive their business. Again, working very closely with them since the date of the announcement, and even before, so that we capture and realize on the potential of the acquisition. So we hope to continue doing that, and we're just all about executing right now.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Second question is on the Atria. You maintained this $186 million to $196 million sort of NOI level, and part of that wide range originally was due to you didn't know when the deal would close during the year. My impression was that the senior housing fundamentals are better from when you announced the transaction, in which case the NOI level for the full year would likely be higher today than when you did the transaction. And so I'm just wondering if you can sort of go through a little bit about sort of NOI for 2011 as a whole for Atria, and then what you'll pick up as your share. And then also how you're feeling about Lazard's holding in the company, clearly which the HCP trade and Carlisle with having bought them out, they weren't really going to be a long-term holder, but I'm just curious how that -- whether that's giving you a thought about having a large stakeholder in the company and perhaps viewed as an overhang and that?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Well, there's a couple, maybe three questions in there and I'll take them seriatim. One is that we do love the fundamentals in seniors housing, especially the Atria assets, which are in these terrific locations like New York and the West Coast. And when we gave our guidance range of $186 million to $196 million, I think we were building in a significant amount of growth in the year-over-year asset performance, which we are seeing actual performance in line with that. So the senior housing market is really performing kind of as we expected, and we did give high growth rates year-over-year for Atria as you remember. And that's really already baked into $186 million to $196 million. And so we feel very comfortable with the range that we've provided. And so the good news is I think the portfolio is performing well and in line with I would say pretty robust expectations of year-over-year growth, so we feel good about that. In terms of our new partner, Lazard, what I think is really outstanding about the deal structure that we struck with Lazard is that it has evidenced Lazard's partnership with us and their confidence in their own assets, in Ventas and in our prospects. And so -- and it's also very balance sheet-friendly and takes a lot of risks off the table for Ventas shareholders in terms of deal structuring. So we -- Matt [Matthew Lustig] has been and Lazard has been a good corporate shareholder in circumstances where they have taken REIT takes in the past. I mean that's been a handful of situations. And I'm confident that they will do the same here with Ventas.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Debbie, in your opening remarks, you commented that you'll be the largest platform and you talked about you could do acquisitions in each sub-sector. I guess how should we be thinking about that in terms of the right portfolio mix, your strategy going forward?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. We have always believed that the way to create value, again, is to grow earnings and to diversify our portfolio and have good balance in the portfolio. And so as we close everything that we have pending, we're going to have a little bit over 25% in senior housing operating and a very good balance throughout the rest of the portfolio, with 70% coming from private pay sources. I think the beauty of the model that we're developing with these acquisitions is that we will be able to respond to market opportunities and really expand or contract these pieces of the pie as we see market opportunities developing. We certainly can do more seniors housing operating. We have set up our deal with Atria to really grow with them. We could do more with Sunrise potentially in that higher gross operating model. And really we have -- we've got our MOB platform now that we can grow. And then frankly, our -- so any way we want to go with the portfolio now, I think we have every opportunity to do so, including, by the way, attacking very large opportunities that will not overweight the portfolio in terms of concentration if those kind of large opportunities present themselves. So we really are excited again about the kind of company that we're going to be, the cost of capital and our ability to really seize the opportunities in the market, which will kind of ebb and flow over time.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you. And you also commented on being able to deliver superior dividend growth and, of course, that's been a key theme in the market today. Could you quantify that? Have you done any sort of sensitivity analysis over the next few years, what you think you could do?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I mean Ventas historically has both one of the highest dividend growth rates, if not the highest in our sector, coupled with a very low payout ratio. And so the combination of our ability to grow earnings and having a low payout ratio means that we should continue to have upward momentum in our dividend. And just to put it in historical context, Ventas has grown our dividend about 8% annually from '04 to '07 and again still has the lowest payout ratio in the sector. So that is a, I think, underappreciated investment attribute of Ventas securities and, of course, NHP also has a low payout ratio. So we're combining sort of the best balance sheet, the best dividend coverage, and I think we can use both of those attributes to great effects as we go forward.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then last question for Ray. Ray, you were commenting on the relationships you'll have in the MOB space nationwide. Can you just talk about that a little bit more and help us -- I guess, help me understand exactly how you can leverage those relationships nationwide?", "Raymond Lewis", "Right, Jeff. So as I said in my comments, Pacific Medical Buildings covers 11 western states, states that Lillibridge hasn't really established much, if any, of a footprint in so far. Now those are certainly states that we wanted to do business in. We're in the process of figuring out how to enter those markets. But with the acquisition of NHP, we get a pretty much ready-made presence and with the strongest brand in that market with their joint venture with Pacific Medical Buildings and the built-in pipeline that goes along with it. And Lillibridge has an excellent coverage of the Central U.S. and Eastern U.S. And so that creates sort of a nationwide capability within our combined companies to service -- full service any of the healthcare hospital systems across the country. So I mean, that's really the basic strategic thesis, and I think it's a very complimentary business model.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Ford with KeyBanc.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Just wanted to ask a follow-up question on how Atria is performing. If my notes are correct, I think you expected the deal to close originally in April and you were looking for sort of a high single-digits NOI growth. And I think you said today that it's running roughly in line with your expectations. Would it be correct to say that it's closing a little bit later than perhaps you had expected but that's being offset by better expectations on the NOI side?", "Raymond Lewis", "I think the NOI performance is right in line with what our expectations were as Debbie said. I think we're looking at NOI increases year-over-year in the first quarter on the order of 10% or so. So again, in that high single-digits range, occupancy is up, rates are up. The redevelopment communities are performing well, I would say on track, and several of them performing well ahead of what we had forecasted. So as Debbie alluded to the NOI builds through the year, and so I think we're still very well within the range that we had projected even with the slight delay in the closing.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Great, thanks. Same question, just relates to the recent announcement by the CMS on the reimbursement changes potentially affecting skilled nursing. Can you just comment on what you think might be the effect on your skilled nursing portfolio and your 1.8x coverage there today?", "Debra Cafaro", "Happy to talk about that. Just for those of you who haven't heard, CMS has proposed of an A and a B reimbursement scheme for fiscal year '12 for the nursing homes, one of which is up over 1% and one of it -- one of which contains the potential reduction of about 11%. Couple important things to note. I mean we have very deliberately been positioning our portfolio to increase our private pay as we are in what we believe is a generally cyclical high in Medicare reimbursements for skilled nursing assets. And I think that's an important aspect of our strategy. Most of our sniffs are with Kindred who, as Ray mentioned, corporately has a very strong balance sheet and the corporate coverage of pro forma after the RehabCare acquisition is about 2x EBITDAR to rent at the corporate level. And so if there was any change in reimbursement for the skilled nursing portfolio, let's say in the 0% to 10% reduction range, we would still have fantastic corporate coverage of our Kindred leases and a 5% cut, frankly, just at nursing home level, changes coverage on the Kindred overall leases by, call it, 15 basis points, something like that. So we're in a great position. These are seasoned leases that Kindred's been growing EBITDAR in over a long period of time, really, since 2001. And so that's the beauty of really being in this protected position with a great tenant.", "Raymond Lewis", "And it's important to note that what Debbie is talking about there assumes no mitigation on the part of the operator. So those are just sort of the gross numbers.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, just a big whack off the top that falls to the bottom line, which, again, we're in a luxurious position of taking a wait-and-see approach towards the rule because we are in such a protected position with Kindred's success.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So a couple of things, just back at NHP. I was curious if, I guess one of 2 things, either you have a sense of how much say, $800 million of additional investments, I assume finance totally on the debt side, benefits sort of the implied return or alternatively, if we're going to try -- if you can't give me that number, I just want to ask some questions about how we should think about it.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Well, again, Jerry, when we announced and underwrote the deal, we did assume that NHP did maybe $0.5 billion or so of acquisitions this year. They're ahead of that. We are assuming they're 100% debt-financed because again given the flexibility in both of our balance sheets, that's perfectly -- we still would have tremendous credit statistics. And our long-term cost to debt between the 2 companies for 10 years right now is probably about 5%, if that helps.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, okay. And so when you gave out initial sort of yield numbers, I don't know if you did that specifically or not, you were assuming the $500 million, what -- how did you sort of think about the return on that investment when you started?", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean we assumed the blended rate would be between 8% and 8.5%, which is -- it's about 8%.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, okay. And just on the CMS thing, just to follow up. So the NHP side of that, anything we should be worrying about on that side of the portfolio?", "Raymond Lewis", "No.", "Debra Cafaro", "No.", "Raymond Lewis", "No. Jerry, we did the same analysis on that side that we did on our own portfolio. Again, taking a big whack at the Medicare revenues across the board, if you were to hit them 10% or so, your DARM coverages -- EBITDARM coverages would be down about 15 basis points from the 2x roughly where they are right now, 2.25x where they are right now.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I thought the NHP coverage was about 1.9%. Just what they just put out.", "Raymond Lewis", "Well on the EBITDARM side.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, okay. Before management fee. Okay, okay.  And just, Debbie, you had -- previously talked about doing acquisitions with Atria but I haven't really heard you put Sunrise so much in that same bucket before. When you talk about Sunrise, you come at buying out more maybe joint ventures that they have or are you talking about new acquisitions that they might be making ", "with you?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think -- we think that Sunrise and Atria are fantastic high-quality operators, and we would be pleased to grow frankly with both of them on the senior housing operating side. And one of the benefits of the NHP acquisition is that it really creates capacity for us to continue to do so. And so I could see -- Mark [Mark Ordan] has -- Mark and Sunrise have been so successful at raising money and really turning the company around that they may not need us. They may do everything on balance sheet, but we would hope that if appropriate opportunities presented themselves, that we could potentially do some more business with Sunrise as well as Atria.", "Raymond Lewis", "And, Jerry, I just want to go back to that last question because I did misspeak. It would be 15 basis points on a 5% cut, 30 basis points on a 10% cut. So I just want to clarify that.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, okay. Last thing, just on acquisitions. Are there new sectors that you might look at like life science and that sort of thing or when you talk about across the spectrum, thinking about the current buckets that you're in?", "Raymond Lewis", "We said all along, Jerry, I think that we're interested in continuing to grow and diversify our portfolio into new spaces and adjacent spaces where they make sense. The life sciences area is a great area. We're not invested in that right now. If we found the right platform opportunity or partnership opportunity with an experienced player in that space, it's definitely something we would pursue and be interested in. We think we've got a lot of runway in the areas that we're playing in right now. Certainly, the seniors housing space is growing and is still highly fragmented. Same with the medical office building space. So with our regional originations capabilities that are coming along with NHP and our large transactions capabilities, we've got plenty of growth opportunity in what we're doing right now. But if we can find the right opportunity in another space with the right partner or the right platform, we would absolutely look at it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Milam with Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "My first question, can you just talk a little bit  as you approach the Atria closing, how you're thinking about the debt refis there. Are you still thinking about doing secured, to refi some of that secured debt, and what would be the timing be on something like that if that's what you did?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean we've essentially pre-funded Atria other than a small amount of secured debt that we'll be paying off at the closing, which is maybe a couple hundred million dollars, and that really we would expect to put on our revolver in the near-term and ultimately again given -- depending on what the bond market looks like, we would consider taking out longer-term with the fixed rate paper. So we've done most of that work already with the $300 million that we paid down in early March, and there's a little bit more that we would expect to pay off at the closing.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "So are you assuming some secured debt when that closes or you're...", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, definite -- Yes, I'm sorry, we've announced -- there was originally about $1.3 billion of secured debt and we'll be paying down. We'll be assuming most of it and paying down a little bit of it.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay, thanks. My second question is on the MOB portfolio. The first thing, it looks like even though NOI was off the margin decline a little bit, I wondered if that is just -- if that's just sort of normal variance or if there was something else going on there? And then, also, could you give us a little color on the non-stabilized part of that portfolio and what you think as occupancy catches up that can contribute in terms of NOI?", "Raymond Lewis", "Well, with respect to the margin question, it's really -- we acquired 5 additional properties at the end of 2010. So this is the first quarter they're reflected which have gross leases which are lower margin properties, so that's really the bulk of the impact on the margin. And then with respect to the pre-stabilized assets, I'll let my colleague, Todd Lillibridge, talk a little bit about what we're seeing on the leasing front.", "Todd Lillibridge", "Yes, we -- on the leasing front, really, to take out the portfolio, both consolidated and -- consolidated first, we're still enjoying a robust occupancy on our stable consolidated, a little over 94%, and we see that continuing throughout the year. With respect to integrating in our lease ups, we're about 91%, headed towards about 92% for the year. With regard to our unconsolidated portfolio, we're about 85%. And actually, we're getting a fair amount of leasing in that portfolio as well. We have about 275,000-some-odd leasing activity for the first quarter, of about 70% of that are leases that have actually been signed or offered signature. So we see an uptick in the leasing activity here in the last 6 months, but we've also deployed a very aggressive leasing program that we launched at the end of last year. We're starting to see some of the fruits of that as we push forward. So we think we're going to see some pickup in our unconsolidated and our NOIs over the course of the year.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay. I guess my question, just looking at the supplemental, the non-stabilized consolidated MOBs for the first quarter, the occupancy, is that a 74%", "on fixed assets?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay. Is that what, Todd, you were talking about or...", "Todd Lillibridge", "Yes, what do we have -- those are our 6 lease ups. And then we have our consolidateds with EBITDARM.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay, thank you. Just my last question quickly. Can you guys just give us a little guidance on the Medicare debt repayment? Is there a gain associated with that, that you're including in your guidance?", "Debra Cafaro", "I can do that. We were -- we had a first mortgage position in the Medicare debt of about $112 million. We were repaid on that in April. We will receive a gain on that in the second quarter, but all of that gain is essentially just moving what was already in our full year projections into the second quarter. So it was already in our projections sort of over the balance of the year, it will all be lumped into one quarter instead of the balance of the year. So that's just a timing difference.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "First of all, I just want to know if someone's going to get Walter's bed or are you going to turning that into a memorial?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, for those of you who don't know about Walter [Walter Breuning], we had the honor of having the world's oldest man and a very fine gentleman living in one of our communities in Montana. And he recently passed away after an incredible life. And so that was why they reported in the press, and we miss him. So...", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "It was a great story. I just didn't want it to go unnoticed...", "Debra Cafaro", "I agree. I agree. We should all have such a great life.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Now that I've loosened you up a little bit. I'm curious in terms of guidance why Atria is in there and NHP is not.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, because we're going to up -- as we said when we announced the deal, we're going to update you on NHP guidance, and full company guidance, obviously, after we close Atria and as we get closer to the NHP closing, so we know more about timing and other puts and takes in the transaction. But we did announce what we think is 2-ish percent annualized accretion. And as we refine all of the projections, we will come out to you with the full company guidance on a total $23 billion enterprise kind of basis.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And reading through the background of the transaction, which was, as expected, a lot of back-and-forth, can you say if company A and company B, as they're described in the documentation, are restricted from getting re-involved in NHP because of the exclusivities that were involved?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, what I can tell you is that we are -- it is interesting reading, we did very thorough diligence and NHP conducted a very robust process. And we're looking forward to closing the merger as soon as we can on the terms that we've announced.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Can I -- just turning to your pro forma 70% of the portfolio being private pay, can you define that for me? Did that include all of Medical Office, for example? How did you calculate 70%?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, and in fact, as we talked about before, Rich, if you really look through the portfolio, it's probably more than that. And I'll explain why. We calculated very simply, which is to say we take out the LPAC [ph] and we take out the skilled nursing NOI. Now as you know and I know, there is a significant portion of both LPAC and the post-acute underlying of EBITDAR that is also from kind of managed care and private pay sources. And if we included that as private pay, the 70% would actually go higher. But it's basically our whole portfolio minus sniffs in LPAC, which I think is a rough but fair way to present the private pay.", "Raymond Lewis", "And that will include the count for about 11% of that, Rich, just to sort of put a finer point on it.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, thank you. And then my last question is on", "the prospects for future transaction activity. I know, obviously, you and others have been very visible and very active. And understanding that you still have balance sheet room to continue the process of going out and looking for deals, can you comment on what may be viewed as the diminishing returns of getting bigger as an organization, and why not let the portfolio kind of grow from this level once you close NHP and Atria? And why you think getting you even bigger from that point may still be a reasonable direction to go?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think -- a couple of reasons. There are times in the external environment and in a company's life where you are in the right quadrant to grow. I am a big believer in sort of looking forward to the external environment and as you know sort of hitting the balls that are thrown to you. And right now, I think there is a great confluence of factors that get Ventas in the right quadrant and give us a lot of opportunities to grow. And they start really with the fact that this is a very large fragmented market that's undergoing a lot of change. And it's a very dynamic market, a lot of consolidation. The -- and that generally creates opportunities. There is attractive access to get capital. As I mentioned, you know, if you can do a 10-year bond deal at 5%, that's historically very attractive capital. And it's our job to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves to us and then change as and when market conditions change. And right now, we're in the quadrant where there are opportunities that will create value for share holders as we build the enterprise. And while that environment exists, it's our obligation, I would argue, to work as hard as we can for shareholders in that environment to get the best opportunities to build long-term value. And that's what we're doing, and that's why we're working so hard right now to move forward. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Just kind of couple of Sunrise questions. First of all, occupancy declined sequentially Q4 to Q1. Should I just chalk that up to normal seasonal move-out activity?", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes, I think that's right, Rob.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Nothing unusually soft?", "Raymond Lewis", "No.", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean I think it's consistent with or better industry trends than as reported by now.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "And then the other question, can you just remind, I forget this, Sunrise, is their pricings done on renewal or on January 1, typically?", "Raymond Lewis", "It's a mixture of both, Rob. So about 75% of the portfolio is on a annual basis in January and the balance is on the anniversary of the lease term.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Okay. So you had a nice bump I noticed in the ADR from Q4 to Q1. There all will still trickle higher, all things being equal through the rest of the year?", "Raymond Lewis", "Well, yes, I think due to a couple of things, one as the anniversary is renewed and then also to the extent that we have some markets where the properties are pretty full. We can start to hopefully push some street rates.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Sekino with Barclays Capital.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital", "I just wanted to get your thoughts, given your long relationship with the Kindred sniffs and the potential if these cuts from seeing us do go through for 12 and we get kind of passed this. There's sort of repricing from both Medicare and even Medicaid. Does this kind of provide you with an opportunity to kind of make some acquisitions maybe on a higher queue with this sniffs facilities? And if this would kind of change your view with sniffs going forward?", "Debra Cafaro", "That's an astute question I would say. We do believe that skilled nursing assets are good assets and particularly the kind of assets that Kindred and some other quality operators operate in the post-acute stage. So we've continued to say that sniffs are low-cost providers and with good operators and the right structure, the right pricing the right capital structure position, yet we're happy to be an owner. And I think that what we -- and this is partly based on our history as you say that goes back to the balanced budget act when we started with Kindred and we were 100% government-reimbursed asset, is that we tend to rightly or wrongly shy away from investing when we believe, again, rightly or wrongly, that you're at a cyclical high in reimbursement rates. And so as this new repricing and sort of resetting the bar comes about for good quality skilled nursing assets, we certainly would consider investing in them at the right price, right structure, right operator, et cetera, without losing our focus on continuing to have a diversified balanced portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Cooney with KBW.", "Daniel Cooney - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "If we could just kind of go back to the Sunrise margins, it looks like they expanded about 80 basis points on a same-store basis. What would the margin change have been if you kind of adjusted to exclude the management fee structure change? I guess maybe a better way is if you kind of exclude management fees, what was maybe the increase in property level operating expenses?", "Raymond Lewis", "Dan, I think that margins would have been I think relatively flat with the exclusion of the management fees.", "Daniel Cooney - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then just one more question, if you can maybe update us on your kind of longer-term plans for the Hearthstone portfolio, maybe just in terms of executing the right to terminate that lease? Just -- if there's any update there.", "Raymond Lewis", "No, Dan. We've been down in Houston meeting with Hearthstone, getting the lay of the land, understanding what the challenges and opportunities are in that portfolio. We want to be thoughtful about how we approach the situation and make sure that before we make any decisions about what we want to do with the portfolio, have a clear understanding of not only the challenges across the business level but at the asset level. And so we're doing a lot of work on that front right now. And I think any other thoughts or commentary would be premature. But we're assessing the situation. And it's a stable situation and now the question is how do we drive value through the portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Truxillo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Thomas Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Obviously, you guys have a lot of moving parts in your balance sheet right and I just have a few questions about some of those parts and in your financial policy in general. I appreciate the comments on refinancing some of that Atria secured debt and financing NHP acquisition with pipeline with debt as well. NHP also has some near-term maturities and borrowings under its credit facility. Can you talk about what your plans for that debt?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I mean, look, here's -- I just want -- here's the key takeaway. The combination of Ventas, Atria and NHP is an incredible credit-positive for Ventas. It does -- and both Atria and NHP are being done in the most balance sheet-friendly fashion. And so we're more diversified. We have a terrific balance sheet, and we really don't have any sort of near-term funding risks. I think to your specific point, we would expect to do kind of debt-for-debt replacement on the NHP front, and they are very, very low leverage. They have virtually no secured debt whatsoever. So putting these 3 pieces together work beautifully. And on a pro forma basis with all 3 of them, the credit stats, which we've kind of published, are still the kind of credit stats that should get us an upgrade, which is again why I think the rating agencies have all indicated positive momentum toward improved ratings. And we'll be happy to talk you about the specifics off-line.", "Thomas Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Just real quickly on the rating agencies and the upgrades. Given your increased scale and diversification that these acquisitions get you and that strong balance sheet, the strongest in the sector that you've talked about, do you have any sense of how high in that scale you could get and where you would want to be?", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Earnings Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Manager, Investor Relations and Capital Markets, Mr. David Smith. Sir, you may proceed.", "David Smith", "Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas' conference call to review the company's announcement today, regarding its results for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions, and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

", "Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure as well as the company's supplementary disclosed schedule are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com. ", "I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, our Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks, David, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to this morning's call. Today's call is to report on our results and activities for the quarter ended June 30, but we'll also discuss the impact of our NHP acquisition, which closed July 1, as you know. ", "Ventas has been in an intense period of growth and portfolio construction to create a strong and balanced enterprise. With the recent closing of our Atria and NHP acquisitions, we're now a highly diversified enterprise with scale and over 1,300 healthcare and senior housing assets. We derived almost 70% of our projected annualized NOI from private pay sources, we own or manage a coast-to-coast $14 million square foot medical office building business and we enjoy a combination of high-quality tenant operators, asset mix, operating models and geographic reach. ", "Our aim with all these activities is to deliver consistent superior risk-adjusted returns to stakeholders. At this point in the year, we are at or slightly ahead of where we expected to be. We believe that consistent superior risk-adjusted return, followed from owning a balanced and diversified portfolio of high-quality senior housing and healthcare assets weighted heavily towards private pay revenue sources, a meaningful exposure to senior housing operating assets located in major metropolitan markets designed to provide lift in a growing economy and limited downside in a slower one, well-covered triple-net leases that should deliver reliable cash flow growth from contractual escalations year-in and year-out and outstanding balance sheet with improving ratings, low debt cost and excellent access to a variety of debt markets, scale to absorb large acquisitions and attract global investment capital, relationships with customers and an investment team that can grow earnings and assets, across this array of sizes, asset types and structures, a cohesive leadership team with continuity and a conservative well-covered dividend with opportunity for future increases. ", "At the same time, we recognize the imperative of delivering positive near-term results and as such, we're pleased to announced 13% normalized FFO per share growth to $0.80 a share in the second quarter and to increase our full-year guidance to a range of $3.17 to $3.23 per fully diluted share. If achieved, these results would represent double-digit year-over-year growth. ", "As all of you know, we continue, consistent with our history, to be focused on managing risk in our balance sheet as we grow. We believe the winning combination for shareholders is coupling earnings growth with reduced risk through continued diversification, financial strength and flexibility. ", "Since the closing of the NHP acquisition, we have obtained 2 ratings upgrades, to high to middle BBB and the endorsement from the bond market of our strategy. Continuing to lower our cost of debt and increase our assets to multiple capital markets is a significant predicate for success in our business. ", "Today, I'd like to describe what Ventas looks like now and our prospects for the future, my colleagues Ray Lewis, will discuss our portfolio performance and investment outlook;  Rich Schweinhart will provide a detailed review of our quarterly financial results and Rick Riney will update you on the pending HCP litigation. Following our remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "So here are some of the highlights of how we see the Ventas business now pro forma for NHP, and our views of macro-trends. As a result of our deliberate strategy, we now  derive almost 70% of our NOI from private pay sources. Our private pay business includes 117 high-quality private pay seniors housing assets managed by Atria we acquired in May, as well as our 79 Sunrise managed assets. This private pay component has increased from about 55% only 2 years ago. ", "We are a highly diversified healthcare REIT by tenant manager, asset class, operating model and geography. Our portfolio consists of over 1,300 properties across 47 states and 2 Canadian provinces. Our largest tenant, Kindred Healthcare, which now represents only 19% of our net operating income, is the largest, most diversified provider of post acute-care in the United States, with a business model that includes long-term acute care hospitals, in-patient rehab hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. ", "We have also worked to intentionally diversify our business by operating segments. We derived about 1/4 of our NOI from our high-quality private pay seniors housing assets located in major metropolitan areas managed by Sunrise and Atria. These assets, best quality, best market and great managers are in a management structure rather than a lease because they should provide lift in a growing economy. We also derive strength from a stable and reliable triple net lease portfolio that represents approximately 62% of our NOI and also includes private pay seniors housing and should provide consistent contractual cash flow growth. Through our investment strategy, we have significantly reduced the portion of our business derived from skilled nursing assets to about 1/4 of our NOI. ", "Medical Office Buildings round out the diversification picture with 11% of our NOI coming from Medical Office Buildings, 90% of which are on the campus of well-regarded hospitals and health systems around the country. As the largest owner of seniors housing in the United States, we do business with the leaders of the industry including, Sunrise Senior Living, the only globally recognized brand in seniors housing; Atria, the fourth largest assisted-living operator in the U.S; and Brookdale, the largest provider of senior care in the country. ", "The senior living business continues to be characterized by constrained supply, with construction starts declining sequentially to 1.1% of inventory, and demand from the over 85 demographic that is growing at 3x the rate of the total population. We believe this positive supply-demand fundamentals in senior housing will provide benefits to Ventas. ", "As one of the largest publicly traded REITs, our enterprise should generate over $1.3 billion of annualized NOI. Our feel for diversification private pay focus and strong balance sheet have resulted in 2 credit upgrades. Specifically in July, Fitch upgraded Ventas to BBB+ and Moody's upgraded us to Baa2. Bondholders also understand that we are reducing risk as we grow and rewarded our activities in May, when we closed a successful $700 million 10-year unsecured bond yield priced at 165 over treasury.  We intend to continue along this path of moving up the credit curve and driving down our debt cost. ", "Our pro forma credit profile remains outstanding with net debt to EBITDA at approximately 5x and fixed charge coverage exceeding 3x, both pro forma for NHP. With our recent acquisitions, we have increased our customer relationships by 6x, and we believe that those customers will be a continuing source of investment activity going forward. ", "Our new relationship with Atria, provides another source of potential growth. Ventas' large deal capabilities and track record, its relationships with tenants and operators and the addition of NHP's regional investment platform all should position Ventas to capitalize on any opportunity in the $1 trillion healthcare and senior housing real estate market. ", "Regarding skilled nursing assets and recent changes to Medicare reimbursement. After being involved in the healthcare real estate industry for over 12 years, there are few things that I can say with certainty. First, skilled nursing facilities represent an integral component of our nation's healthcare delivery system, particularly for the elderly. Skilled nursing also tends to be a low cost provider of care, which will be a benefit to the asset class over the long term. And finally, reimbursement goes in cycles and changes every single year. As a result, we have taken a consistent, and I believe realistic view, of skilled nursing investments over the years. That is, at the right time, right price with the right operator and right structure, these assets can provide very good risk-adjusted return to real estate investors and should be a part of a diversified healthy real estate portfolio. But there are periods of volatility for the operators that occur apathetically, such as the one we saw on Friday and Monday. Remember that as a landlord, we are in a super senior secured position in tenants capital structure. Our earnings are not affected by changes in Medicare reimbursement, and we have well-covered skilled nursing assets, primarily in highly structured master leases. ", "As reimbursement changes year-to-year, and particularly when large changes are adopted, it generally takes time for the full effect of the new rules and rates to become clear. The key point is that Ventas is in a very sound position with this portfolio with both increased diversification of our tenant base and well-covered leases. ", "In conclusion, we have built a business that is designed to prosper in any economic reimbursement and capital markets environment. We have enunciated and executed a differentiated strategy that was designed to make the company more private pay, more diverse, larger and stronger. So we should do well starting with internal growth from our diversified portfolio of productive healthcare and senior housing assets, external growth from investments, opportunities to refinance our debt at lower rates and the prospect of a growing well-covered dividend. Our job is to execute this business plan and realize on the benefits of our platform with the same focus and commitment to stakeholders we have demonstrated in the past. Ray?", "Raymond Lewis", "Thank you, Debbie. As Debbie mentioned, with the closing of Atria in the second quarter and now NHP at the beginning of the third quarter, Ventas' portfolio is diversified across 1,300 high-quality healthcare seniors housing assets in 47 states and 2 Canadian provinces. ", "With nearly 70% of our NOI coming from private pay assets, the majority of our income coming from long-term triple-net leases with contractual escalations and the growth that comes from our seniors housing operating portfolio, Ventas is well positioned to provide reliable and growing cash flows to our investors. ", "During the second quarter 2011, our same-store portfolio of 499 properties delivered another strong quarter of internal growth with NOI increasing 2.6% over 2010. Adjusting for $3 million of cash payments received from Sunrise in the 2010 comparison period, our cash NOI growth would rise to 4.5% year-over-year. So our portfolio continues to deliver strong cash flow growth. ", "Today, I'd like to share some of the second quarter portfolio performance highlights and finish with a few comments on acquisitions and the external environment.  Let's start with our triple-net lease portfolio, which is diversified across the seniors housing and post-acute asset classes and accounted for 53% of Ventas' NOI during the second quarter of 2011. This percentage increases to approximately 62% with the closing of NHP. ", "Cash NOI to Ventas in the second quarter on the 393 same-store triple-net lease portfolio grew 2.7% over the prior year, benefiting from our annual rent escalations. This performance is consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year, which projected triple-net same-store cash NOI growth in excess of 2.5%. ", "Coverage has remained strong and stable across the whole triple-net portfolio with EBITDARM  covering rent at approximately 1.7x in the first quarter of 2011, the latest date available. Notably, our seniors housing triple-net portfolio coverage was strong and stable during the first quarter at 1.3x. And coverage increased 10 basis points sequentially in each of our skilled nursing and hospital triple-net portfolio to 1.9x and 2.3x, respectively. ", "As you know, most of our skilled nursing and hospital assets are leased to Kindred Healthcare, the largest post-acute provider in the U.S, with over $6 billion in annual revenues and equity market capitalization of over $500 million and strong corporate credit. ", "On July 29, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services are now on its final ruling on reimbursements for skilled nursing providers in the 2012 fiscal year, which take effect beginning in October of 2011. These new rates result in a reduction of Medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing of 11.1% on average. On a positive note, on August 1, CMS released its final rule for 2012 long-term acute-care hospital reimbursement. Under this new rule, LTAC reimbursement is projected to increase 2.5% beginning in October of this year, a significant improvement over the 1.9% increase that CMS recommended in May. ", "Each of our 4 pooled multi-facility master leases with Kindred, contain both skilled nursing and LTACs, approximately 37% of Ventas' current Kindred rent is attributed to the LTACs. ", "It's important to note that when estimating the potential impact of the new Medicare reimbursements, it's necessary to isolate your analysis to the period after October of 2010, when RUG-IV was implemented. After giving effect to the new rates and not considering any mitigation or other impacts, we estimate the EBITDARM coverage on Ventas' entire Kindred post-acute portfolio would be reduced by approximately 20 basis points to a still very healthy 1.9x during the period that RUG-IV was in effect. This demonstrates the power of our pooled multi-facility master leases with Kindred, which are structured to withstand the ebbs and flows of reimbursements over time. So as you can see, Ventas' well-seasoned Kindred leases provide ample coverage and remain very secure. ", "Subsequent to the closing of NHP, Ventas announced that it has leased 32 assets formerly operated by Hearthstone Senior Living to Senior Care. Senior Care, which is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky has been a tenant of Ventas since 2006, and is a top 20 operator of seniors housing with a national footprint and an excellent operating track record. Since 2006, Senior Care has simultaneously increased occupancy into Ventas assisted-living portfolio by 1,200 basis points, an average monthly rate by 32%, in spite of one of the worst economic environments in U.S. history. Under the new 15-year lease, Senior Care will pay $28.5 million of rent in the first lease year rising to $30 million in the second lease year, which is consistent with our underwritten expectations when we acquired NHP. ", "So the triple-net lease portfolio continues to perform well and provide a stable and growing cash flow base to our portfolio. And with NHP, the majority of our  leased properties are structured in pooled multi-facility master leases with credit support and have a weighted average remaining lease term of nearly 7 years. So we expect to be able to continue to deliver reliable and growing cash flows from this portfolio, as we have in the past. ", "Now let's turn to our private pay seniors housing operating portfolio, which included 196 assets at quarter's end. During the second quarter, we completed the Atria acquisition, which added 117 high-quality seniors housing communities, located primarily in affluent, high barrier-to-entry coastal markets to our existing portfolio of 79 assisted-living mansion communities managed by Sunrise. ", "Our seniors housing operating assets accounted for 39% of our annualized NOI for the second quarter, and are expected to be about 25% of our annualized NOI going forward, with the closing of NHP in July. ", "Starting with the Sunrise portfolio. Our 79 high-quality mansion-style properties turned in another solid quarter, generating $39.5 million of NOI, the second highest quarterly figure since we acquired the portfolio in 2007. This represents year-over-year growth of 5.3%, after adjusting for $3 million of cash payments received in the second quarter of 2010 and equalizing the management fees during the comparison period. In addition, average occupancy for the entire portfolio during the second quarter was 89.4% and spot occupancy for the entire portfolio as of the end of July was 90%. ", "Sequential performance of the Sunrise assets was also quite strong, as NOI increased 8.8% and margin was up 220 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Performance was driven by a combination of a 1.2% increase in average daily rate and lower expenses. ", "For the 78 properties in our same-store stabilized portfolio during the second quarter, occupancy was up 80 basis points, average daily rate was up 4.3% and NOI, including the previously mentioned adjustments for cash payments in management fees was up 4.7% year-over-year. So our Sunrise portfolio continues to perform well as we move into the third quarter, and we are reaffirming our full-year guidance of $152 million to $157 million. ", "Now let's turn to the Atria portfolio, which we closed on May 12. Looking at June, our first full month of operation, average occupancy in the total portfolio, including the 7 redevelopment properties was 86.8% and trending positively through July. Total portfolio NOI for June was $16.1 million. Occupancy in the 110 property stabilized portfolio was 87% and NOI was $15.3 million.  The 7 properties in our redevelopment portfolio continue to lease up nicely, and we're at 83.4% in the month of June. NOI for June in the redevelopment portfolio was about $800,000. ", "One of the key value drivers in the Atria portfolio is the pipeline of opportunities to refurbish and reprogram older buildings in high barrier-to-entry, high-end continental locations. As I mentioned, trends on the 7 redevelopment assets that are currently in lease of are quite positive with strong leasing momentum and NOI growth. For example, our high-end independent and assisted-living redevelopment on West 86th street in New York reached 93% occupancy in June. Also, Atria of Hudson, our 122 unit green assisted living building in Westchester County, which opened in April achieved 50% spot occupancy in July. ", "So performance in our Atria portfolio is tracking our expectations and now that the transaction is closed, we are reaffirming our guidance for the second half of the year at $93 million to $98 million, consistent with the full-year range that we provided in March. ", "Now I'd like to touch on our Medical Office Building portfolio. Ventas own portfolio of Medical Office Building, included 127 properties standing $7.6 million square feet and accounted for 7% of our NOI during the second quarter. Approximately 90% of our MOBs are on campus and affiliated with investment grade health systems. ", "Our 63 property consolidated MOB portfolio turned in another consistent quarter of performance. Occupancy was at 93.4%, was down 80 basis points and NOI at $13.5 million was even on a sequential basis. The 6 properties in our consolidated nonstabilized portfolio told a similar story in the second quarter. Occupancy at 74.7% was up 50 basis points and there's continued positive leasing momentum heading into the third quarter. NOI at $2.0 million was level sequentially. ", "With the closing of NHP, we now have ownership in over 230 MOBs and manage approximately 14 million square feet accounting for 10% of our portfolio NOI. This makes Ventas the largest fully integrated medical office owner, manager and developer in the country. And with the strategic relationship with specific medical building and the $1 billion proprietary development pipeline that comes with it, we have a coast-to-coast footprint and deep relationships with over 50 investor-owned and not for profit health systems. So MOB has continued to be an important and growing part of our business. ", "Before turning the call over to Rich Schweinhart, I'd like to briefly discuss the acquisitions environment. With the closing of NHP at the beginning of July, Ventas has closed approximately $11 billion of acquisitions in the first half of 2011. And while we are laser-focused on a smooth integration of this important transactions, we also remain active on the acquisitions front. ", "Our pipeline remains active across the asset classes we invest in, particularly in seniors housing and medical office. We are seeing particularly strong deal flow in the small and midsized transaction, which plays well into our regional acquisitions capability that we acquired as part of the NHP transaction. Year-to-date, the NHP originations platform has closed over $600 million of transactions and yield an excess of 8%. Importantly, these transactions were mostly with local and regional operators that represent new relationships for Ventas. ", "As we have said in the past the combination of Ventas' large transaction capability and NHP's regional origination network enable Ventas to compete on both large and small transactions, and deliver consistent and accretive transaction volume for our shareholders. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich Schweinhart, who will provide you with an overview of the second quarter financial. Rick?", "Richard Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. Major events for the quarter were on May 12, we purchased Atria Senior Living, by paying 25 million shares and assumed net debt of $1.6 billion. We also borrowed funds on our revolver to pay the remaining $150 million of the purchase price. Atria's results are included in our consolidated statements of income for the period from May 12 to June 30. ", "On May 17, the company issued $700 million of 4.75% senior notes due June 1, 2021. That same day, $600 million of the proceeds was loaned to Nationwide Health at 5%.  On July 1, with the acquisition of NHP, the loan and the associated interest income terminated. In April, we received proceeds from repayment of one of our mortgage loans receivable totaling $112.4 million. We recognized income of $3.3 million on debt repayment and the income from loans and investment plan. Net income was scheduled to be recognized over the remainder of 2011, and was in our 2011 guidance. ", "Second quarter 2011 normalized FFO was $0.80 per diluted share, an increase of 13% compared to the second quarter of 2010, per share results of $0.71. Normalized FFO increased 26.5% to $142 million compared to last year's second quarter of $112 million. Normalized FFO in the second quarter excludes $41 million, composed primarily of margin related expenses and deal cost, partially offset by a $6 million income tax benefit and $9 million change in fair value of interest rate swaps.  ", "Second quarter normalized FFO increased from last year's second quarter due to NOI increases in all 3 of our segments: triple-net, seniors housing, operating and medical office, as well as income from loans and investments. Triple-net lease revenues grew to $120.1 million from $117.4 million last year, primarily due to contractual escalations. Seniors housing operating NOI increased $26.9 million,  $26.2 million due to the Atria acquisition, and the balance due to our Sunrise managed portfolio. The Sunrise managed portfolio grew to $39.5 million this quarter from $38.8 million last year. Due to the Lillibridge acquisition on July 1 of 2010, second quarter medical office property group NOI grew to $18.7 million, including $1.4 million in unconsolidated joint ventures from $8 million last year. ", "Looking at sequential results, normalized FFO increased $21 million to this quarter's $141.5 million from the first quarter's $121 million. The principal reason for the increase is the Atria acquisition, whose partial quarter NOI for May 12 to June 30 totaled $26.2 million. There was sequential improvement in the triple-net segment of $1.5 million and Sunrise managed portfolio of $3.2 million and an income from loans and investments of $2.3 million.  Medical office NOI in the second quarter of 2011 of $18.7 million was up slightly compared to first quarter of $18.4 million. ", "Interest expense increased by $11.2 million from the second quarter compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the Atria-related assumed mortgages, borrowings for that acquisition and our newly issued senior notes. ", "We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flows from operations. At June 30, our cash balance was $26.7 million, and we had $139.5 million outstanding on our $1 billion revolving credit facility, for a net liquidity exceeding $875 million. Our credit stands at June 30, were net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA at 5.6x, our fixed charge coverage ratio at 3x, and debt-to-enterprise value 34%. More importantly, because of the large equity component of the NHP acquisition on July 1, net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA is anticipated to be approximately 5x, Our fixed charge coverage ratio better than 3x and our debt to enterprise value approximately 29%.  ", "Because of this credit improvement in July, Fitch Ratings upgraded Ventas to BBB+ stable, Moody's has upgraded Ventas to Baa2 stable and S&P affirmed Ventas at BBB- with a positive outlook. ", "Weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter at 178 million shares increased 13% over the second quarter of last year and 10% over the 162 million in the first quarter. At June 30, shares outstanding were 188 million. ", "Let me also mention several events that occurred after quarter end. In June, we called $200 million of our 6.5% senior notes due June 1, 2016. The transaction closed in July. Also in June, we declared a pro rata dividend in connection with the NHP acquisition, totaling $23.8 million. These financial statements include the accrual of that dividend, the payment was made in July.  On July 1, we acquired Nationwide Health Properties, which will be included in our third quarter financial statements. Also in July, we repaid NHP's 6.5% senior notes due July 15, 2011, in the amount of $339 million. ", "We are increasing our 2011 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance to $3.17 to $3.23 from $3.06 to $3.14. This increase reflects affirming our Sunrise managed portfolio guidance and from $152 million to $157 million, affirming our Atria NOI projection at an annualized rate from $186 million to $196 million, which equates to second half 2011 NOI to be between $93 million to $98 million, and our initial NHP projection. ", "Normalized FFO per share guidance includes the acquisition of Atria Senior Living and Nationwide Health Properties, but does not include among other things, the acquisition of unannounced acquisitions or divestiture activities deal costs, capital transactions, losses on extinguishment of debt, FX gains and losses, noncash mark-to-market derivative income and expense, noncash income tax expense or benefit, litigation expense or proceeds are the reversal of or incurrence of contingent consideration and liabilities. Because of the increase in the FFO and weighted share count, it is possible that the full-year computation of FFO per diluted share could be as much as $0.03 higher than the sum of the 4 reported quarters. ", "And now, I'll turn the call to Rick Riney, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel.", "T. Riney", "Thanks, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We know investors have an interest in the existing HCP litigation. So I want to take a few moments to explain the current posture of the case and provide an update on the facts to date. ", "We have an existing $102 million judgment and pending punitive damages filed against HCP. The punitive damage trial is scheduled for February 21, 2012, in the United States District Court here in Louisville. Our claims against HCP concerned towards its interference with our 2007 acquisition of Sunrise REIT. ", "Each court and jury that has considered the case, 5 in total, have ruled in Ventas' favor, 2 Canadian courts, the United States District Court, the Federal Jury Verdicts, and the Sixth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals had all ruled in Ventas' favor. ", "At the end of the quarter, the Sixth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals denied HCP's request for a rehearing. The latest decision in the Sixth Circuit federal Court of Appeals provided 2 favorable rulings. First, the Court of Appeals affirmed our jury verdict against HCP for $102 million, which is secured by a letter of credit. Secondly, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the United States District Court for trial on the single issue of punitive damages. ", "In his opinion the court stated that, and I quote, \"the record is replete with evidence of intentional misrepresentations, deceit and/or concealment of material facts by HCP.\" ", "The court also stated and again I quote, \"We, the Court, also believe that a reasonable jury could conclude that HCP engaged in its fraudulent conduct with the intention of inflicting harm on Ventas.\" ", "The Commonwealth of Kentucky does not have a statutory cap on the amount of punitive damages that a jury may award. We will continue to act as a fiduciary for our stakeholders as we have in the past and make sound business decisions about the litigation. ", "Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of James Milam of Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "My first question, you guys talked a little bit about the balance sheet activity, I was just wondering if you could give us a little color on where you guys stand in terms of cash in line of credit and if there are any needs to extend the duration of some of the debt that's outstanding now post-quarter close.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. Dave, we have over $1 billion in liquidity under our line credit facility, and it's our intention, at some point in the second half of the year, to increase and extend our existing revolving credit facility. Hopefully on very favorable terms.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay. So with the repayment of the NHP debt and the calling of your notes, there wasn't an increase in -- I mean I guess there is no -- I guess what you just said there's $1 billion of available in your line of credit, so there isn't a substantial need to extend rates on any other outstanding debt line now? So...", "Debra Cafaro", "Right. Remember, that we -- NHP got an $800 million term loan prior to the closing that we have the benefit of, at LIBOR plus 150, so that we have expanded capacity now. So that's why we have over $1 billion of availability.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Got it. Okay. The second question is just on the guidance. Is the increase primarily related to the timing of the NHP acquisition and the deal that the regional team there has done prior to closing? Or is there anything else that is pushing that mid point up for you guys?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean there are a variety of things, and they would include those that you mentioned, which are the timing of the deal, more investment activity than we had projected and the overall lower capital costs.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay. And then just my last one on the senior housing portfolio. You guys, obviously, your expectation remains sort of 5% growth out of that portfolio, I was wondering if you could just break down for me, how that splits out in terms of stabilized assets, where you just expect better rate versus the growth you expect from some of the assets that need to stabilize, so to fill up the redevelopment portfolio.", "Raymond Lewis", "James, as we said before, the fill-up in redevelopment portfolio is providing about $5 million to $10 million of annual income in the Atria portfolio. So that's an important driver of the margin, but the bulk of the growth continues to come through the stabilized portfolios in Sunrise and Atria.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jerry Doctrow of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just a handful of things. Have you had any conversations yet with the rating agencies as to their views on the whole Medicare thing? And have you seen any risk that there's a change to negative outlook of that, just because they're -- by Medicare?", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean we have talked with them and in fact, one of the rating agencies put out a piece on this really when the rule was originally proposed, and the overall view is really the right view for bondholders, which is that if you're a bondholder of Ventas basically you have 3 layers of protection to your bond and all the credits of Ventas are extraordinary, and I think are an important component of the ratings as well. And so, while I think no one would characterize the rule as a positive credit event. I think the rating agencies obviously knew about the proposal and are comfortable with the ratings for Ventas.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And are there any -- sort of to add thinking of the NHP acquired portfolio that we may know a little less well, are there any weak links in there, like operators that are below 1, 2 that could -- I mean while the whole portfolio may be perfectly strong, is there an operator or 2 or some properties that are likely to be put into real distress because of the rate that Medicare changed?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. Thank you for asking that. I mean, Jerry, we have really been fired up about all the different things that we've been doing at Ventas over the last couple of years and over the last 10 years, really to build this stake, strong business, very diversified, try to stay focused, we have great well-covered leases and good diversification even within now the skilled nursing portfolio. So I would tell you that if you look at NHP's last quarter supplemental, which they published, you could see the top 15 tenants there, and you can see that's the EBITDARM coverages for the skilled nursing tenants are quite high. And we've given a composite view of the coverages in the supplemental and it may read so on with a significant cut, and that looks really good. I would tell you in any situation, in any portfolio, you're always going to have a bottom group of stragglers but the key point about everything that we've done with the diversification and so on, is that anything that could happen would be wildly immaterial for the company. And so we feel good about where we are.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And Debbie at NAREIT you talked about maybe being sort of more active asset manager, could we see more divestitures? Is that -- where do you stand sort of in that process?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes good. I think that is a good question as well. And by the way, in the event that we do expect that there could be market opportunities as well, and we'd be very well positioned to take advantage of those, if they do occur in the skilled nursing business. If you go to your next question.", "Raymond Lewis", "So, Jerry, with 1,300 properties, I think there's going to be a much larger number of opportunities to strategically recycle capital in our portfolio, and so we're putting together an active plan right now to sort of go through all of our assets and identify those where we think it's the right time to be selling and monetizing and recycling that capital onto different asset classes. So we think that's another opportunity for us to continue to drive performance in our portfolio over time.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Does the guidance assume any level of divestitures? Or really, really not?", "Debra Cafaro", "No, it doesn't. As a typical it wouldn't include capital transactions or acquisitions or divestitures.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And last thing for me, and I'll jump off. Just pricing, like if you were doing a skilled deal today or even senior housing deal, does these -- or even MOBs for that matter, does, specifically the Medicare stuff but also just what the market's generally less happy feeling about the healthcare in general here. Are you expecting cap rates to be moving higher?", "Debra Cafaro", "As I checked the market, it didn't seem to like anyone this last week or so. I'll let Ray answer that.", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes. So, Jerry, I think consistent with what you've been hearing this week, I think the market is still digesting the information from CMS, with respect to how that's going to impact pricing on skilled nursing transactions. And we, like others, are going to wait and see how that plays out and see what sort of opportunities that present. So I couldn't really tell you what the ultimate impact on pricing is going to be of that development. With respect to general market conditions, it's always been our view and we've stated very consistently that over time, cap rates adjust to changes and cost of capital but there's often a lag and so, depending upon how long conditions persist. It may take some time for the market to adjust to the new cost of capital should they remain in place.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Specter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Here's the first question, Debbie, just maybe to focus on stock. I'm sure that you're a little disappointed today. The quarter was great, the ratings upgrade, you've executed on the deals, what are investors saying to you? What do you think the markets are missing here?", "Debra Cafaro", "I hadn't been looking at the screen this morning, so maybe I'll be disappointed when I get off the call. But look, I mean I think that people are really missing the size, strength, feel and diversification of the business here, all the things that we've been talking about, the positioning of the dividend. Again, if you look back over time and as I mentioned, there are these episodic periods of volatility that investors react to. And at the end of the day, we always cycle through them, and this is one of the reasons we like to have a bulletproof balance sheet. And we like to stay strong and diverse. But this has happened before, and we always kind of weather through it and our job is to execute. Our job is to deliver cash flows, to make good decisions, to really deliver for investors. And I think in the end, if we do that, as we have over the past 10 years, then the stock will follow. And so that's our job.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And can you maybe just reiterate your thoughts on the dividend and the growth potential there over the next year or so?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well I believe that over the past -- since 2004 or so we've grown the dividend by about 8% on occasion basis. And as you know, NHP had one of the lowest payout ratios in the sector. We've actually reduced that somewhat by virtue due to the fact that our dividend was even lower on adjusted basis, and our dividend payout ratio has been the lowest. And therefore, again, if we deliver the cash flows and we continue to grow the business and we have room to increase the dividend and make it continue to grow in a reliable and secure way, I would say that, that certainly is a good investment attribute of Ventas that will be particularly attractive, I would say, in relatively low growth environment that we have with low returns on people's invested capital and money market funds of bonds and the like.", "Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just a last question. Risks in the housing market seem skewed to the downside. Can you just I guess tell us how we should think about that? And the senior housing operating metrics and demand you're seeing?", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes. And I think if you look back over the last several years, where the housing market has been struggling mightily, you'll see that our primarily need driven assisted living and all-timers portfolio in Sunrise has performed and held up quite well on a relative basis to other real estate asset classes and we would expect that to continue going forward. It has proven, I think, through the last cycle to be fairly resilient in the face of challenging housing conditions. We don't see that changing.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Debbie, don't get too worried. Your stock is only down 2.2%, the REITs are down 3% and the broad market is down 3.3%. So...", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Well, thanks for that update. I was wondering if I was going to have to go check the Bloomberg, but thank you.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "In your opening comments, you mentioned one of the things about Ventas and its position today, there was acquisition opportunities, and you said having the ability to do anything in sizes, asset types or structures and combinations thereof. And I'm just curious as you think about your deal activity today, and obviously, the last 18 months of positioning the company through the deals that you have done, I'm just curious where you sort of see that trending over the next 12 months in terms of what your desires of what you want to be doing in terms of size, asset types and structures.", "Debra Cafaro", "I'll let Ray start and then maybe...", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes, I'll start that and yes, Debbie will jump in. So, Michael I think one of the key investment theses in NHP was the regional acquisitions platform, which allows us to hit higher yielding transactions that are basically singles and keep making accretive acquisitions and growing our cash flow externally through all environments. We can't really predict how many or when large transactions are going to emerge. We've certainly been very successful at winning our fair share of those. But the ability to work these 70 relationships that we have and target these local and regional operators and create a consistent flow of attractive yielding investment, I think, is something that we're really excited about with NHP, and something that has proven to be correct in terms of investment thesis so far in our 10 years.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "And I guess, what sort of...", "Debra Cafaro", "Sorry to interrupt, Michael. But also I think we're seeing good acquisition activity potentially on the medical assets building side, which is, again, a very good stable business that -- Todd is here with us. We're seeing some nice smaller size transactions in that business. And I think we'll continue to grow there as well. So that's, I think the best visibility we have really on what the deal flow is likely to look like over the coming quarter or so.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "And then thinking about that for a second. As you go into the back half of the year, is there anything in the back half that sort of gets accelerated as you move into 2012? And just when we look at the back half of guidance adjusting for the share count and the FFO, your back half is about $1.60 to $1.66 per share. And I think you said, yes, the quarter is not going to add to the year because you have a different weighted average share count for the year relative to the back half. So using the $290 million for the back half of the year, you get to this $1.60, $1.66 type range. And so I'm just curious, as then we start to think about 2012, what other sort of drivers are already in place that continue that growth going forward, absent new investment activity?", "Debra Cafaro", "Right. Well obviously we'll have the benefit of a full year of the second half of accretion. We'll have hopefully growth in the Atria and Sunrise businesses, and then we'll have growth in the NHP businesses. And then obviously added to that any potential refinancing activity, any additional synergies that we're able to capture from NHP and then any back half accretive investment activity. So that would be the menu, if you will, of things that could accelerate into 2012.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "And on the G&A front is there -- what sort of volume or what type of amount is that heading into next year versus what you're have in the back half? I think you talked about $15 million of G&A savings. I don't know how much of that is baked in to the back half of the year versus next year.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean I'd say most of it is baked into the back half, and then maybe we can tick up some more going in to 2012.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. And then just last question. Debbie, you're part of Rahm's World Business Chicago. It's a group of 50 people that are pretty extraordinary in their own right, in terms of their diverse business experience and governmental experience that they have. And so I'm just curious if whether you've been together as a group, and what you've learned and what you're hearing from -- pull yourself out of the healthcare and real estate industry for a second, What you sort of hear on the broad economy in the market.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. I was a holdover from Mayor Daley's administration, I think. But anyway, it is really important I think. It's really helpful in my job to get a broader picture of things and that group has a very broad picture of the economy. There was also a group that recently met with the Governor of Illinois to talk about business and wide range manufacture, financial services and things like that. So I would say in my conversations with people that the tone has really shifted broadly from really a bull-iant one in, say, February of this year to obviously one where people have much lower growth expectations, much higher probabilities on the potential for a double dip. And generally are definitely seeing their businesses affected by a slowing economy. And that is more consistent, frankly, with what our view has been for the whole year. And why we think that Ventas really is an attractive investment opportunity, and you could apply that potentially to REITs generally, but if you can really continue to deliver steady reliable growth of growing dividend, low risk, strong balance sheet, not a lot of kind of internal volatility, I think that in the environment that I think we're in and that seems to be the environment that my compatriots outside of healthcare and outside of real estate seem to think we're in, that is going to be a pretty scarce commodity, in my opinion. And so that's where we're positioning the business, and I think it will be attractive to investors. But I do think the macro-trends are soft, is I think probably a good word for that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I just wanted -- I'm lost a little bit on the accretion from NHP. I always thought that the $600 million of year-to-date acquisitions was the number that we have been talking about. Is that -- and you said that a part of the accretion is a function of them doing more than you thought or in some...", "Debra Cafaro", "A little bit more, yes.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. So then maybe the primary improvement is better or lower cost of capital, can you kind of a quantify and break that down what exactly we're talking about there?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean basically, we have the term loan at L-plus 150. We did the $700 million of bonds at lower rates than we expected. And overall, since our capital costs are lower than we had projected initially.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So the majority of the upside was from capital costs and non-NHP activity, is that fair?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well not from acquisition, but the portfolio continues to perform, for example.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Ray, you were talking about the acquisition environment. You're mentioning kind of portfolios in the hundreds of millions. Are there any deals out there that you're looking at that are in the billions still? Or they're kind of scarce at this point?", "Raymond Lewis", "There are still a number of large portfolios in private hands that we expect to transact. Obviously, as the market becomes a little less clear and a little more uncertain, people may hold on to those a little longer. So things that we might have thought we would see in the third quarter may be postponed until there's a little bit more clarity around the direction of cost of capital. Right now, we've been continuing to hit the singles in NHP, and that's a good deal flow for us. Debbie mentioned our Medical Office Building pipeline, which also has a number of $100 million or so transactions in it. So that's going to keep us busy until some of these other larger portfolios come to market. But...", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. So are there any held in public hands?", "Raymond Lewis", "Well we've always been a believer, Rich, that public-to-public consolidation in our space makes sense. And we certainly have been an active player in that. But outside of that, there's not a lot of that I'm aware of.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Regarding NHP, are there any adjustments, vis-a-vis the Hearthstone deal that you did that you could see kind of more perfecting the business of NHP now that you own it? Or do you think that was kind of the primary one, and you like most of the rest of the way things are structured?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I would say generally that was the primary one and we like the way the rest of the business is structured.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And just a couple of really quick ones. You talked about EBITDARM with an M coverages. If we're to look at EBITDAR, is it fair to say maybe like a 3 points lower type coverages? Or is something like that from 1.9 to 1.6? Or is it more than that?", "Debra Cafaro", "No. We do talk about EBITDARM for a couple of reasons. One is that we really believe when operators, tenant operators who look at their portfolios, it's that what they look at because it's really what their cash flow to them. But also, various people apply different management fee to the EBITDARM. And so you might see on hospitals, a 2% to 3%. You might see on skilled nursing 4% to 5%. And so we like to let people kind of put their own included number in there. But in general, big picture, it would be in the 0.35%, 0.4%-ish adjustment to a portfolio when you go from EBITDAR to EBITDARM on a kind of averaging kind of basis.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then last question for me is, one thing we're not talking about on this call yet in terms of the numbers is the impact of cost efficiencies at the -- on the case of Kindred or other operators level. What could be the impact on the upside to coverages as they become more efficient in the face of the CMS news on the nursing home side?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean you're making a very important point. I mean when these rules take effect, as I've said, it takes a while for the full impact of them, both on the positive and the negative side to be really fully understood. And so, sort of everybody in the market right now particularly in the real estate market is sort of trying to take this mathematical sensitivity, and that's a good place that they need to start. But people need to understand that these are complex businesses, the rules are complex in general. And frankly, the impact to different operators even on the top line is going to be a much wider range and is going to be different by operator. It's not going to be 11.1%, for example, to every operator on the top line. So there will be a range. For example, some of NHP's tenants may not be in the super high acuity or whatever. They may have a much lesser impact to begin with. Then you go to the expense side -- well not just expense side but you go to mitigation, and the operators, there are lots of things that they do, do and they can do to change their mix, to change their expense and cost structure, to manage -- to care for that mix and so on. And the good operators, as I said, manage through these changes every single year. This is a larger change, and so they've already started their mitigation plans and efforts. And I think started them actually sometime ago when the perspective rule came out. And so I think you will see mitigation reduce the impact of the rule, which frankly, may be smaller or greater on any given operator depending on where they kind of went into this. So if I hope that's helpful.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So it's kind of a cathartic experience right now, I guess.", "Debra Cafaro", "It's always fun.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Karin Ford with Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Debbie, I wanted to just get your perspective across the industry whether or not you see any additional shoes to drop either in the sort of the near or medium-term? I guess the CMS ruling for LTAC was positive as you pointed out, but are there -- do you see any other targets either in the budget process or coming down in the pike at all that gives you any concern?", "Debra Cafaro", "So, no. But let's make a broader kind of discussion and that is, it is important for, especially real estate investors, to understand there's a broad sort of health-care world, the hospitals recently got an increase, the in-patients regular hospitals, the LTACs have gotten an increase, in-patient rehab has gotten an increase as well, and so there are these sort of cycles within the business. I would say that Medicaid expectations are generally plus or minus kind of 1% growth on average throughout the portfolio, and again that's where being in multiple states can really help you. And there will be again continued sort of cost containment efforts at the federal level and at the state level. And that as we have talked about for a while, I think those produce cost pressures on providers. But overall, this is part of kind of a long history of healthcare and is part of the normal expected cycle. And that's again, why we've tried to both go a lot more private pay at our business and also to have well-covered leases that are designed really to anticipate these changes in government reimbursement. So no other Jimmy Choo to drop, but we certainly are in a period where budget issues will be in the forefront. So, I hope everybody understood the Jimmy Choo reference.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "I certainly did. Second question, just sort of, Ray, relates to the operating senior housing portfolio. It sounded like you had some nice trends in the Sunrise side of things with 1.2% sequential increase in rate. And it sounded like occupancy ticked up 60 basis points through July. Now that you've own Atria for a month, are you seeing better or worse rate in occupancy trends in Atria between the 2 portfolios?", "Raymond Lewis", "I think between the 2 portfolios -- let me just touch on Atria, first. I think what we're seeing there is pretty much what we expected going in. You pointed out, we've got a month so you can't draw a lot out of that, but it's performing as we expected. Between the 2 portfolios, I think it's important to note a couple of differences. One, and this is an important one, Sunrise has a higher percentage of double occupancy rooms in its portfolio, and so those will actually drive a higher average rate because you're getting the benefit of having 2 people paying for one unit for full care. And it works in the higher acuity models like Sunrise. And you also get a little bit better margin off of those units because your leveraging your fixed costs across those 2 residents. So you'll see a little bit higher rate and a little bit better margin coming out of the Sunrise portfolio. And I think that will be consistent over time.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Here with Derek Bower. Couple of questions. First, regarding the HCP litigation. I think on their conference call, Jay had expressed some willingness or desire to settle. Is that something that you are currently pursuing?", "Debra Cafaro", "Ross, I'm sitting right here next to my dear friend and General Counsel, Rick Riney. And what I would say is that we're very limited in the comments and responses we can give at this point because of the pending punitive damage trial. And I apologize for that, but we think that's really the right course of action.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Understood. Second question, with respect to the Hearthstone assets that were given to Senior Care, why wasn't that structured in a RIDEA deal? And why was it Senior Care and not maybe given to Atria or Sunrise?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay, good questions. We believe in general that using a lease structure -- or using a management structure versus a lease structure really in our mind has been for a kind of the prime of the prime, which is kind of best asset, best operator, best market, because in a growing economy you really should get that lift. In a softer economy these are still your primo assets. And as we know from just old-fashioned real estate that tends to be kind of where you want to be. And Hearthstone are very good assets. They are decent market, and I think they'll do well. We think Senior Care is the right kind of operator for those assets, and Ray will elaborate on that. But, we just think a lease structure for the asset is really the way we wanted to go on this. And I'll let Ray kind of elaborate on that.", "Raymond Lewis", "Sure. So Ross, you may recall the transaction we did with Senior Care in 2006, and they were the first people that came to mind when we started to really get into the Hearthstone situation and think about how to optimize these assets going forward. Because they basically ran the same playbook against the, what used to be called, the balance care portfolio. Those are newer assets, secondary markets, a little bit higher percentage of double occupancy and had generally been undermanaged. And they were able to come in. They increased occupancy 1,200 basis points. They increased rates over 30% over that time period. And I think the one thing that they did that distinguished themselves is they turned around the culture of these buildings. And they're recognized now as one of the top 100 places to work in the U.S. by Modern Healthcare. They really have a great operating model. And so we felt very comfortable bringing them into this portfolio because we saw there's a perfect corollary. And using the lease structure as an alignment tool enables both of us to do well over time as they turn around this portfolio. And so for all those reasons, we thought this was the right operator in the right structure for this circumstance.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. Switching gears. On your guidance, I may have missed this earlier, does the new FFO guidance include a resetting of the straight line rents and the FAS 141 mark-to-market with respect to NHP?", "Debra Cafaro", "That sounded very, very proficient. Exactly. NHP had very limited kind of straight line rents, and so there's very limited impact. We do have the rent straight line that we have but there's very limited impact in the new guidance. And so does that answer your question?", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Mostly. How would one define limited? Like the overwhelming majority of the increase in your FFO guidance was due to cash items not gimmicky noncash FFO stuff?", "Raymond Lewis", "Of course. I think that the answer is that the straight lining rules that they follow and we follow are exactly the same. Everything that was straight line will be straight line. We will do the same thing that NHP did, which is we will determine whether reserves should be put on certain straight line items, and we believe that the change in the straight lining effect will be very minimal to a quarter.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "But there's no merger accounting reset that's causing that to jump up that's causing, that's contributing to the accretion to the FFO guidance?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean, look, there's a zillion different puts and takes of cash and noncash items as you're pointing out, as when you do your merger accounting. And there maybe net effects of couple pennies or whatever one way or another when all get said and done. And so there maybe some but it won't be anything -- it's not anything wildly material, again.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Bryan Sekino of Barclays Capital.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital", "Just quick question here on the Atria and the Sunrise operating assets. Is there any Medicare SNFs in those facility? Reimbursement from Medicare for the SNFs?", "Debra Cafaro", "No.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then on the liquidity position that you have now, how should we think about I guess your appetite to address some of the assumed mortgage debt from Atria and maybe some of the senior notes inherited from NHP?", "Debra Cafaro", "Some of the? I'm sorry.", "Raymond Lewis", "Senior notes from NHP.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, it's the same answer for all of them. I think we will refinance them as they become due hopefully at lower rates. And in general, NHP had virtually no secured debt, so we have really good credit profile on the secured debt front. But we would hopefully continue to do more unsecured as the bond market is agreeable to the same. So those are our plans for the maturities.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. And one more for me. Just the $70 million of leases in the SNFs coming due in 2013, given that the Medicare cuts impacts are kind of uncertain right now, can we expect that you'll kind of hold off on addressing those until Kindred has a full year under its belt? Or is that something that you can square away in the near-term?", "Debra Cafaro", "In 2013, we have certain of the master lease renewals coming up, as we do sort of consistently. And we would expect Kindred to continue to renew those. Those are all bundle -- those are all mixes together as multi-facility master leases with long-term acute-care hospitals as well. That's for 2013.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Theiler of Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Just a really quick follow-up question on the Sunrise rate. you guys have really good rate, the 4.5% or so. I was wondering is some of that coming from an increased average level of services? And if so, is there a limit to that rate growth going forward where you'd expect it to kind of moderate as you reach the upper end?", "Raymond Lewis", "Jeff, this is Ray. There's a little acuity in that rate but not a lot of it. A lot of it is just an increase in rate that was passed through to residents in the second quarter.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Okay. So it's not like this is a near-term bump that can't be repeated that you feel pretty confident that this 4% rate of growth is kind of reasonable going forward?", "Raymond Lewis", "Well on a quarter-over-quarter basis, no. I wouldn't say that's likely to be something we'd see every quarter.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "But on an annual basis, do you have any thoughts about -- on the run rate?  Do you have any thoughts about what the right rate growth would be?", "Raymond Lewis", "Well I mean I think a 4% year-over-year rate growth is in the range.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "That's what I'm talking about. Okay great.", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes,  I think -- I'm sorry I misunderstood your question.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Suzanne Kim with Credit Suisse.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Regarding -- I know you talked to earlier about the punitive ruling. But just to clarify is that just simply the difference between what you could have paid and what you did pay? And is there -- is that what the $100 million represents? Is there an opportunity to push it up for the litigation expenses that have been incurred as a result of this as well? What does the, I guess, $100 million represent at this point?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, Suzanne, we have a judgment for $102 million, which was the difference between what the contract was that we had to buy Sunrise REIT and what we ended up paying. And that's the judgment that we have. And as Rick said, the single issue that's going to be addressed in the punitive damage trial is really separate and sort of on top of that for punitive damages. And punitive damages are really just to discourage similar behavior. That's what the punitive damages trial is about.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay, great. And then also have -- historically, have you ever reset rents for an operator? And would you prefer to reset the rent? Or would you prefer to just kind of take these assets and get a different operator? What's your preference there? And what sort of been your examples in the past in those?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well I can tell you in 2006 we did reset the rent under our Kindred leases by $33 million a year upward. We increased rent in the reset. We've had various reset rights and other leases that have enabled us to increase rent to market, and we've done that as well. So...", "Raymond Lewis", "And the way that we structure our leases, Suzanne, is that upon renewal there's either a contractual escalation or a right to reset rents to market. And to the extent there's a right to reset rents to market is typically the greater of fair market or a contractual escalation. So that's the process that we go through when we structure our leases.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Have you reset them downward? Historically?", "Debra Cafaro", "Not in general, no.", "Suzanne Kim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. So if an operator looks distressed are you more inclined to find a different operator versus resetting the rent at a lower rate?", "Debra Cafaro", "That would all depend on whatever the facts and circumstances are at the time. In general, we like to get increase rents, so that was what our focus on when you asked the question. So, okay?", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Philip Martin with Morningstar.", "Philip J. Martin", "A couple of questions. My first one, I wanted to see if I could get an update from you on the role and opportunities for LTAC was in the integrated healthcare delivery system and even a bit more specifically, the potential competitive threat in LTAC may have less skilled nursing facility, especially as the skilled nursing is in many cases being repositioned to handle shorter length of stay, more rehab to an extent higher acuity, et cetera.", "Debra Cafaro", "We're going to lose all the REIT guys on the phone but I'll try to take that one. There is a post-acute continuing of care. As we know, when you get out of the regular hospital, there's whole variety of settings where people can go, in-patient rehab, long-term acute-care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, et cetera. Long-term acute-care hospitals also are an important part of the healthcare delivery system albeit it being a smaller one than skilled nursing facilities, they take care of much sicker, more clinically complex patients and get a higher Medicare rate, which of course we just mentioned is increasing in the fiscal year 2012. So I feel good that obviously, CMS and others are recognizing the merits of LTACs and in-patient rehab hospitals in the healthcare setting. And I don't know if you know so, there's actually is a patient certification that was introduced in Congress this week, which further kind of validates the LTAC model, particularly the one that's really high acuity, medically complex patients, medically fragile patients like the ones that Kindred cared for. And so hopefully that answers your question.", "Philip J. Martin", "Yes. It's always done in an interesting sector. And it's, I think, becoming a more important cog in the overall healthcare delivery wheel, so to speak. My next question is given Ventas' broad reach and just the knowledge and relationships across the healthcare acuity spectrum, can you get us some feel for the trend in patient outcomes across your operator and tenant base? I know we all sometimes focus too much on coverage, which I know of course is very important but patient outcomes are obviously central and a critical component to healthcare delivery, the efficiencies, reimbursements, et cetera. And I'm just wondering how you track patient outcomes? If you do that? Or if you have any anecdotal thoughts on that?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. It is true that at the end of the day, it still is all about the patient and healthcare. And I would tell you that we don't really discuss our patient outcomes by operator. I mean that's really for them to do. I would tell you that Paul Diaz and the team at Kindred have initiated some years ago a quality initiative and they really have done a fantastic job in getting to a point, where I think they could be #1 in quality among nursing home operators nationally, and that of course does lead to better patient outcomes. And so, I think we do track that. And I would encourage you to really talk to Kindred about some of the particulars around patient outcomes and quality.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I'll keep mine brief. Just looking at the Medical Office Building portfolio, just the occupancies have been trickling down last couple quarters, you seem to be holding rate okay, can you just comment on the occupancy trends?", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes. This is Ray. With respect to the Medical Office Building portfolio, our stabilized portfolio at 93.4% is still very well occupied by any relative standard. So we're really happy about that, you know that the occupancy has declined slightly but there's nothing to really attribute it to other than sort of normal frictional turnover within the buildings.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "If you layer in just increased uncertainty to just general healthcare and reimbursements environment, any lowering in the lease durations? Are folks willing or not willing to sign a 5-year lease? And maybe you're seeing more of a 3-year lease?", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes. I mean that is an observation we're seeing in our portfolio, Todd, that people are signing shorter-term leases as they try to figure out what's going to end up happening with reimbursements and other things long term. I think the other trend that is sort of feeding into that is consolidation among physician groups and by hospitals acquiring physician groups. So with that trend accelerating a lot of physician groups are taking shorter term leases to give them more flexibility to either align with each other or with hospital systems. So those 2 driving factors, I think are causing our tenants generally to favor shorter term leases at the moment.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So a couple of questions. Just on Karin's line of questioning about where you might see a shoe drop. Just curious, on the whole doc fix issue and any kind of potential impact from Medical Office Buildings that you could see?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I'm actually glad you mentioned that because when Ray was talking about trends, that was one of the things that I think is a positive trend, which is it does appear that this year Congress, again for these people, there's going to -- so-called cliff for physician payment that is every single year gets pushed out another year. It never occurs. And just keeps getting pushed out and people talk about the \"docs fix\" for that gets permanently fixed so there's not an appending cliff or cut in reimbursements for physicians going forward. And this year, there is a belief that the docs fix will take effect therefore physicians will have a known kind of visibility into their reimbursement rates, and they won't have this annual thing hanging over their heads anymore. And so I do think that will be positive if that occurs for the Medical Office Building business. To the extent that that's a paid for i.e., somewhere else, and somebody has to pay for that there may be kind of reductions to the Medicare gross rate that are from other healthcare sectors. It could be home health, could be hospitals, could be who knows what. And so I think that it's out there but I don't view that as -- I think the nursing home guys have really given up the office. And so I think it's really less likely to affect them although it may in some small measure.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So you actually think they're going to rob Peter to pay Paul rather than just smash the physician by the 20% difference that's hanging out there right now?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think, there's a general believe that they will do this \"do the docs fix,\" but again time will tell.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then again, over the next 6 to 9 months as things start to shake out in the world of skilled nursing. Could you actually see a scenario where you would actually find that sector more attractive for you to invest in going forward?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I think what we have found in life generally and as a company is that in every challenge there's also an opportunity. And what we challenge ourselves with is to say, whatever happens we have the kind of business that can really get -- kind of have the staying power and the strength to deal with it. The management expertise and skill and the insight to really kind of do well for our shareholders, in light of changes. And so I think that you always have to be understanding of that. And as we've said before, if there are challenges in the marketplace, and we think we have good visibility, it may prove to be an opportunity. I think obviously it's too early to say that, but we do believe the sector is an important sector. And so that could happen. As for now, I would say that we're continuing on our private pay focus. We do like the seniors housing and MOB sector, and we'll continue to invest there. And as the situation evolves and clarifies, we will consider, hopefully seeing and using opportunities for the benefit of our shareholders in others spaces.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Tom Truxillo with BAML.", "Thomas Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Quick follow-up question on the refinancing activity you mentioned earlier. Obviously you guys have an unsecured note coming due later in the year, but can you update us just on your thoughts about the ideal split between your unsecured and secured debt? And how much of that debt can you refi without really commutative prepayment penalties? And then just kind of given today's market, does it make sense to do that? Or are you kind of happy with your secured debt, where it is?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Well the secured debt level will be quite low, and we can get you a specific on that pro forma for NHP. But again, in terms of the maturity, we do have a convert due in November, $230 million, that's an unsecured piece of paper and that's really our only material -- that's really our only maturity this year. We are constantly evaluating. David Smith works on this. And Rick Schweinhart and I are constantly evaluating what's the new issuance rate is compared to the all-in investment that we would incur, where we can pay off existing debt and incur prepayment penalties. We have done some of that. And obviously, where we can call notes at any time and extend the maturity at lower rates, I mean that generally, I would say a good thing to do. And we've benefited from having a staggard maturity schedule. And again, hedging into different levels, different spreads different base rates and that's really helped the company. And I do think we have more opportunities there over time.", "So, wow, this was a long call. Thank you, all for participating. We very much appreciate your attention and your support. I do want to point out that something that got lost in the shuffle, which is that we have, I think enhanced our supplemental disclosure. We try to put some more information in there regarding our seniors housing portfolio, in terms of markets and different kinds of occupancies, statistics and so on. So we hope that, that additional enhanced disclosure will be something that you'll all appreciate. ", "And we did correct Page 9 of the supplemental this morning about 10:30 or so. So if you pulled one earlier, you might want to take a look at that. ", "So thank you again, and we look forward to speaking with you soon after I hope you have a good August after earnings season, and we look forward to getting back on the conference circuit starting in September.

", "I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, David, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. We want to welcome you to Ventas' Year End 2011 Earnings Call. ", "Today, I'm pleased to share an overview of our outstanding 2011 achievements and our outlook for 2012. Ray Lewis will discuss our portfolio and investment activities and Rick Schweinhart will review our financial results for the year and the quarter. After our remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. ", "The key take away for 2011 are growth, diversification, a fantastic balance sheet and a dedicated team working together to create shareholder value. These have been consistent themes for Ventas and we believe they remain the predicates for our sustained success. ", "In 2011, we closed over $11 billion in accretive acquisitions, including our investment in NHP and Atria. These deals made Ventas a $23 billion enterprise, increased our annualized NOI to over $1.4 billion, expanded our revenue base to over $2.4 billion, deliberately driving private pay revenues to nearly 80% of our business and dramatically improved our tenant mix. ", "Importantly, we improved Kindred Healthcare share of our annualized NOI to only 17% from more than twice that at year end 2010. During 2011, we also become the largest owner of private pay senior living, which is benefiting from excellent supply demand fundamentals and demographics. Even more amazingly, we achieved this growth in 2011 while actually strengthening our already best-in-class balance sheet, liquidity and credit profile. ", "Here are 2 of the most significant tangible results of our 2011 activities: our normalized FFO per share grew 17% for the year to $3.37 and our debt to enterprise value stood at an outstanding 29% at year end. Also, during 2011, all 3 credit rating agencies upgraded our corporate credit rating in recognition of our outstanding credit profile and enhanced reliability. ", "These important actions significantly lowered our cost of debt, giving us the opportunity to increase our liquidity and further stagger and extend our debt maturity. ", "To put this in context, for every $1 billion dollars in debt that we replaced at a 200 basis points savings in rate, our shareholders will enjoy $20 million in improved cash flow. We ended 2011 and entered 2012 with strong positive momentum. And we're energized about our opportunities for the year. ", "First, we announced our agreement to acquire MOB owner, Cogdell Spencer, on December 27. This accretive acquisition of 72 high-quality, 92% occupied medical office buildings will increase Ventas' MOB portfolio to 20 million square feet and the share of our NOI from this large and attractive asset class to 15%. We will be the largest owner of medical office buildings in the U.S., poised to partner with highly rated hospital systems who need capital to grow or consolidate. ", "Second, in February, we raised $600 million in 4.25% tenure unsecured bonds to prefund our Cogdell Spencer acquisition.", "Third, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2012 dividend of $0.62, an increase of 8%. This dividend increase continues our track record of increasing our dividend at consistently above average rates, retaining more cash flow for growth, and maintaining a conservative payout ratio of about 70%. Ventas has a highest compound annual dividend growth rate in the REIT sector over the past 10 years and we view our dividend growth as an important component of the total return proposition we offer to our shareholders. ", "Finally, today, we announced 2012 normalized FFO guidance of $3.63 to $3.69 per share. If achieved, this would represent almost 9% growth in our FFO per share at the midpoint. All of our activities are focused on providing consistent superior total returns to shareholders over the long-term. ", "In 2011, we delivered a 9.8% total return and over the past 10 years, Ventas' total return to shareholders exceeded 720%. In fact, for each of the last 1, 3, 5 and 10-year periods, Ventas' total returns exceeded those of the RMS and the S&P 500. ", "Our most important asset is the dedicated cohesive and highly skilled Ventas management team. With the recent additions of Todd Lillibridge, John Cobb, Lori Wittman and other key players, the Ventas leadership team has been together for a decade and continues to demonstrate our core values of teamwork, transparency, integrity, a work ethic second to none, and an unwavering commitment to stakeholders. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Ray to provide a portfolio and investment summary.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Great. Thanks, Debbie. Ventas' diversified portfolio now consists of nearly 1,400 assets balanced across 47 states and 2 Canadian provinces with over 100 tenant operator relationships. Our portfolio derives approximately 70% of its NOI from private pay sources, which is comprised of seniors housing and medical office buildings. ", "The company's diversifying acquisitions over the past couple of years have been primarily focused in these 2 sectors and as a result, Ventas is now the largest owner of private pay seniors housing in the United States, and will also be the largest owner of medical office buildings when the Cogdell Spencer transaction closes. ", "In 2011, our same-store portfolio of 498 assets provided 3.4% cash flow growth over 2010 after adjusting for a $5 million cash payment received from Sunrise for expense overages in the comparison period.  So Ventas' portfolio continues to benefit from the stable cash flows of its triple-net lease portfolio, along with a higher growth from its private pay seniors housing operating assets. ", "First, let's review the performance of our triple-net lease portfolio. Triple-net leases account for over 60% of Ventas' total NOI and are diversified across nearly 900 seniors housing, skilled nursing and hospital assets with over 70 different tenant operators. Cash flow coverage for the third quarter of 2011 in our triple-net lease portfolio increased 10 basis points to a strong 1.8x. ", "Same-store cash NOI growth for 2011 in this triple net portfolio was 2.7%, better than our projections at the beginning of the year of greater than 2.5%. ", "For 2012, we expect this part of our portfolio to again provide same-store cash NOI growth in excess of 2.5%.  Furthermore, the long-term stable growth is supported by a weighted average maturity of 7 years for our total triple net portfolio. ", "Moving on to our seniors housing operating portfolio, which now represents 25% of our NOI. These communities continue their strong performance trend with positive sequential increases in occupancy, NOI and margin. Like apartments, our portfolio of 197 high-quality private pay seniors housing communities are in a management contract structure where Ventas is the direct recipient of the NOI. We have 6 years of experience with this structure and our strategy is simple and consistent. We target the best assets and the best markets with the best operators like Atria and Sunrise. Those of you who toured our Atria properties in New York with us in October got to see firsthand what we mean by this. ", "NOI for all communities in this portfolio increased 2.4% sequentially in the fourth quarter to $89.5 million, compared to the third quarter of 2011. And stabilized unit occupancy continued its upward trend by increasing 100 basis points to 88.9%. This momentum in occupancy, which normally wanes during the holiday season, has carried into the new year. ", "Our Sunrise portfolio of 79 high-quality, mansion style seniors housing communities finished 2011 with total NOI of $156.7 million, which was at the top end of our guidance range. 2011 NOI for our Sunrise portfolio was up an excellent 5% over 2010, excluding the previously mentioned $5 million cash payment. ", "Furthermore, resident occupancy increased 80 basis points sequentially and finished the fourth quarter at 91.4%, which is the highest total portfolio occupancy since 2007 when Ventas purchased these assets. Similar to our Sunrise portfolio, Ventas' Atria-managed portfolio of 118 private pay seniors housing communities experienced a strong fourth quarter of operations. Total NOI was $48.5 million for the fourth quarter, a sequential increase of 2.1% over the third quarter of 2011 and same-store stable occupancy increased 80 basis points to 89%. ", "NOI for the second half of 2011 was $96 million, which is right in line with the guidance we provided when we announced the transaction. ", "Ventas and Atria continue to execute on our redevelopment strategy as 3 new projects entered the pipeline and one was transitioned to stable during the quarter. Atria on the Hudson, our 122-unit green IL/AL/ALZ building in Westchester County, New York, which opened in April, ended the year at 70% occupancy and our 80-unit ILAL in Glen Cove, Long Island, which opened in October, finished the year at 59% occupancy. So these attractive redevelopment opportunities remain a key thesis for value creation and cash flow growth in our Atria portfolio. ", "For 2012, we expect total NOI for our Atria and Sunrise senior housing portfolio to range between $350 million and $360 million. Our guidance reflects that our Sunrise management fee reverts to 6% of revenues in 2012 resulting in an increase of $12 million in management fee expense for the year. ", "Pre-management fee, our guidance reflects a 5.5% NOI growth rate year-over-year for this portfolio. As you can see from our results again this quarter, trends in the seniors housing industry are positive and the fundamentals remain among the best of all real estate sectors. ", "Now I'd like to discuss Ventas' MOB portfolio. With the expected addition of Cogdell Spencer this year, we will add 4 million square feet of high-quality owned MOBs, another 2 million square feet of property management and another 12 investment grade hospital relationships to our Lillibridge medical office building business. ", "Upon closing, we will own 300 primarily on-campus MOBs coast-to-coast and relationships with over 60 investment grade hospitals and over 3,500 tenants. ", "For the fourth quarter, our same-store pool of 169 owned medical office buildings, including those recently acquired from NHP, provided approximately $34 million of NOI to Ventas and experienced positive sequential increases in occupancy, NOI and margin. ", "Same-store cash flow growth in our consolidated MOB portfolio grew 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. So our medical office portfolio continues to deliver stable growing cash flows, which we expect to continue during 2012. ", "During the quarter, we also continue to realize the benefits of our relationship with Pacific Medical buildings, which came with our NHP acquisition as we began construction of a $28 million on-campus medical office building in California. This building is 100% pre-leased to AA-rated Sutter Health and should be completed by the end of this year. So our MOB portfolio is an important and growing part of our business and we look forward to capitalizing on additional opportunities in 2012. ", "Before I turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart, I'd like to spend a moment on the acquisitions environment. 2011 was a transformational year for Ventas with over $11 billion in acquisitions completed during the year. Of this total, over $940 million was originated by the combined Ventas-NHP regional origination platform. We also made significant investments in building our acquisitions capabilities by adding new resources, processes and systems. In the fourth quarter alone, we invested over $325 million in new deals with expected going in yields over 7%. ", "Looking into 2012, we expect to see a continued flow of attractive investment opportunities in our core senior housing and medical office target markets and with our recently announced agreement to acquire Cogdell Spencer, we are already off to a running start. ", "So with our extensive tenant relationships and investment grade balance sheet, the lowest leverage in our sector, $2 billion of revolver capacity, a competitive cost of capital and a world-class acquisitions platform, we are well-positioned to source and win attractive investment opportunities. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart who will discuss our financial results. Rick?", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. The following significant events occurred in the fourth quarter. In October, we closed on a new $2 billion unsecured 4-year revolving credit facility currently priced at 110 basis points over LIBOR. It replaced our prior $1 billion facility, which is priced at 280 basis points over LIBOR that was scheduled to mature in April 2012. ", "Our revolver balance at year end was $456 million and we had $46 million in cash. Currently, we have $270 million in cash and liquid investments and our entire $2 billion revolving credit capacity available. ", "In November, we repaid, at maturity, $230 million on our 3 7/8% convertible senior notes. We also issued a little over 940,000 shares in connection with the convert feature. The effective rate turned out to approximate 5.5%. ", "In November, we received the litigation settlement of $125 million from the HCP. The proceeds, less litigation expenses and a charitable contribution, were used to pay down the revolver. In November, S&P upgraded the company to BBB stable, joining Moody's at Baa2 stable and Fitch at BBB+ stable. ", "In December, we borrowed $500 million on a new unsecured term loan priced at 125 basis points over LIBOR with a weighted average maturity of 4.5 years. This replaced the short-term NHP loan we assumed at the NHP closing. We also collected over $81 million of notes receivable in the fourth quarter. ", "Now let me focus on fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter 2011 normalized FFO was $0.89 per diluted share, an increase of 15.6%, compared to fourth quarter of 2010 per share results of $0.77.  Normalized FFO increased 113.5% to $259 million, compared to last year's fourth quarter of $121 million. ", "Normalized FFO in the fourth quarter excludes the net benefit totaling $99.7 million from net litigation proceeds and income tax benefit partially offset by merger-related expenses and deal in integration cost, mark-to-market adjustment for derivatives, loss on extinguishment of debt and amortization of other intangibles. ", "Fourth quarter normalized FFO increased from last year's fourth quarter due to NOI increases in all 3 of our segments, triple net, senior housing operating, and medical office, as well as income from loans and investments. ", "Triple net lease revenues grew to $210 million from $116 million last year, primarily due to NHP and also due to contractual escalations. Senior housing operating NOI increased $47 million, principally due to the Atria acquisition. Fourth quarter medical office building NOI grew to $43.7 million from $18.5 million last year, primarily due to NHP. Both periods include $1.3 million in unconsolidated joint venture earnings. ", "Income from loans and investments increased to $9.9 million this year from $5.1 million last year due to NHP's portfolio. ", "On the expense side, consolidated interest expense increased to $70 million this quarter from $44.6 million last year, reflecting the assumed debt in the Atria and NHP acquisitions, as well as all the debt activity in the last year. ", "Looking at sequential results, normalized FFO increased $4 million to this quarter's $259 million, primarily due to fourth quarter improvements in our senior housing operating business and MOB versus performance in the third quarter. ", "Interest expense decreased by $2 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, principally due to the repayment of our 3 7/8% convertible senior notes and the reduction on our revolver rate. ", "We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flows from operations. At December 31, our credit stats were net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA at 4.7x, our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 4x and debt to enterprise value 29%. ", "The most important takeaway of the year are that we made over $11 billion in acquisitions, yet our credit stats are better at the end of the year than they were at the beginning. And our 2011 FFO per share increased by 17% to $3.37. Weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were 291 million shares, an increase of 84% over the fourth quarter of last year and fairly flat with the third quarter. ", "Starting off in 2012, we improved our weighted average debt maturity to over 6 years and expanded our current liquidity to over $2 billion. We are initiating our 2012 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance at $3.63 to $3.69. ", "At the midpoint of the range, that's growth of 8.6%. While our projections do assume the closing of Cogdell Spencer in the second quarter consistent with our normal practice, they exclude additional unannounced acquisitions and capital transactions.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Rick. Before we turn the call over to Q&A, I know a number of you have questions about the 2013 Kindred lease renewal. So I thought I would address that subject for you now. ", "So as most of you know, this is our third renewal cycle under the Kindred master leases. Kindred has already renewed assets representing $23 million in annual rent, leaving about $99 million in annual rent remaining subject to Kindred's renewal options in 2013 or 7% of Ventas annualized NOI. ", "Kindred has until April 30, 2012, to exercise its renewal options on these assets and at this time, we can't tell you whether or not Kindred will renew its lease on any or all of these assets up for 2013 renewal. ", "The key points that we believe current rents for the 73 health healthcare facilities are at about market level. The facilities are profitable at current rent levels and they would be attractive to a variety of health care providers if they do become available for releasing. ", "So whether it's with Kindred or with new Ventas tenants, we feel confident about the expected outcome of the 2013 renewal process. ", "So operator, we'll be happy to open the call to take our analysts and shareholder questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Quentin Velleley from Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Michael Bilerman for Quentin. Debbie, how do you -- in the event that Kindred doesn't renew some or all of the 2013 remaining expiries, what would sort of the timing be of -- you mentioned the rents are at market, but what would be the timing of sort of release the CapEx potentially in there so as we start to think about 2013 earnings and cash flow, what sort of down time we would need to sort of bake in, in dealing with that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, thanks for joining, Michael. I would say that the leases are set up so that we would always have at least one year to release the assets if there isn't a renewal. And so what would happen is we would basically spend that year's time repositioning the assets and as you know or may not know, we own the licenses in the assets and there's very detailed provisions in the leases that would call for an orderly transition of operations. So there really shouldn't be any so-called downtime like you would think about in an office or retail. Really, there would be a transition of operations on -- going concern kind of business level in the assets.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. So there would be no loss FFO from that standpoint?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "There should be no downtime at all. And if rents are at market and if Kindred doesn't renew and we release the asset at the same level there should be just a continuous rent stream, basically.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And how do you respond? I mean there are certain cynics out there that say all the investment activity that you've done over the last 18 months which has been significant was a way to grow out of this potential issue of Kindred in terms of its size and that maybe you overpaid for, for those acquisitions, and so how do you defend yourself in that way when you hear those things?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, I really would make 2 comments. In general, I would say that anytime you can do accretive, diversifying acquisitions that improve your balance sheet and reduce your cost of debt by 100-plus basis points and you really -- that's a signal to say yes, you should go ahead and do those acquisitions. I would also say honestly to those cynics that during my 12 years of tenure here at Ventas, I have consistently tried to position the company, not only to grow, but as you know, to manage risk. And one part of managing risk over the past 10 years has been to continue to manage the balance sheet, but also to continue to manage tenant concentration, because no matter how good a tenant you have and no matter -- you always want to continue to manage risk in your business. So if we can grow cash flows and manage risk I think that, that -- and grow a dividend, that is 8% taker as we have over the past 5 years or so. I think that is a recipe for delivering shareholder value. And I feel very strongly about that. Those are the 2 things that we try to do and the acquisitions that we did in 2011 and the one that we're doing 2012, I think fits squarely within our pattern of growth diversification and risk management.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And just one last one just in terms of the Kindred stuff this coming June next year, how much unsolicited approaches have you received from other sort of competitors on those assets or how much marketing have you done in the event that they don't release renewal?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, because -- well over a year at this point, we would expect that any overtures that we would make relative to unrenewed assets would occur after April 30, because it would be at that point that we would know whether we would have 0 assets or 73 assets to bring to market. So we think that there's a time and place with that, but it would essentially be starting in May of 2012.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Let me just make sure I understood. The 73 facilities, are they in 4 what you call bundles?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I can tell you they're divided into 8 renewal groups or what we have typically called bundles. And every bundle has between 6 and 13 assets and at least 1 hospital. And so -- and they're diversified by market and asset type, et cetera. And the renewal options that Kindred has are really by renewal group.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Right. So like it's not going to be all or nothing on the 73, it could be somewhere in between?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It could be something in between, as I said, we could have 73 released to Kindred. We can have 0 released to new tenants or to Kindred and all released to new tenants or something in between.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "If you said that before, I apologize.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No, that's okay.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The 5.5% same store NOI growth that you're assuming in your guidance for the operating portfolio, Sunrise and Atria, would you be willing to break that down between what you're expecting from Sunrise and what you're expecting from Atria?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "We are providing guidance on a consolidated basis, Rich. I think just to provide you with some flavor though, I think the Atria will grow at a higher growth rate than the average and the Sunrise at a little bit lower than the average.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. I wanted to ask on the Cogdell Spencer transaction, when you announced that you included transaction cost in your return, I guess, you guys being so normalized in the way you talk about things, I'm surprised that you included transaction costs in your return projections for that portfolio. What would it be if you were to take out the transaction cost and just purely on the investment in the entity, what would be the returns then? I think it was low 7s with transaction costs?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We'll give you that. And again, I mean when we look at investments, we take -- we look at them a lot of different ways. And we certainly would want to take investment into account and looking at kind of the going in yield. And if we do that, it would be kind of a -- if we take out the transaction costs, we'd be looking at somewhere in the mid-7% cap rate on expected NOI.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Getting back to the senior housing portfolio. I'm looking at your disclosure on Page 15 of the supplemental. And obviously you have a cliff down in the report, I guess, inclusive of Atria. Do you ever foresee that cliff kind of becoming less substantial. In other words, is there any upside, meaningful upside, to Atria rents relative ", "to Sunrise that you can see in the future or will it always kind of be that big gap?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well, Rich, they are, as we've said different operating models. The Sunrise is a smaller, higher, acuity assisted living Alzheimer's focus. The Atria is a larger, lower acuity independent living, assisted-living focus. That being said, as we do redevelopments, we're adding reprogramming for Alzheimer's and other high acuity space into some of the Atria buildings which could continue to push those rates up. And as we redevelop the independent living and assisted living buildings in the higher quality markets, we're also seeing rate increases. So I don't think you'll see that cliff close, but you could see the Atria rate growth go at a faster rate than the Sunrise rate growth near term.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then my last question is on the growing exposure to private pay 84% of revenues, 70% of NOI. I guess, just to be a cynical, is there a loss of diversification as you get more and more into private pay or would you, if you could snap your fingers and get to a 100% private pay, would you do it?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "There's a lot of cynics on this call. I would say the following: I believe in diversification. I believe in it strongly. And I think that having a balanced portfolio that has a mixture of asset types and operating models is the best way to manage the company as we grow. And so, we have deliberately focused over the past 2 years on driving our private pay revenue and NOI statistics higher and we think it was the right time in the cycle to do that. But obviously, nursing homes are an important part of the post-acute delivery of care to seniors in the United States. And at the right time and at the right price and the right structure, those are appropriate assets to own as a health care REIT, I believe, in a diversified portfolio. So that's how I would answer your question. I think that's how we'd manage the company.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, so it's 70% of NOI be kind of a ceiling for you or do you think you could even go up higher?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, I could see that being 70% to 80% private pay NOI.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Bryan Sekino from Barclays Capital.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I'm sorry if you mentioned already, but can you give us some flavor on the occupancy pricing and maybe even expense growth in the $350 million to $360 million NOI for the operating senior housing assets?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Right. And so just as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the management fee this year will be reverting to the 6% rate. So if you sort of back out that $12 million impact and sort of go 2011 to 2012, I think occupancies up 50-ish basis point, rates up 3%, 3.5%, margins relatively flat, ought to get you that 5.5% growth on the bottom line.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, thanks for the detail. And then I know it's still early but maybe if you could provide some color from your conversations with some of your SNF operators on what they're experiencing in the fourth quarter in terms of handling the rate cuts? Some operators suggest maybe the rate per day has been less -- the impact on the rate per day and maybe cost mitigation has been successful. Any details you could give there would be helpful.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, I mean we can discuss some of our private operators. I think that the revenue cuts are really coming in, in line with their expectations. And people are, in general, being successful at starting to mitigate the cuts and are looking to a 25% to 50% ultimate mitigation level. And that some operators will be able to effectuate that mitigation earlier than others, but in general, once they get everything in place, I would expect 25% to 50% mitigation.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeff Theiler from Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "One of your peers had a big Canadian investment this quarter. I'd love to hear an update on how you're thinking about potential international expansion and whether you see that as a growth driver for you in the future?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we do have our Canadian Sunrise asset that we acquired in 2007 and we like the Canadian market. I would tell you that we believe that if you're looking at big long-term trends, in health care and senior housing and health care REIT, you can see potentially over time expansion into either the kind of Western democracy that are aging and/or countries like India or China where there's a growing middle class that would be paying for infrastructure, private pay hospitals and things like that. But those are really pie in the sky. Those outside of North America at this point are really much longer term kinds of initiatives and so, I think you may see health care REITs go there over time, but we're talking decades kind of, not tomorrow.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So I guess, in the U.S. then, in terms of other asset types, I know that we've talked about lab space a lot with you in the past. Is that an area you're still interested in or has pricing gone too far for you to be interested in it at this point, or how are you thinking about that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, Jeff, I think turning back to the U.S. is a good segue. I mean the one great thing that we have in the health care real estate space is that we still have huge amounts of opportunities here domestically. And that is unlike some of the other real estate sectors and again, it's because you do have this trillion dollar health care real estate market where the REITs still own less than, say, 10% of it. And that distinguishes us, I think, among real estate sectors in a positive way because you've got a large sector, it's growing and it's sort of under-penetrated in public ownership. So that really does focus us kind of back on the extensive domestic opportunities. And as you mentioned, life sciences is one of them and I'll turn the rest of that over to my partner, Ray, to answer.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes. And Jeff, our view on that hasn't really changed. We think it's a great space. We think it fits well within the healthcare REIT portfolio from a diversification and growth standpoint. It is a specialized business. It requires expertise, not unlike when we got in to the medical office building space, we would want to do it either in partnership with that expertise or by acquiring that platform. And so as and when the right opportunity presents itself, we'll certainly work hard on it. There are a number of other, I think, very positive trends going on in the health care world at large, for health care REITs that could drive more business into our wheelhouse. I think, as Debbie mentioned, there's a huge addressable universe, much of which is owned by hospital and health systems who are facing increasing needs for capital and decisions that they have to make about how they're going to allocate their own precious capital. Pressures in the tax code are also making it more difficult for them to raise additional capital. And so over time, we could see a scenario where more hospitals would be monetizing their real estate, both medical office and other hospital-owned real estate, and that could present some really attractive opportunities to us as and when those trends take hold.", "Operator", "Your next question comes is from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "In regards to your 2012 guidance, I was wondering if you guys could give a little bit more color over some other drivers. I think you've given the NOI numbers for the senior housing operating platform, but kind of what else is going into that number?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we have improved operations. Obviously, offset with the increase and reversion of the Sunrise management fee. We've got Cogdell Spencer and we've got some improvement on capital cost and escalators in our senior housing leases. And basically, some timing or negative [indiscernible] from prefunding the Cogdell Spencer acquisition. Those are kind of the major drivers to the midpoint. And importantly, I mean, importantly I would say no acquisition, which we always give guidance that way, of course. And just give you one example, I mean we had $81 million of loans pay off in the fourth quarter and they were in the 9-ish percent. So if we end up reinvesting that money that obviously changes the outcome, but right now, we're just assuming that, that pays down debt. So things like that go both ways.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess, the reason why I'm asking is the Sunrise, the senior housing operating numbers look pretty strong for 2012 and you have a lot of these natural escalators  it just doesn't quite sum up, at least in my model, to your $3.63 to $3.69 guidance number. I'm wondering whether it's the classic, under-promise and over-delivered that we've gotten accustomed to with Ventas over the past several years?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well we certainly try to deliver. I think we also try to sort of call it like we see it and we're giving you sort of the assumptions that we have and I think, a midpoint 9% FFO growth without any acquisitions is pretty outstanding, frankly. So I feel good about that and obviously, to the extent that we work the whole year as we always to do to try to do acquisitions that are smart and do better than that. But I feel good about 9% FFO per share growth and at the midpoint and an 8% dividend increase and, obviously, we'll try to do better if we can.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "There are no lease expirations or anything built into it that we're not aware of?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And just about just kind of given the large amount of the large operating platform now, could you talk just a little bit more about just what CapEx spend could look-- recurring CapEx spend could look like in 2012, both for the senior housing operating portfolio and the MOB portfolio?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. I think if you kind of exclude any kind of new development or things like that, we'll be looking at about in the kind of $50 million to $60 million, if memory serves. I'll confirm that for you.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "$50 million to $60 million. And then just last question, and thanks for indulging me. On the Kindred side of things, if my memory serves correctly, the $99 million number you discussed on the call, that number was closer to about $130 million that will actually meant to come up for reset, it sounds like some of it has already been leased, some of it have already been leased, is that correct?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, exactly. Of the -- let's call it $122 million that's up for 2013 renewal, remember all these goes May of 2013, $23 million of that has already been renewed by Kindred. So that's why we've got the $99 million, that is up, remains up for the 2013 renewal.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Could you talk about the new terms on that, and did you have any red bumps [ph] on that or kind of came in flat versus the old rent or...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Say that again, sorry?", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Could you talk a little bit about the partial, the amount that's actually been released. What the new lease terms were and what pricing, what rents are like on that relative to the old rent?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. Well, the renewals are formulaic. And so the renewal is a 5-year renewal basically with a standard contractual escalations of basically 2.7%. So those are -- those will just carry on and then a couple of them have the ability for us to have kind of a mini reset right or an appraisal process whereby rents could increase to market. So maybe there's some pick up on that potentially in 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Daniel Bernstein from with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I have a question on the Kindred leases that are up for renewal. Can you characterize whether those leases are better or worse lease coverage than the overall number that you're providing in the supplemental? I'm just trying to get a sense of the quality of those assets.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, I can tell you. On the 73 assets that are basically are still up for renewal, they have 2.1x EBITDARM coverage, which is consistent with the whole portfolio. Remember, all of these, the whole structure of the Kindred master leases is that it's a diversified portfolio at the macro level, at the master lease level and at the renewal group level. So they're designed to have consistency across each sort of economic unit, if you will.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's very helpful. The other question I have is in terms of the taxable REIT subsidiary, when you think about growing those subsidiaries or growing those operating assets, are you thinking about maybe doing any development, aside from the redevelopment in Atria can you do straight-up development in there? What kind of assets do you want to add to the operating asset portfolio to help that grow?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Dan, I think that we have done some development sort of consistent with a structure that's commonly used by health care REITs and some of those came over from NHP, but I do believe we do those in the REIT itself as opposed to taxable REIT subsidiary where we're doing kind of -- we're kind of financing a ground up development for one of our operator partners who has a good track record. And then that converts into a triple-net lease, but I'm almost sure that, that occurs within the REIT itself.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just kind thinking if you're worried about CapEx at senior housing, the aging of the stock there, you might want newer assets in the TRS does that make sense or...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, in general, yes. I mean we like to have newer assets, but those could be in the REIT as well. They don't have to be in the TRS, that's my only point.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Right. The other question I had was on the guidance. Are you making any -- although it doesn't include acquisitions, do you have any kind of goals or assumptions on what you can do in terms of the smaller relationship driven, NHP-driven acquisitions obviously, the big, the large acquisitions will come in chunks but what kind of quarterly acquisitions do you think you can turn just from these smaller portfolios?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, our experience is that acquisitions big and small are relatively unpredictable, which is why we don't predict then, we can tell you what the past has been.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, as I've said in my remarks, last year, we originated about $940 million through that combined Ventas-NHP originations platform. We've got, I think, some really strong originators in the marketplace. Very good customer relationships with a number of tenants both Ventas and NHP, legacy tenants that are providing us with a consistent flow of transactions and we would expect that in 2012 we will continue to do a lot of that type of business.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Nicholas Yulico from Macquarie.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "I just wanted to see if I heard this correctly. Did you say that all of the facilities in the upcoming Kindred renewal are profitable at current rent levels?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. The 73 assets that are up for renewal have coverage over 2x. Therefore, they are profitable.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. I'm just wondering if there is, perhaps, a situation that could happen here with similar to back in 2007 where you actually sold some of the underperforming SNFs back to Kindred?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Great question. We have done some very favorable transactions for both parties in the past where Kindred acquired some underperforming assets at attractive valuations from our standpoint. We redeployed that capital into other investments and those opportunities will always exist and some of them happened last time in the context of the renewal process. So those kinds of -- thank you for reminding me, those kinds of things can indeed happen.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then, Ray, I think you were saying that some of the occupancy gains in the RIDEA portfolio from the fourth quarter have carried into 2012 here. Can you just talk a little bit about how you guys are sort of managing occupancy here in the first quarter and whether you've had to maybe offer some rate concessions to keep occupancy high?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "No. I did mention that we sort of buck the seasonal trend where normally, during the holidays, occupancy declines and we've seen our occupancy hold up heading into January. So that's a positive thing and we haven't had to provide any incentives or other discounts to drive that. So we're pleased about the way the year is starting.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of James Milam from Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Did you give the portfolio occupancy for the MOB portfolio on a combined basis for the stabilized and non-stabilized?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I'm sorry if I missed it, can you just give it to me again.", "Todd W. Lillibridge", "James, this is Todd Lillibridge. On the stabilized portfolio, which is the 177 facilities that we've got, excluding the 14 non-stabilized, the current occupancy there is 91.9%. And on a combined basis, when we combine both stable and non-stable, at 89.5%.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Great. And I guess I'll just say, I noticed you guys took that column out on the first page of the sub, so to the extent that my opinion matters, I would love to see that back in there. The disclosures are great, we really appreciate it. I'm looking forward to talking to David later this afternoon. Second quick question, can you guys give a little more color on the assets that you sold, just what type of properties those are and how you're thinking about increasing the disposition activity going into 2012?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Sure. So those were independent and assisted living properties in our triple net portfolio. Basically, sold at a 6 3/4-ish cap rate on rent. And as we look forward in our portfolio, obviously, we want to be prudent allocators of capital and where we find opportunities to recycle capital out of assets that are either not long-term strategic or where we think we can sell the assets at a cap rate and invest at a better yield someplace else, we're going to take advantage of those opportunities. And with the portfolio now of almost 1,400 properties, I think there's going to be a lot more opportunities for us to do that in 2012.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "On these ones that you did sell, were they newer assets or older assets or just out of sort of the market geography you're looking for, what was kind of the driver behind disposing of these ones?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I think there was a win-win opportunity here. They are, I would say, productive assets, but probably not assets that are central to our strategic objectives. And so there's a chance for us to sell them back and have -- redeploy the capital into perhaps assets that we might want to own longer term.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then my last one just especially since you said you sold those at a 6 3/4, are you guys seeing just as a general trend cap rates continuing to compress and if so, how are you thinking about acquisition opportunities and growth with prices sort of continuing this upward trend? Is that -- are you seeing deals that you're kind of passing on because they're getting expensive or are you still seeing plenty of accretive opportunities and that's not really an issue yet?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I think, James, given the strong fundamentals in our core medical office and seniors housing space, there is a lot of competition for transactions. And as a consequence, cap rates remain very competitive and pricing on transactions remain competitive. We have a number of relationships and as the incumbent in those relationships, I think we have the opportunity to win those transactions at the margins. So that's helpful for us. And then we have to be selective and really look at the deals that we think we want to own for the long term that have the right, either cash flow growth profile from an operating asset perspective or credit structural support and structure from a triple net perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains from Morgan Keegan.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I'm so glad you kind of connected that dot. I was going to follow on to Ray's comments that I decided that we don't want to make the call too long, but I'm very glad you added that. I mean, this is a couple things. One is the reason there's competition for acquisitions is because these are great assets in health care real estate, they provide really good risk-adjusted returns. They performed the best in the downturn of any real estate sector, they've got good supply demand fundamentals, stable cash flows, et cetera. And so it's not surprising that there is a lot of competition for these kind of assets and I know all of you think I'm obsessed with cost of capital because I am, because if we want to buy the best assets and still make money for shareholders, and we really need to have a very competitive cost of capital, which happily, due to all the activities that we've undertaken, we absolutely do. And I think it really is important for our continued success. So that doesn't mean that we throw out all of our kind of underwriting criteria either just because something is accretive doesn't mean it's appropriately valued. So that's really the push and pull and of it. And I would say that we have all of the predicates in place for continuing to drive attractive acquisitions and really, it's just up to us to identify those opportunities that we want to pursue when we think they make good sense. But we, in general, we're happy that people like health care real estate assets and really embrace their profile.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Obviously, other health care REITs as you've seen.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Pension funds, insurance companies.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Private equity firms. There is, through the Fannie and Freddie agency financing, very attractive secured financing available, so there are people who have access to capital and can generate positive spreads over their cost of capital that will compete for transactions with the health care REITs.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "And owner operators, as well.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Absolutely.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I hope that's helpful.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, there are 2 reasons. One is as we all know in life if people have CapEx budgets, they tend to end up spending most of it in the fourth quarter after they do all the plan -- they get it approved and they do all the planning. So timing is definitely part of it. And that's why you can't ever take kind of the fourth quarter times 4, or the first quarter times 4. But also remember, we added Atria in the middle of the year and so it would be -- that would be the second major reason that it would be disproportionate to the full year.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Debbie, a couple of questions. First, regarding medical office building, do you think the longer-term cash flow growth profile is higher, lower or the same as senior housing?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think it's lower.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And that certainly has an impact over how you think about going in yield, is that a fair statement?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Absolutely. And in fact, we did that exact analysis when we were looking at Cogdell Spencer. We said, okay, you know, this is x 7 whatever low to mid 7s yields and if you bought a senior housing asset, that was of similar quality, sort of if you analogize to the on-campus kind of highly rated hospital system kind of situation, if you bought a senior housing asset at x yield, let's call it low to mid-7s minus some amount, what do the growth rates have to be in order to get a similar return. So yes, we do look at that and so the -- that's why we feel good with the kind of low to mid-7 cap rate on the Cogdell portfolio. I mean is that what you're getting at?", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "No, that's exactly how I look at it. I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We're on it, yes.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. With respect to Kindred. My understanding is that Ventas and Kindred have historically had a very positive relationship and that you and Paul are always, have been on good terms. So with that in mind, I guess I'm wondering why couldn't the 2 companies come together on a resolution for all of the 2013 assets all at once, rather than what is sort of going on now, which is sort of, yes, we'll renew some now and we'll get back to you later on the rest of them, because that creates uncertainty for both companies. Why couldn't all these been dealt with a couple of months ago?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, again, yes, theoretically, that could happen, but basically we talked about this a little bit before and I don't want to get too much into the minutiae of the way the leases work, but there was an incentive for Kindred to renew assets where they thought that the reset rent would go up a little bit earlier and they did that. And then with respect to April 30, there's a lot going on in the reimbursement world and so on, we've got mitigation and so on. So I don't criticize Kindred basically for waiting until they have the most possible information until they decide whether they're going to renew or not. And in the meantime, obviously, we talk all the time and if the companies want to reach a consensual resolution, obviously, we have been able to do so on certain matters in the past and I believe we could do so in the future.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Has there been anything adversarial in the process here or has it been the same mutually friendly relationship that you've had over the years?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, I think it's a very good relationship and it's been very professional in relation to the renewal process. And I would say good, more than professional.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tom Truxillo from Bank of America.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So on top of any acquisitions that you guys made, do you have some bonds coming due later in the year or the CSA acquisition you have to fund? Can you kind of talk about how you plan on funding those capital needs? Do you see yourself going back to the term loan market which obviously, gave you very attractive pricing? Could you use preferreds or do you kind of plan to stick to the unsecured bond market?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we basically have $2.3 billion in liquidity right now. As you know, we just did the very attractive 4.25% tenure unsecured bonds and that essentially funds, with our cash on hand, more than funds Cogdell Spencer and so we have minimal other maturities in 2012. And so absent additional investment activity, I think we're in great, great shape. And even with incremental investment activity, we have the kind of capacity, so I think we're liquid.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. A quick follow up. You guys called the 6.5% notes. You have 2 additional issues that are kind of approaching new call dates. Can you give us any thoughts on your process, your thought process there, do you see further opportunities kind of reduce that cost of capital you like to talk about?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. And I think that's a great question for bondholders and shareholders alike and because we want to make money for all of our constituents. I mentioned in the outset that if there's $1 billion of debt and we replace it at 200 basis points cheaper, we're making $20 million of additional annual cash flow and if we do that by calling shorter-term bonds and issuing, say, 10-year bonds, we're not only adding to our cash flows, improving our interest coverage and credit stats, making more money for shareholders but we're also managing risk by staggering and lengthening our debt maturity schedule. So as we see opportunities to do that, I think it would make sense for shareholders and bondholders alike for us to continue to execute that kind of plan. So over time, I think we'll try to be smart and optimize those kinds of transactions.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "So I don't know if Jerry Doctrow is on the phone or not but I do want to give him a little shout out for his years of following our sector with great intelligence and humor and vigor. Most of you know Jerry is retiring in early March and it is a loss for our industry despite the abilities of his able successor. So I just wanted to say that Jerry helped me a lot 12 years ago when I got to the industry and I'll always be very grateful for that. And I know that all of us at Ventas will really miss his presence and his perspective. ", "So with that, I want to thank everyone for joining today. We sincerely, as always, appreciate your interest in Ventas and your support of the company. And we hope to see everybody in Florida next month.

My name is Derek and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lori Wittman, Vice President, Capital Market. Please proceed.", "Lori Wittman", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended June 30, 2012.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Please note that the quantitative reconciliation between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Lori, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to Ventas' Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Today, I'm pleased to share an overview of our excellent second quarter results. Ray Lewis, will discuss our portfolio and investment activities, and Rick Schweinhart, will review our financial results in details. After our remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "The Ventas investment thesis continues to be a very positive story of growth and defense. There are extremely limited opportunities that provide investors with good internal and external growth and also, significant defensive characteristics. The value of that optionality cannot be overstated in today's global environment with significant sale risk and upside. Our second quarter results and outlook for the year provide an outstanding example of these valuable qualities working in tandem for our constituents.", "Normalized FFO this quarter was excellent at $0.95 per share, up 19% from last year. And we maintain an outstanding balance sheet with 28% debt-to-enterprise value. We have also increased our guidance to $3.70 to $3.74 per share for the full year. If achieved at the midpoint, this would represent a 10% normalized FFO per share growth rate year-over-year.", "First, let's talk about the growth side of Ventas. Growth at Ventas comes from excelling at our 3 key activities: Allocating capital, raising capital and managing our assets. Simply put, we focus on investing in the right asset at the right price and structure, continuing to improve our cost of capital and driving performance in our portfolio. We have a long track record of effectively executing all 3 activities.", "Our external growth this quarter includes the completion of $1.2 billion in high-quality accretive acquisitions including Cogdell Spencer's MOB business and 16 new, high-quality, private pay Sunrise-managed senior living communities. Those acquisitions are performing extremely well and we continue to see excellent opportunities to invest in performing health care and senior housing assets. And we have good visibility to completing over $300 million in additional acquisitions in the near-term, as well as investing about $100 million in a small but profitable development and redevelopment pipeline.", "Our business model allows us to continue allocating capital flexibly across subsectors in different operating models and investment types  as conditions warrant and opportunities arise. And of course, the $1 trillion health care and senior housing real estate market is huge, fragmented, growing and dynamic. It should provide many investment opportunities to Ventas for years to come.", "Our internal growth has also been exceptional this quarter, particularly, in our senior housing operating segments. Our Atria- and Sunrise-managed assets are proving the benefits of our strategy, of buying the best assets in the best markets operated by the best managers. These communities are delivering great results with same-store NOI growing 8% year-over-year before management fees. These high quality assets provide upside to our shareholders in a growing economy.", "We also generated additional internal growth that will materialize in 2013 through our new 10-year lease with Kindred, on 10 long-term acute care hospitals or LTACs at a $6 million annual rent increase. Year-to-date, we have been proactive at capital raising, generating further internal growth by issuing $1.2 billion in bonds and using a portion of the proceeds to replace higher coupon debt security.", "Finally, our current $2.48 annualized dividend represents only 66% of our new guidance midpoint. This exceptionally favorable payout ratio should provide opportunities for us to continue increasing our annual dividends. We know that dividend growth is an important component of our total value proposition for shareholders.", "On the defensive side, there are 5 aspects of the Ventas business that are significant. One, we have scale, with a $26 billion enterprise value and $1.5 billion in annualized NOI. Two, we have a balanced portfolio that is diversified via geography, tenant operator, asset class and business model. Three, all of our asset types are need-based and resilient in a downturn, with increasing demand from those demographics and healthcare policy. Four,  a significant portion of our business is in triple-net leases that provide long-term stability and cash flows. And last, but not least, we have a fortress balance sheet. All of these factors protect investors, reserve value and limit volatility.", "Our outstanding balance sheet and liquidity provides those offensive and defensive benefits. Our 28% debt-to-enterprise value at quarter-end is industry leading and should allow us to continue taking advantage of external opportunities and also be a safe haven if the market is disrupted. During the quarter and the year, we have taken actions to further enhance our balance sheet and improve the quality of our portfolio. Among other things, we raised over $300 million in equity capital and sold assets or harvested loan repayments of over $250 million including the sale of 12 assets to assisted living concept. Our normalized FFO guidance assumed another $150 million in real estate dispositions and loan repayments.", "Our asset sales year-to-date have generated gains approaching $80 million. And we intend to continue executing on our articulated strategy of selectively and calculatingly divesting of assets to improve our portfolio. We believe the Ventas combination of internal and external growth on the one hand, and balance sheet and portfolio management on the other, provide the right mixture of offense and defense for our investors, particularly in the current macroeconomic environment.", "The results of our strategy and execution are clear, in early 2008, Ventas was not a top 10 component in Vanguard's REIT index. Now, we are fourth with a 4.3% rate. More importantly, Ventas' performance has continued to be strong. Our total shareholder returns year-to-date exceeds 20%. Whether you look at year-to-date, 1-, 3-, 5- or 10-year periods,, Ventas has outperformed both the S&P 500 and the REIT Index in each period, often by a wide margin. This record reflects the consistency, reliability and all weather performance we seek to deliver. Ray?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Thank you, Debbie. Today, I'd like to share with you how our strategic growth and diversification strategy, coupled with our rigorous asset management approach, continues to deliver results with a potent combination of our higher growth seniors housing operating asset, coupled with the stable cash flows of our triple-net lease portfolios and MOBs.", "First, I'll briefly cover the performance of our triple-net lease portfolio, which is diversified across 913 seniors housing, skilled nursing and hospital assets  with over 73 tenants. These assets are generally in pool, multi-facility, long-term after leases with credit and structural support. Cash flow coverage in our same-store triple-net lease portfolio for the first quarter of 2012 was strong at 1.7x, and our Kindred coverage remains strong at 2x. Coverage across our same-store portfolio of senior housing and hospital assets was stable to slightly improving sequentially at 1.3x and 2.5x, respectively. As expected, coverage in the same-store skilled nursing portfolio declined sequentially from 2x to a still, very healthy, 1.9x, due to the inclusion of another quarter of the 2012 CMS reimbursement cut in the debt period. We expect an update from CMS for the 2013 fiscal year, Medicare reimbursement rate and the skilled nursing and long-term acute care hospital sectors to be delivered shortly.", "Our expectations for skilled nursing is a net 1% to 2% increase beginning October 1, 2012. As for the LTACs, the proposed rule issued in April called for a 1.9% increase in spending, and it's possible that the final rule could be more favorable. These impacts on the SNF and LTAC sectors are before any impact from sequestration, if it occurs. So, all in all, the near-term outlook is stable for reimbursement.", "Before I move on, I'd like to take just a brief moment to update you on the status of the releasing process for 54 skilled nursing facilities. With the completion of the lease on the 10 LTAC properties that Debbie mentioned, we have renewed 35 of the 89 properties, including all 16 of the LTACs, and about 60% of the existing rent on the building. We've been actively managing the process and have generated significant interest in the remaining 54 assets. In fact, we have received strong interest with multiple bids in all states from both existing and prospective relationships including national, local and regional operators.", "As a reminder, our goals in this process are to do business with reputable operators and to maximize rent, and we expect to enter into multiple transactions  to achieve this outcome. And while we are still relatively early in the process, we are encouraged by the broad interest in our assets and continue to believe that our current rents are consistent with market level. We hope to be able to provide you with more clarity in the third quarter as the marketing process unfolds.", "Next, I'd like to discuss our seniors housing operating portfolio, which accounts for 26% of our NOI. With the addition of the 16 new Sunrise properties that we acquired in April, this portfolio now consists of 214 high-quality, independent and assisted-living communities in affluent markets around major metropolitan areas managed by Sunrise and Atria. As we have been saying, these best-in-class properties have core-like characteristics, but provide above core return. And right on cue, our portfolio turned in another strong performance in the second quarter, with positive sequential and year-over-year increases in occupancy, NOI and margin.", "NOI, before management fees, for the total same-store portfolio increased 2% sequentially in the second quarter to $107.9 million compared to the first quarter of 2012. And NOI, after management fees, was $91.8 million, up about 1.7% sequentially. Unit occupancy in our 197 property same-store portfolio continued its upward trend by increasing 80 basis points sequentially to 89.2%.", "NYXdata on the Top 31 MSA shows that unit occupancies increased 40 basis point sequentially. Typically, we would expect to see a seasonal decline in occupancy at the beginning of the second quarter but not this year. On the contrary, occupancy has continued to be very strong and we are very pleased with the overall performance.", "In second quarter of last year, NOI and the 196 properties in our same-store Sunrise and Atria portfolio, grew 8% before management fees and 4.8% after management fees. As a reminder, our Sunrise-based management fee reverted the 6% of revenues this year, up from the 3.75% reduced rate that we had negotiated for 2011. Year-over-year, unit occupancy and the same-store Sunrise- and Atria-managed portfolios grew 250 basis points to 89.3% compared to a 10 basis point year-over-year occupancy increased reported by NYX for the top 30 MSAs.", "On May 1, we closed the acquisition of 16 Sunrise communities for $362 million. These high-quality assets were developed by Sunrise are similar in quality to our existing Sunrise portfolio and are 4-years old on average. Based on the performance during the first couple of months of our ownership, the current yield on this portfolio is over 7%. As the consequence of the 17th Sunrise and Atria operating properties acquired in the first half and our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our full-year guidance range on our seniors housing operating assets to $375 million to $381 million, from $350 million to $360 million.", "We expect performance for the 197th senior housing asset included in our original guidance to be at the high-end of the original range. Though those expenses were slightly higher this quarter, in line with what we expected and what we told you during our first quarter results call, and we expect this trend to continue into the second half. But all in all, the results of our operating assets have continued to prove out our strategy that investing in the best asset in the best market with the best operators will result in above average growth for Ventas.", "Before I turn to acquisitions, I'd like to discuss the Ventas' MOB portfolio, with which the acquisition of Cogdell Spencer, which closed on April 2, now comprises 320 properties standing on about $17.4 million-owned square feet and accounts for 15% of our annualized NOI. Here are a few of the MOB segment highlights for the second quarter. Cash NOI in the 69 same-store consolidated MOBs that we own in both the second quarter of 2011 and 2012, increased 3.2% year-over-year. Driven primarily by increases in rate and expense control, offset by a slight decrease in occupancy. Occupancy in our 245 stable MOBs was just under 92% in the second quarter. Occupancy in the same-store stable portfolio in the second quarter of 2012 was consistent with the first quarter and leasing activity remained strong. We closed our acquisition of Cogdell in early April and due to the efforts of many talented professionals at both companies, the closing and integration went exceptionally well. The portfolio consists of 71 high-quality medical office buildings containing 3.9 million square feet located primarily on the campuses of leading health care systems in the Southeast. Stable portfolio is 94% occupied and we purchased the entire portfolio for less than $200 per square foot.", "Second quarter financial results are in line or slightly better than our expectations, making the acquisition cap rate in the mid-7%  range. We welcome our new Cogdell colleagues to the company.", "Finally, we will complete and open 3 100% pre-leased medical office building developments in the second half containing 278,000 square feet. The total development cost is approximately $109 million and the expected yield to cost averages 8.4%. Though our medical office business continues to provide steady performance and with the addition of Cogdell, a further diversification of our national platform and relationships with leading health care system across the country, that position us to continue to consolidate and grow in this attractive space.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart, I'd like to spend a brief moment on the investment environment. Our acquisition pipeline is very active and we are seeing both small and large acquisition opportunities. In addition, to the $1.1 billion we have invested in the Cogdell and Sunrise transactions, we have also closed investments of $159 million in the first half of the year  at an average going in unlevered cash yield exceeding 7%. We also expect to complete over $300 million in additional acquisitions in the third quarter at approximately 7% going in unlevered yield. All of this investment activity is coming from existing NHP, Lillibridge or Ventas relationships.", "Our opportunities continue to be diverse. Individual assets, small and large portfolios, both senior housing and MOBs, and play off the trends of demographic growth and operator consolidation. The U.S. health care market is large, growing and still very fragmented and there are no shortages of potential opportunities available to us from either existing customers or new relationships.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart, who will discuss our financial results. Rick?", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. The following significant events occurred during the second quarter. On April 2, we acquired 100% of the stock of Cogdell Spencer for approximately $760 million, including the assumption of debt of $213 million. Cogdell's operations are included for the entire quarter.", "On May 1, we acquired 16 Sunrise-managed properties for $362 million. During the quarter, we also acquired 7 assets for approximately $98 million. On June 18, we sold 12 senior housing communities for $100 million, including a $3 million fee producing a $24 million gain. In April, we issued $600 million of 7-year, 4% senior notes. The proceeds were used to pay down our revolver and pre-fund our acquisition of 16 Sunrise communities, and call our 6 3/4 senior notes. On May 16, we redeemed our 6 3/4% senior notes due 2017, incurring a loss on debt extinguishment of $10 million, of which, $7.6 million was a cash make-whole payment. On May 1, we repaid $82 million of our 9% senior notes on their maturity date.", "In early June, we issued almost 6 million common shares producing proceeds of $342 million. Our revolver balance at quarter-end was $367 million. Currently, we have unrestricted cash of $55 million, $370 million outstanding on the revolver and over $1.6 billion of capacity available. Our pro forma and net debt to EBITDA is extremely strong at about 4.9x.", "Now, let me focus on second quarter results. Second quarter 2012 normalized FFO was $0.95 per diluted share, an increase of 19% compared to the second quarter 2011 per share results of $0.80. Normalized FFO increased 96% to $278 million compared to last year's second quarter of $142 million. We have detailed the non-cash items included in normalized FFO on Page 18 of the supplemental. Normalized FFO in the second quarter excludes the net expense of totaling $3 million from the loss on extinguishment of debt, merger expenses and deal costs, mark-to-market adjustment for derivatives and amortization of other intangibles. Offset by the gain on sale of real estate and non-cash income tax benefit.", "Second quarter normalized FFO increased from last year's second quarter due to NOI increases in all 3 of our segments: Triple-net, senior housing operating and medical office, and lower-weighted average interest rates. Triple-net lease revenue grew to $208 million from $116 million last year, primarily due to the acquisition of Nationwide Health Properties and normal annual contractual escalation.", "Senior housing operating NOI increased $31 million to $96.5 million from $65.5 million last year, principally due to the acquisition of Atria and 16 Sunrise-managed communities. Second quarter medical office building NOI grew to $62.9 million from $18.7 million last year, primarily due to the NHP and Cogdell acquisitions. Both periods include $1.4 million in unconsolidated joint venture earnings. Income from loans and investments was $8.2 million this quarter, fairly flat with the $8.4 billion last year.", "On the expense side, consolidated interest expense increased to $74.4 million this quarter from $52 million last year reflecting the assumed debt due to the Atria, NHP and Cogdell acquisitions, as well as all the debt activity in the last 4 quarters. Our average cash interest rate improved to 4.6% from 5.2% last year.", "Looking at sequential results, normalized FFO increased $13.9 million to this quarter's $277.8 million, primarily due to second quarter acquisitions and second quarter increases in all 3 of our segments, partially offset by increases in interest and G&A expense. Interest expense increased $4.8 million in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, principally due to acquisition activity offset by interest decreases due to the retirement of our 9%, 6 3/4% and 6 1/2% senior notes, and the issuance of our new 4% senior notes.", "We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flows from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 147% to $461 million in the first half of 2012, from $186 million in last year's first half.", "At June 30, our credit stats were outstanding with the net debt to pro forma EBITDA at 4.9x. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 4x and debt-to-enterprise value of 28%. Weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were 293 million shares, up 64% compared to the second quarter of last year, and up slightly compared to the first quarter of this year, reflecting the issuance of almost 6 million shares in June.", "We are raising our 2012 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance to $3.70 to $3.74 from $3.63 to $3.69. This 1.6% increase in our FFO per share guidance is primarily due to our acquisition of the 16 Sunrise-managed communities, stronger performance from the company's senior housing operating portfolio, year to date, slightly better-than-expected results from the Cogdell acquisition and additional investment activity, offset in part by more shares outstanding, the $0.02 to $0.03 per share second half impact of the year's approximately $400 million in asset sales and loan repayments, net rent adjustments on our triple-net lease portfolio approximating $6 million and debt refinancing during the second quarter -- second half of the year. Guidance does not include the impact of additional capital transaction or any unannounced acquisition.", "Operator, if you would, please, open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Rich Anderson, BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Can you list, in order of priority, your financing alternatives as it relates to your acquisition pipeline?", "Lori Wittman", "We, obviously, focus on our cost to capital and we have maintained a split in every capital market imaginable. So we obviously, have revolver capabilities. We have term loan capabilities. We have long-term, unsecured bonds capabilities, Fannie and Freddie ,  converts, et cetera. And so, as we are modeling out the identified near-term acquisitions, we're looking at some combination of those debt products for -- to acquire those assets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. But more likely, debt products at this point?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Been talking a little bit to our economist up in Canada about the potentially plateauing economy there, and I'm curious what your view is on the future of Canada given your investments there. It's become a lesser portion of the portfolio, obviously, as you've grown. But do you have any opinion now about the future in terms of Ventas' interest north of the border?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well ...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Oh, go ahead, Ray.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Rich, as you point out, we currently own 12 Sunrise properties in Canada. They have been very strong performers in our portfolio. Average occupancy in Canada is 95.6% in the quarter and they've consistently been very strong performers. We think the Canadian senior housing market generally is a good market. It doesn't have a lot of supply particularly in the high-end assisted living and higher acuity assisted living space. So we really like our investments up there. If we could find more attractive investments like that, I think we would be comfortable adding to those. But obviously, we keep a mindful eye on the same economic trends that you do.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "A couple of quick follow-up, the guidance methodology changed by adding unannounced to acquisition and dispositions, I'm curious what motivation was behind that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, the methodology, really, is -- typically, we do not include acquisitions or dispositions or loans repayments in our guidance. I would say that when in fact we had a known inflow, however, of capital such as we have this year with the potential $400 million worth of dispositions, I think it gives investors a clear, more transparent picture if we explain to them what our use of proceeds is, because if we simply pay down the revolver, something with the capital, that wouldn't really give a true reflection to investors of what we expect our FFO per share growth to be. So if -- we have done this in the past when we had known inflows of capital, that's why.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "That's fair. Then the last question is, what were the motivations behind the sale to assisted living concept?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "As we said in our press release, Ventas really stands for excellence in senior's housing. We believe that this transaction really will gave ALZ the opportunity to make positive changes for the residents in those assets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Like you didn't -- weren't on the same page with them in terms of their operating methodologies, is that right, or how they went after this?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It was a mutually beneficial transaction and again, we hope that ALZ uses that transaction as a springboard to continuing to make changes for the benefit of its company and its residents.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Jana Galan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I wanted to clarify the $98 million of senior housing community acquisitions in 2Q, is it triple-net or operating? And if maybe you could give us your view on partnering with other operators in the space other than Atria and Sunrise?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well, the first part of your question, the $98 million was triple-net, there were -- yes, it was triple-net. And then with respect to partnering with Atria and Sunrise, obviously, with the acquisition of the 16 Sunrise assets, we've increased our relationship, grown our relationship with Sunrise. We continue to believe, and I think our performance shows that they are both outstanding operators, and to the extent that we can find the best assets in the best markets, we'd be very happy to continue to grow our relationship with those 2 operators.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then maybe if you could give us some guidance around what type of disposition yields your cap rates?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, we can. In this second half, $150 million, which is loan repayments and dispositions. It's pretty much across the board in terms of asset type and balanced in that way and the lease cap rate or NOI cap rate is in that the 8% to 8.5% range.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of James Milam from Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Can you just break down how much of the dispositions, I guess, that 8, 8.5 covers the whole $150 million, is there -- I guess how much of that is a debt repayment versus asset sales?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's about 1/4 of everything. It's pretty balanced across the board, James.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And then I was wondering if -- on the senior housing operating guidance, what would that number have been, excluding the acquisition that you guys announced, so kind of comparable to your prior guidance at the beginning of the year?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right. And I think Ray mentioned, we have given the $350 million to $360 million guidance for the year, and with respect to the assets that, that covered, it's -- we're performing, and our expectations are in the high end of that range.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my last one, Debbie, probably for you. Just given as you kind of close in at the end of the year and at least as of right now, tax law is going to change and going to increase, I think for Ventas specifically, that may mean there could be additional acquisition opportunities. So I wonder if you could share some color on that. And then also more broadly, just if -- what your perspective is given your visibility and the people you're talking to, whether or not people are starting to change their behavior in anticipation of those changes.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I don't see a lot of behavioral changes regarding tax changes that may occur at the end of the year because I think there isn't a tremendous amount of certainty about what actually will happen. The one thing I was a little bit more focused on is that as you know, when the Bush tax cuts were originally passed, they included a preference essentially for corporate dividends over REIT dividends. And if those provisions expire, REIT dividends could be relatively, be even more on an even footing with corporate dividends, and that could actually benefit REITs.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I'm here with Derek Bower. You had answered a question earlier from Rick regarding capital alternatives, and I was a little perplexed because you're stock's now creating the highest valuation I think it's ever traded as a public company, you\u2019re at a 5% FFO yield, below 5% implied cap rate, you could effectively go out, issue equity and buy absolutely anything you wanted to and it would be accretive. What's stopping you from doing it?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, I would tell you that based on what we talked about here today, we identified about $1.5 billion of acquisitions that we've talked about, if you think about Cogdell, if you think about the Sunrise, 16, if you think about the other acquisition activity, if you think about the $300 million we've discussed, if you think about the investment development -- redevelopment pipeline, so I would say that we are certainly not sitting on our hands here at Ventas and we -- here's what I will say. First of all, 2 things, we will always be disciplined, and that is really important. We have a strategy. We execute that strategy to the best of our ability. We want to have the high-quality company that is delivered to its all-weather performance and I think regardless of \"accretion\" we're trying to build value, long-term value, short-term value and we will be disciplined in deciding kind of what to buy. But obviously, we have been active. I will tell you something else though, and that is, I was reflecting with a new senior level executive at Ventas and I said that if someone had told me in 2000 when Ventas' equity cap was $200 million, that we'd be sitting here in 2012 with a $19 billion-plus equity market capitalization, I wouldn't have possibly believed that. But what is really amazing to me is I never would have believed also that even after all of that growth over the last 12 years, I would be more excited and believe more in the growth potential of Ventas and our industry as I am right now. And that is a pretty remarkable observation. And I think it does speak to our ability to use all the attributes that we have here including cost of capital and including the market that we're in and the opportunities that we see over the near and long term, to continue building value and continue growing the company. So I hope -- that's a long answer to your question, but I hope it's responsive.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Dan Bernstein from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I just want to be clear on the -- what's coming out from the third quarter for ALZ for the assisted living concept and the triple-net leases, I think Rick said $6 million, does that include the $3 million termination fee that was -- I think in the second quarter, is that a correct assessment?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I don't understand the question, could you repeat?", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess you're going to lose some lease rent from ALZ and I think Rick said, there was $6 million less of lease rents that are going to come out from all dispositions, and I just want to make sure that I'm understanding that $6 million correctly as to whether that includes the termination fee that was part of the ALZ leases or not.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No. The ALZ fee is in this quarter and it was about $7 million in rents.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Including the termination fee?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The termination fee is a part of the $100 million and it's in this quarter.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Right. But is that $3 million in the rent number somewhere or is that in your earnings this quarter?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No, it's not.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's what I didn't understand. And then the other question I had, when looking at the seniors housing performance, and I just kind of try to isolate some of the same-store Sunrise property, that 79, it looked like it performed 60 or 70 basis points or so quarter-over-quarter and that maybe implies that the Atria occupancy was a little less than that. And if you could talk about the performance between those 2 portfolios. And I also understand, maybe on the Atria side, I'm missing the redevelopment property, so you could talk about maybe how the redevelopment assets are doing in terms of your expectations as well.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Dan, both the Atria and the Sunrise assets performed extremely well during the quarter. As you know, we acquired the Atria assets in the second quarter of 2011, and so we don't yet report year-over-year analysis or include those in the same-store analysis, but I can tell you that Atria perform -- Atria and Sunrise performed quite comparably, sequentially and year-over-year.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And the redevelopment assets are meeting your expectations for your returns on your investment there?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "On they are, Dan. I think they performed right in line with our underwriting on those assets. We continue to identify redevelopment opportunities in the portfolio and invested additional capital in there. And that is a good growth driver in that portfolio.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then turning to the remarketing of the 54 skilled nursing assets, you talked about some very strong demand from local, regional, large, national operators, what do you think is driving the demand from those operators? Is it the quality of the assets, are they all looking for economies of scale? We've obviously seen the Jonas' Sun merger [ph] , and turning to the REITs for that financing due to their cash positions post-reimbursement cut last October?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We met -- there are a few simple reasons why the process in these assets have generated such a competitive process and robust interest. First of all, there's a lot of cash flow with the asset and the prospective tenants will have to make -- remember, there's essentially very limited capital that's involved in re-tenanting the assets, effectively working capital for the new operator. And so they will be essentially stepping into a cash flow position where they will get immediate cash flow over and above the rent payment for a very, very de minimis capital contribution, and they will be able to spread overhead as you suggest. So this is a very attractive way to be able to expand your  business if you're in market, if you're a provider and that I think is the central reason why we're having such terrific interest on this process.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And does that imply, do you think that the SNF operators are going to turn more to the REITS as well for further financing and growth of their companies, you see that as an opportunity for you?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, certainly, that is one part of the consolidation theme and part of the growth being potentially in-house care real estate. But I think this marketing process is really more about the quality of these assets, the cash flow with these assets and the ability of operators to be able to drive profitability in their market by spreading overhead and getting coverage, cash flow over and above the lease payment. And it's as simple as that.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Quentin Velleley from Citi.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just in terms of -- Debbie, I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the acquisition pipeline you're seeing, has there been any reduction in the size of the pipeline? And maybe if you could talk a little bit more about what sectors are more active.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I'm going to ask John Cobb to take that, Quentin.", "John D. Cobb", "Yes, I think we still see an active pipeline across all sectors, both in MOBs, senior housing and skilled nursing, and we still focus on the senior housing and MOB, but it's still very active both small deals and large deals as Ray said earlier.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then in terms of size, you haven't seen any reduction over the last 12 or 24 months, is that a fair statement?", "John D. Cobb", "That is a fair statement.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just in terms of guidance, it's all about  the run rate in the second quarter at $0.95 and just simplistically apply that for the rest of the year, you'd be above the high end of the revised guidance? And then if I look at some of the capital management you're doing, there might be a little bit of net dilution there. I think you said you're buying $300 million assets or factoring in $300 million of assets at a 7 cap, selling $150 million at an 8%, 8.5% and then I assume you're going to turn out some of the debt on the line. Is there anything else in there that's going to pull that run rate down that I should be thinking about?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. And it's quite simple. So as we mentioned to Dan, there's a $3 million lease termination fee in the second quarter. So obviously, that is relevant. And then remember, we had the 6 million shares outstanding just for June, and so those will have an impact in the second half as well. And we sold the ALZ for $100 million at the end of June, so it's really the $150 million that will come of dispositions plus the $100 million that occurred at the end of the quarter. So we do have a lot of really positive things and accretion happening in the second half. And then we do have the impact of those dispositions and loan repayments and the like.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Nick Yulico from Macquarie.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Just quickly on who is the operator for the $98 million of acquisition in senior housing? Is that one operator, who was that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Some of it was an existing customer and some of it was a new customer.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. It's not possible I get the actual operator? Names?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "They're existing, kind of NHP and Ventas customers, public and private.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then on the $350 million refinancing plan, I just want to be clear, were you saying that, that -- is that going to be accretive or dilutive? Is that based on permanent financing versus what's on the line or is it based on taking out some of your bonds which you're trading or which have higher costs and where you could issue today?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. Well, as Quentin said, some of it is turning out the line and if we did go to the bond market, and some of the debt that we now have has higher cash coupons that has lower GAAP interest rates. And so that would show up as a dilutive -- a slightly dilutive impact even though it could be cash accretive.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just lastly on the whole debt side. I mean, you do have a fair amount of bonds next year coming due and then mortgage debt as well. I mean how early can you go out and refinance some of this, particularly some of the mortgage debt?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The mortgage debt really isn't -- wouldn't be until -- if we chose to take it out early, it wouldn't be really until the end of the year. So there won't be much of an impact on that in '12.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. But presumably, it would be -- the thinking would be that you would be -- I mean, would the plan be to do an unsecured to refinance that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, we'll access market conditions at that time. Again, I think one of the things that we try to be really good at is capital raising and hitting the right market at the right time. So obviously, we have to see what market conditions are and then we'll make a judgment at that time.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Philip Martin from Morningstar.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I have a question just regarding the nature of Ventas' organic growth. Specifically, any discussions you might be having with the hospitals and healthcare systems and their development, redevelopment or expansion needs. Could you address this and how and when it may impact your development pipeline or portfolio?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "So, Philip, obviously, Ventas, through its Lillibridge business, has very strong relationships with a number of highly rated health systems around the country, and as I'm sure you're acutely aware, as the healthcare market is evolving, you're seeing more and more interest in integration, vertically and horizontally, in that space. Hospitals are focusing on returns on operations, and that's the whole message of having real estate flow to the most efficient operators starting to gain traction. And so we think we're very well positioned as hospitals look to optimize their capital structure to participate in the consolidation, both vertically and horizontally that is inevitable in the industry. So when that's going to happen, is difficult to predict, but we continue to work on that opportunity and plant the seed so that we're well positioned when it does start to accelerate.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Are the systems really, at this point, in assessment mode? I mean, certainly, the care and coordination of care is likely going to be delivered a bit differently as this continues to evolve. But the systems, I'm sure, have to be looking at their strategies going forward, managing this real estate need, et cetera. So I would have to imagine there's some pretty interesting and attractive opportunities are down the road.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We think there will be as well. Wherever there's a lot of change and there's a lot of real estate and a lot of capital needs, which in, obviously, with the relationships that we have, we should be very well positioned to both understand and execute. And so over time, I think it will be a fruitful avenue potentially.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Actually, Philip just asked my question, so I don't have any further questions.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Market.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "On the development and redevelopment, the $100 million that you were talking about for later this year, are those the projects listed on Page 16 of the supplement, or is that in addition to what you've got already underway there?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's really listed on the supplemental.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then second question is just on Lillibridge. If I remember correctly, I think there are about 60 assets that you guys bought joint venture interest in, and I think you had the right to first offer on the remaining interest in those. Is that something you guys would want to own, is that a potential deal that you guys are looking at on the table? And what would you -- how would you feel about owning more of Lillibridge today?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, our Lillibridge partnership has gone quite well. We're looking at our friends across the table here and obviously, at the high quality portfolio. And so -- and in strategy, so the assets in our MOB Lillibridge portfolio are generally performing well, and so if there's an opportunity, I'm sure we would look at it.", "Operator", "Your next question coming from the line of Tom Truxillo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just following up on the surprisingly high number of questions about balance sheet and capital, it kind of felt like a bank call today. I'd appreciate the comments about it. So first of all, I'd appreciate the comments about being prudent when deciding to buy and not necessarily letting this cheap capital that's abundant drive your acquisition strategy. But getting back a little bit to how you finance the deals that you do close, you stated it would be mostly some form of debt, not equity. Given that, I assume your leverage metrics are going to go up a little bit, depending on how much you do, is that...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Remember, I was just addressing the, essentially the $300 million that we talked about as a near-term opportunity. I mean, look at our -- you know our credit stats are just of the chart, they deserve the IBM coupon. And so a $300 million acquisition is not going to move the needle one way or another.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So that was just to that $300 million. I mean if you pursue something bigger than that, it would be, maybe a more balanced financing approach?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "As you know, we are absolutely fanatical about managing our balance sheet, keeping a strong balance sheet and we have our own identified target ratios that are very strong that we have maintained over years and years of growth, again, going from the $200 million of equity capital to the $19 billion now. And I think equity has grown twice as much as debt over that time, so we have been able to make money for shareholders while maintaining a really strong balance sheet, and again that goes back to the offense and defense. And you will not see any -- we are as committed to that now as we always have been. So you should feel good about that.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And a real quick follow-on, I assume you're revolver is probably the cheapest form of capital you have. Can you talk about how you decide when to term that out -- term the short-term borrowings out rather than running up a more kind of substantial balance and then issuing, maybe, a larger unsecured bond deal?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we look at those kind of tactical things all the time, and hopefully, we're doing a good job balancing all the objectives that we have in terms of tapping the market at the right time, providing our bond investors with liquidity and keeping a lot of availability on the line over time so that we could be opportunistic. So it's a mixture of all of -- it's a judgment call, really, of all of those qualities.", "So I want to thank, Derek, our operator, and all of our participants. With 10-year total return exceeding 770%, normalized FFO, compound annual growth over 10% and the highest compound dividend growth rate in REITs sector over that decade, I think you would all acknowledge that Ventas stacks up very well against many of the growth REITs, while also providing investors with shelter in the storm. So we really believe we enjoy valuable attributes that are going to support Ventas' continued success and growth for our constituents. And these are most importantly, our long tenured cohesive management team that focuses on delivering consistent superior total return to investors, excellent underlying supply-demand fundamentals in our business, a flexible business model, a competitive cost of capital, a huge fragmented market where consolidation and change will provide opportunities and an excellent diverse portfolio and of course, a strong balance sheet. So we hope everybody has a great rest of the summer. We're happy to see through our second quarter earnings, and we look forward to seeing you all in the fall. Thank you for your support.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Janina, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lori Wittman, Vice President, Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Lori Wittman", "Thank you very much.

Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Lori, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. Welcome Ventas' third quarter 2012 earnings call. Today, I'm pleased to share an overview of our excellent results, investment activities and outlook for the balance of the year, Ray Lewis will discuss our portfolio performance and Rich Schweinhart will review our financial results. We'll be delighted to answer your questions following our remarks.", "The Ventas business continues to thrive, demonstrating our ability to grow because of our high-performing diverse portfolio driven by demographic demand and our robust disciplined investment activities. We are executing on our 3 pillars of excellence: Capital raising, capital allocation and asset management, which are producing consistent superior results. Quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, we have put great numbers on the board with minimal volatility.", "Ventas posted outstanding third quarter results. Normalized FFO this quarter with $0.96 per share, up 9% from last year and total FFO grew 12%. Year-to-date cash flow from operations grew 60%. Our growth rate is especially impressive because this is the first quarter of year-over-year comparisons that include the NHP and Atria acquisitions in the prior period. Internal and external growth drove our superior result. We enjoyed fantastic performance in our Sunrise and Atria assets, which grew NOI 10% and occupancy 300 basis points, as well as robust accretive investment activity.", "Since the beginning of 2011, we have completed about $13 billion of acquisitions, including $1.7 billion year-to-date. Our unlevered yield on these high-quality year-to-date acquisition exceeds an outstanding 7.5%. In addition, our average cash debt costs continue to improve. We issued $275 million and 10-year bonds at 3/4. And just yesterday, closed a new $180-million 5-year funded term loan with the current rate of under 1.5%.", "Since the second quarter call, we've closed over $400 million of investments in mostly private pay assets, including 36 high-quality medical office buildings or MOBs, on-campus or affiliated with AA-rated hospital system. With access to an outstanding combination of internal and external sources, we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the highly fragmented and growing $1 trillion healthcare real estate market.", "Our acquisition pipeline is very active with potential deals emanating from Ventas, Lillibridge and NHP legacy relationship, as well as from new sellers eager to enter a market that can produce win-win outcomes for buyers and sellers. We began our acquisition charge 2 years ago, and the benefits of our strategy are clear today. Our focus is, as it always has been, on creating shareholder value. The strategy we articulated over a decade ago to become a leading player in our consolidating, dynamic sector with a disciplined approach to building a diversified portfolio with a private pay focus is serving us and our shareholders well. Ventas' need-based business continues to generate reliable demographic demand, furthered by policy shifts to lower-cost setting. These benefits translate into property performance that is the most positive and least volatile of all real estate asset classes.", "At quarter end, we maintained a fortuitous balance sheet at 29% that's enterprise value. We currently have $1.6 billion in available liquidity. Our strength in liquidity allow us to take advantage of opportunities and be a safe haven for investors in a disrupted market. We are raising our full-year normalized FFO guidance to $3.76 to $3.78 per share, representing 12% per share normalized year-over-year FFO growth if achieved. Excluding non-cash items in both periods, the growth rate would be 9% per share.", "Finally, we view our dividend and dividend growth as an important component of delivering consistent superior total return to shareholders. Our annual dividend growth has been 10% over the past 10 years, market-leading performance. Our current dividend represents just 66% of our updated 2012 normalized FFO per share guidance and 70% excluding non-cash items. We have confidence in our team and our balanced business model.", "Now, I'm happy to turn the call over to Ray to discuss this quarter's portfolio results.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Thank you, Debbie. Our diversified portfolio, 1,428 properties, turned in another quarter of excellent performance. We now derive 81% of our revenues and 70% of our NOI from private pay assets. Once again, our high-quality, higher growth seniors housing assets and our stable MOBs and triple net leases provided the winning combination of growth and defense that has been the centerpiece of our strategy.", "In the quarter, our same-store cash NOI grew 3.5% versus the third quarter of last year, and 4.4% normalizing for last year's reduced Sunrise management fee.", "Starting first with our 212 property seniors housing operating portfolio. This segment contributes 26% of our NOI, and is comprised of high-quality, independent and assisted-living communities in affluent markets around major Metropolitan areas managed by Sunrise and Atria. Our seniors housing operating portfolio turned in an exceptionally strong performance in the third quarter with positive sequential and year-over-year increases in occupancy, NOI and RUG-IV.", "The total seniors housing operating portfolio delivered $100.2 million of NOI after management fees in the third quarter, and $118.3 million before management fees, growth of 15.3% and 19.4%, respectively versus the prior year. NOI before management fees for the 194 properties same-store portfolio increased 9.7% in the third quarter to $108.6 million, compared to $99 million in the third quarter of 2011. And NOI after management fees was $92.3 million, up about 6.3% year-over-year. Same-store unit occupancy continued this upward trend, increasing 300 basis points year-over-year to 90.6%. Same-store sequential unit occupancy grew 140 basis points.", "The occupancy gains in the lease up portfolio have likewise been very strong. For example, the Atria-managed business at Longmont, which we acquired in March at approximately 82% occupancy is now 98% occupied. Atria of Hudson, which reopened in April of last year, is now fully occupied, and Atria of Glen Cove, which reopened in October of last year is now 84% occupied. So we continue to add cash flow growth and value through our portfolio redevelopment plan and acquisition strategy with Atria. Consistent with what we said on our last call, expenses increased slightly this quarter, and we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter. And consistent with historical trends, we expect that occupancy will start to decline in the back end of the fourth quarter.", "So our highly productive best in class seniors housing operating portfolio continues to perform extremely well. And we have increased our NOI expectations for the full year to $383 million to $385 million from $375 million to $381 million.", "Let me turn to the performance of our triple-net lease portfolio, which is diversified across seniors housing, skilled nursing and hospital assets with over 70 quality tenets. These assets are generally in pooled multi-facility long-term master leases with credit and structural support. Cash flow coverage in our same-store triple-net lease portfolio for the second quarter of 2012 was strong at 1.7x. And our Kindred coverage remains strong at 2x.", "In late July, CMS published its final increase in Medicare reimbursement rates for the 2013 fiscal year. Skilled nursing will receive a net increase of 1.8%, and LTACs will go up by 1.7%. These increases took effect at the beginning of October 2012 but do not reflect the impact of sequestration, should it occur.", "Before leaving the triple-net lease portfolio, let me touch on the releasing process on our Kindred skilled nursing facilities. As a reminder, there's a total of $126 million of rent -- of Kindred rent up for renewal in 2013, of which we have already replaced approximately $75 million. We have been marketing the remaining 54 properties for releasing since the mid-second quarter of this year. The process is going very well, and we are moving into the selection phase. Interest in the portfolio is strong, and we have multiple bids to lease the assets from both existing and new relationships for Ventas. We expect to complete the releasing in stages or clusters and that the total rent on the assets up for renewal should approximate the current rent level. We are excited about the opportunity this process provides Ventas to expand its tenant base and diversify its tenant relationships with multiple quality operators. We are confident that we will execute the releasing process to a successful outcome and look forward to providing you with more information through the end of this year.", "Finally, I'd like to discuss Ventas' MOB portfolio of 292 consolidated properties spanning 15.7 million square feet, which accounts for 17% of our annualized NOI. These well-occupied, on-campus properties affiliated with highly rated health systems have core-like characteristics, but provide above core returns.", "Here are a few of the MOB segment highlights for the second -- for the third quarter. Cash NOI in the 173 same-store consolidated MOBs that we owned in both third quarter of 2011 and 2012 increased 4.7% year-over-year, driven primarily by increases in rate and expense controls offset by a slight decrease in occupancy. Occupancy in our 279 stable MOBs was 91.6% in the third quarter. Also, during the quarter we delivered 2 MOBs totaling 302,000 square feet and over $80 million in total development costs. Both are 100% leased. One in Mission Hills, California, is silver lead eligible and affiliated with a AA-rated hospital system.", "The second, developed by Cogdell, is on the campus of a leading hospital in Duluth, Minnesota. These developments provide great risk-adjusted returns of 7% to 7.5%. So our medical office business is providing excellent performance, and we are continuing to see good development in leasing activity.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart, who will discuss our financial results. Rick?", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. The following significant events occurred in the third quarter. After August 1, we made $368 million of investments including acquiring 80% to 95% share in 2 medical office buildings JVs. These joint ventures were previously partially owned and included in investments in unconsolidated entities on the balance sheet and income from unconsolidated entities on the statement of income. They are fully consolidated, beginning on the acquisition date.", "On August 3, we issued $275 million of 10-year 3/4 senior notes. That same day, we prepaid a 200 million, 4% term loan maturing in September of 2013.", "On July 2, we repaid that maturity $73 million of 8 1/4% senior notes, which were fair valued when acquired at a GAAP effective rate of 1.6%. On September 28, we repaid $153 million of 5.9% mortgage debt with a scheduled maturity of January 1, 2013, which was fair valued when acquired and a GAAP effective rate of 3.1%.", "Please note that improved cash interest rates on refinanced debt don't always translate into FFO or net income pickups because the Atria and NHP debt was marked-to-market at GAAP rates averaging less than 4% versus almost 6% cash coupons. The positive benefits from refinancing higher cash coupon bonds and mortgage debt with more favorably priced debt has begun to show up in our cash flows.", "Our revolver balance at quarter-end was $705 million. Currently, we have unrestricted cash of $63 million, $435 million outstanding on the revolver and approximately $1.6 billion of capacity available.", "Now, let me focus on third quarter results, which, for the first time, contained both NHP and Atria in the prior comparison period. Third quarter 2012 normalized FFO was $0.96 per diluted share, an increase of 9%, compared to the third quarter of 2011 per share results of $0.88. Normalized FFO increased 12% to $285 million, compared to last year's third quarter of $255 million. We have detailed the non-cash items included in normalized FFO on Page 18 of the supplemental. Normalized FFO in the third quarter excludes the net benefit totaling $22 million from real estate activity, gain on extinguishment of debt and non-cash income tax benefit, offset by a merger expenses related to expenses -- excuse me, merger-related expenses and deal costs, mark-to-market adjustment for derivatives and amortization of other intangibles.", "Third quarter normalized FFO increased from last year's third quarter due to NOI increases in all 3 of our segments: Triple-net, Senior Housing Operating and Medical Office. And our $1.7 billion year-to-date acquisitions, offset somewhat by higher G&A expenses, interest expense due to higher debt balances from our acquisition activity and increases in the Sunrise management fee.", "Income from loans and investments was $9 million this quarter, down $1 million from $10 million per last year's third quarter due to repayments in our loan portfolio. On the expense side, consolidated interest expense increased to $75 million this quarter from $69.5 million last year, reflecting the assumed debt due to the Cogdell and MOB JV acquisitions as well as all the debt activity in the last 4 quarters.", "Our average interest rate improved 60 basis points to 4.4% from 5.0% last year. Looking at sequential results, normalized FFO increased $7.1 million to this quarter's $284.9 million primarily due to third quarter acquisitions and third quarter NOI increases in all 3 of our segments, partially offset by increases in interest due to acquisitions.", "Since July, we have closed or collected about $87 million of the asset sale proceeds and our loan repayments we discussed on our second quarter call. The weighted average cash yield on these dispositions and loans was 6.8%, and the GAAP yield was 8.4%. We are forecasting an additional $56 million or so of disposition or loan receipts by the end of the year.", "We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flows from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 60% to $709 million in the 9-month year-to-date in 2012 from $444 million in the first 9 months of last year. Our weighted average share count for the same period increased less than 40%.", "At September 30, our credit stats were outstanding with a net debt to pro forma EBITDA at 5.0x. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 4x and debt to enterprise value of 29%. Weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were 297 million shares, up 2%, compared to the third quarter of last year, and up compared to the second quarter this year, reflecting the issuance of almost 6 million shares in June of 2012.", "We are raising our 2012 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance to $3.76 to $3.78 from $3.70 to $3.74. This increase in guidance, since we spoke last to you, is primarily the result of stronger performance from our portfolio and additional acquisition accretion. Guidance does not include the impact of additional capital transactions or acquisitions.", "Operator, if you would, please open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Jana for Jeff. I wanted to ask you, you had very strong impressive occupancy growth in the operating senior housing assets, but the triple-net senior housing portfolio lost a little occupancy. I was curious if you could comment on the differences between the portfolios, and why one is performing at a better level in terms of occupancy?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "It's Ray. Remember that the triple-net is reported on a quarter leg, so you're looking at the second quarter statistics for the seniors housing portfolio. It's actually seasonally fairly common for the seniors housing to decline at the beginning of the second quarter, and then start to build towards the end of the second quarter. And I think the other thing to note in there is that, that performance is fairly consistent with declines that we saw in some of the public operators during the second quarter. So that sort of explains it.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, and again, as we've emphasized them, we have our senior housing operating portfolio, which is more than a quarter of our business and these are very strategically selected to be the best assets in the best markets and we have the benefit of that growth in the Ventas portfolios. So that -- we're very happy to have that growth directly flow through to our shareholders.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And bigger picture, do you think the senior housing business will change as you and your peers own more of the senior housing real estate out there. Would there be opportunities, you think, to take market share from some of the private owners?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, I mean, again, this market is a very good market. It's being driven by demographics. I think in general, if you own really good assets and good markets and you operate them professionally, you will outperform the averages. And that's really how we're thinking about our portfolio and our acquisition activity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Milam with Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I wonder if -- first off, can you just give us a little bit more color on the 36 MOBs that you acquired? Or maybe just tell us what the implied valuation for the portfolio is, the yield, and if there's any additional debt that you consolidate with that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The transactions that we closed kind of since we spoke to you last, which included those assets was on average above between kind of a 7% and a 7.5% yield. And so it's very attractive, they're 90% occupied, 100% affiliated or on-campus. And there was a mortgage debt that we consolidated with that.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Can you, I guess, how much was the -- of the 420, how much of that was the MOB assets? And then can you give the dollar amount and yield on the debt? And maybe also, the square footage for the full 36?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, it was -- I would tell you it was a lion's share of the acquisition activity. And Rick will give you the amount of the assumed debt.", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "Yes, the assumed debt is about $116 million, $117 million.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And the rate on that?", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "I believe it's around 5% something, right at 5% [ph].", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then also, can I ask -- on the senior housing portfolio, obviously, a very strong performance this quarter, and Jana touched on it a little bit. I'm curious, the same-store cash flow growth, obviously benefits from some occupancy increase. But maybe could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in rate, and what sort of a sustainable long-term growth rate is after the occupancy builds back up? And then maybe, Ray, to the extent that its specific if you're seeing anything in the housing market that is benefiting that portfolio?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, so on the rate side, if you look at our RUG-IV in our same-store total portfolio year-over-year, rates were up about 2.1%. And so, I think we're starting to get closer to that sweet spot of the cycle where occupancies start to get into the mid to upper 90s where you can really start to push rate, discounting will start to abate and we hope that we can continue to drive cash flow growth going forward through rate increases. Certainly, that will be tied to the performance of the general economy and the housing market to a lesser extent. Certainly, as the housing market continues to improve, that's another benefit to our seniors housing operating portfolio at the margin. So I think, we're at a pretty good point in the cycle with limited new supply, pretty strong occupancies and pretty good general underlying economic fundamentals.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "So assuming that we don't have any major blips in the general economy, is this kind of a 3 to 5-year window, where you think you can get mid-single-digit same-store growth? Or do you think it's longer than that?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "My crystal ball doesn't go out that far, James. But I do like the near-term outlook for the industry. So I think next year looks pretty good. So, again, barring any changes in the general underlying economy.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Last one. You guys did another 5-year term loan in the quarter. Debbie and Rick, maybe, could you just talk about how you're thinking about interest rates now and why, I guess, why not go more tenured debt, obviously, you did some of that as well, but what your thoughts are on the term loan market versus the unsecured market right now?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Sure. We are very focused on Capital Market's excellence. It's one of the things that we really spend a lot of time on. I would say that we want to have a foot in every capital market including the bank term loan market, which is very attractive right now. And we've done both, as you mentioned. And so we're -- we have very kind of rigorous internal metrics in terms of how we manage our balance sheet. And most of it will continue to be long-term fixed-rate debt, which is also very attractive at the 3 1/4% that we mentioned.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So I would like to get back to the same-store results in the operating senior housing. I think this is semantics, but is it fair, do you think, to include the unstabilized assets in that 10% number? Because really the stabilized pool grew by about 4.3%, if you look at Slide 12 in your supplemental. And I'm curious if you've always included non-stabilized in your same-store calculation?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we do it both ways. And in the shop portfolio, I would say we do same-store stable and we do the whole portfolio. I mean we bought the whole portfolio and so we've been looking to that high single-digit growth rate, which was our expectation and that's what we're getting. So that you can look at it, all different ways and all of them are valid.", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "And, Rich, if you looked at the same-store stabilized portfolio year-over-year on an EBITDARM basis, so if you were to take out the impact of the increase in the Sunrise management fee, you're looking at like an 8% year-over-year increase. So it's important to remember that.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, I mean, I guess that just -- the 10% is certainly not going to be a number that you'll be able to replicate over the long-term. I just wondered if maybe you should be highlighting the other number and...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay, good suggestion. So the SHOP was up 8% on a stabilized basis. I think that's a good data point.", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "SHOP being the acronym for the Seniors Housing Operating Portfolio.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Rick, can I ask a question about that -- you told me about the Kindred process for 2013. $126 million of rent that we had to be renewed -- we're going to renew in or expire in 2013. I remember the 64 assets being something like $77 million, am I right about that? And can you reconcile the $126 million to the $77 million for me?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Can you ask the question, again?", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "There's 64 assets in total that you're going to have to market, right? 10 you took care of that, you would credit [ph] the LTAC Master Lease, 54 are remaining. The 64 in total were $77 million of rent. Isn't that correct? Not $126 million.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Maybe I'll take this off-line with you. I'm -- maybe...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No, that's okay. My guess, honestly, is we've replaced somewhere between $75 million and $77 million. It could be the difference between an escalated number and an unescalated number, something like that.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I'll take that question off-line, maybe a little bit too much detail.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's okay. No problem.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, so maybe a little bit more bigger picture on the Kindred process. You said that's going well. To what degree, do you think, the elections or the fiscal cliff or whatever are having an effect on a hesitation on the part of potential replacement operators to take over some of those assets?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, so Rick, as we said, that the process is going well. We've got a lot of interest. We're on schedule. So we're happy about the way things are going. And I'll tell you, the operators are looking at the same thing that everybody else is looking at. They understand that sequestration is out there. They understand there's the election coming up, and that depending upon which way that goes there could be various impacts. And they're underwriting that into their numbers. So we haven't seen any -- as we get closer to those events, any changes in the appetite for the assets.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, we did get the positive of a rate increase starting October 1, so that was good, too.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "But it's been out there since the beginning of the process.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "At what point you start getting a little nervous as getting close to, is it May 2013? That you have to -- or April 30, is that right?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. I mean we're confident in the releasing process. We're way on schedule, and we think we're, as Ray said, into the selection phase. And we're pretty excited about the opportunities that this process is presenting for the Company.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, last question for me. If you deploy $1.6 billion of your current liquidity, most of it being the line balance or availability, where does that take you in terms of leverage from 29% to what? And what are you comfortable with being at before you would have to go back to raise equity?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, I mean, we typically -- the 29% obviously, is a wonderful statistics and we're at about 5x debt to EBITDA and over 4x fixed charge coverage. So I think we have, even as we do manage our balance sheet conservatively, but we have some significant acquisition capability without really any additional need for equity capital. Remember, we're also selling some assets. We're generating really significant excess cash flow in our portfolio over and above the dividend. And so we have some significant capacity to do acquisitions.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So we should assume that, that 29% number stays in that range for the foreseeable future, despite what activity you might take on?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. I mean the way we look at it, is we're at about -- the net debt to EBITDA number is about 5x as we've said consistently that we see plus or minus return on that. So given -- that's where. EBITDAs let's call it, a little under $1.5 billion.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I'm here with Derek Bower. If we think about acquisition and consolidation activity going forward, in particular 2013, do you think it's reasonable to assume that we're going to see a bit of a coming down period after what has been nothing short of a feeding frenzy for the past 24 months, or do you -- does Ventas personally remain sort of as open eyed as it has for the last 2 years, and how do you think about how your competitors are looking at it as well?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, as you point out, I mean, we were -- we are kind of at the leading edge of this activity. We've closed $13 billion in the last -- since the beginning of '11. What I would tell you is we are and continue to be a disciplined investor. Capital allocation is another important aspect of our activities. And we have, I think, been proven ourselves to be good capital allocators. And so we have lots of opportunities. The pie is large. It's a fragmented industry. And we believe we can drive value for investors by continuing to acquire in a thoughtful way. And as I mentioned, the $1.7 billion that we've acquired year-to-date, we are getting about a 7.5% unlevered yield, and they're very high-quality private pay assets. So if we can continue to do that, whether it's from new business, whether it's from existing NHP, Ventas, Lillibridge relationship, I think that would create value for our investors. So as and when we can continue to do that, we will do so. So I hope that answers your question.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "No, it does, I guess, I'd have a follow-up as well, which is I think it's no secret that you were the cover bid on the Sunrise transaction. How do you now feel about having a number of your owned assets effectively operated by one of your competitors? Does that cause you to think that maybe you should think about restructuring that relationship?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I didn't see any company vie in there.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Well you can choose not to answer the first part of the question. How about the second one?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Look, we have, as we've said, we've got great assets, they're performing extremely well, they're in great markets. And we have excellent contracts that provide alignment and have protective -- significant protective rights in them. And so the situation at Sunrise continues to evolve. And I think, that's what -- we feel happy with our assets and the performance of those assets.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can you elaborate on what you mean by those protective rights? Are you suggesting that the relationship has existed historically, might be changing?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "All I'm suggesting is that we do have great assets, they're in great markets, they're performing well, and we have really good contracts that we worked hard on to create alignment and protection for Ventas in all circumstances. And we feel good about that.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. I'm trying to interpret that. There's a lot of legalese in that comment, but it doesn't sound like you want to tell us any more than what you've just said.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We're good. Let's keep talking.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Ray, in your comments, you said if sequestration should occur, what areas would you see that not occurring?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well, I mean obviously, if something were to happen in the lame-duck session, where there were to be some resolution outside of the sequestration process. You've heard the President himself say, that's not going to happen.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Let's push it off.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "So they could push it off. I mean, there's a number of different things that could play out. Now certainly, the expectation in the underwriting that you go through right now as sequestration is what we have in place and what we are looking at. But that could change.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I believe Rick alluded to this, but how much of the $429 million of acquisitions closed in the third quarter versus what closed subsequent to quarter end?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Everything that's about $70 million, I think, closed in the third.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then last question. The 36 medical office building acquisition, was that a portfolio transaction?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It was.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Michael Bilerman. I just want to sort of follow-up a little bit on the acquisition side as well. Because I think in your opening comments, Debbie, you talked a bit about things like, it appeared almost that things were slowing down a little bit more judicious. You're being cognizant of sort of discipline on your capital in getting those returns. And I didn't know if you were trying to comment that things would be a little bit lower from an acquisition standpoint.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think what we're trying to communicate is that we have always invested as we believe we could create value for shareholders. One of the things that I would say is that this market is drawing a lot of sellers to the market, and we have this big portfolio of existing relationship. And so there continue to be really, thoroughly plentiful investment opportunities. But I would also say we really have been disciplined investors. I think our year-to-date yields and quality of acquisitions speak to that. And I can't project the acquisitions. We never have. We take opportunities that we think will create a good risk-adjusted returns for shareholders when they're available and -- but we are disciplined investors.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "What sort of pipeline, I guess, what they call the former NHP sort of regional platform? Where does that sort of stand on a quarterly basis, and what sort of volumes are you seeing on that front?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, again, our deals are coming -- as we put this unified platform together, I think the opportunity for us is really to get -- use the tools available to us to really drive performance in the company. And we are seeing good acquisition volume from the NHP legacy relationships. And we also believe that a lot of our existing tenant base is interested in the Kindred releasing process as well. So we're getting lots of benefits from, again, Lillibridge, NHP and our own historical business.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Are you seeing any opportunities on the debt side at all?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "To be a lender?", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Correct.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Is that what you're asking?", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We are seeing some opportunities, yes.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And how about across -- outside the U.S. Is that taking up any of your time at all?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We invested in Canada in 2007, as you know. And we have continued to look at opportunities outside the U.S. And over time, could see making some reasonably sized investments, but nothing short-term on the horizon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I presume the acquisitions on the MOB side came out of Lillibridge JVs. Can you remind us of what rights of first refusal or offer you have on those, and maybe talk about the motivations of the sellers? Is it motivated by a possibility of increased capital gains tax or is it something else that may be motivating the sellers?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We had 3 pools of joint venture assets on the Lillibridge side. And we have acquired 2 of those pools, and so we have one remaining. And I think, like everything, investors hold assets at various points in time. They make decisions whether they're a company, a pension fund, a private equity shop or what have you. They make a decision at a certain point in time that they'd like to recycle their capital. And so, I think, there's nothing more notable than that.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And you have rights of first refusal or offer on the other JV, I assume?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We have, in our joint venture deals, we do have rights of first refusal. And that would be typical in joint ventures, yes.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then are you -- just think in terms of priorities for acquisitions and property types. It seems seniors housing cap rates have been compressing. Do you view that the acquisition running for seniors housing is being a little heated, and is the risk reward better now for, say, medical office or skilled nursing or some other asset class? How are you prioritizing what property types you're looking to buy?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, again, we'd have a strategic plan to diversify our portfolio, create a balanced business model and to be active in all the different sectors. We have differentiated our strategy over the past couple of years by really emphasizing the private pay assets. And, again, as we allocate capital, if we are ahead of the curve, what we would see is our investors will make money if either cash flows go up or cap rates come down. And that's how we create -- it's very simple. That's how we create value for our shareholders. And so we look at all the asset types. Our strategy has been clearly articulated. And each deal really should make sense on its own. And we should believe that it fits well into the whole, and therefore, create additional enterprise value. And so that's how we assess transactions, and we continue to look across the spectrum of health care and senior housing assets. But we have focused more on private pay.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, you don't think seniors housing cap rates have bottomed yet or is there still room for cap rates to move down there?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think, again, every deal stands on its own in terms of quality, in terms of what the structure of the transaction is and markets and so on.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. On the dispositions, can you just describe kind of what you were selling, and maybe what the yields on those assets were?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right. I think we've talked about it. Rick mentioned that the GAAP yields was in the 8s on the sales and loan. Remember, its loan repayments as well, and it was in the 6s on the cash -- high 6s on the cash basis for the almost $90 million that we talked about since July 1.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just consistent with what you've said before.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Totally consistent, yes.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then one other question I had, just want to go back to Sunrise. Did you have any rights to go -- Sunrise management contracts, some of those are being reset. Do you have any rights to reset management contract fees upon change of control of Sunrise?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We have contracts that are -- that again, give us good alignment and give us various protective rights under different circumstances.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Quick question on the MOB side. I mean, I get this whole idea of more procedures being done in an out-patient setting. But the recent trend of doctors not becoming employees of hospitals, physician groups also kind of breaking apart and those physicians joining hospitals. Just wondering if you're starting to see that impact demand for MOB space in any way, shape or form?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "With respect to demand for the space, we're definitely seeing the trend. So there are a number of doctors' groups that are, as you say, being acquired by hospitals as they start to anticipate the Accountable Care Organizations and the impacts of those changes on the healthcare industry. The benefits of that, obviously, for us are that we get stronger alignment with a hospital in certain circumstances, perhaps a better credit to the extent the hospital actually acquires the practice. So that's clearly a benefit. The other thing for us is because our MOBs are predominantly on-campus, that tends to drive more demand for space in our buildings. So we would expect to see that translate into demand as that trend really starts to take hold. But we're kind of in the early stages right now, a little too early to sort of report a big impact from that.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then second question, just in regards to disposition. You did $87 million this quarter, you've added another $60 million to guidance for the fourth quarter. Just kind of curious, strategically, what you're getting rid of and why you kind of made the decision. Is that the right time to kind of call the portfolio?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we projected about, maybe $150 million for the second half of the year in our second quarter call. And this is really consistent with that. And it's really across asset types. And we have a very large, very diverse portfolio now. And I think you'll see us become a little bit more active capital recyclers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "I have a question on skilled nursing[ph]. We've seen the trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverages kind of tick down across your portfolio and your peers, as last year's Medicare cuts work through the system. Curious as to what you're hearing from your operators in kind of the second half of this year, if they have been able to adjust their operations in any way that will see kind of a leveling out next quarter in this EBITDAR coverage statistic or do you think we kind of see the same pace of decline?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well, I think as you look at the coverages that we've reported in our portfolio at 1.8x, I think it's consistent with what we had projected when the cuts were announced in October of last year. We said we would expect to see the rates decline by about 10 basis points every quarter, as another quarter of the cuts were rolled into the trailing coverage statistics. And that's pretty much how it played out. With respect to the operators that we're talking to and what they're seeing going forward, I think, a lot of the operators have identified ways to mitigate the cuts and to adjust their operations to maintain profitability. So I think the operators are looking at the forward environment and saying, this is an environment we can operate in and that's sort of what we're hearing right now.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so it kind of continued another 10 basis points of decline next quarter. At what point do you start getting concerned when you look at your leases on an after CapEx basis? I mean, maybe describing a little bit for the G&A of the operator. At what point do you start to get concerned about the health of those sniff [ph] leases?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "So I mean, as we look at our portfolio and underwrite management fees and CapEx, we're still very comfortable that the properties are profitable for the operators. So we're not at that point at all.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "But there's no kind of, I guess -- I guess the other problem is that you have the dispersion of the portfolio, right? You have an average statistics that's reported. Can you give any color around the dispersion around that statistics? In other words, the bottom 10% of your leases are covering it 10x, or can you give any more clarification on that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well we obviously have the Kindred leases, which are the biggest part of it detailed in the supplemental. And everything else is -- doesn't have -- we don't have a wide dispersion.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philip Martin with Morningstar.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Just when you thought you're off the hook. Can you characterize the turnover and even acuity of care makeup across your senior community portfolio? For example, what is the difference, if any, in your senior living communities and smaller markets where household income is, maybe a bit more average as compared to larger metro markets where income and demographics may be a bit stronger?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, that's a good question. As we've owned the -- our seniors housing operating portfolio for over a year now, and obviously, Sunrise back to '07, we started providing more information on both a regional and a MSA bases in our supplemental. And I think what we found this quarter, is that -- what we have found is that the larger markets have been outperforming. And they came out really strong and continued to be strong. I think what we're seeing now, and you can see it in the supplemental is that the smaller markets are actually doing quite well now. And you'll see that all the regions are also doing well. And obviously, the industry data set that's put out by NYX also slices and dices the portfolio that way. So I think we are seeing the smaller MSAs start to catch up, and the larger MSAs where we own most of our senior housing operating portfolio really have led the way with great growth last year and great growth again this year that's continuing.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Are you seeing any difference -- meaningful difference in turnover? Are you seeing an average length of stay, differential in the larger markets versus smaller markets or a higher turnover rate larger versus smaller?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Phillip, I guess anecdotally, the answer to that is, no. I think it's fairly consistent. I think the acuity level in general and the seniors housing industry is up. The average age at entry is up. And I think that's consistent in smaller markets and in larger markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nic Yulico with Macquarie.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Can you remind us on Atria and Sunrise, where those portfolio's were occupancy basis back at the peak. And where the rents today are in relation to the peak?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The Atria portfolio was acquired in parts, and so that's a difficult answer. I would say in general, and remember, occupancy statistics have changed over time to go from residents to unit occupancy. So you have to be careful when you compare historic periods. But I think back in '97 or so, resident occupancy was in the 93, 94 range. And we're getting, approaching that now, I would say. That's if memory serves.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I think that's right.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "So roughly still call it 300 basis points of off peak occupancy, which sort of mirrors what's going on.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No, no.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "No, that's resident not units.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "That's was what I was saying at the beginning. You have to be careful when you do your comparison. So resident occupancy in the '07-ish time period, I think, was in the 93, 94 range in Sunrise. And I think the resident occupancy now is approaching that.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay, and then as far as rents on these portfolios, I mean, they're up since 2007?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, I mean the rents have consistently risen year-over-year in the Sunrise portfolio. We've had good rent growth even through the downturn.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Remember that the senior housing industry was the only real estate asset class that showed positive NOI through the downturn. And that was because they were able to have some stable to even slightly growing rate growth with good expense controls and then some occupancy decline. So that's how it played out.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "So on the occupancy side, Sunrise is kind of back to -- close to peak type occupancy levels or close to it. And Atria still has some occupancy upside or is that also getting closer to the peak type occupancy levels that they enjoyed?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I would just say that, again, Sunrise and Atria have grown 10% year-over-year before management fees. 8 percentage, as Rich pointed out on the stabilized portfolio. And I think that they're still at the mid-90% unit occupancy level. And so I would suggest that industry trends continue to be positive. If you look at NYX data, you would see that they are projecting continued positive absorption well into 2013. And so I would characterize what we think about the forward environment, which we still think is attractive differently from what you said. And we view the forward absorption and growth rate to be fairly positive.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Yes, now I'm just trying to figure out where these portfolios are in relation to the peak. Because the industry overall is still running 300 basis points below peak occupancy. So it's just helpful to try and figure out what -- where these portfolios are in relation to the industry and industry recovery cycle at this point.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right. Well just be sure you're comparing apples to apples. But again, if we're at mid-90% unit occupancy levels, I would say that we think there will be positive absorption going forward.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay, helpful. And then just one other question on Kindred. You talked about getting some multiple bids there, moving to selection phase. You talked about rents, I think about, should approximate sort of current rents likely. What about CapEx? I mean, are operators requiring CapEx? Are you guys expect to have to spend anything on CapEx? I mean presumably, these are some older facilities that might need some CapEx?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "No, Nick. We -- Kindred has invested a lot of money in these buildings over the years and maintained them very well. We're not really expecting any material CapEx requirements on the releasing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I apologize if you already covered this, I hopped on late. I was hoping to just get some color as best you can share of how you and PMB are kind of looking at the world right now just in terms of your comfort level with new supply, and how they're thinking about things as well?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay, well just as a reminder to everyone, one of the benefits to the NHP transaction was we got the exclusive development pipeline with PMB. And we, in fact, opened one of the developments this quarter, as Ray pointed out, in California fully leased. And that was an important benefit we got from the transaction. I would turn it over to Ray to talk about the view of the world.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Right. And so supply remains very well in check in the medical office space. We are seeing interest from Hospital systems in developing new properties. We target on-campus developments, and there are a handful of those things that we and PMB are working on. So I would say that the market is consistent. I wouldn't say it's awash in opportunity, but I wouldn't say it's devoid as well.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "And I would point out too, that our Lillibridge business has a development business that's quite good, and we are developing a view assets as well that we're excited about.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Any difference between the 2, whether it's Lillibridge or PMB or you at the top? The comfort with building on spec versus these MOBs have to be pre-leased.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, yes. We are very disciplined about that.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "We require a minimum pre-leasing level in the buildings. So we don't build on spec and so, no. There's no difference between the way that we view it or PMB would view it.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think it's really -- this is demonstrated by the fact that the 2 that opened this quarter were 100% pre-leased, and another one that we expect to come on maybe, in January is 100% pre-leased to a AA hospital. So those you can get really good risk-adjusted returns because -- and you get new buildings in your portfolio. So that's how we look at the business. Again, on a very disciplined way. So we're going to have to wrap up the call. And I want to thank everyone and the operator and all of our participants. We sincerely appreciate your interest in Ventas. And we look forward to seeing everyone in San Diego. I hope you all realize that we continue to pursue our goal of delivering consistent superior total returns to our shareholders and using all the tools we have at our disposal to do so. So thanks again, and we'll see you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Please proceed, ma'am.", "Lori Wittman", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2012.

Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Lori, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our year-end 2012 earnings call. I'm delighted to discuss the highlights of our successful year and our expectations for a strong 2013. This morning, Ray Lewis will also discuss our portfolio performance and Rich Schweinhart will review our financial results in detail. Following those remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "2012 was a year of successfully executing our strategy and harnessing the power of the diverse assets, platforms and people we acquired over the past several years to deliver outstanding results for our stakeholders. Our total return to investors for the year was over 22%, and over the last 13 years Ventas has delivered 32% compound annual return to shareholders. As you know, we have built a balanced business model to provide consistent superior returns in a variety of economic, reimbursement and capital market environment, and our performance demonstrates the success of that approach. Ventas total return has exceeded the U.S. REIT index and the S&P 500 in each of the trailing 1, 3, 5 and 10-year time periods. Our strategy is simple and consistent: increase diversification and private pay assets in our portfolio, grow cash flows, maintain financial strength and flexibility, improve our cost of capital, make disciplined investments and actively manage our portfolio and enterprise risks.  At Ventas, we strive to achieve and sustain excellence so that we can provide consistent superior total returns to investors. Our drive for excellence is supported by 3 key activities: allocating capital, raising capital and asset management.", "Here are a few of our 2012 highlights. Our full-year financial results were outstanding. Normalized FFO for the year was $3.80 a share, up 13% from last year and total FFO grew 44%. Importantly, excluding non-cash items, our normalized FFO per share grew 10%. We completed $2.7 billion of investments, which were generated from all parts of our business, including existing NHP, Lillibridge, Cogdell Spencer and Ventas relationships as well as new customers. 97% of these investments were in private pay assets. Our cash unlevered yield on our 2012 real estate investment approaches 8%. We also improved our cost of capital during the year. We raised $2.6 billion in debt capital in 2012 at an interest rate of just over 3%. And our balance sheet remains pristine with debt to total capitalization a strong 31% at year-end.", "Our Asset Management Group and our quality tenant operators continued to drive portfolio performance this year. Same-store cash NOI in our portfolio grew 4.4% year-over-year, normalizing for the scheduled increase in the Sunrise management fee during 2012. And that doesn't even include the outstanding high-single-digit NOI growth in our Atria-managed assets, which we acquired mid-2011.", "As expected, we have completed signed agreements for all 89 licensed healthcare assets whose lease term comes up for renewal on May 1, 2013. This is a great example of our disciplined approach, our active portfolio management and our team's execution capabilities. We project that rent and reinvested sale proceeds on these assets should approximate $125 million in 2013. Notably, in 2012, the company generated $1 billion of cash flow from operations, a real milestone for us. Excluding litigation proceeds we received in 2011, cash flow from operations grew 74% in 2012 while our share count grew only 28% year-over-year. Even after paying dividends to our shareholders and funding recurring CapEx, retained cash flow approximated $200 million in 2012 that we redeployed toward income producing activity. Finally, at the end of the year, we made a strategic investments in Atria Senior Living, the nation's best largest senior living provider. As the senior living business continues to evolve, grow and consolidate, Ventas is poised to enjoy a meaningful role through both our real estate ownership and senior housing assets, our relationship with multiple leading care providers and our strategic investments in Atria.", "Today, we announced our 2013 normalized FFO guidance of $3.99 to $4.07 per share. At the midpoint of our -- of the range, our normalized FFO guidance represents 9% growth per share, excluding non-cash items. We expect net operating income or NOI to exceed $1.6 billion in 2013. As a result of our successful performance in 2012 and our confidence in cash flow growth in our business, we are pleased to announce an 8% increase in our dividend to $0.67 in the first quarter. Ventas' compound annual growth rate for dividends has been 8% for the last 8 years, and yet we retained one of the best, safest payout ratios in our sector with room for future dividend growth. We believe that our dividend is an important part of the total return proposition we offer to our shareholders.", "The healthcare and senior housing investment market remains very active, and we continue to see significant opportunities from this $1 trillion market that is growing, highly fragmented, rapidly changing and consolidating. It is also supported by significant demographic demand. Opportunities for external growth abound, yet we can never predict with certainty the timing or volume of our investments. We do know that our investment professionals will bring home more than our fair share of good deals that create value for Ventas and offer our sellers a reliable, customized capital solution that meets their needs. Finally, I want to publicly thank and recognize the Ventas team, which is a deep, experienced, skilled and cohesive group. Working together, they produce outstanding outcomes for our constituents year-after-year and 2012 was no exception. We will continue to raise the bar in 2013.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Thank you, Debbie. Our diversified and productive portfolio of 1,442 seniors housing, medical office and post-acute properties turned in another year of very strong performance.  For the full year, our same-store cash NOI grew by 4.4% normalizing for the 2012 scheduled increase in our Sunrise management fee so our portfolio continues to deliver consistent, reliable cash flow growth, and I'd like to take a few moments to share the highlights by segment. Let me start with our portfolio of 220 high-quality, private pay, seniors' housing operating assets. The total seniors' housing operating portfolio delivered $386.6 million of NOI after management fees in 2012 and $455.8 million before management fees, growth of 38.6% and 44.1% respectively versus the prior year. Excluding properties acquired in the fourth quarter and not included in our previous 2012 guidance, NOI totaled $386.2 million compared to our most recent range of $383 million to $385 million. Our results outperformed the top end of the range due to better-than-expected occupancy in our Atria portfolio and better-than-expected RUG-IV in Sunrise. Expenses in the fourth quarter increased in line with our expectations.", "Occupancy in the 212 stabilized properties finished the quarter at a very strong 92.1%. If we include a full year of results for Atria in 2011, average occupancy in the 194 same-store communities increased by 255 basis points to 90.1% in 2012. NOI before management fees was up 8.8% to $427.7 million. Importantly, each of our same-store Atria and Sunrise portfolios had both occupancy and RUG-IV growth in 2012 versus 2011. NOI before management fees for the 194 property same-store portfolio increased 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to $107.3 million compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Occupancy increased 360 basis points and RUG-IV increased 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus the fourth quarter of 2011.", "Occupancy in the 200 property same-store stable portfolio grew 130 basis points sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter of 2012 and RUG-IV was essentially unchanged. For 2013, we expect total NOI for our Atria and Sunrise senior housing portfolio to range between $430 million and $440 million, representing a same-store NOI growth rate of between 5% and 8% year-over-year. As you can see from our results again this quarter, trends in the seniors housing industry remain positive and the fundamentals are among the best of all real estate sectors.", "Next I'll turn to the performance of our triple net lease portfolio, which is diversified across 842 seniors housing, skilled nursing and hospital assets. Same-store cash NOI was up 3% for the year. Cash flow coverage in the 374 properties in our same-store triple net lease portfolio for the third quarter of 2012, the latest available information, was strong at 1.6x, and our Kindred coverage remains strong at 1.9x. We are extremely pleased with the results of the releasing process for the 89 healthcare facilities up for renewal May 1, 2013. Kindred renewed or entered into a new lease for 35 of these facilities. Of the remaining 54 assets, 49 have been leased to 7 qualified nursing operators and 5 are under contract for sale. All 7 of the operators are well-respected, private regional companies. Three are existing Ventas customers, which came through the NHP merger and 4 are new relationships. The rent and reinvestment proceeds on these assets should total $125 million in 2013. Six of these assets have already been transitioned successfully to their new operators. The remaining assets are on schedule. Post-transaction, we expect Kindred revenues to represent about 8% of our total. As you can imagine, a lot of work went into this process, and the expected successful outcome is a great testament to the abilities of our asset management and legal teams who worked tirelessly to get us to this point.", "Lastly, I'd like to briefly discuss Ventas' MOB portfolio of 300 consolidated properties, spanning over 16 million square feet and accounting for 17% of our annualized NOI. Here are a few of the MOB segment highlights for the fourth quarter. Total portfolio NOI grew to $227 million, up from $106 million in 2011 due primarily to a full year of NHP results, approximately $1.2 billion of MOB acquisitions and internal cash flow growth during 2012. Cash NOI in the 69 same-store consolidated MOB portfolio increased 2.2% year-over-year and the 173 assets that we owned in the second half of both 2011 and 2012 increased 2.5% year-over-year. Occupancy in our 285 stable MOBs was a very strong 91.9% in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we continue to make progress in our lease-up portfolio with the same-store occupancy improving sequentially by 200 basis points in the 13 properties owned in both the third and fourth quarters of 2012.", "Finally, our consolidated MOB portfolio has grown from 9.3 million square feet at the end of 2011 to 16.1 million square feet at the end of 2012. Our MOB team has done an outstanding job of integrating Cogdell Spencer and the other acquisitions completed last year in optimizing our portfolio operations.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich Schweinhart, who will discuss our financial results. Rick?", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. In the fourth quarter, we invested over $1 billion in senior housing communities, medical office buildings and secured loans. We also extinguished our $44 million obligation related to the earn-out arising out of our 2011 acquisition of the portfolio of Atria-managed senior living communities. To fund our investments, we entered into a 5-year $180 million term loan at LIBOR plus 120 bps and issued $925 million of senior notes, $700 million 5-year at 2% and $225 million, 10-year at 3.25%. For the full year, including development, redevelopment and CapEx, we invested almost $3 billion. To fund this investment, we issued a little over $340 million of equity and $2.6 billion of debt at a stated rate of 3.2%, with a weighted maturity of 7.7 years. Our revolver balance at year-end was $541 million.", "Now let me focus on fourth-quarter results. Fourth quarter 2012 normalized FFO was $0.99 per diluted share, an increase of 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 per share results of $0.89. Normalized FFO increased 13% to $294 million compared to last year's fourth quarter of $259 million. Fourth quarter 2012 normalized FFO increased from last year's fourth quarter due to our $2.7 billion in 2012 investments, NOI increases in all 3 of our segments, offset somewhat by higher interest expense due to higher debt balances from our acquisition activity.  On the expense side, our average cash interest rate improved 70 basis points to 4.1% at December 31, 2012, compared to December 31, 2011. In total, consolidated interest expense increased to $77 million this quarter from $67 million last year, reflecting all of the debt activity in the last 4 quarters.", "Looking at sequential results, normalized FFO increased $8.7 million to this quarter's $293.6 million, primarily due to third and fourth quarter investments and an increase in interest income on loans due to a note repayment in excess of carrying value and lower G&A expenses partially offset by an increase in interest expense to fund our investments. In September, we have closed or collected about $120 million due to asset sales, proceeds and investment and loan repayments. The weighted average cash yield on these dispositions and loans was 7.7%.", "Comparing full year 2012 to 2011, normalized FFO increased 44% to $1.1 billion compared to last year's $777 million. Normalized FFO was $3.80 per diluted share, an increase of 13% compared to 2011 per share results of $3.37. Non-cash items totaled $0.20 a share in 2012, as detailed on Page 12 of the press release. Weighted average shares outstanding for 2012 were 295 million shares, up 28% compared to 2011. 2012 normalized FFO increased from last year due to our $2.7 billion of investments in 2012, the full year effect of our 2011 investments and portfolio NOI increases, partially offset by higher interest expense, increases in G&A and the Sunrise management fee and income reductions from our asset sales and loan repayments.", "We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flows from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 28% to $1 billion for 2012 from $773 million in 2011 and 74% if you exclude the 2011 litigation proceeds. At December 31, our credit stats were outstanding, with net debt to pro forma EBITDA at 5.4x, our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 4x and debt to enterprise value at 31%. In December, Moody's raised our stable outlook to positive. We are currently rated Baa2+. We are initiating our 2013 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance at $3.99 to $4.07. At the midpoint of the range, that is growth of 6% and 9% excluding non-cash items. 2013 non-cash items are currently estimated to total $0.12 per share, as detailed on Page 12 of our press release.", "Our 2013 guidance assumes about $100 million of acquisitions under contract, about $300 million of dispositions and loan repayments and $400 million of debt financing. The guidance does not include the impact of additional capital transactions or unannounced acquisitions.", "Operator, if you would, please open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Banc of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Jana for Jeff Spector. I was curious, Ray, in your expectations for 2013 guidance, what are you thinking about same-store NOI growth for the MOB portfolio and the triple net portfolio?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "So for the MOB portfolio, it will be plus or minus 3% and then in the triple net portfolio, 2% to 3%.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And it looks like you have some MOB leases rolling over. I was just curious if you could provide an update on those.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "So yes, if you look in the supplemental at our lease maturity schedule and you look at what we got coming up in 2013, it's about 11% of the total MOB rent, which is pretty consistent with historical levels there, so it's just normal ordinary course.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Now that your Kindred 2013 expirations are done, congratulations on that by the way, when does the next pool of Kindred leases expire and when do you expect to approach them about a potential renewal?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We are very pleased with our efforts to re-lease the 2013s as we expected, and those transitions, as Ray said, have begun and will be continued, and we expect to complete that process for the 2013s in the coming months. The next pool of assets that are subject to renewal would be in mid-2015.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So when do you typically approach the tenants about a renewal or when does those discussions start?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, the important point to remember about the Kindred master leases is that those master leases and the structured master leases is set up to protect Ventas. Relative to the 2015s, Kindred has 5-year renewal option, and that option rate has to be exercised no later than April of 2014. And if Kindred chooses to renew, the leases would carry on at an escalated basis starting in 2015, and if they do not, then, of course, our team will get back to work and re-lease those assets as we're doing right now for the 2013s.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then with your skilled nursing coverage ratios down to 1.7x right now, where do you -- or do you have a sense where those ratios will stabilize after the mitigation efforts are fully reflected in the coverage ratios?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "As you know, this quarter in the supplemental represents the first quarter where the trailing 12 months fully reflects the loss of the RUG-IV revenues that the nursing home operators got in the prior calendar year. And so this is a level where at least relative to prior sequestration or prior any other changes, we think it's a stable level of EBITDARM coverage at the 1.7x.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So you think that going forward the next few quarter or the next few quarters, once the mitigation efforts are beginning to be fully reflected, you're not going to see too much improvement from the 1.7x mark?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "That will depend again on what changes positive or negative you see in the forward reimbursement environment and what the cost structure of the operators is and how those interrelate with each other, but we think this is a relatively stable level for the time being.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Could you talk about the types of things you're doing around expense management in the shop portfolio? It looks like expense for the same-store stabilized assets increased a little under 9% year-over-year. How much of that was tied to the growth in occupancy, and I'm guessing only about 200 bps is the higher management fees?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, the management fees do account for a big chunk of those expense increases. We work very closely with our operators to manage the expenses. You would also expect to see, as occupancy increases by 360 basis points, that your labor, which accounts for about 60% of the expenses, would increase as well. So I think when you factor in the labor increases and the management fee increases and look at the balance of the expenses, they would be within normal tolerances.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got you. So it would be fair to say maybe 300 bps of that is related to maybe performance incentives or improving occupancy in the fourth quarter?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, remember, the change in the management fee is -- has to do with the scheduled increase that took effect in 2012 because we had a 3.75% benefit in 2011. So that was a significant portion of it when it reverted to a contractual 6% level in 2012. And then there was some amount of incentive management fee because the Sunrise assets obviously did exceptionally well.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got you. Okay, and then I guess more of a strategy question, we've seen some really good growth metrics in the RIDEA portfolio and the outlook for 2013 is positive. Would you ever look to convert some of the triple net leases over to operating assets? Or will you look to grow shop more through new investments?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "That's an important question. We've had a very defined strategy around senior housing operating assets, which the market often refers to as RIDEA, and our strategy there has been to get the highest and best-quality asset with the highest growth potential in the best markets with the best operators that has, simply stated, the most growth potential with the most protected  downside. And that's really been our Atria and Sunrise portfolio, and that strategy is working with those high-single-digit growth NOI levels that we're seeing. So the most important part of our strategy is really when we acquire things, what assets and what operators we're having in the management structure.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "And, Jack, I would just add a little color to that. We've got a lot of those similar types of assets in our triple-net lease portfolio as well, although because they're high-growing assets that have a lot of NOI growth, the operators generally prefer to keep them in that lease structure so that they can receive the benefit of that cash flow growth.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of James Milam from Sandler O'Neil.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I just want to ask the first one on the balance sheet. I guess, can you talk about your expectations for the maturity that you may pursue with the $400 million debt offering that you talked about, and then also with the line of credit balance at $540,000 does that include -- or actually, I assume that doesn't include the first quarter maturity being repaid so I'm curious if there are any other sources of capital that you guys are looking at for 2013?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right, we're -- as you mentioned, we're forecasting, assuming no additional unannounced acquisitions, about $400 million of debt financing and, of course, the most important thing to think about when you think about Ventas is that despite our above-average dividend increase of 8%, we also would expect to generate after dividends almost $300 million of free cash flow in 2013. So that's also a very significant and important source of capital for us.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. So that effectively $500 million on the line plus $250 million of the maturity, and then you basically outlined $700 million of sources, is that the way we should think about it?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "That's a great way to think about it, yes. That's essentially the way we'd forecast.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then just bigger picture, you guys have done more 5- and 7-year maturities than 10-year maturities, at least in 2012. I'm just curious if in 2013 your intent would be to lengthen maturities or I know there's another hole in the maturity schedule around 2020, if you would maybe look to fill that first.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Are you turning into a bond guy?", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I'm just curious, 10-year bonds costs a little bit more than 7-year bonds, and that affects free cash flow to equity. That's all I'm after.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, no, one of the things that we really feel is a core competency and is one of the most important things that we have to be excellent at is raising capital. And so our team is constantly looking at different types of capital, different tenures on debt maturities, different structures, and we're trying to get a staggered debt maturity schedule, a balanced capital structure, and we're also trying to pick the right spot at the right time in the market. And all those things affect our decisions about how we go to market, when we go to market and what product or tenure we're choosing. So we will hopefully make the right decisions for the capital structure and for the shareholders when we raise that this year.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then so I just want to ask one on the re-leasing, it looks like the rents based upon the numbers that you provided for the 54 skilled nursing facilities are down about 10% over where they were with Kindred. So I guess, a, am I correct in that thinking; b, what is the coverage on the new leases; and then, c, how does that affect your thoughts? I know 2015 is still a couple of years out, but as you look at the re-leased assets coming up then and then that's it for me.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, well, thanks, James. First of all, we're very pleased with the outcome on the 2013s. It's very consistent with our expectations. And we believe that this is a real great opportunity for us to achieve greater diversification and the same amount of rent. As we look forward, we think Kindred is going to be about 8% of revenues for Ventas in 2013, and so we feel good about where we are. You have to think about these -- again, I said the master lease of the bundle structure protects Ventas, and that's because this is really a pool of cash flow and a pool of rent. So if you think about it, basically, you got more rent on some and a little bit less rent on others, but at the end of the day, the same NOI level obtains. And as I was thinking about it this morning, if we were David Simon and we had 20 malls and we had Saks in 20 stores at a $1 a rent a year, and Saks decided not to continue and we went out and we re-leased 10 of the stores for $1 and 5 of them for $1.25 and 5 of them for $0.75, then we're in the same spot, and that's what good real estate companies do and that's part of our business, and we're just applying that same level of kind of re-tenanting expertise to the healthcare business. So you have to think about it as a pool of cash flow and a pool of assets and what those assets in total are going to generate in rent. And we've we thought that we could replace the current rent levels, and that's exactly what we're doing.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And I'm sorry, can you give the coverage for the new leases?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, if you think about what the coverage is now and you assume the rent is the same, you would imagine that the coverage would be about the same. Now if the operators turn out to have lower cost structures, it could go up a little bit. If reimbursement changes, if it goes up or down, that could obviously affect it, but you would imagine if rent is the same, the coverage would be the same.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Right, but for the 54, if I -- it sounds like the rent is a little bit lower on the 54. That's the reason for the question.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, remember, that the LTACs went up, $6 million, $5 million, $6 million, and so that's the offsetting -- those are offsetting, and that's why you come back again to the pool concept and the same amount of rent.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to focus on the Atria Senior Living acquisition that was done at the end of last year, and the minorities that you guys now have in the management company. Would like a little bit more color in regards to why exactly you decided to do that, what kind of returns are you generally expecting from that business?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay, well, let's recap. Thank you for asking, because we're actually very excited about the transaction and because we announced it on December 24, I think we haven't gotten to talk about it as much as we would like. I mean, the fundamental transaction is this: We paid $242 million, and we bought the fund, which owned 3.7 million shares of Ventas, which at that time was worth maybe $230-something million, and we bought a third stake in the Atria management company, which as I mentioned is the fifth-largest provider of senior care in the United States. And so that investment is really a strategic investment for us. The management team now owns the other 2/3 of the business. So it provides great alignment and Atria is in a great, great spot really to continue to grow and we hope to grow with them.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I guess, I could we talk a little just about what kind of return you expect and what the overall profitability of that business is? I'd also...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, we expect to make money on that investment, and the business is very stable. It has about $30 million of cash on hand, and we expect to make a profit on the investment, but the real reason that we're doing it is to have alignment with our provider and to help them grow. I mean, the investment itself is very, very small.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful then. I guess for me, it's just, again, I would like a bit more of a defensive move kind of given what had happened at Sunrise, more so than anything else or...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, as you know, we're all about offense and defense, and this is a great -- again, Atria is well-positioned and so are we, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, to really take advantage of this operator consolidation craze and the changes in the senior housing business. And so Atria is in a good spot, and we are in a great spot with our third investment to have a lot of options going forward in the senior housing business.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. Just second question -- one more question, I'm sorry. On the -- in regards to acquisitions on a going-forward basis, specifically life sciences, I know we've brought this up with you at different times, but right now that entire sector is going gangbusters. And I was just very curious if your thoughts towards an investment in life sciences had changed or had evolved since the last time we talked about it.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think we felt the same for a while. So there's no change in our position.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley from Citi.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just in terms of the acquisitions pipeline, in the prepared remarks, you said that opportunities are down. Can you just give us a sense of sort of the size of the pipeline that you're looking at and where some of the better opportunities might be within seniors housing operating assets and just having triple-net assets, medical office or even potentially skilled nursing again?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I would say that the pipeline is very active and very large, as it has been for the past multiple years. And again, we are in a great sector for external growth, and I think we're very well-positioned with all of our relationships. And it's really across the sector: senior housing, medical office and the government reimburse sectors as well as others, and so we feel really good about the forward environment.", "Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just given the strong fundamentals in the seniors housing side of the business, how should we think about Page 18 of your supplemental with development pipeline? You've currently got about $60 million of projects under construction. Are you and the Atria team seeing more opportunity and a more development feasibility starting to stack up, given rent and occupancy growth?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We are seeing significant redevelopment opportunities in particular, and Ray can add to that comment. And then we would expect at any given time to have $100 million to $200 million of development, redevelopment projects kind of in progress.", "_", "Raymond J. Lewis", "But, Quentin, as we've seen in the time period that we've owned the Atria assets, the redevelopment projects have been a great addition to the growth of the NOI of the portfolio, and so we're going back through the portfolio, combing it, trying to find more and more of those opportunities and accelerate that activity. So you might see us do a little bit more of that in the near term.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "And you also might see some income-returning investments in our triple-net portfolio as well, where we can get above-average risk-adjusted return on existing assets.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Debbie, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. Just thinking about just the opportunities abound, which Quentin mentioned, how does that translate relative to sort of U.S. versus other potential markets? I mean, do you have stuff that you're looking at expanding in Canada at all and adding to those investments, after you had done Sunrise a number of years ago or other global markets or is it -- or is the main focus continuing to be U.S.?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, the domestic opportunities, given the fragmentation in the market and the need for capital and the consolidation in the market as well as just all the change within the healthcare and senior housing business, we have a ton of opportunities domestically. We certainly have talked about and from time to time, look at international opportunities in Canada and elsewhere. And if we found something that worked for us, we would attempt to see if it works for our shareholders, so -- but the focus continues to be on the domestic opportunities.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And is there anything in terms -- in the loan book right now that we should be aware of that converting into real estate into fee at all?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "In general, when we make loans, we consider them for repayment rather than loan-to-own so that's how you should think about it.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And what's the maturity of -- in terms of that $700 million obviously you're earning a pretty good rate. Does any of that mature this year or next?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No. I mean, we have small amount, obviously, that paid off last year and that's in our disposition and loan repayments kind of section that we talk about. It was about $420 million last year and then this year we're modeling about $300 million of -- it's mostly asset sales, but it also is a little bit of loan repayments, but very little in the loan book in 2013.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Is there anything on the hospitals that, I guess, obviously, is in a size of investment relative to the company is the smallest piece. Is there anything changing on that end where some of that real estate can be unlocked?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think that we have made the case over time that real estate assets will ultimately flow to the most sufficient owners. And I think the capital, the capital needs in the hospital business and the hospital business is enormous. The capital needs are great, and the sources of capital available to hospitals continue to be constrained and a little bit more expensive. And so over time, I would imagine that opportunities will present themselves that are perhaps higher quality than the kinds of hospital opportunities that have been available in the past.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And how would you think about -- if you were to own those assets, about the security of that income, but also the growth underlying that income of owning hospital assets?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right. I mean, it would really be just like any other underwriting that we do in, in any of our sectors, which is to understand what the sustainable cash flow and cash flow growth is, what the volatility is, and then what the risk-adjusted return and coverage should be. So it's just a different analysis depending on which subsector, but it's the same principle.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just one last question, just in terms of the dividend, the dividend went up 8%, cash flow growth is 9%, is there any reason why you just didn't match them completely?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We like to be -- we like the 8 in 8 years, but I think that we have a really good record of increasing dividends at above average cash flow level at about average rates, but also retaining more cash flow every year to reinvest and continue and grow. And that's how we think about it, and hopefully, we'll be able to continue that trend in the future.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I want to return to the senior housing portfolio and what's embedded in the guidance for 2013. Given that the portfolio's over 90% occupancy, are you looking at, say, improved rate growth into 2013, 4% or 5% margin expansion? Just want to understand what's embedded in that senior housing guidance?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Sure, let me just give you the basic assumptions, and perhaps, that will answer your question. I think, just to go back to the basics, we've given a range of $430 million to $440 million, which represents 5% to 8% growth year-over-year. Embedded in that, at the midpoint, we're sort of looking at occupancy going up around 200 basis points, rate going up around 3% and then your margins would expand slightly, maybe 30 basis points or so, and that's the basic assumption that we're using going into the modeling.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "And that's a comparison versus a full year 2012...", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, those are averages, yes, against -- thank you, Debbie, those are against the averages for the year.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So if I was to go 4Q to 4Q, I guess, the average would -- the occupancy increase would be a lot less than that, but I imagine it's -- what you're expecting is something close to what the industry might be, 100 basis points of occupancy, would that be the right way to think about it?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I mean, more or less.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then also maybe I missed something prior to the press release or earlier in the call, but your secured loan balance on the balance sheet jumped $400 million. I don't know if you could just talk about what that is and make sure I understand what that secured loan was?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right, when we put out our press release at the end of the year in terms of our year-end investments, we did -- we made about $400 million of senior secured loans.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Is that all seniors housing then?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, it's in the healthcare space, yes. It's not all senior housing. It's a mixture.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then also just thinking of that in terms of the acquisition environment and pricing, obviously, the 10-year has gone up over 2%. Debbie, you were on a panel at ASHA where, I think, Noah Levy of Prudential indicated he thought assisted-living cap rates could back up given how close those cap rates were to IL. Given where interest rates are, given what your capital structure is, how are you thinking about what you are willing to pay for acquisitions in 2013 versus 2012? Is it about the same level? Or you think you're going to be a little bit more cautious on how you bid for assets?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, I mean, I think what's been great about Ventas is we have been able to acquire $14 billion or more of assets over the past couple of years, and our unlevered returns are quite high. This year, the 2.7 was the cash on levered yields approaching 8%. So that's been outstanding, and one of the ways that we think about acquisitions is to try to be kind of ahead of the herd as we acquire things. And I think we can still acquire assets in our core sectors at attractive risk-adjusted returns, depending on the growth profile for those assets. We'll continue to watch replacement cost levels as we make acquisitions, as we always do. And we'll be a disciplined acquirer, but I do think the environment continues to be good for us to be able to add value through our acquisition activity.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But do you think cap rates are about the same as 2012? Or do you think they can compress further and back up, I mean, just...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, I think they're about the same.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And are you seeing any additional competition from, say, private equity or other investors getting excited about seniors housing and MOBs? Or do you expect the REITs to continue to be probably the highest bidder, lowest cost of capital in the healthcare space?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we're always glad when other people discover the benefits of our asset base as the largest owner of some of these sectors, and I'd say it's always been competitive, and it still is competitive. But as I said, we have a great team, great relationship, and I think we'll get more than our fair share.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Theiler from Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Hey, I just wanted to follow-up on the question that James was asking about the coverage on the re-leased Kindred assets. For those re-leased assets, I understand that different operators can have different cost structures and maybe produce different results, but if you just assumed it was the same run rate that Kindred was doing, what would the coverage be, I guess, over all on those re-leased assets?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, if you look at the supplemental, you see that the Kindred EBITDARM coverages on SNFs are about 1.5x now, so you guess in the kind of 1.5x plus or minus range, assuming...", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So 1.5x EBITDARM coverage on those re-leased assets. And what are the -- just the escalators on those on average?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The new leases are about 11 years, and the average escalation is about 2.5%.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "2.5%?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just lastly, how are you thinking about skilled nursing these days? You're not really going out and actively acquiring the asset, but you only sold a few of them. Do you think that the risk is being overpriced in the private market, i.e., cap rates are too high so they're not a great sale target right now? Or how do you view that property sector in general?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, we have taken a deliberately private-pay approach to most of our investment activity. We've always been a supporter of the skilled nursing and post-acute business. It is a low-cost provider, and it has a place in a healthcare REIT portfolio. It has a place in the delivery of healthcare in the United States, but we have, since probably 2010 been very active in building the private pay part of our business, and that's kind of where we are now.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Tom Truxillo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Appreciate all the comments from James earlier on the balance sheet and source in uses of cash. You also have about $283 million of secured debt coming due in 2013, how should we think about that and your attempts to kind of reduce your secured average?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Whenever we have a chance to pay off secured debt in our consolidated portfolio, we will do it.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, easy enough. And then the second question is, you talked about continuing to buy the best and the highest quality assets and being interested in doing that in kind of an operating senior housing portfolio, obviously, that adds some risks to your income statement even though the outlook is very positive now. Can you talk about maybe your willingness to continue to grow that portion of your portfolio as a percentage of total portfolio, and then do you think that changes the way you need to manage the balance sheet in any way to offset some of that income statement risk?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I totally disagree with the statement and the premise. These are the best assets in our industry with very, very stable operating histories. They had positive -- this industry had positive NOI growth through the financial crisis and recession, which is the only real estate asset class to deliver that kind of performance, and that's because the assets are need-based. They're supported by strong demographic growth in the over-85 population, and we have the data that supports that performance through basically a depression in the United States. And so I think these assets are our best assets, and ones that actually improve the reliability of our cash flow. And if you look at our total NOI of, let's call it, $1.6 billion next year and this is a quarter of that, if it goes up or down 2% or whatever, that is an absolute immaterial impact on our cash flow and our debt coverages. So I think this portfolio improves the reliability of Ventas as a company and as a debt issuer. And we believe it's going to grow, as Ray said, 5% to 8% same-store as we look into 2013.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I should have asked it a different way because I agree with all your points there. Have you had any luck in convincing rating agencies that that's the way they should look at it, given that HCP has been kind of given higher credit ratings than you? And how do you...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, I mean, Moody's moved us to positive in December, and I think that as the assets continue to perform and the facts become known, you can't fight the facts. And the performance has been very strong and reliable, and the most important thing is that we have a huge business with scale that's balanced and diversified. And that is the best possible thing for bondholders and equity holders alike. So, Tom, we're going to have to move on to the next question.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Nic Yulico from Macquarie.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "For the 5 assets that were sold to Kindred SNFs, can you just talk about why they were sold and not re-leased?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, I mean, we -- as we looked through the portfolio, we thought that these were assets that we would like to sell, and so we put them in the sale bucket as opposed to the re-leasing bucket.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "And what was the cap rate on these assets?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The cap rate is -- the total proceeds are maybe about $9 million or $10 million.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "That's the total cash proceeds?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just lastly, just going back to the coverage question, I mean, Kindred, if you go back to the fall, they gave a 2013 coverage pro forma for the 54 SNFs they weren't renewing, and it was 1.15x EBITDAR. And so I guess I'm wondering you said there could be a different cost structure, a new operator, but I mean is that a coverage that you ended up writing these new rents at that level of coverage?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, again, if you look at all the portfolio right now in the supplemental, basically, after all the RUGs has -- the RUGs removal has washed its way through the system and then before perhaps all the mitigation has taken effect, you're right about somewhere in our portfolio for skilled nursing between 1.5x and a 1.7x  EBITDARM coverage. And then depending on what the overhead you want to allocate as a percentage of revenues, you get down to, let's call it, a 1.3x, 1.2x EBITDARM coverage, and we're perfectly comfortable with that.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "So I mean, it's fair to assume that you wrote rents at a similar coverage set, 1.2x-type EBITDARM coverage?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, which again makes sense because the assets are profitable, and will continue to be profitable to the new tenants.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just quickly, real quick for, Ray, the same store for Atria, Sunrise, 5% to 8%, is that before or after management or doesn't matter?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "That's after management fee, and it doesn't really matter...", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "It doesn't really matter because you have the full 2012?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "That's exactly right.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "You got it.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Debbie, I guess, just rebutting a little bit on the RIDEA strategy and all that, do you ever wonder what the other side of the table was thinking in the sense that different views on the same subject or what make transactions happen, so maybe they know something that others don't, and that's why they're so willing maybe to do an operating lease as opposed to a triple-net lease. Is there any -- what would you say to that comment?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, I would say that I love our portfolio, and it's delivering single-digit, high-single-digit growth, and it's really just a little bit of a strategic matter relative to the operators and how they're going to organize their business. You see that in the hotel sector as well.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "And sellers sell for different reasons, Rich. I mean, if you look at the Lazard situation, they've been in the investment for a long time. Sunrise REIT was an M&A opportunity, so you have different reasons.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "What would you say the RIDEA premium you require versus a comparable triple-net execution would be?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "So we look at every deal to judge whether on many, many different metrics, it will create value and it is a good risk-adjusted return for that investment. And then, well, how it fits into the overall Ventas balance that we want to have in our portfolio. So I think it's really just a case-by-case basis, depending on the quality of the assets, the growth we expect, the markets, the operator, is it a new relationship with someone, is it a pool, et cetera? And all of those factors really go into how we price our investments and how we decide whether to go forward or not. And I would say that, again, our strategy that we've put in place with a balanced portfolio, the percentage of our portfolio that's in these high-quality senior housing assets, coupled with the stability of the triple nets and the MOBs, has been working very, very well.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "What is the premium for the Atria RIDEA structure? Could you comment on that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I really don't even understand the question in terms of premium or not. We look at it and we say, \"Would we be happy to own these assets at a pick a number, 6.5 cap rate with a high-single-digits growth rate\" and the answer, in these primary markets with barriers to entry, the answer is a resounding yes.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. So it's mutually exclusive. Last question, what is the risk of owning 34% of the management company, I mean, knowing the bogey is 35%, what could happen to trip that number and then what would happen in that circumstance?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we have, I've been walking around glued to our tax guy, who's kept us on good stead in the REIT compliance area for 13 years. And I would say we're well in compliance, and we expect to stay so, and we have lots of protections to make sure that's the case as we always would do.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Is there a cure period?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The REIT statute itself does have cure provisions in it, but we would not expect to need to rely upon that.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Rich, thanks for hanging out with us till the end. We really appreciate it, and we want to close the call with appreciation to all of you for listening, and we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida in the next couple of weeks. Thanks again.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to the Quarter 1 2013 Ventas Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nancy. I will your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Lori Wittman, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lori Wittman", "Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2013.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These projections, predictions and statements are based on management's current beliefs, as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events.

Many of these factors are beyond the control of the company and its management.

Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Lori, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. Thank you so much for joining Ventas' First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call.", "I'm pleased to discuss the results of another excellent quarter. This morning, Ray Lewis will also discuss our portfolio performance; and our CFO, Rich Schweinhart, will review our financial results.  Following our remarks, we'll be pleased to answer your questions.", "Consistent with our management team's commitment to achieve and sustain excellence for all our stakeholders, Ventas began the year with outstanding growth and property cash flow, normalized FFO per share and dividends.", "Ventas' balanced, consistent approach of driving growth, while staying strong, diverse and secure, continues to produce outstanding returns for shareholders.", "Year-to-date, Ventas' total returns exceed 22%, well in excess of both the RMZ and S&P 500 indices.", "More importantly, our 10-year performance is an exceptional 888%, showing our long-term track record of out-performance. In short, our strategy is working, our team is executing and Ventas' business is great.", "Some of the highlights of the quarter were: First, normalized FFO with $1.03 per diluted share, representing 16% growth from the first quarter of last year, excluding noncash items in both periods.", "This increase in FFO flows from both internal and external sources. Same-store cash flow growth in our high-quality, diverse portfolio exceeded 4% in the quarter, and we derived significant benefit from last year's $2.7 billion in accretive investments.", "Our cash flow growth enabled us to increase our dividend by 8% in the first quarter to an annual rate of $2.68 a share. With a secure payout ratio of 67%, we are well-positioned to continue our record of increasing the dividend at above average levels, a competitive advantage in delivering superior total shareholder return.", "We successfully completed $200 million of investments during the quarter at initial cash yields approximating 6.5% in high-quality medical office buildings and senior housing assets. We continue to maintain a robust pipeline of attractive additional investment opportunities.", "At the same time as we are fueling our continued growth, we are also consistent in managing our business with discipline. During the quarter, we took advantage of historically low interest rates to extend our debt maturities by raising $759 million in senior notes, with a 15-year weighted average maturity and a fixed rate of 3.6%. By using the proceeds to pay down our revolver, we also created significant liquidity and shifted more of our capital structure into fixed rate versus floating.", "At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-enterprise value was an astonishingly good 28%. Recognizing our outstanding credit metrics, scale of $31 billion, consistency, private pay focus and diverse business model, S&P improved its outlook on our corporate credit to positive at the end of March, following similar action by Moody's in December.", "As planned, and consistent with our risk management approach, we sold portions of the higher-yielding loans we originated in the fourth quarter, at par to sophisticated partners. We expect to complete another  $100 million of this activity going forward to manage our aggregate loan investments and our single-borrower exposure.", "Finally, our asset management and legal teams are pushing toward  the finish line, regarding the 89 licensed health care assets whose lease terms expire at the end of this month. We are pleased to report that the lion's share of these transactions and operating transition should be completed by May 1 at the rent and on the terms we previously announced. We expect the remainder be completed, as we said on our last call, by the end of this quarter. We believe that this process is a great example of the proactive, collaborative team execution capabilities at Ventas, resulting in an excellent outcome.", "Consistent with our expectations when we spoke with you 2 months ago, we are confirming our full year normalized FFO guidance of $3.99 to $4.07 per diluted share. If achieved, the midpoint of our range represents 9% growth per share, including, not excluding, noncash items.", "We remain comfortable with our full-year guidance range, even though we replaced almost $800 million of floating rate debt with fixed rate debt, and completed over half of our ongoing loan and asset dispositions late in the first quarter. While these actions will reduce normalized FFO in subsequent quarters, we are incredibly well set up to capture the many investment opportunities we see before us.", "As I said in February, acquisition opportunities abound in our large, fragmented health care and senior housing investment market. We see opportunities to add to our best-in-class senior housing operating portfolio, our medical office building business and a range of triple-net investment across the continuum of care. Our existing liquidity, balance sheet and diversification are highly supportive of continued external growth.", "While we can never predict the timing or amount of our investment activities, we are excited about continuing to expand our portfolio in a balanced, forward-thinking way to create value for stakeholders. Our team is definitely leaning in as we look to the balance of 2013.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Thank you, Debbie. Our diverse, balanced and productive portfolio of 1,433 seniors housing, medical office and post-acute properties turned in another strong performance in the first quarter.", "Same-store cash NOI in our total portfolio grew by 4.2% year-over-year, and 3.5% sequentially, once again, demonstrating the sustained excellence that our strategy of growth and defense delivers.", "Let me briefly run through some of the quarterly highlights of each of our key business segments. Let me start with our best-in-class private pay seniors housing operating portfolio, which accounts for 27% of our NOI.", "The portfolio now stands at 220 properties and delivered another outstanding quarter. The total seniors housing operating portfolio produced $108.1 million of NOI, representing growth of 20.2% versus the prior year.", "Occupancy in the total portfolio finished the quarter at a very strong 91%. This is 190 basis points higher than the average senior housing occupancy reported by NIC in the first quarter for the top 31 MSAs.", "NOI after-management fees for the 195-property same-store portfolio was $96.3 million in the first quarter, a 7.3% increase over the prior year. Performance was driven by same-store occupancy, which increased 270 basis points, and RUG-IV, which increased 3.2% year-over-year. The same-store portfolio substantially outperformed the NIC top 31 MSA data on both occupancy and RUG-IV growth year-over-year.", "One of the key drivers of our outstanding performance is our redeveloping portfolio. As a reminder, we have a number of assets in our senior housing operating portfolio where we can add new units, amenities and programming to drive occupancy and rate. We currently have about $75 million of these projects underway, and a $200 million pipeline that we are evaluating.", "Looking at sequential performance, NOI for the 212-property same-store portfolio increased 5% from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013, driven primarily by a 2.9% increase in RUG-IV.", "Occupancy in the same-store portfolio declined sequentially, reflecting a normal seasonal pattern and stood at a very strong 91%. As occupancy has stayed high, we have been able to increase rates, which is driving our strong performance.", "Our 2013 full year guidance expectations for the seniors housing operating portfolio remain unchanged, with NOI guidance between $430 million and $440 million, and same-store NOI growth in the 5% to 8% range.", "Next, I'll turn to the performance of our consolidated triple-net lease portfolio, which accounts for 53% of our NOI and is diversified across 856 seniors housing, skilled nursing and hospital assets.", "Same-store cash NOI in our 833-property same-store triple-net portfolio was up 2.4% year-over-year in the first quarter. Cash flow coverage in triple-net lease portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2012, the latest available information, was stable and strong at 1.6x. Kindred coverage in the 173 skilled nursing in LTAC that currently leases from us remain strong at 2x.", "Finally, we opened one building, which is 100% leased to a joint venture affiliated with the Cleveland Clinic, and which was another benefit we acquired as part of the Cogdell acquisition. So the triple-net lease portfolio continues to deliver stable, reliable and growing cash flows for our shareholders.", "Lastly, I'd like to briefly discuss our 302-property consolidated MOB portfolio, which stands over 16 million square feet and accounts for 17% of our annualized NOI. I'd like to remind you that over the last year, we have added nearly 7 million square feet to our portfolio, nearly doubling in size.", "Here are a few of the MOB segment highlights for the first quarter. Total portfolio NOI grew to $74.6 million in the first quarter, up from $43.3 million in the first quarter of 2012, due primarily to approximately $1.2 billion in acquisitions, including Cogdell Spencer, as well as internal cash flow growth.", "Occupancy across the entire portfolio increased to 90.5% from 89.7% in the first quarter of 2012, again, due primarily to the high-quality acquisitions completed last year.", "Cash NOI in the 185 same-store consolidated MOB portfolio increased 4.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by increases in rate and margin.  Occupancy was down slightly in the same-store portfolio due to some anticipated vacancies. The 9 properties in the same-store lease-up portfolio increased occupancy by 230 basis points year-over-year, so we continue to make good progress in filling our non-stable billings -- buildings.", "As we have built out our MOB portfolio, we have begun to realize the benefits of scale by identifying best practices in leasing, expense management and capital investment and driving their implementation across our entire portfolio. We expect this to drive above-average internal growth in our MOB business as these initiatives are rolled out over time.", "So once again, this quarter's very positive results demonstrate the merits of building a high-quality, balanced and diversified portfolio that we actively manage to provide our investors with growth and capital preservation.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich Schweinhart who will discuss our financial results. Rick?", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. In the first quarter, we invested approximately $200 million and received proceeds of $156 million from assets, dispositions, loan syndications and loan repayments. The $200 million in investments include a previously capitalized lease.", "On the capital market side, we issued $500 million of 2.7% 7-year senior notes due 2020, and $258.75 million of 5.45% 30-year senior notes due 2043 in March. If you combine our 2 senior note issues, they have a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% with a 15-year life, which has a favorable effect on our scheduled maturities. We also repaid $270 million of 6.25% NHP senior notes, which were booked for GAAP purposes at an interest rate of approximately 1.75%.", "Our revolver balance at quarter-end was $165 million.", "Year-to-date, we have raised $83.7 million, issuing over 1.1 million shares under our aftermarket program. Over 1 million of these shares were issued in the second quarter. As a result, we currently have unrestricted cash of approximately $58 million in virtually all of our $2 billion in borrowing capacity available on the revolver.", "Now let me focus on first quarter results. First quarter 2013 normalized FFO was $1.03 per diluted share, an increase of 13% compared to the first quarter of 2012 per share results of $0.91.  Normalized FFO increased 14% to $302 million compared to last year's first quarter of $264 million.", "First quarter 2013 normalized FFO increased from last year's first quarter, due to our 2012 investments of over $2.7 billion, and NOI increases in all 3 of our segments, offset somewhat by higher interest expense due to higher debt balances from our acquisition activity and, to a lesser extent, G&A expenses.", "Average cash interest rate improved 80 basis points to 4.1% at March 31, 2013 compared to March 31, 2012. In total, consolidated interest expense increased to $80 million this quarter from $68 million last year, reflecting all the debt activity in the last 4 quarters.", "Looking at sequential results, normalized FFO increased $8 million to this quarter's $302 million, primarily due to an increase in all 3 segments' operating results and fourth and first quarter investments, partially offset by an increase in interest expense to fund our investments and higher G&A expenses.", "Weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter were 294 million shares, up a slight 1% compared to first quarter of 2012.", "At March 31, our credit stats were outstanding and improved from year end, with a net debt of pro forma EBITDA at 5.3x, our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 4x, secured debt-to-enterprise value of 10% and a debt-to-enterprise value at 28%.", "On April 2, S&P raised our stable outlook to positive. We are currently rated BBB+. Even with a $0.02 per share, per quarter impact from our first quarter capital activities and dispositions, we are affirming our 2013 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance at $3.99 to $4.07. The guidance does not include the impact of additional capital transactions or unannounced acquisitions.", "Operator, if you would, please open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Jana for Jeff. It was good to see your tenant triple-net rent coverages remain strong, they were flat in the fourth quarter. I was curious that in your conversations with Kindred or some of your hospital operators, have they seen any impact from the sequester in April? Because I think we won't really see this show up in numbers until the third quarter reporting.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Good question. Yes, our coverages were good and ticked up a little bit, in some cases, in the triple-net portfolio. I would say, just talking about the government-reimbursed portion of our business, I would say that remember that the operators got an almost 2% Medicare rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2012, and so -- and sequestration doesn't really take effect until April 1. So those are essentially a push, if you want to think about it that way.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, any input from your operators on how they're thinking about their budgets with what CMS may announce shortly?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We would expect the CMS preliminary rules regarding fiscal year 2014 rates to be coming out really any day now and be finalized later in the summer. And we should know very shortly what that preliminary rule is, which, again, I want to remind everyone, is subject to a common [ph] period and then often changes and improves in between these initial publication and finalization.", "Operator", "We have our next one from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Manny Korchman is on with me as well. Debbie, I just wanted to go -- your comments about the pipeline being robust, acquisition opportunities abound, and you talk about the balance sheet being astonishingly good and being in great shape. I'm just curious, as you think about your capacity to acquire today, arguably you have access to capital markets when you need it, depending on what transaction you do. But how should we think about what volume of transactions you could do prior to either selling assets or selling new equity in terms of how much you would be able to bring on balance sheet today as you look at the...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right. Right. And I think you're right. We obviously we have fantastic access to the capital markets. I think one of the company's hallmarks is that we are aggressive and drive growth, but we also make sure that we always have great liquidity. So if the markets are there, we'll use them, but we know that we have a good safety net in our existing liquidity. When we look at our acquisition opportunities, they are really plentiful, and we're as busy as we've ever been. I would say that when we look at the numbers, we could easily acquire over $1 billion, really -- and be very comfortable with our balance sheet without the need of any additional equity component.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And how we should we think about the types of deals? Or - I mean, is this elephant hunting in terms of large transactions that's getting you excited about opportunities? Or is it a lot of singles and doubles, either from the existing portfolio where you're buying out partners or smaller-type portfolios in the couple of hundred million dollar range? How should we think about your excitement about transactions today?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, in a word, yes to all of those. I mean, we are seeing great kind of follow-on transactions with existing partners. We're seeing great follow-on with our current tenants, some of whom came from NHP. We're seeing regional deals. And we're seeing large -- very large portfolio transactions. So I think the strategy of putting our various legacy companies together, whether it's Lillibridge, Cogdell, NHP, Atria, we -- all of those are channels for continued internal and external growth. And that's when I say the strategy's working and we are executing, that's really what I mean.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the loan buybacks and -- or the loan -- I guess you sold off some loans in the quarter. Looking on Page 2 of the supp, so that balance had come down on your mortgage loans from $635 million to $490 million, but the yield went up, and if you just do the data math, it would say that you sold $145 million of loans at 7.6%. I thought I heard you said you sold some high-yielding loans, and I -- but it would appear as though the balance actually is better today than it was before.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. I mean, basically, we're -- as I said we're making sure to manage -- we made some high-quality, well-structured, very attractive, risk-adjusted return loans in the fourth quarter, and our plan has been to syndicate or sell off parts of those, and we've started to do that. And I think the rate ticked up a little bit because we may have had a few loan payoffs of lower-yielding loans. And also, we sold these later in the quarter and so that may have affected the weighted average. So we may see that tick down next quarter, Michael.", "Operator", "We have the next one from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just want to start with the shop portfolio. You give average occupancy in the supplement. Could you talk a little bit how the metric trended throughout the quarter? As in, did you exit March higher than the average for the first quarter, assuming flu tapered off the beginning of January?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, Jack, this is Ray. So the typical seasonal pattern, which was followed by our portfolio this year, is that your occupancy will decline throughout the first quarter, and typically, into April, and start to trend back up again in May. And we're starting to see, as we look at flash reports, the stabilization of the occupancy, and it's following historical patterns.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, got you. And then, just really, the Kindred. The company is trying to reposition itself around these 21 integrated care markets. So just yesterday, we saw the sale of 17 facilities to Vibra. Do you own any of those assets? And then, as they continue to restructure, how do you protect yourself if the asset moves to another operator?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, first of all, none of the assets that were announced yesterday -- none of the 17 are Ventas-related in any way. So that's a first answer to your question. And again, our leases do not permit the sale or assignment of any of the operations without our consent. We have master leases that are very protective of Ventas.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Karin Ford.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "A question on Rick's comments at the end there that guidance -- you had a $0.02 impact from doing more debt issuance in the first quarter than you had previously incorporated into guidance. I'm just wondering, what, if anything, was offset on the positive side that had you keep guidance the same despite that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay. Well, first of all, we had a great first quarter, obviously, so that helps. And we are very confident about our expectations for the remainder of the year. And again, just to do the math for you, if you do $759 million at a 3.6% versus your 1.4% on your revolver, and you sell, let's call it, $156 million at, say, a 9% and you also compare that your revolver, that's how you get your 2-plus -- a little -- $0.02 a quarter a share going forward. Just to make that very transparent for everyone. But I think we expect a good, continued performance for the rest of the year, and we feel really good about our business.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Was there anything specific in the business? Any particular segment that seems to be ahead of budget today that's offsetting that?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "No. I mean, I think if you look at our portfolio, our seniors housing operating portfolio and MOBs are performing in line with our expectations, and so I think our portfolio is right on track.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Next question is, given that, as you pointed out, your balance sheet's in great shape, your debt-to-EBITDA is very low, can you just talk about your decision to issue 1 million shares under the ATM in April? Was it the stock price? Was it imminent acquisition activity coming? Can you just talk about that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we've been, again, fairly open, I think, about the acquisition and market that we're seeing, which we think is quite robust. And so we really want to continue to be in a position to take advantage of those opportunities, and at the same time, continue to move up the credit curve. So we would expect, over the course of the year, although our guidance does not include any acquisitions, we would be hopeful that over the course of the year, we will be able to get our fair share of additional investments.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great. Last question is, are you anticipating any M&A activity in the health care space through the balance of the year? And what are you seeing on the cap rate side?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we -- again, we've been consistent in saying we do expect consolidation in the health care and senior housing business. And we've seen some of that, and I think we'll continue to see that.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And pricing, has pricing changed on either the MOB side or the senior housing side?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we were very fortunate with the accretive investments that we made the last couple of years, which were at very, very good yields for very high quality assets. And I think as cost of capital has continued to improve for us and others, that has had an impact on cap rates, but we can still -- I think we're still in that excellent quadrant of being able to create value for shareholders while we acquire, and that's our strategy.", "Operator", "We have the next question from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Now that the occupancy in the shop portfolio is above 90%, do you think you'll be able push rental rates to continue to drive the similar case of the revenue growth that you have been able to do?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes. Michael, this is Ray. So as you correctly point out, we do have well above-average occupancy in our portfolio. And if you look at the rental rate increases in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year, we're nearly 3% this year, and last year, we were closer to 2%. So we're already starting to see that benefit materialize in our portfolio. And so, yes, I think we are pushing. And obviously, in the economy, there's going to be limits to how far you can push, but we're seeing the benefits of the higher occupancy in our pricing.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, have you seen increased development activity in the senior housing space, particularly around your seniors housing operating portfolio?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well, remember, our senior housing operating portfolio is in high-barrier, infill locations in major metropolitan areas, which are typically very difficult to develop in and have long lead times and, quite frankly, are expensive to put new buildings up. If you look at the NIC data in the top 31 MSAs, there's about 13,000 units under construction, which is relatively 2.5% of inventory. Historical averages are closer to 3.2% of inventory. And another way to sort of look at it is the total inventory increase year-over-year was up about 1.2%. So if you overlay that against, sort of, the demographics, while new construction is higher than it was in the trough during the recession, it's still well within normal tolerances, and is not, at this point, something that would have an impact on our -- the performance of our portfolio.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "And there's -- there continues to be positive absorption as a result of that favorable supply demand.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And have you seen, I guess, more development projects in the early planning stages that could come to the market, that could increase that CIP [ph] number?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "We're not seeing a tremendous amount of development. Now, remember, we're not a company that does a lot of development, but I think there just aren't a tremendous amount of financing sources right now for new development in the marketplace. So there are pockets in memory care and other areas, where, I think, there has been more new development. But independent living, in particular, is still running well below historical levels. We're not really seeing a tremendous flow of development.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my last question is with regard to the transitioning old Kindred assets. Is there typically any weakness with the transitioning operators from the properties?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We would expect to see some transition expenses and friction as the new operators set up operations, change systems and hire the new employees. But that's, obviously, all baked into their expectations. And the assets are profitable, and so there may be a changeover impact, but that'll be short-lived.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Which -- and we've underwritten that.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Stifel.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to go into the senior housing operating margins that were up sequentially. I think I would have expected those to have gone down seasonally with the Canadian utilities. I know there was one less day in the quarter. So maybe if you could just about your expense controls and how you're seeing operating margin progress throughout the year?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well, I think you hit it on a couple of things. So you look at sequential margins, and our -- and same-store stabilized portfolio, they're up 60 basis points. One thing that would sort of drive that is the rate increase this year was much more than we've had in the prior years sequentially. 2, I think, if you look at the non-stable portfolio, the lease up that occurred in the non-stable portfolio were pushed 190 basis points of increase sequentially in the lease up there. And the margins went up 820 basis points, that's another big driver. And then, there was, as you point out, some additional expense savings, I guess, because of the fewer days in the quarter. So those are the big contributing factors.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, do you expect rate growth to -- I guess, normally, all of your rate increases are on January 1, is that correct? Or there's anything that's spread out throughout the year with -- between the [indiscernible] of those?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "The majority -- yes, the majority of our rate increases occur January 1.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, maybe a similar question on MOBs where you had an increase in operating margin Q-over-Q, it looks like even on the same-store. Is there something in the seasonality there or something you're doing on the expense side? I guess you eluded to that earlier in the conference call about your economies of scale. But is there anything that you did 4Q to 1Q to increase the operating margin there?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well, Dan, there's a couple of things that are going on in the MOB side. One is, we are -- we have a very active best practice program going on in our medical office building portfolio right now, where we're going through, basically, building by building, identifying the buildings that are doing the best on each expense line and trying to take those practices across the entire portfolio. And we're starting to realize real expense savings off of that. And particularly on our gross leases, we'll get the benefit of that immediately. And then, there's also just some timing issues from quarter-to-quarter. As you know, in the medical office buildings, you've got your billings and your recoveries that will, as you look sort of from quarter-to-quarter, create some variation in margins. So those are the 2 primary drivers there.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So would you expect operating margins in the MOBs to continue to ramp up throughout the year as you continue to go ahead and evaluate expenses at the individual properties?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I mean, I think, overtime, the objective is to drive down expenses and recover those as the rents turn over in the market. So I don't think you'll see it happen quickly this year, but overtime, we want to try to be able to recover more of the expenses.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I have a follow-up question on cap rates. I think, Debbie, when we were in -- I think it might have been last June's NAREIT, we asked about if you were to buy Atria assets today, how much lower the cap rate would be, and you kind of alluded to maybe being 50 bps. Is that still the case, given capital cost? Do you think seniors housing cap rates have continued to compress since mid-last year? And not to pinpoint what you would you pay for assets today exactly, but is below a 6 cap reasonable for seniors housing in -- for class A major metro portfolios?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think that, first of all, buying Atria was a great decision. It's a great company, and the assets have done incredibly well with high kind of single-digit NOI growth. And we really bought it at the right time in the cycle, and Atria is doing a great job running it. So I -- we're very happy about that. I would say that cap rates -- as cost to capital has come down, cap rates have also come down. And so the cap rate, though, as you know, is only one part of the story. You have to look at the growth rate, and the quality, and replacement cost and all the other normal investment metrics that we do look at, as well as what the capital structure of the asset is and how profitable ultimately it's going to be. So there are a lot of factors that go into it, but I think your general direction is correct.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And are you distinguishing difference in evaluation between assisted living and independent living as well when you think about acquisitions going forward and when you're underwriting asset -- potential asset acquisitions today? The gap between assisted living and independent living cap rates have come down a lot. Should assisted living be more value -- higher cap rate than IL?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. There are different arguments on both side of the equation. Historically, AL has had a bit of a higher cap rate or even more than a bit. You're right, it has compressed. I would say the need-driven AL product did the best during the recession, because it is need-driven. But IL has been performing incredibly well as the economy and housing market have comeback, and we really are in this Goldilocks environment with moderate GDP growth, and that's been very supportive of the IL continuing to do well. So I think IL is even more like multifamily than AL, so that would argue for a lower cap rate. But yet, AL performed very well under the stress test of the financial crisis. So both of the them are good asset classes. I think there is not a big distinction right now in the marketplace between the cap rates for the 2.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "A quick question on the Kindred transition of assets. I mean, when those assets re-transit, do you expect a big difference in regards to the rent coverage ratios, new operators versus the current Kindred coverage?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We don't. I mean, there's a possibility that after this initial transition period that we just talked about, that if the operators are more efficient, if they are low-cost providers, that coverage will go up. But in general, these are profitable assets to begin with. They're profitable when they go to the new operators, and a lot will depend on what the reimbursement environment is, ultimately. But we do expect the new operators to be very hands-on and efficient operators.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just in regards to the CMS fiscal year '14 reimbursement. Any expectations in regards to what could come out with the preliminary numbers?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think ever since someone let out the fed minutes half an hour earlier or something, they're keeping a close wrap on this. So let's talk about it when it gets published maybe this evening.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So, Ray, can you explain -- to a question earlier, I think it was Karin who asked, how you take on some of these dilutive events during the quarter that were positive events, the senior notes issuance and the dispositions, and say that operating performance is in line with your expectations, but guidance was affirmed? I mean, is there some wiggle room implied in the guidance? Or were some of these transactions contemplated to begin with?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, some were contemplated, and it's a range, obviously. So I think if you kind of do the math, and you'll get to the answer. But I mean, yes, the portfolio is doing well.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And maybe, Debbie, I can ask a question of you on the -- maybe my favorite topic lately, the Atria management state, the 34%?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Absolutely.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I guess, my question is, what would be the status of that organization, that management company, in the absence of your equity investment? In other words, did they need it? Did you want it? Were there other bidders out looking to get that? I mean, how much did their livelihood depend on you making that investment?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, they're very viable company. Remember, we bought the funds from Lazard. So the price that we paid, if you will, really was not an equity infusion to Atria, because they had $20 million, $30 million cash on hand anyway. It was really a -- we bought it from the owner, which really was Lazard. And it's a great transaction, if you think about it. We paid, let's call it, $240 million, and among other things, we got 3.7 million Ventas shares, which alone, today, are worth about $290 million. So we essentially have 1/3 interest in one of the premier management companies in senior housing. And we -- we're very excited about that. I think it's going to be a great opportunity for us as the sector continues to evolve.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, fair enough. And just a quick question, Ray, on the senior housing portfolio, the reiteration of the same-store outlook at 5% to 8%, would you say -- looking maybe a little bit longer-term, would you say that growth -- the growth pattern of the space is accelerating, decelerating or sort of stable at this point?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I mean, I think it's pretty stable. There's -- as we said, there's sort of limited new supply coming online, although there is some. Our portfolio is at a good point where we can start to push on the pricing a little bit and afford to have occupancy remain relatively stable. So I would look at it and say we're probably at a good equilibrium point right now in the marketplace but -- in supply/demand and good spot.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then last question, maybe for Debbie or whoever. The remaining assets that haven't closed yet with regard to the Kindred release, how much will be kind of dark or -- not dark, but not paying from May 1 until they ultimately close that? What percentage of the total will be done?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "None. 0. 0. The...", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Oh, 0?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, 0.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Oh, they'll all be done by May 1?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No, no. There will be some that we expect, as we said, to close by the end of the quarter. But those will continue to earn rent. We're going to try to keep our call to about 1 hour, so we'll take our next caller. Thank you, Rich.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Jeff Theiler from Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick one on skilled nursing. The coverages seem to stabilize, but the average occupancies appears to still be trending down. Why do you think that is? And where do you see it going?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, I think as the assets have become really more post-acute, more shorter stay, across the industry, you'll continue to see shorter lengths of stay, which in turn lead to lower average occupancy. So that's the reason.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And can you provide Q mix progressions from last year to this year? How has that changed?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, we do put Q mix in the supplemental, and we have it for this quarter. And I believe it's pretty stable, maybe slightly improved from last quarter. But it was, I think, for Kindred, it was about 72%. I can confirm that.", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "73%.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "73% this quarter.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Debbie, when I look of the portfolio and I think about the diversification, your exposure to hospitals is clearly smaller than what you have in skilled nursing and medical office and assisted living. Can you talk about where your appetite for hospitals is at the moment? And maybe also the same question on the Life Science side, as you think about diversifying the portfolio further.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Good. As you know, we've been building our private pay business, and so that has that effect of, of course, shrinking our exposure to hospitals. And the part of the pie that we currently have in the hospital business is all long-term, acute-care hospitals, so a specialized segment. I think that we've had a vision in the health care and senior housing business that, over time, assets will flow to the most efficient owners. And that's really across senior housing, skilled nursing and really all across the continuum of care. And with our Lillibridge subsidiary, I think Ventas is really uniquely positioned to, if we choose to do so, devote capital to in and around health -- high-quality health care systems and hospitals. And so, we continue to explore all areas of health care and senior housing as we look at investments. And as I said, Todd's been visiting CEOs of these systems for 25 years, and we have great expertise and a great window into that business. So we continue to explore opportunities, really, in all segments of our business.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Why do you think hospitals have not migrated into the public REIT hands to the extent that senior housing and medical office has to this point?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think that, in general, I would say that there's been some adverse selection as far as hospitals go, in so far as the better hospital companies have really wanted to and have -- are temperamentally suited to kind of holding on to all their assets. But again, over time, as their capital needs increase and their costs and sources of capital become more -- a little bit more challenged, I think they would -- they do to consider the possibility of divesting of higher-quality assets. And until that happens, we really wouldn't be willing to play. Because it's got -- if we were to make an investment, it would have to be in higher-quality systems and operators. So all these trends are big, secular trends that take time to develop, and have developed, obviously, since REITs -- sort of health care REITs got into the RMZ. I mean, you can see the growth in assets that have come into public hands, and I do see that trend continuing across asset classes.", "Operator", "We have a next question on the line of things James Milam from Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I just wanted to clarify a comment that, Debbie, you made earlier on the call. You said you have capacity to do $1 billion of investment this year without raising equity. But what's kind of your target capital structure as you make those investments, particularly given your comments about moving up the rating scale? It's really kind of directed at how should we think about the ATM program in particular.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Could you repeat the question? I'm sorry.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just how you would -- even though you have capacity to do $1 billion of investments without raising equity, what is sort of your target funding if you are to -- able to close that many new deals this year? Equity versus debt.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We -- again, we're super consistent about this. So we target anywhere between 4x and 6x net debt-to-EBITDA. And so at various points in time, you'll -- we're very comfortable in that range, and so that's where we are now.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "So, I guess, if you make $1 billion of investments, should we think about $500 million of equity? Or is it...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No, no. What I -- no, I'm sorry. Let me repeat. We believe we could easily make over $1 billion of investments without raising any additional capital, equity capital that is. And we're very comfortable with that leverage level. So that's -- I would -- so I hope that answers the question.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Yes. I'm just -- I guess I'm just trying to marry that with the fact that you guys felt like it was a good opportunity to raise $85 million of equity with the ATM in April. So I'm just trying to get kind of a sense of how you're planning to use the ATM, given that comment and then what you guys did so far in the second quarter.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, with all of our capital markets, again, we try to make a decision based on all the facts and circumstances at the time, including our perception of market volatility, our perception of our capital needs and timing in terms of blackout periods and so on. So we look at all capital transactions on an audible-type basis with all facts and circumstances. And the ATM will be no exception to that.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. Let me move on. I guess, I just wanted to ask for a little bit more detail on the loan investment program. And I guess, what I'm really curious is, if you could give us a little more detail in terms of the types of loans you're making, whether they're mortgages or receivables or are OpCo-type loans, where they are, Mez [ph] loans? And then, I guess, also, is this an opportunistic strategy, given the dislocation you see in the market? Or is this something that you expect to be kind of a recurring business line for an extended period of time? And that's it for me.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we have -- okay. Yes, because we need to carry on. So we have, historically, with -- as did NHP, kind of 2% to 5% of our business in loans. A lot of that continues to pay off and recycle. The loans that we've made are very high quality, either senior secured loans and/or Mez [ph] loans with good loans to value and well-structured, good risk-adjusted return. And again, if you think about it, we're getting proceeds in from loan repayments, proceeds in from the syndication of parts of these loans. And then we expect to keep that overall book in balance, if you will, in that 2% to 5% range, which is exactly where we are.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Nic Yulico from Macquarie.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Ray, just turning back to the redevelopment program in senior housing. I think you said you had a $200 million pipeline. Does that kind of exhaust your redevelopment opportunities in the assets you have today? And what type of returns, can you remind us, are you retargeting on redevelopment?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Just before Ray answers, we have like 1,433 assets. So I'm hopeful that the $200 million doesn't exhaust our opportunities. But I'll let Ray answer the specifics.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "No. I know what you -- I meant, all to -- since senior housing, if that's all the redevelopment opportunity left?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "No. No. And there's a lot of opportunity within our portfolio, both in the seniors housing operating portfolio, Nic, and our triple-net lease portfolio. I mean, the playbook is to go find assets where you've got good occupancy, strong markets and at or below market rents where you can go in and add some additional programming, add some additional units or add some upgrades to the building and amenities that could enable you to drive rate. And we've got a lot of opportunities across our portfolio, either in the operating side or the triple-net side to go do that. So, no, we're -- $200 million is just a snapshot in time. There's plenty of opportunity for us to go mine in our portfolio.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay, and the type of returns you expect on that?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "We're typically in the double digits, so the lower double-digit range, 10% plus.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then -- and just one last on senior housing. I mean, you did talk about -- I mean, there was the Q-over-Q sequential occupancy decline, clearly some seasonality, cold-weather probably in the Northeast. But a year ago, you didn't have that sequential decline, and so you also mentioned that you pushed rates a little harder this first quarter. How much did pushing rates attribute to the occupancy decline?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "So there's a couple of things that sort of explain that. Obviously, we look at the same trends. And so, one is, I think, the higher-quality, higher income properties performed better during the downturn, and coming out of the downturn, outperformed the market. So I think we saw our portfolio grow ahead of the rest of the market. So that's one thing. 2, as you point out, we are pushing the rates a little bit, so there is some fiction as you start to push rates. And then, I think the third thing to look at in this quarter in particular was it was a fairly nasty flu season. And there was a little bit higher move-out in the portfolio as a result of the flu season. So you kind of put those 3 things together and it paints the picture.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for your questions. I'm afraid that's all the time we have today. I would now like to turn the call over to Debra Cafaro for closing remarks.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Nancy, and thanks to everyone for your participation. We sincerely appreciate your continued interest in Ventas, and we are looking forward to seeing you in Chicago, our hometown, in June. So thanks again, and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, Debra. Thank you, all, for joining, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes your call for today. You may now disconnect.

My name is Lucy and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Lori Wittman, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Lori B. Wittman", "Thank you, Lucy. Good morning and happy Valentine's Day. Welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the Company's announcement today regarding its results for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2013.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These projections, predictions and statements are based on management's current beliefs, as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events.

The information being provided today is as of this date only, and Ventas expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in expectations.", "Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the Company's supplemental disclosure schedule, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the Company.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Lori, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. We thank you for joining Ventas' year-end 2013 earnings call. Ventas had another outstanding year in 2013 and I'm excited to share the highlights with you today. We remained focused on delivering consistent superior results for our shareholders. Following my overview of 2013 and our initiation of 2014 earnings guidance, Ray Lewis will discuss our portfolio results and Rick Schweinhart will review our financial performance. We'll be happy to answer your questions after our prepared remarks.", "Ventas' outstanding performance in 2013 showed our ability to execute our strategy consistently, manage risk proactively, invest accretively, refinance opportunistically and run our assets productively. Now we are $28 billion enterprise with a diversified business model, fantastic balance sheet, nearly 1,500 productive senior living and healthcare assets, and expected NOI of $1.8 billion.", "Here are some of our notable achievements for the year. Total normalized FFO topped $1.2 billion. Normalized FFO per fully diluted share grew 11% excluding non-cash items and 9% on a reported basis. Yearly cash flow from operations increased more than 20% to $1.2 billion. We generated over $300 million in free cash flow after dividends and capital expenditures. In 2013, we increased our dividend by 10% while maintaining a 67% payout ratio, the strongest in our sector.", "We delivered excellent same-store cash flow growth in 2013 by managing our assets productively. Company-wide, our same-store cash NOI growth was 5% in 2013, including 6% in our Atria and Sunrise managed communities. We invested about $1.9 billion during the year with the lion's share invested in stabilized high quality private-pay senior living communities and medical office buildings with new tenants and existing relationships. We also allocated about $100 million to development and redevelopment in 2013.", "Our return from the acquisitions exceeded 7% and our redevelopments are underway to providing future growth. We continued our opportunistic and effective capital strategy in 2013, raising $5 billion in debt and equity. At year-end, our borrowing cost improved to 3.8% and our weighted average debt maturity lengthened to seven years.", "From a governance and enterprise reliability standpoint, we continue to benefit from a strong and cohesive Board of Directors and an enduring commitment to integrity and transparency. Consistent with our principles, we are pleased to provide enhanced supplemental disclosure this quarter, as promised.", "In sum, Ventas produced exceptional high quality and sustainable results in 2013. We believe that growing cash flows at increasing levels year after year while maintaining financial strength and flexibility will protect and increase equity and franchise value for our shareholders, We intend to execute on those principles once again in 2014. Today, we are initiating 2014 normalized FFO guidance of $4.31 to $4.37 per diluted share. This range represents 5.5% to 7% year-over-year growth in normalized FFO per share, excluding non-cash items and unannounced investments.", "Finally, let's talk about the external environment. Our business is at the center of many gigantic secular trends in the U.S. and the world. One is the ageing demographic of course with both baby boomers and the over 85 population growing at a rapid rate. Another trend is the overall growth in healthcare spending. A third is the increased access to our healthcare delivery system initiated by the Affordable Care Act. And a final important trend is the increasing change, consolidation and integration of healthcare providers and segments.", "As capital partners to our important customers who are on the frontline of delivering quality care to residents and patients in myriad real estate settings, we continue to see wonderful opportunities for Ventas to grow and deliver value to both our customers and our shareholders.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Thank you, Debbie. Our balanced and diversified portfolio of 1,473 seniors housing, medical office and post-acute properties turned in another strong performance in 2013 delivering same-store full year-over-year cash NOI growth of 5%. Excluding the $20 million cash payment received from Kindred in the third quarter, our full year cash NOI growth was 3.4%. Same-store cash NOI growth for the fourth quarter of 2013 versus the fourth quarter of 2012 was 4.4% and notably all segments were up sequentially.", "I'll break down this strong performance by property type, starting with our seniors housing operating portfolio. 2013 was another year of strong performance in our seniors housing operating communities. At year-end, we had a total of 237 properties in our seniors housing operating portfolio, and during the year, we acquired 16 new high-quality assets, all of which are managed by Atria. For the 195 properties that we own for both the full year of 2012 and 2013, occupancy increased by 130 basis points, REVPOR grew by 3.5% and cash NOI growth was 6% for the full year 2013 versus 2012.", "During the second half of the year, we ramped up the redevelopment activity in our seniors housing operating and triple-net portfolios. At year-end 2013, we had 18 redevelopment and development projects totaling a little over $200 million approved or under-construction, and we have another $200 million in the pipeline of projects we are currently evaluating. In addition, we are pleased to provide 2014 NOI guidance on our seniors housing operating portfolio of between $488 million and $500 million. On a same-store basis, we expect between 4% to 6% NOI growth. Finally, as you can see from our enhanced disclosure, NOI from seniors housing operating assets that have new construction within a three mile radius is between 2% and 3% of our total NOI.", "Next, I'll turn to the performance of our triple-net leased portfolio which is diversified across 907 seniors housing, skilled nursing and hospital assets. The 822 long-term triple-net leased assets we own for all of 2013 and 2012 delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 4.7%, including the previously mentioned $20 million paid by Kindred, and 2.2% excluding it. Cash flow coverage in our same-store triple-net leased portfolio for the third quarter of 2013, the latest available information, was strong and stable at 1.6 times. Coverage in the seniors housing triple-net portfolio and skilled nursing triple-net portfolio also remained stable at 1.3 times and 1.7 times respectively.", "As you can see from our enhanced disclosure, leases with a 1.1 times coverage or better represent the vast majority of our triple-net rent, about 99%. Conversely, less than 1% of our total annualized NOI comes from leases with under a 1.1 times coverage and the weighted average lease maturity of that small amount of annual rent is six years.", "Occupancy in our triple-net leased seniors housing portfolio increased by 160 basis points year-over-year and 130 basis points sequentially. By comparison, net reported seniors housing occupancy increased 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the same periods.", "As previously announced, we reached a mutually beneficial agreement with Kindred on the 108 assets whose lease term expires September 30, 2014. Under that deal, Kindred renewed 48 of the 108 facilities at a $15 million increase in annual rent and we received $20 million in prepaid rent. As a result, we have already replaced 67% of the rent that is expiring and we are extremely pleased with our re-leasing process on the remaining 60 skilled nursing facilities.", "We began the leasing process in the third quarter and significant progress has already been made. We have completed the bidding and due diligence phases, identified replacement operators, and are currently in lease negotiations for substantially all of these assets. We expect to complete substantially all of the transitions by year end. We still believe that the net impact of all of these events will fall within our original expectations of plus $3 million to minus $9 million of NOI in 2015.", "Before turning the call over to Rick, I'd like to provide a few comments on our medical office business consisting of 309 consolidated properties accounting for 17% of our annualized NOI. Same-store cash NOI growth for the 184 properties that we owned for both the full year of 2012 and 2013 was an excellent 3.7%. Same-store annual growth would be even higher at 3.9% if we included the Cogdell Spencer portfolio and the joint venture assets that we bought out in 2012 in a same-store pool of 287 MOBs.", "2013 was a year in which we used best practices across the portfolio to benchmark performance, focus on expense control, push rate and drive margins. Margins in the same-store stabilized portfolio was 67% in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with 64% in the fourth quarter of 2012, a 300 basis point improvement. We are also continuing to drive scale and consistent performance in our management business by internalizing our third-party managed assets where appropriate. During 2013, we brought 1.2 million square feet of property management in house to our Lillibridge property management business. As the largest owner of MOBs in the country, we can take advantage of our scale and platform to continue to drive NOI growth.", "So, once again, our balanced and diversified portfolio turned in a strong year across the board in 2013. And for 2014, we expect our total portfolio to show same-store cash growth between 3% and 4%, driven by our seniors housing operating portfolio at 4% to 6%, MOBs between 3% and 4%, and our triple-net portfolio ranging from 2% to 3%.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart who will discuss our financial results. Rick?", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. I'd like to focus first on activities during the quarter. Cash flows from operations in the fourth quarter were $359 million, up 27% from the fourth quarter last year. In December, we entered into a new $3 billion unsecured credit facility comprised of a $2 billion revolver priced at 100 basis points over LIBOR and a $1 billion term loan priced at 105 basis points over LIBOR. The loans mature in 2018 and 2019. Proceeds were used to pay down existing unsecured floating-rate debt.", "In the fourth quarter of 2013, normalized FFO was $1.06 per diluted share, an increase of 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 per share results of $0.99. Normalized FFO increased 7% to $314 million compared to last year's fourth quarter of $294 million. For the year 2013, normalized FFO was $4.14 per diluted share, an increase of 9% compared to 2012 per share results of $3.80. Normalized FFO increased 9% to $1.2 billion compared to last year's $1.1 billion. Our fully diluted share count rose slightly in 2013.", "For the year, cash flow from operations were $1.2 billion, up 20% from the previous year. Dividends totaled $802 million producing a net of $393 million available to invest. For the year, we had $1.9 billion in real estate investments including acquisitions, development and loans. During the year, we received loan payments and disposition proceeds of $358 million. The yields on these investments was 8.6%. Proceeds were redeployed into 2013 acquisitions. Our average cash interest rate improved 30 basis points to 3.8% at December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012, and we have been able to lengthen our weighted-average weighted debt maturities to nearly seven years from six years last year.", "At year-end, our credit stats remained outstanding with net debt-to-pro forma EBITDA at 5.5 times, our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 4 times, and secured debt to enterprise value of 10%. In December, S&P upgraded us to BBB+ from BBB, bringing all three agencies to a similar rating. Our revolver balance at year-end was $376 million. Currently, our debt to enterprise value is 33% and we have $1.8 billion in liquidity.", "We are initiating our 2014 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance at $4.31 to $4.37. It represents per share growth of 5.5% to 7% excluding non-cash items. The guidance does not include the impact of additional capital transactions or unannounced acquisitions or dispositions. Operator, if you would, please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please proceed.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America", "Just a question on the [indiscernible] guidance, would it be possible to break down your expectations for same-store growth for the portfolio with and without, I guess I know with developments, but what's the growth expected on an NOI basis without developments and sort of what are the driving pieces in terms of occupancy and rate growth?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Juan, this is Ray. So with respect to occupancy, sort of the midpoint assumes that occupancy would increase on average throughout the year about 80 basis points over 2013. Rates would be around a 3% increase. The redevelopment, as we mentioned in the script, we have geared up our redevelopment. The good news for that is we're trying to pump for future growth, but as we increase the amount of redevelopment activity, obviously there will be some units that will come off-line. The net impact of that next year would be probably a reduction in the order of maybe $3 million or so of NOI.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America", "Okay, great. On the dividend, you obviously increased in the fourth quarter about 10% annualized number, should we be thinking of any incremental bumps in this calendar year or sort of what are you thinking in terms of addressing the dividend in terms of timing within a year on a go forward basis?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Great question. Yes, we did increase our dividend in the fourth and continued that increase into the first quarter of this year, and as you know, we think the dividend is an important part of our total return proposition and have increased it on a 10% compounded basis over the last 10 years. Because our payout ratio is very, very strong at 67%, we do have room to continue to increase and our Board will be looking at that as we always do on a quarter by quarter basis.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America", "Great, and just I guess the last question, have you seen any sort of pickup in penetration levels in terms of seniors housing demand, maybe any tick down in the average age of people coming into the communities?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Juan, this is Ray. No, we haven't seen necessarily a change in the penetration rate or the average age. Obviously as the economy improves, spending generally will pickup and we have seen as the housing market has improved, a continued improvement in the seniors housing market, but with respect to penetration rates or average age, we're not seeing any change there.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I do think you're really on to something. So as a secular trend, I think we will see over time increased penetration rates in addition to increased demographics. So that will be a very positive demand trend for our business.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America", "Great, thanks. And you quickly \u2013 sorry for the last question \u2013 you just mentioned the supply data and I think you quantified it at 2%, but just trying to get some context of how that was \u2013 that number came about, how that was calculated for the\u2026?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Sure. One comment is, it is important to note that we are projecting and [Nick] (ph) is projecting positive absorption in seniors housing into 2014 and that's very important. I'll turn it over to Ray just to talk about the specifics.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Juan, if you look at be enhanced disclosure that we've provided in the supplemental this quarter, you'll see that we've actually laid out the amount of NOI that has construction within a three mile radius, and that on our total NOI base is less than 2%.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks for the additional disclosure on the senior housing portfolio. Are there any markets that you guys are currently in that you're particularly encouraged about that have stronger fundamentals and are there any particular like MSAs in general that supply does worry you?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Mike, thanks for joining and I appreciate the comment on the enhanced disclosure. I do want to take a minute to share with our investors and analysts that we've had a team of great people here at Ventas working very hard to provide you with that additional disclosure and information and I want to thank them and it's been a big effort here at Ventas on your behalf. So in terms of markets where we really like the supply/demand fundamentals, I'm going to turn it over to Ray.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I mean I would point you to the very first market in the list which is New York, which accounts for 22% of our total NOI. Within a three-mile radius of our properties in that densely populated marketplace, there is really only one property under construction and with 213 units. So we feel very bullish about that market and our assets in that market as an example.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets", "Are there any markets where I guess supply concerns you, maybe Dallas?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Dallas and Houston are the two markets where there is the most supply going on. Again, I think if you look at our properties in those markets, there are buildings that are being constructed around our properties, but when you look at the income statistics and the household, the home value statistics within our rings, our markets are very strong from those perspectives.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right, and one of the parts to the disclosure too talked about unemployment and population growth, and if you look at Houston for example, those are off the charts in terms of positives.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Exactly.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets", "Then how much does memory care supply really impact assisted living in the course?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "It's a different product type. I think you're pointing that out correctly. It's the most neat driven product of the seniors housing continuum. It's also been the most underserved product in the seniors housing area traditionally. So it's a highly specialized business for people that need specific services relating to dementia and the assisted-living product itself is more for the frail but mentally cognitive elderly. So there is I think a progression from assisted living into Alzheimer's but I don't think there is a direct crossover because of the specialized nature of the Alzheimer's services.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, and then fortunately, given the fact that our population is living longer and longer, the growth in the Alzheimer's population is also quite high.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then can you give us some color on the interest you're receiving from the 60 expiring skilled nursing facilities, is there more interest for sales than renewals? And then, Ray, I believe you said this transaction would be completed by year-end but doesn't that lease expire on September 30?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, it does, and we would expect to have the vast majority of the assets transitioned by the expiration of the lease looks minimal, potential hold-over depending upon regulatory processes. And then with respect to the interest in the buildings, we've had a lot of interest in the process. This time around I would say we've had a little bit more interest than we had last time from both existing tenants and new relationships. The process has moved very quickly, we have gotten our site inspections and diligence done, we've made significant progress for negotiating as I said with identified tenants for the properties. So this has been a good process where we've been able to leverage what we learned from the last process to move it along quickly. And then finally, I believe you asked about sales versus leasing, we may sell a couple of buildings but the vast majority of the portfolio is targeted for re-leasing.", " ", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman from Citi. Please proceed.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup", "It's Manny. Debbie, in your opening comments, you talked about these four gigantic secular trends and I can recognize the deal activity can be lumpy. I also recognize that you like to manage risk, stay disciplined and so that's a gating factor sometimes to Ventas potentially executing transaction activity. But I'm just curious for your thoughts on the overall deal environment. 4Q was light overall, was obviously light relative to the rest of the year. Can you sort of give us a little bit more color on potentially what you see occurring over the next couple of months?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Sure, Michael. I mean I think that we really love our business and I think that over time we have demonstrated again and again our ability to get more than our fair share of the acquisition opportunities in a very large and growing sector and I continue to feel very confident about that as we look forward. I would say that you really hit on it when you said, acquisitions are lumpy and the timing is impossible to predict, and so that is why we don't predict our volume or timing. But we've got a great team and a great cost of capital, we're in a great sector where we have different segments where we can allocate capital intelligently at the right time and in different cycles and hopefully create value for our shareholders, and at the end of the day that's what's it's all about. And again, I feel very confident in our team's ability to go out there and take care of business.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup", "Is it seller expectations in terms of pricing or is it buyers expectations about where they want to buy at, that's causing a little bit of a freeze in the overall market?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "One thing I would say is that we have a good pipeline, we are continuing to work on things, I wouldn't characterize it exactly the way you did, and again I do think it's timing and there has been \u2013 when you look at the market, I would say our asset types are attractive for the characteristics that they provide, whether it's MOBs or senior housing or other parts of our business, and those cap rates have stayed relatively steady or even have compressed a little bit. We still have a great cost of capital as I said. And so, over time we're going to continue to I think make value creating acquisitions and we are working on things now, but again timing and volume are yet to be spoken about.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup", "Okay. On HCP's call, they talked about getting more comfort on Europe and that potentially being an area of focus for them in terms of transaction activity, whether it would be fee or the financing side. I'm just curious about, certainly you have global being in Canada, but would you have any interest and is that sort of transaction activity that you're working on?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I would say that the exciting part of our business is that we have tremendous domestic opportunities that we think we will continue to take advantage of, but we also have the opportunity to go global. Many of the trends here obtain abroad as well and we have worked on international transactions over the past years and we have a high hurdle for those kinds of transactions, but we do work on them and we'll continue to do so, and if we find a transaction we think will provide good risk adjusted return and a channel for continued growth, then I think you will see us execute on that.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup", "Okay, great. Just last question, you have in your guidance this $34 million asset that's subject to a pre-existing purchase option arguably at a very high yield. Just remind us how many other assets or how much NOI or how much GAV potentially is tied to purchase options so that we're thinking about that piece of the enterprise correctly?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We'll do, yes. That's an old NHP purchase option that we were aware of of-course when we acquired the company. We have a limited number of these purchase options. I do think what's important if you look at the press release is, we have that purchase option and then we had some loan repayments and other sales that were at about an 8.5% yield during 2013, and our ability to continue to grow and reinvest in the face of that I think is quite good and quite extraordinary. And so we don't have anything material at all other than the one that we called out in the press release.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nick Ullico from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Nick Ullico - UBS", "Going back to the senior housing portfolio, could you just talk a little bit about, if I look at the stabilized same-store portfolio in the fourth quarter, occupancy was down about 50 basis points, could you just talk a little bit about what happened there?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "It's actually kind of a normal trend in the fourth quarter as you get to the holidays that people will not be moving their parents into seniors housing. I think the last couple of years as our portfolio has really outperformed the rest of the market, we bucked that trend, but this is a pretty normal trend that you would have, stable to declining occupancy slightly in the fourth quarter.", "Nick Ullico - UBS", "And then just turning back to the guidance\u2026", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Nick, just for your question, the same store total sequentially was 91.6% to 91.7%.", "Nick Ullico - UBS", "Right, I was referring to the year-over-year being down in stabilized.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay.", "Nick Ullico - UBS", "Actually I guess you raised occupancy quarter-over-quarter which \u2013 but I was wondering if there was something going on in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I don't even think it's the same pool, so that's relevant as well.", "Nick Ullico - UBS", "Okay. Just going back to the guidance for this year, I think you said you expect rates to be up about 3% and you did 3.5% in 2013, and what I'm wondering is, as you're getting your occupancy up for your portfolio, what level of occupancy do you need to reach before you think you can push rates a little bit more? I mean on one hand I understand there's, if the industry has a certain amount of rate growth, that's been going on, but on the other hand I thought the story was that Europe properties, once they reach a certain level of occupancy, the Atria, Sunrise assets, that's when you could probably drive rate more. So I guess what I'm wondering is, how far off you guys think you are from that and why the rate growth in 2014 might be just a touch below what you did last year?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Again, I think there's a lot of variables that go into creating our guidance. I would say our portfolio at approaching 92% occupancy is getting to the point where you can start to push rate and we have been doing that in markets where we have strength to do so. I would say that what I'm saying about guidance is really sort of a working assumption and is in fact a little bit higher than the working assumption we used for rates and guidance last year.", "Nick Ullico - UBS", "Okay, got you. And then just one last question is on the redevelopment that sort of as we think about the future redevelopment possibilities for the existing portfolio, what sort of dollar amount might be behind the \u2013 you have the $150 million underway in the operating portfolio today, I mean is there another $200 million, $300 million opportunity behind that with your existing portfolio or do you really need to do more redevelopment, do you really need to be buying more assets at this point?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "We've got a couple of hundred million dollars in the pipeline of redevelopment opportunities. There are still a number of attractive opportunities in the seniors housing operating portfolio that we haven't even begun to work on and then we've got our entire triple-net leased portfolio as well which we haven't mined to any material extent so far. And so that provides I think a very nice opportunity to go to our customers and markets where we think there are opportunities to invest in the assets and drive rate and occupancy, and that's going to be a big focus of ours this year.", "Nick Ullico - UBS", "Okay great, and I just want to make sure I heard correctly, when somebody asked about the redevelopment impact to same-store guidance this year, Ray, were you saying that it's actually it's going to be a reduction of NOI this year, or last year?. I was presuming it was more of a benefit.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Remember Nick that we sort of \u2013 we've gone \u2013 we had a big amount of redevelopment a couple of years ago that we were undertaking. We moved through that. That provided a lot of growth in our portfolio. We shifted gears again this year. This year we did $100 million of redevelopment as Debbie described. We now have a couple of hundred million with another couple of hundred million in the pipeline. As you implement those redevelopment projects, you are taking units off-line, you are reducing NOI in those buildings, so that you can increase your growth rate in the future as you are able to refill those units at higher rates. So that's what that's all about.", "Nick Ullico - UBS", "Okay, got it. Alright, thanks everyone.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please proceed.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital", "Good morning and happy Valentine's Day to you all too. So just to start out, is there anything else that you're seeing in terms of the SHOP occupancy growth in the fourth quarter? Obviously a 10 bps of improvement quarter-over-quarter but I would have expected a little bit more since I think we were using average occupancy and I would imagine that the third quarter ended at a higher level. So I guess that's the redevelopment that way on it or are you seeing anything else?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I would say the redevelopment would have had a marginal impact on it in the fourth quarter. I don't really have any other observation and a seasonal trend around the holidays.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then just to follow up on the Kindred re-leasing with the 60 [indiscernible] \u2013 thanks again for the additional details around the data points, that's great \u2013 I was curious of the talks around the long-term doc-fix are playing in the re-leasing discussions, and then how does the process play out after due diligence, is the next step rates and terms and then that gets us through October and then to the end of the year?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "First of all by the way congrats on your great call on Kindred, you've made investors a lot of money with their continued improvement. So in terms of process, what typically happens is there, as Ray said, diligence and site tours are done, you would be concurrently agreeing on financial terms and negotiating leases, and then once leases are signed, you go through the regulatory process.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital", "Got you.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I'm sorry, you asked about the impact of the doc-fix, we're not hearing anything from our potential tenants with respect to the doc-fix or other reimbursement changes. The properties continue to perform well and interest remains very high. I think with respect to the doc-fix, obviously there's a lot of uncertainty around the pay force and whether or not that would scuttle any kind of a deal in spite of the apparent savings that are embedded in the fix. So, we're not hearing anything from our tenants on that at this point.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital", "Got you. And then maybe just a bigger picture question, as you're thinking about making new investments, if we get better visibility in the Medicare rates from the long-term fix, would that make you more excited about making new investments in skilled nursing?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We are very consistent about our view in skilled nursing and what we've always thought is that it can be a very good risk-adjusted return investment if you do it out of good time in the cycle with a good operator and at the right pricing, and the right pricing would typically be where you may be coming out of the trough in Medicare reimbursement and looking, as you said, at better stability or even an overall multiyear increase in rates, that would obviously be ideal. They are low cost providers and important parts of the healthcare delivery system for seniors, and so we like that, but we do seem to \u2013 they do tend to have less visibility at all times around reimbursement and that has kept cap rates high.", "So, whenever we feel like we have good visibility and sustainable cash flows, we certainly would be willing to invest a certain amount of capital into high-quality assets with good operators in markets where the operators have good ties to hospital discharge planners and commercial payers.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital", "Got you, that makes sense. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Theiler from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "Can we talk a little bit more about the same-store stabilized senior housing NOI growth, and I'm just looking at 4Q 2013 over 4Q 2012 to take any seasonality issues out of it? It looks like the NOI growth of your stabilized same store pool was about just under 3% and that's, if you look back the last few quarters, that quarterly year-over-year growth rate has been kind of like 5%. Can you talk about this deceleration, what's going on there?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, I mean I think again going back to the fourth quarter of last year, we had a very strong fourth quarter of last year. I think occupancy was up 130 basis points sequentially and 360 basis points year-over-year. So I think there is a very strong comparison period there.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "Okay. So I guess along those lines then, when you project out your guidance, I understand you're taking some properties off-line and that takes about $3 million away, so the properties that stay online, that are stabilized, what NOI \u2013 that you are not doing any readout for, what NOI growth would you expect from that pool within your guidance?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "3% to 5%.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "3% to 5% on just the stabilized stuff that you're not doing any readout for?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "Okay. So shifting gears slightly to the supply, the data that you've put in there \u2013 and by the way, sorry, let me comment that I really appreciate the enhanced disclose, it's very helpful and it's really well done \u2013 on the supply data, you use a three-mile radius, is that the right number to be using when we think of competition coming into the market? I mean why is it three miles versus five miles and how do you come up with that number?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I mean I think we use a three-mile radius because all of our properties or substantially all of our properties in our seniors housing operating portfolio are in [indiscernible] infill urban and suburban locations where a three-mile ring is going to encapsulate a lot of population density. I think some markets may be a little more, some markets may be a little less, depending upon the density, but we believe this is a pretty good proxy given the composition of our portfolio.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "Okay, so it's primarily just because your properties are in dense markets and three mile is going to encompass a lot of that population?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "That's right.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "Okay. Alright, one last thing, on your new coverage tables, the triple-net leased coverage tables, if you were to put that on an EBITDARM basis using the standard assumptions that some of the other REITs use in terms of management fees, what percent of your NOI would you anticipate being at 1 or below on a coverage basis?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean first of all you have to look at the different asset types. In general in senior housing for example, if you look at profitability, that would move by maybe 5 to 15 basis points. Skilled nursing as you know is a little bit more because of the margins in that business. I think the important thing to note as we look at EBITDARM, and that is the most powerful way that operators look at coverages because there tends to be profit in that so-called managemency incrementally, so it really \u2013 it moves it again depending on the margin of the asset type, maybe 10 basis points on senior housing and maybe 20 basis points, 30 basis points on skilled, and so substantially all of the portfolio is very reliable on that basis.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Just a couple of quick ones and then kind of a bigger picture one. On the purchase option, the 11.2 NOI yield, for modelling purposes, is that what the cap rate we should use or should we use a larger or a smaller number, that's the lease yield, in other words the rent?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "That's a GAAP lease yield, that's what you should use for your model.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you. And then, Ray, you mentioned $3 million of NOI comes out because really it's a redevelopment in the same-store analysis, but doesn't that also come out in the prior year or is that just one end of the equation, so you actually do see it [indiscernible]?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "If we had a steady-state pipeline, Rich, that would be true, but because the pipeline is growing, the incremental impact of growing the pipeline is the $3 million.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "So it's a net decline of $3 million from one period to the other period?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. I was going to ask the three-mile question but I was going to ask it a little bit differently. Do you have any statistics if you used five or 10 miles, what the difference would be or have you done that analysis?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We look at three miles as being the most appropriate radius for the reasons that Ray stated. Staten Island, probably a-tenth of a mile for example, where we have our Sunrise asset. So it seems like an appropriate trade area and so that's why we focus on it.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Right, but I mean did you do the analysis for five miles and come up and do you have that number or did you just not go that way?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We did the analysis for three miles.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Only three miles, okay. I was looking at the disclosure, and I agree it's excellent and thank you for this, but I do have a question on the same-store analysis on Slide 3, and a lot of moving parts in terms of the number of properties that are in the same store operating pool, the fourth quarter, and then there is a lesser number for the full year, would you give any thought going into 2014? I'm just keeping it static so we don't have a lot of these redevelopment questions and all that noise that kind of entered into the equation?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think on Page 3, it is the total. I'll confirm that here with my colleagues, but\u2026", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "The same-store portfolio up-top.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, those are the same \u2013 those include everything because that's really I think at the end of the day the most useful.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. So I see 195 properties in the Atria Sunrise and 197\u2026", "Debra A. Cafaro", "That were owned the whole year of \u2013 this is an annual because we're doing the year-end call, it's annual, those are all the properties that were owned in that portfolio for the full year of 2012 and the full year of 2013?", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "So why is it 197 in the top table then?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We have two non-Atria, non-Sunrise assets that are in the materials, that why.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, that's it. Okay, thank you for that. And then finally, the question on the guidance for the SHOP portfolio, 4% to 6%, what will be the factors to move it to the lower end or the higher end of that range? I know you're probably going to say, we are targeting 5%, but what would be a situation to go to 4%?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We actually have that in here, we don't have to tell you.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "So Rich, as you know there are an unlimited number of like permutations you get on this\u2026", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Just give me the top two, give me the top two.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Probably the best thing to do is just isolate some variables and use those purely as the driver. So if occupancy was the only driver, you could go plus or minus 100 basis points on either side to stay in there \u2013 to get to the top and the bottom of the range or\u2026", "Debra A. Cafaro", "If all else being the same, ceteris paribus.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Ceteris paribus, yes.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "All else being equal.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I'm going to give you some corners of the back.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, go ahead.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "If you isolate REVPOR, a 1% swing on either side would get you to the top or the bottom and then 50 basis points on expenses on either side.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We got to keep rolling guys just so everybody has a chance to ask their question. Thank you.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "I'm done. Thank you very much. Happy Valentine's.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Good morning everyone, also happy Valentine's Day. I just wanted to understand the senior housing operating platform, same-store NOI growth in 2013, when I look at all the quarterly numbers you're kind of in the low to mid 6s, but the year price is 5.6%. I know there were some tax credit issues from 2012 that creates some comparability issues but just wanted to kind of understand what the real number was on an apples-to-apples basis?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay, so if you look at the same-store portfolio on a cash basis, full year to full year it's a 6% growth rate in NOI.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "It's a 6% [indiscernible], and that is just for the tax credit issue from 2012?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's just straight-up as-reported. If you look on the top of Page 3, that's the 6% number as-reported. There are no adjustments in that number for the full year.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Then the second question was along Michael's line of question about acquisitions, we kind of saw [indiscernible] do this very interesting deal in Boston, kind of curious whether you looked at it, again it's high-quality asset, it's MOBs, it's life sciences which we expect an interest in, and just kind of curious about your appetite for those kind of transactions going forward.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "As one of the kind of leading investors in healthcare and senior housing properties, I think you really should assume that our team is kind of out there looking at pretty much everything, and as I talked about with Michael, I think we are very confident about our ability to execute this year on the investment front and we do have this great opportunity to look at different sub-segments and rotate capital to where we think we will create value through increasing cash flows at our acquisitions and/or increasing multiples.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Great, all right. Let me also just thank you all for the additional disclosure, I think it's fantastic.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Our young guys are getting a big head here listening to all the [indiscernible], but they deserve it, thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "Happy snowy Valentine's Day at least on the East Coast, and I reiterate it what everybody said, the disclosure is very helpful. The only question I have on the supplemental is, when you \u2013 and don't roll your eyes, I'm not asking about SHOP stabilized anymore \u2013 but I'm just asking about the definition of SHOP stabilized. Does that include redevs or is it \u2013 what's your definition of stabilized when you do a redevelopment for Atria? Are the redevs in stabilized?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "No, those would be separated out. Once the property exceeds 90% occupancy and stabilizes, then it would be moved out of redevelopment and into the stable portfolio.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Does it matter what kind of redev you do, like if you close a big part of the wing or if it's a smaller portion, or just all redevs are out of stabilized?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "In general, it has to be material to get moved into redev and then once it's in redev, as Ray said, once it gets stabilized it gets into stable.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then also on the SHOP portfolio, looks like expenses jumped up in the quarter, I'm not sure if you addressed this earlier in the call or not, I may not have heard it, but I just wanted to understand\u2026", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No, we didn't. I mean as Ray said, in the third quarter typically repair and maintenance and other type of expenses where the operators have budgets for the whole year that get under-spent early in the year, tend to get lumpy in the fourth quarter. We saw some of that, which again is pretty consistent with our experience and expectation.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, so would that $50 million or so of maintenance CapEx be a good number for 2014 and expected to stay about the same level or is it unusually high a little bit?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "What number you're referring to?", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "The maintenance CapEx, the recurring CapEx in the SHOP portfolio.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "In here?", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, I think it was like $65 million for the year. Where did I miss?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well, obviously we've added more units into the portfolio, so it's going to increase. It's about 2,000 units and that's in the ballpark.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "2050.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, just checking.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think it's a little lower than your number.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "All right, that's good. That's all I have. Thank you very much.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We have time for just two more questions and who's next in line?", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Deb, can you please comment on the media reports about potential merger discussions with another large healthcare REIT, what would be the rationale for a potential combination like that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay, first of all we do not comment on rumors and that's our policy and we'll continue to follow that. I have had discussions with investors and happy to do so on a hypothetical basis. Every transaction has pros and cons, public to public mergers have pros and cons obviously. The true value of any transaction will depend upon what its financial terms are and then what the strategy, the team and the prospects for continued growth would be on \u2013 and synergies on a go forward basis. And at the end of the day, any public to public merger is a very, very low probability but there are pros and cons in terms of investment pieces, but at the end it all depends on the factors that I outlined.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thanks for that. Do you see any benefits to having any \u2013 to have an even greater scale than you currently have today?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I would say that the following, that some of the benefits of scale include ratings and cost of debt which are very highly correlated with the size and scale and diversification, and I would also say that if you think about healthcare REIT, I've always thought of us as kind of a third real estate, a third healthcare, a third finance, and typically to the extent that there is a finance component to the company, those companies do tend to benefit from scale. So that's how I would characterize it, Karin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "All right, so I do that and clean up this morning.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo", "Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered but just a couple of big picture questions. I was hoping to hear your comments in general on the public non-trade REIT space. You mostly hear this group in the net leased sub-sector as a potential M&A target, but the numbers of entrants have definitely increased within healthcare. Are these large portfolios on your radar to acquire and really what are your general comments on the potential for increasing competition from these well-funded buyers?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "So you're talking about the non-traded REITs, I mean I think \u2013 as I said, our sector is large, it's growing, it's highly fragmented and there are lots of opportunities and we have always been \u2013 we have a track record of having executed our growth strategy in a very compelling way and we feel confident about our ability to continue to do that. Because of the attractiveness of our sector, I would say we've always had competition, that competition takes different forms in different times of the market, and our job is to see where the value creation opportunities are in any given market and that's where we are focused on for 2014.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo", "Okay, thanks. Then just one last quick one, just regarding the ATM, how do you determine the price to sell at? Do you guys look at it tied to NAV or spread to investment for new investments and how much of volume is assumed in your guidance for this year?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We do not assume any additional capital raises in our guidance and we always view our shareholders' equity as a very precious resource and we hope to use that wisely and we use a variety of factors, including use of proceeds as a principal one, in determining how, when and what form of capital to raise, and we do believe that having excellent capital market raising capabilities is one of the most important things we can do as a successful acquisition and investment firm.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thank you. So, we are going to close the call and I want to once again thank everyone for their interest in our Company and I can honestly say that with the strong relationships, our team, our cost of capital, our balance sheet, our track record and our focus, I am as excited about the future of Ventas as I was 15 years ago when I joined. We really look forward to seeing all of you in Florida and hope you have a great weekend. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

As always we\u2019ll then be pleased to answer your questions.", "Our first quarter financial results continued our long standing track record of growing earnings, cash flow and our dividend. The depth, strength and stability of our management team are strong contributors to Ventas\u2019 consistent superior performance.", "First let me address some of the highlights of the quarter and year-to-date and our expectations for the balance of 2014.", "Normalized FFO for the quarter grew to $1.09 per share, which reflects 7% growth compared to the first quarter of last year excluding non cash items. Our growth resulted from increases in same-store NOI, the accretion from our high quality 2013 acquisitions and receipt of fees and other payments partially offset by higher corporate expenses and the impact of loan repayments and asset sales in 2013.", "At Ventas we focus on delivering reliable growing cash. Ventas\u2019 growth resulted from increases in same-store NOI, the accretion from out high quality 2013 acquisitions and receipt of fees and other payments partially offset by higher corporate expenses and the impact of loan repayments and asset sales in 2013 in case you didn\u2019t catch that the first time. At Ventas we focus on delivering reliable growing cash flow.", "This quarter our cash flow from operations increased over 23% since last year. One reason for this increase was a very strong 3.7% same-store cash flow growth we recorded in the quarter from our highly productive portfolio of diversified assets and our successful business model. During the quarter we paid our shareholders a dividend of $0.72.5 per share up over 8% from the dividend we paid from the first quarter of 2013.", "Yet we retain an impressive dividend payout ratio of 67%, providing room for continued upward movement in our dividend payment. We are proud of our 14 year compound annual dividend growth rate of 9% and pleased to share the company\u2019s success through a reliable growing dividend. We also have great news to report on the 60 skilled nursing assets whose lease term expires later this year. Ray will address the particulars, but I am delighted to report that we have improved our expectations and we are on schedule to complete the transactions by October 1.", "We also have been very active on the capital and investment fund. We expect $0.03 of accretions from the net impact of our recently completed and very attractive $700 million bond deal, the $200 million of investments we completed in the first quarter, the pending closing of another $100 million of investments and the upcoming repayments of $200 million of mortgage debts.", "We are excited to announce that our biggest investment in the quarter was the acquisition of three high quality private hospitals in the United Kingdom. This transaction is in consistent with our articulated strategy of expanding Ventas\u2019 footprint in selected geographies where we see positive fundamentals, superior risk adjusted returns, and continued long-term investment opportunities.", "These three private hospitals are leased to Spire, the second largest private hospital operator in the UK under a long-term triple-net leases. The properties are highly productive with strong market share and are located in greater London and northern England. Rent coverage exceeds two times in your escalators or at least 3% and the expected net yield is 9%.", "We intend to build on our investment in the UK over time, because the healthcare and senior housing real estate market there is highly active and evolved. We remain optimistic about our investment opportunities both domestically and internationally. The healthcare and senior housing investment market has ramped up significantly and we have our hands full reviewing potential transactions.", "These opportunities range from multibillion dollar portfolios to single asset acquisitions across all our segments. Our job is to sort through a very large pipeline and allocate capital to the right segments, right geographies, at the right time in the cycle in good risk adjusted return transactions that create value for Ventas\u2019 shareholders.", "We are highly confident that we can extend our long track records of being excellent capital allocators and disciplined successful investors. I\u2019d like to make one final point before I turn the call over to Ray. I recently saw a release this morning announcing that our long time and highly valued CFO Rich Schweinhart plans to retire at the end of this year after a distinguished and productive 43 year career, the last 12 with Ventas. Until then Rick will work with us in our outstanding IT, accounting and finance teams to ensure a smooth and seamless transition.", "I met Rick on my first week at Ventas CEO in 1999, when he was still the CFO at Vencor. And I asked him to tell me what an LTACH was. Rick has been teaching me about healthcare ever since. I finally persuaded Rick to become our CFO in 2002 and he has played a central role in our growth and success. Among other things Ventas grew from a market CAP of under a billion dollars when he joined us to $19 billion today including over $21 billion of acquisitions.", "During his 10 year, we went from a high yield issuer to a highly rated one, now enjoying one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT space. And we joined the S&P 500. All the while Rick has worked side by side as our trusted colleague, with good humor, patience and tireless commitment to our enterprise. We and our shareholders owe Rick a great debt of gratitude and I\u2019d like to publicly thank him for all he\u2019s done for Ventas over the years.", "I look forward to continuing to work with Rick and having plenty of opportunities to toast him with his favorite Kentucky bourbon, during the remainder of 2014, Ray.", "Raymond Lewis", "Thank you Debbie. Our diverse, balanced and productive portfolio 1473 seniors housing, medical office and post-acute properties had another strong performance in the first quarter. For the quarter our same-store cash NOI grew by 3.7% year-over-year. I\u2019ll run through some of the highlights for the quarter by segment.", "Let me start with our private-pay seniors housing operating portfolio. The total portfolio now stands at 237 properties and delivered another strong quarter. The total seniors housing operating portfolio produced $122.7 million of NOI after management fees in the first quarter, growth of 13.5% versus the prior year.", "Occupancy in the total portfolio stood at 90.6%, compared to seniors housing occupancy in the 31 primary markets as reported by Nick of 89.8%. And REVPOR was about $5500 versus about $3400 reported by Nick. NOI for the 220 property same-store portfolio increased 4.6% in the first quarter of 2014, compared to the first quarter of 2013. And same-store REVPOR increased 2.5% percent. This also compares favorably to the next senior housing annual rent growth of 1.6% in the 31 primary markets for the first quarter.", "Sequentially in the 235 communities we own for the full first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013, NOI growth was even more impressive at 5.5% and margins improved 140 basis points. Nick recently reported that seniors housing construction has slowed in the first quarter, in particular Nick reported the construction starts for total seniors housing in primary markets declined 65% from about 4000 units in the first quarter of last year to about 1400 units in the first quarter of this year. At the same time absorption and seniors housing continues to be positive due to the need based nature of the product and the aging of the population.", "Most importantly for our SHOP portfolio, construction of the percentage of inventories with only 2.5% in the three-mile trade area around our buildings, compared to 3.1% for the 31 primary markets reported by Nick. Our expectations for the full year SHOP NOI remain unchanged, with 4% to 6% projected same-store NOI growth and total NOI between $488 million and $500 million.", "Next, alternative performance of our triple-net lease portfolio which is diversified across 907 seniors housing, skilled nursing and hospital assets. Same-store cash NOI in this portfolio was up 4.1% year-over-year, cash flow coverage in the 764 properties and our same-store triple-net lease portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2013, the latest available information was strong and stable at 1.6 times.", "As Debbie mentioned in her remarks, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the progress on the 60 Kindred leasing facilities whose terms expire in October 1st of 2014. We have signed leases on 55 of the 60 buildings and we have executed sale contracts on four of the five remaining buildings we intend to sell. In combination with the agreements we reached with Kindred last fall, these transactions, when completed, will fully replace the 2015 rent we would have otherwise received had Kindred renewed the entire portfolio. We have already transitioned a half-dozen of the buildings and all the remaining facilities are on track to be transitioned on or before the Kindred lease expires on October 1st.", "Our interdisciplinary releasing team has been working extremely hard on this transaction and has done an outstanding job the position on Ventas for an excellent result. Upon closing of the signed leases with our new tenants our portfolio will be even more diversified and Kindred will account for approximately 6% of our total revenues.", "Finally, I\u2019d like to briefly discuss Ventas\u2019 portfolio of 309 consolidated medical office properties, spanning over 16,000,000 square feet and accounting for 16% of our annualized NOI.", "Here are a few of the MOB segment highlights for the first quarter. Total portfolio NOI at the 100% share with $75.7 million and overall occupancy was a very healthy 90%. Most importantly cash NOI and the 296 same-store consolidated medical office buildings increased 3.6% year-over-year net of lease termination fees received in the first quarter of last year. Rate in the same-store portfolio also increased 3% year-over-year and margin improved, again after netting out the prior period lease termination fees.", "So we continue to push rates, manage the expenses, drive bottom-line growth in our MOB portfolio. Additionally we started to see leasing activity pickup in the first quarter, we\u2019re issuing more letters of intent, signing more new leases, and commencing new leases then we have in the past year. And we are maintaining a strong retention rate.", "This increase in activity should translate into increasing occupancy and continuing NOI growth over time. So our balance in diversified portfolio continued to perform across the board. And we are on track to deliver our same-store cash NOI growth target of between t 3% and 4% in 2014. Rick?", "Richard Schweinhart", "Thank you Ray. Cash flows from operations in the first quarter were $284 million, up 22% from the first quarter last year. Investments in the quarter totaled $247 million including acquisitions, CapEx and construction and development. At the quarter end in April, we were opportunistic in the fixed income markets raising $700 million at an interest rate of 2.75% and a weighted average maturity of seven years.", "Our strategy continues to be to lock in low long-term rates, lengthen and stagger our maturity schedule. Repaying outstanding liquidity on our $2 billion dollar revolving credit facility and maintaining an appropriate amount of floating-rate debt, which now stands at 15% of total debt.", "In the first quarter of 2014 normalized FFO was a $1.09 per diluted share, an increase of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2013 per share results of a $1.03. Normalized FFO increased 7% to $323 million compared to last year\u2019s first quarter of $302 million. Normalized FFO increased due to improvements in all three segments, accretive acquisitions completed in 2013 and fees and other payments approximating $0.01of earnings.", "This increase was somewhat offset by a decrease in interest income on loans and investments that were repaid or sold last year. And an increase in G&A and interest expense due to acquisitions. Our diluted share count rose less than 1% to 296 million shares. Our average cash interest rate improved 40 basis points to 3.7% at March 31st, 2014 compared to March 31st, 2013. And we have been able to maintain our weighted average debt maturity at nearly seven years.", "At quarter end our credit stats remained outstanding with net debt through pro forma EBITDA at 5.5 times. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of four times and secured debt to enterprise value of 9%, our revolver balance at quarter end, prior to the issuance of our bonds was $559 million. Currently our debt to enterprise value is an outstanding 34% and we have over $2.2 billion in liquidity including $260 million of cash on hand.", "We are maintaining our 2014 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance at $4.31 to $4.37. Our guidance if achieved represents 5.5% to 7% per share growth excluding non-cash items estimated at a dime per share, because of our recent activity we would expect to come in towards the higher end of our range.", "Our current guidance range includes the net accretive impact of our $200 billion of investments closed in the first quarter. The completion of $100 million of pending acquisitions and the repayment of $200 million in mortgage debt, financed by our $700 million bond deal, because we are currently in a net cash position, there will be a minor amount of negative arbitrage in the second quarter due to timing differences between our capital raise and full deployment of the proceeds.", "Our guidance does not include the impact of additional unannounced capital transactions or acquisitions or dispositions. So all in all we had an excellent quarter and we are well positioned to deliver for the balance of the year.", "Operator if you would, please open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of UBS.", "Nick Yulico \u2013 UBS", "Good morning everyone. Just want to start in the UK maybe if you could just talk a little bit about what was attractive about this deal and particularly since its Spire. There has been I guess, in the press that their owners are exploring a sale review the overall entity. I think there\u2019s still more real estate there that is, I know they sold some real estate a year ago, I think it\u2019s probably about 20 properties maybe left if I look at it. Maybe if you could talk about the future investment opportunity there and whether it\u2019s well with 100 million that\u2019s on the contract relates to Spire as well.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. We\u2019re very excited and again consider the Spire investment to be a great risk adjusted return and also a natural evolution of our articulated strategy of growth and diversification. Spire is obviously a highly regarded hospital operator, the second largest private hospital operator in the UK and they do own addition real estate. I can tell you that none of the extra $100 million relates to Spire but, as I said in my remarks we do believe that the UK healthcare real estate market is very evolved, it\u2019s very active. And we would expect to have additional opportunities there with Spire or other operators over time.", "Nick Yulico \u2013 UBS", "Okay and then the 9% yield that was quoted, is that a GAAP or a cash yield what would be the cash if so?", "Debra Cafaro", "The dealing in cash it\u2019s about 6.5 and the 9% is the reported yield.", "Nick Yulico \u2013 UBS", "Okay so if we sort of think about the 6.5 yield and even if we think broadly about investing internationally into the private pay hospital market whether it\u2019s the UK or even possibly Australia which has a similar funding market, it sounds like cap rates are similar in Australia. How do you think about investing as that type of cap rates for hospital assets? Even though recognizing that maybe people are just aren\u2019t as aware of how the funding environment for the operator\u2019s much different than US, maybe you wouldn\u2019t mind covering that a little bit.", "Debra Cafaro", "Sure. And I think that you\u2019ve hit on a really important point in our investment thesis. I would say that when we talked about this as being a natural evolution of Ventas\u2019 diversification, I would say that a hospital asset in the U.S. and a hospital asset in the U.K. are a little bit of different animals and they beat to different drummers. And in particular, I think what you would find in the U.K. is that there is lots of opportunities for support of the hospital systems, there is significant stability in those funding sources, and the risk reward is different in the U.K. and therefore, the cap rates are different, because the reliability of those cash flows over time and the stability of those cash flows over time has been very, very strong.", "Nick Yulico \u2013 UBS", "Would you view Australia as a similar type of market to the U.K.?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, they\u2019re both English-speaking, I can say that, but yes, I would say that in general, some of the countries that are basically under the historic British Empire would have traditional systems. And in many cases have similar drivers to their current operating profiles and funding sources.", "Nick Yulico \u2013 UBS", "Okay that\u2019s helpful. And just one other question is, as we think about your Canadian senior housing portfolio, it\u2019s not that large. I\u2019m just curious, how you\u2019ve thought about that investment. How it\u2019s done, how you think about investing additionally into Canada if there were a decent sized senior housing portfolio that became available at a similar type of cap rate to where you\u2019ve been investing in the U.S. with a known operator. Would you look to do more in Canada today?", "Debra Cafaro", "I\u2019m going to ask John Cobb, our chief investment officer to take that one Nick.", "John Cobb", "I think that definitely we\u2019re looking both domestically and abroad. We\u2019re looking at the smaller yields and bigger yields like you suggested and you should assume we\u2019re looking at everything.", "Operator", "Thank you the next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Go ahead please.", "Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citi", "Debbie, just on sticking with Spire for a second? The $200 million, was that part of the sale leaseback they did last January or was that a new sale leaseback that you entered into with them direct?", "Debra Cafaro", "It\u2019s not part of what we said in last January. It was an existing lease that we acquired from the landlord that has long-term term remaining.", "Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citi", "Right. And so between 6.5 to 9, how long is that term and what are the escalators?", "Debra Cafaro", "The escalators are at least 3% annually.", "Richard Schweinhart", "It\u2019s over 20 years.", "Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citi", "So, this was an existing lease that they had in place?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes; and yeah coverage is well over two times and if they\u2019re seasoned assets and a seasoned lease.", "Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citi", "Now, had you looked at \u2013 I don\u2019t know where this relationship had embarked on but I do look at this or we\u2019re involved last year when they set up the \u2013 I got to assume you had a cheaper cost of capital than two-hedge funds, when they did the sale leaseback last January. Was that something that was of interest to you and how do the economics there compare to the economics you\u2019ve got here?", "John Cobb", "We do not look at that particular transaction, but the economics are similar.", "Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Debbie, this is a two part question. So, if you and I were putting together a panel for NAREIT last fall and for this coming NAREIT, and we\u2019re going to put the three big healthcare REITs on the panel, you, HCN and HCP. Would it have surprised you that the panel wouldn\u2019t have been you, Jay and George and it would\u2019ve been you and two Board members. That\u2019s part one. Part two, is sort of in that light and I don\u2019t want to imply one iota that I want you to say, but can you talk a little bit about Ventas\u2019 approach and process on succession planning, given the first part of the question?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah, I mean it would be a pretty small panel this year, but I would say that we all as executives and public companies serve at the pleasure of our Boards and our shareholder constituents. And I think that over time that will change and does change as we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 months in our space. And we at Ventas are very serious about our team and I think we are distinguished by the long tenure team we have and the very deep bench, many of which are here with me today, and that\u2019s one of our great strength. And I would say that in all companies, all of our successes are a product of a lot of people\u2019s efforts and I feel very good about where we stand at Ventas, although I have no intention to leave at the present time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Theiler of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.", "Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Just a couple of quick ones from me. Can you talk a little bit about the low expense growth we saw on the SHOP portfolio? Was there anything unusual going on there? Is that just great cost controls by your operator?", "Raymond Lewis", "No, Jeff \u2013 this is Ray. There is always some puts and takes between expenses in the quarters, but there is nothing unexpected in there. I think we saw a little bit of increase in utilities, but that was more than offset by management of productive labor, payroll and benefits.", "Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors", "Then, just moving to the Kindred transition, can you talk a little bit about the five assets that you\u2019re selling, the reasons you\u2019re selling those particular assets and what kind of pricing you might be expecting?", "Raymond Lewis", "Yeah, so those are non-strategic assets, Jeff, that we really didn\u2019t have a place for. We\u2019re going to sell those for about $42,000 a bed, something like that.", "Operator", "Juan Sanabria, Bank of America.", "Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a few questions. With regards to outstanding purchase options, have you guys had any agreements with operators \u2013 Brookdale comes to mind \u2013 with regards to getting ahead of those potential options?", "Debra Cafaro", "We\u2019re very happy to report that. Basically, we had one purchase option this year that we had disclosed as part of our 2014 guidance and is in our assumptions, and then we really don\u2019t have any material purchase options until 2020, and frankly, those are immaterial as well, and those are at [indiscernible] and fairly small in nominal dollar size. So we\u2019re in very good shape there.", "Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "With regards to sort of acquisitions and preferences for asset types, I know you\u2019ve been focused on private pay, particularly seniors housing and MOBs. What\u2019s the view on some of the private run listed REITs have become more competitive it seems, looking at skilled nursing which has a sort of a higher going-in yield cap rate and maybe isn\u2019t quite as competitive?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think we\u2019ve talked a little bit about this, and the way I would describe it is when we talk about being excellent capital allocators and creating value for shareholders, I think it\u2019s important to allocate to the right sectors at the right time in the cycle. And if you think about it, we did about $11 billion in acquisitions in 2011, which was you could make a tremendous kind of macro investment thesis on senior housing and MOBs, basically saying that those were assets where you really wanted to be that cap rates were going to compress and value was going to be created through both cap rate compression as well as increases in NOI.", "So, that has been a wonderful capital allocation for us. I would say, as other people catch on to the merits of those asset classes and we\u2019ve always had competition, just like now, what we\u2019ve tried to do is refine our investment focus to places where we have a significant competitive advantage, where we can really add value, either through internalizing management on the MOBs or we can use our balance sheet on assets that don\u2019t have in place mortgage debt, where we can perhaps transition assets to Atria for example. And so we\u2019ve refined that and we have continued to grow accretively and focus our investment efforts on areas where we really believe we have a competitive advantage and we will continue to do that in those sectors.", "Obviously, we are looking across the board at all asset types, including skilled nursing and hospitals as we\u2019ve discussed and I think that we would continue to allocate capital to skilled on the basis of, if we could find good risk adjusted return with good operators who have good presence in the market and good relationships with managed care and discharge planners, but I think our capital allocation there will be more at the margin as output drivers and it will be a huge amount of additional net investing.", "Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a last question, you\u2019d sort of talked about in the intro $0.03 of, I guess, accretion on deals, investment both that close in the first quarter and that are pending? And how should I think about that relative to annualizing your first quarter figure which implies a number basically at the high end of your guidance?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we can look at it \u2013 good question \u2013 I think we can look at it in a couple ways. If the net impact of bonds and the acquisitions and debt repayments is, call it, $0.03 accretive, if we were at the midpoint before, that puts us more towards the high end of our range as Rick said. Alternatively, if you take the first quarter and Rick mentioned there might be a $0.01 of items, so maybe you take 108 times four and then you add the accretion going forward, something like that, you can kind of get to the higher end of the range in a couple of different ways, Juan.", "Operator", "Jack Meehan, Barclays.", "Jack Meehan \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I want to start with the hospital investments in U.K. Just curious about the regulatory environment in U.K. a little bit. We\u2019ve been tracking it for HCA and I know the competition in markets \u2013 and BMI to divest some hospitals. How do you think about that in London? Is it a good thing because it could lead to new investment opportunities for Ventas, or do you think it\u2019s more of a risk because some of the better operators are being asked to leave the market?", "Debra Cafaro", "We think of it as a net opportunity for us.", "Jack Meehan \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Maybe more specifically with HCA and BMI, do you think that those are opportunities or even with Spire that you\u2019d expect to see happen over 2014, or is this something that you think could take a little bit longer to play out?", "Debra Cafaro", "We think it\u2019s an intermediate-term process, I would say, and we\u2019ll take a little bit longer than this year to play out. To begin, as capital providers, when assets are changing hands, it obviously can create opportunities, it doesn\u2019t always, but it can create opportunities to finance some of that changing hands and acquisition activity.", "Jack Meehan \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Just a couple on the operating environment, we\u2019ve had a couple of the hospitals now report early on and one of the interesting things we\u2019ve heard is that they\u2019ve talked about seeing some improvement in surgical volumes which they say could potentially be economic driven. When you talk of your post-acute operators, have they talked about seeing any sort of benefit downstream yet and obviously there\u2019s been a lot of moving parts, so, just curious.", "Raymond Lewis", "Jack, this is Ray. We haven\u2019t really seen that impact flow through to the post-acute operators yet, but that is obviously a delayed reaction.", "Debra Cafaro", "That\u2019s the word post, but I do think that those are \u2013 I think the important point you are making is those are favorable trends that over time we should obtain the benefit of.", "Jack Meehan \u2013 Barclays Capital", "The last one with the LTACHs, there\u2019s been some discussion. Obviously, we\u2019ve got criteria in December and the rate cuts don\u2019t go in until the end of 2015, but the potential that now physicians have some sort of blessing to put those patients that fall in the criteria to send them to an LTACH versus sending them somewhere else where they\u2019re doing it previously. Just curious if on that front, with your discussions with your LTACH operators and obviously Kindred, if you\u2019ve heard any of that or if you think that could be a near-term opportunity in terms of the coverage?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean, I think it\u2019s great how the LTACH model has been validated, and obviously, Kindred is one of the, if not weak, top LTACH operators in the country, and so, we have been \u2013 we have liked this asset class for a long time and I do think there is opportunity for Kindred and obviously the market sees that, as their stock has rallied to over $25 this year as you well know and they have a great strategy in their integrated care markets and those are the assets that we own. So, we think it is great for Kindred and that we will be a secondary beneficiary of those important improvements and again the validation of the LTACH model by CMS.", "Operator", "Daniel Bernstein, Stifel.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Going back to the U.K. acquisition, I was trying to understand also the competitive environment for those hospital assets relative to say, marketed transactions for seniors housing or MOBs in the U.S. Are there a lot of private equity buyers there? We\u2019ve seen a lot of European REITs, U.S. REITs. So, just trying to understand who\u2019s bidding on those assets?", "John Cobb", "This is John. I mean, I think it\u2019s very similar to the U.S. I think you\u2019re seeing a myriad of suitors, you\u2019re seeing private equity, you\u2019re seeing pension funds, you\u2019re seeing other REITs, you\u2019re seeing international REITs compete. So, it\u2019s no different than it is here. It\u2019s still competitive. We\u2019re still seeing market transactions and off market transactions.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Are you looking elsewhere in Europe; medical properties trusted Germany transaction \u2013 property transaction in Germany, well I think those were some \u2013 had some reimbursement involved with them and not just private pay. So are there other places of opportunity within Europe that you\u2019re looking as well beyond U.K.?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think John had to get extra pages for his passport last quarter.", "John Cobb", "I like the global entry thing.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah. Look, I mean we are focused in our strategy and we\u2019ve identified specific jurisdictions where we think there are good trends and investment opportunities and we will stay focused on those, and so, more to follow perhaps.", "John Cobb", "Yeah. I think we have a big team focused both domestically and international that\u2019s looking for good opportunities that can create value for shareholders.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "You guys are going to have to do an Analyst Day over here at some point.", "Debra Cafaro", "Lori is already [indiscernible].", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "On the SHOP portfolio, occupancy declined sequentially, which under normal seasonal conditions I don\u2019t think would be a question I\u2019d ask, but with NIC MAP Data down 5 basis points for assisted living and basically flattish overall sequentially, trying to understand the dynamics that went into that occupancy drop. You increased rates; are there other items there that moved that around? I think you were also doing some increased CapEx. I was trying to understand the dynamics that went into that occupancy drop. What trends you\u2019re seeing going into this quarter at the end of last quarter that would change the view about that occupancy drop?", "Raymond Lewis", "Dan, this is Ray. So, you\u2019re right. The occupancy drop is sort of consistent with historical seasonal patterns. NIC did not report the same type of impact. I think when we look across our portfolio, we did push rate pretty strong this year and had some good success with it. So that could have a muted effect on move-ins. Obviously, we had some weather this year that made traffic decline a little bit. We had some more move-outs as a result of the flu season and some higher debt rates in the communities, and those are really I think the contributing factors to the change in occupancy in our portfolio.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "But nothing unusual, nothing kind of the ordinary. All right. One last quick question, I\u2019ll jump off. On the sale of the SNF assets that are now re-leased and came through to other tenants, is that including part of that breakeven of NOI that was quoted in the press release, or is there some additional \u2013 as you reinvest that \u2013 it doesn\u2019t include the reinvestment of those proceeds?", "Raymond Lewis", "No, it does not, but the reinvestment returns on that are not going to be material.", "Operator", "Karin Ford, KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Could you provide us a little more detail on the $100 million that you\u2019ve got under contract for the second quarter and you said it\u2019s not additional hospital acquisitions, but could you just talk about what\u2019s included in that?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah, it\u2019s a couple of investments that are kind of ordinary course, kind of 6% to 7% yield, senior housing and other\u2026", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Senior housing?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "The triple-net portfolio grew same-store NOI over 4% this quarter. That seems above sort of typical normal escalator levels. Can you just talk about what caused the number to be that high?", "Raymond Lewis", "It\u2019s Ray. You\u2019re right. I mean, our triple net portfolio typically grows between 2% to 3% annually and I think as you look forward through the balance of the year, that\u2019s probably where we\u2019re going to end up. We always, as part of our normal course of business are working with our tenants to create win-win solutions which generates fees and other payments for us. We had a few more of those in the first quarter this year. So, 2% to 3% growth accounts for most of it and then some additional fees and rent increases this year.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "How much of it was one-time fee related?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, it\u2019s not one-time, I would say. It\u2019s a ordinary course of our ongoing business and some of that is, as Rick talked about, I think we had some items that might add up to about $0.01. I don\u2019t know if all those were in the triple-net portfolio. They\u2019re kind of across the board, but not more than that.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks. And then last question, I just wanted to get more detail on what you think was driving the pick-up in medical office leasing in the first quarter. Do you think it had something to do with the enrollment surge, the success of the ACA, just what\u2019s driving that?", "Raymond Lewis", "Karin I think you\u2019re right. I think, there feels like, and Todd can talk to this as he\u2019s out talking to the health systems that there\u2019s a lot more optimism about patient flow coming from the ACA and I\u2019ll let Todd talk about that.", "Todd Lillibridge", "Yes Karin this is Todd. I think there\u2019s, believe it or not, little more certainty than there has been over the last 12 to 24 months. The doc fix has obviously been pushed out another 12 months. There continues to obviously be a fair amount of consolidation but, as that consolidation continues to occur and practice, kind of musical chairs as we would call, begin to settle down and practices begin to form larger groups.", "I think we\u2019re seeing, as Ray pointed out, more activity not only on leases executed but also just LOIs issued. So we, on a trailing three quarter basis, we\u2019re seeing more activity today, and we obviously believe it\u2019ll translate into a pickup in occupancy, but I think also as Ray pointed out, we\u2019re also seeing a strong increase in rate at 3%. So, to be able to push rate in this environment, we think is very good. So, we\u2019re optimistic.", "Operator", "Todd Stender, Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Ray, I think you said your rents within the 55 newly released SNF assets in the Kindred portfolio would be fully recovered. Is that over the life of the lease, I just wanted to get a sense of where the rents are relative to where they were?", "Raymond Lewis", "No, Todd. It\u2019s in the first year and it\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s in combination with the transactions that we did with Kindred last year. So you remember Kindred had a $15 million rent increase last year. When you add these transactions together, we are fully replacing the rent that Kindred would have otherwise paid us in 2015.", "Debra Cafaro", "And beyond. I mean, I think\u2026", "Raymond Lewis", "Right, and beyond.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah. So, it\u2019s a very, very favorable outcome.", "Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "I don\u2019t know if I missed this, how many operators are going to be taking over those 55 assets?", "Raymond Lewis", "So, we\u2019ll have eight operators and it\u2019s a mixture of new and existing relationships. Three of them are existing relationships and we\u2019ve got five new relationships so, the benefit of diversification with the added benefit of growing some new relationships.", "Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "How would you stack up the credit, I guess, of these eight operators relative to what Kindred was?", "Raymond Lewis", "Well, Kindred is a large public operator. I would characterize these credits as very consistent with other credits in our portfolio.", "Debra Cafaro", "They\u2019re principally private, regional operators with good in-market presence and good care.", "Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Just wanted to get a sense of the seasonality or potential seasonality I guess with the Atria and Sunrise operating portfolios. As we kind of head into the spring, just since Q1 same-store growth was in the mid-4% range, but according to your guidance, it could get as high as 6%. Just seeing how much of a potential ramp there could be. Any thoughts around that?", "Raymond Lewis", "Well, so when you look at historical seasonal patterns, Todd, the occupancy typically declines through the first quarter into the second quarter and starts to head up through the third quarter, and then sort of plateaus towards the end of the third quarter and stabilizes through the fourth. Those are typical historical patterns if those hold true again this year. That\u2019s what we would expect to see in the occupancy of the portfolio.", "Operator", "Omotayo Okusanya, Jefferies.", "Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies", "In regards to questions, first of all, the senior housing operating platform, just going back to that for a second, when I take a look at just trends for the same-store revenue growth, it\u2019s been slowing somewhat in the past few quarters, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that, whether it\u2019s really the rent growth piece of that or that\u2019s kind of slowing whether it\u2019s the occupancy piece of that, that\u2019s slowing and how we should be thinking about that for the rest of 2014?", "Raymond Lewis", "I mean, I think the historical trend over the last three quarters in the same-store portfolio has been in the mid to high 4% and it\u2019s been fairly stable in that regard. I think, as I\u2019ve said last quarter, we had shifted gears on redevelopment and we\u2019re waiting for some of that redevelopment now to move through the pipeline and come online and I think that\u2019ll provide some acceleration and growth. I think we see, typically as I said, some improvement throughout the year as occupancy ramps historical seasonal patterns and so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. I think our expectation remains 4% to 6% same-store growth this year and we\u2019re comfortable with the guidance we\u2019ve provided.", "Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies", "Which is helpful, I guess, but the numbers I\u2019m looking at \u2013 when I look at \u2013 I 100% agree with everything you\u2019re saying on the same-store total number, but when I just take a look at the same-store stabilized portfolios or just excluding any of the lease up from any of the assets of the stabilized assets, that\u2019s a little bit, what I\u2019m kind of looking at a little closer in regards to revenue \u2013 same-store revenue growth associated with the stabilized assets.", "Raymond Lewis", "Well I guess I would have to get back to you on that, Tayo, because I don\u2019t have that in front of me.", "Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies", "Second question, going back to the U.K., could you just talk a little bit \u2013 I know you made some comments about reimbursement in the U.K. it\u2019s been stable for the past few years, majority of it is NHI or national healthcare program that they have out there, but could you just talk a little bit about just how much of that is private pay in the hospitals that you bought? In regards to your targeting new assets in the country, is it really mostly in your housing you\u2019re looking at. Is it more hospitals you\u2019re looking at or combination of both?", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean I think we are looking at healthcare real estate and senior housing in the U.K. in terms of the private hospitals. Obviously, these are privately owned hospitals. At least half of the revenue base is private and the remainder is funded via a very interesting system they have there, called Choose and Book where you can basically go online and book your knee replacement and the government will fund that to improve the timeliness of treatments that they\u2019re paying to the private hospital providers and so it\u2019s a very good mix, a very good system, yes. So we\u2019re going to have to accelerate here a little bit. I think, Tayo, do you have anything else and then we have time for one or two more questions.", "Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies", "Absolutely, I appreciate it. Just one more question in regards to, again, this has been going on for a couple of months, but there\u2019s still a lot of speculation so to speak about, at some point the big three becomes the big two or even the big one, and there have been a couple of management changes at some of the big three. I mean, Debbie, when you kind of just think about the overall landscape, in your mind, do you still think that world exists where 12 to 24 months from now, we could be talking about the big two or the big one instead?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I would say that in our case, it would be the little ones. What I would respond is that we are constantly reviewing as we\u2019ve talked about here globally, domestically, et cetera any and all opportunities to enhance shareholder value at Ventas, and we think we have a great track record of doing that and we hope to continue that track record. As to any specific expectations, I think it\u2019s best to just move on.", "Operator", "Michael Carroll, RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I just have one quick question. With regard to the U.K. hospital market, what\u2019s the primary growth driver that\u2019s going to allow, I guess, these assets to cover the 3% rent on? Is it through rate or is it through patient volumes?", "Debra Cafaro", "It\u2019s through both.", "Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "So was the inpatients, I guess, rates through the U.K. hospital market; are they similar to the U.S. or are they different?", "Debra Cafaro", "In these hospitals the per day rates are reasonably similar for similar activities.", "Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "So we should see more volume growth in the U.K.?", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean these hospitals are humming. They\u2019re in great areas. They have leading market share and \u2013 are very well regarded, and so we expect to see continued volume expansion.", "John Cobb", "Yeah, we have more than two times cover.", "Operator", "Emmanuel Korchman, Citi.", "Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citi", "If we\u2019re looking at sort of the deal in the U.K., are you \u2013 or maybe if you do a larger deal offshore, how do you think about hedging and would you hedge it or \u2013 are you comfortable with currency risks?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think that, one thing I would say is that both for tax and FX purposes, we have pretty advanced and expert in-house knowledge. We\u2019ve obviously been international since 2007 and we have, again, great international technology that we\u2019ve had for a long time; part of that is FX, and I would expect that we would and have generally hedged either through borrowing and local currency or other kinds of products.", "Hedge about half of the cash flows to mitigate any changes in local currency and where those hedges end up flowing through our income statement can depend on what kind of hedges there are, but net-net, we\u2019re looking at trying to hedge our net kind of normalized FFO regardless of that geography and we would expect to do that with this investment as well.", "Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citi", "Then, staying on the global topic for a second. In the past, you\u2019ve always said that you wanted to get comfortable with the market, get a foothold, small deals followed by bigger deals. Is that likely the way that we should expect you to play in the markets, or if there was a big deal in one of these markets and we spoke about Australia, Canada, U.K., wherever that be, would you do a big deal without being in the market first?", "Debra Cafaro", "If we believe in our investment thesis, I would say that one of the big benefits we\u2019ve had is the capital allocators to be a little bit ahead of the curve, and so, if we\u2019ve done our work and we feel confident in the operator, the market and the investment thesis, we would be willing to do a significant transaction. And we also could use the model that we\u2019re doing in the U.K. where we make kind of a beachhead investment and then look to expand that investment over time. I think we\u2019re confident that we could do either of those models as we target the selected geographies where we think there\u2019s good risk-adjusted return.", "Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citi", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you. There aren\u2019t any further questions and so we\u2019ll wrap up the call on behalf of all my colleagues. I want to thank you sincerely for your continued interest in Ventas and your support of the Company. We look forward to seeing you all soon.

My name is Tahitia, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Lori Wittman, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Lori Wittman", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas' Conference Call to review the company's announcement yesterday regarding its results for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws.

The information being provided today is of this date only and Ventas expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations.", "Please note that the quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com. I will now turn call over to Deborah Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Lori. Good morning. I'd like to echo Lori's welcome to all of our shareholders and other participants and thank you, for joining our call this morning.", "I'm pleased to share our record results for the quarter, introduce our increased guidance for the year and discuss our pending transactions. Following my remarks, Ray Lewis will discuss our portfolio and Rick Schweinheart will review our initial results in detail. As always, we'll then be pleased to answer your questions. Our second quarter financial results showcased the strength of our platform and our ability to continue to grow earnings, cash flow and our dividend, delivering superior results for our shareholders.", "First, let me address some of the highlights of the quarter. Normalized FFO grew 11% to $1.12 per share compared to the second quarter of last year. Our growth resulted from increases in same-store NOI, accretion from acquisitions and receipt of fees and other income. Excluding noncash items, normalized FFO also grew by 11%.", "We continued our long-standing focus on delivering reliable growing cash flow. Cash flow from operations grew 12% this quarter compared to the same period last year to $311 million and is up over 17% year-to-date. This extraordinary growth is due to our strong performance in raising capital effectively, investing capital wisely and managing our assets productively.", "Specifically, our same-store cash flow growth was 4.5% this quarter, and our weighted average cost of debt improved to 3.7%.", "In short, Ventas' financial performance continues to be consistent and outstanding.", "Turning to our investments. I'd like to highlight the benefits of our 2 pending acquisitions, totaling $3.8 billion. One is our acquisition of Holiday Retirements 29 independent living communities; and the second is our pending stock and cash acquisition of American Realty Capital Health Care Trust or HCT. These transactions solidified Ventas' position as the global leader in senior living and medical office buildings.", "I'd like to take some time to review our rationale for these transactions and discuss some of the positive characteristics of the assets and the capital structure for the deal. With these transactions, we are acquiring high-quality assets that are consistent with our strategy.", "The NOI from these assets is 87% private pay. Together, the transaction should provide at least $0.10 accretion to normalized funds from operations and funds available for distribution in 2015, assuming that we issue $1.8 billion of equity at the $67.13 per share valuation currently contemplated under the HCT merger agreement. As a result, these transactions will help us continue to grow cash flows and our dividend.", "The expected unlevered going-in cap rate on these transactions exceeds 6%, which is consistent with market pricing for high-quality private pay health care and senior living assets.", "In total, Holiday and HCT represent $3.8 billion of investments that will be funded with nearly 50% equity and the balance in cash or debt assumption.", "We have a BBB+ credit rating from all 3 rating agencies, and we believe our funding of these deals shows our commitment to retaining an excellent credit profile and rating.", "Continuing our balanced and diversified approach to capital allocation, the combined acquisitions generate 40% of their NOI from triple-net leased properties, 46% from senior housing operating communities and 14% from multi-tenant medical office buildings or MOBs. In terms of stability of cash flows, the triple-net leased portfolio has an average remaining lease term of 12 years and extremely limited near-term rollover.", "Importantly, we are also continuing to build an international business at Ventas, with 5% of our pro forma NOI derived from assets outside the U.S.", "Breaking the HCT and Holiday portfolios down to more granular pieces, here are some other important data points. The HCT portfolio, which is valued at $2.9 billion including its pipeline, is composed of high-quality newer assets that derive the vast majority of their NOI from private pay sources.", "The 4 million square feet of MOBs we're acquiring from HCT, fit our overall MOB strategy and my partner Todd Lillibridge is eager to bring those assets into his MOB fold. Here's why: they are 97% occupied, have average remaining lease terms of 8.3 years and half the buildings were newly constructed in the last 10 years.", "Each of these metrics improves the overall quality of our existing market-leading MOB portfolio. The MOBs are also consistent with our strategy because they are 90% affiliated or on campus with strong hospital sponsorship.", "Credit quality is also strong with, over, 70% of the NOI associated with investment-grade credits.", "In particular, the MOBs are affiliated with leading regional health systems, some of whom are already our clients and others, we are excited to do business with. They include Advocate, Taylor, Memorial Hermann and UC Davis.", "The HCT MOBs average over 50,000 square feet per building and are principally comprehensive or specialty outpatient centers that serve as a central hub for the affiliated health system's care network. They are strategically located to provide the convenience and access necessary for successful population health management.", "Currently, most of HCT's multitenant MOBs are managed by third parties and we see some potential upside to future property management insourcing because of our Lillibridge capabilities and scale. The HCT portfolio of 29 managed senior living assets are operated by 8 respected regional care providers. This portfolio is also high quality, with occupancy approximating 94% and NOI per unit per year of $16,700. It generates REVPOR per month of $4,300.", "These shop statistics compare favorably with NIC data and other wholly private pay portfolios without skilled nursing beds. We also like the local market demographics of the HCT senior living assets. They are in markets with above average concentrations of seniors and high expected growth in that cohort. We expect the NOI in these assets to grow at 4% to 5%.", "Turning to the Holiday assets. These apartment-like 29 independent living communities are also located in markets with exceedingly high percentages of seniors and they have robust median household income. Current occupancy in the portfolio exceeds 90%, and the properties have margins of about 50% and REVPOR of CAD 3,200 per month. The NOI growth rate is also expected to approximate 4% to 5%. We are excited to grow with Atria north of the border and they will take over the management of these Holiday communities at closing.", "In terms of funding and timing, we expect to complete the Holiday acquisition shortly, funded with proceeds of a Canadian dollar denominated bank facility we closed on July 31, and the assumption of mortgage debt. As soon as practicable, we expect to issue Canadian bonds to provide a long-term capital structure for the acquisition.", "We continue to expect to close the HCT acquisition in accordance with its terms probably late in the fourth quarter.", "As previously stated, the HCT transaction will be principally funded with $1.8 billion to $2 billion in Ventas equity, valued at $67.13 a share plus cash and assumed debt. This balanced deal structure is classic Ventas. It protects Ventas' shareholders and the accretion, eliminates equity market risks, fees and discounts; is balance sheet friendly; and allows HCT shareholders to participate in Ventas' future success.", "In sum, we are excited about our pending investments as we continue to build a high-quality reliable, diversified portfolio of productive health care and senior housing assets.", "Looking ahead, we are pleased to increase our full year 2014 normalized FFO guidance to $4.39 to $4.43 per share, as a result of our expected closing on Holiday and our results year-to-date. This guidance, if achieved, would deliver 7% to 8% per share normalized FFO growth over 2013, excluding noncash items. It would also represent the ninth year out of the last 11, when Ventas delivered over 7% per share growth. During that period, we have also grown our dividend at a compound annual rate exceeding 9%, and yet our payout ratio remains an exceptional 67% of normalized FFO per share excluding noncash items. We are confident we can extend our long track record of excellent, consistent performance to produce reliable growing cash flows, dividends, earnings and total return for our shareholders.", "With that, I'm delighted to turn the floor over to Ventas President, Ray Lewis.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Thank you, Debbie. Same-store cash NOI in our diversified portfolio of seniors housing, medical office and post-acute properties grew by 4.5% in the second quarter and delivered strong growth across the board.", "Let me start with our seniors housing operating portfolio, operated by Atria and Sunrise. This high-quality private pay portfolio now stands at 239 total properties and produced $125 million of NOI in the quarter, an increase of 13.5% versus the prior year.", "Results were driven by strong performance in the 198 properties in our same-store stable U.S. portfolio, which was up 6.6% year-over-year and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by declining performance in our 12 Sunrise Canadian communities. Occupancy in the total portfolio averaged 90.3% in the quarter compared to senior housing occupancy in the 31 primary markets, as reported by NIC, of 89.9% and our REVPOR was 60% higher.", "NOI for the 218 properties in our total same-store portfolio increased 4.8% year-over-year in local currency, driven by a 2.7% increase in REVPOR. As a point of comparison, NIC annual rent growth for all seniors housing in the 31 primary markets was 1.8% year-over-year.", "NOI growth in our 210 same-store stabilized properties was a solid 5.2% year-over-year in local currency. Rates were up 2.6% and margins improved 90 basis points.", "During the quarter, we transitioned the management of 2 U.S. senior housing communities to Atria from Sunrise, pursuant to the terms of our Sunrise agreements. As we have told you in the past, we have been increasing the pace of our redevelopment activity over the past few quarters. We had 9 properties under redevelopment in the second quarter of 2014 versus 2 properties in 2013. More importantly, we had approximately 140 more units off-line during the second quarter versus the same period of last year.", "We now have $116 million of projects under construction at 8% to 12% unlevered yields. These investments represent an excellent risk-adjusted return, and we expect them to enhance our growth rate as they come online.", "Construction as a percentage of inventory reported by NIC declined for the third straight quarter and stood at 3.2% across all seniors housing types in the 31 primary markets.", "Our shop portfolio continues to be better than NIC trends, with construction as a percentage of inventory at 2.6% in the 3-mile trade area around our buildings.", "NIC continues to project that absorption would be positive through the next 4 quarters.", "With our expected acquisition of 29 seniors housing properties from Holiday, we are pleased to provide updated shop NOI guidance of $512 million to $520 million. Next, I'll cover our triple-net lease portfolio, which is diversified across 906 seniors housing, skilled nursing and hospital assets and accounts for 54% of our NOI.", "Same-store cash NOI for the 841 properties that we owned in the second quarter of 2014 and 2013, was up 4.9% year-over-year. Growth was driven by contractual escalations and active portfolio management, including renewals, negotiated rent increases and fees. Cash flow coverage in the 735 properties in our same-store triple-net lease portfolio for the first quarter of 2014, the latest available information, was strong and stable at 1.6x.", "Looking forward, we recently received good news from CMS that SNF and LTAC Medicare reimbursements are set to increase 2% and 1.1%, respectively, in the next fiscal year.", "We are also ramping up redevelopment in our triple-net lease portfolio. We now have about $50 million of triple-net redevelopment projects under construction at an average yield over 8%, and have another $40, that we have approved. Another important feature of these attractive investments is that our lease payments increased as we fund construction, so we can drive growth and improve portfolio quality at the same time.", "Before I move on to MOBs, I'll provide a brief update on the re-leasing of the 108 properties leased to Kindred that expire on September 30 of this year. We have now leased, transitioned or sold 103 buildings and the remaining 5 facilities are on track to be transitioned or sold by year end. Upon completion, we expect that we will have fully replaced the expiring rent for 2015 and further diversified our income stream with good regional operators. I'd like to congratulate our asset management and legal teams for another outstanding releasing outcome. With the releasing of the Kindred portfolio, our weighted average lease maturity is now 8.6 years and rent from triple-net leases expiring before 2018 is less than 3% of our current annualized NOI.", "So the triple-net portfolio continues to deliver reliable and growing cash flows.", "Finally, I'd like to briefly discuss Ventas' portfolio of 275 consolidated medical office properties, spanning over 15 million square feet and accounting for 15% of our annualized NOI.", "Here are a few of the MOB segment highlights for the second quarter. For the total portfolio, NOI was $72.3 million and occupancy was a very healthy 91.7%.", "Most importantly, cash NOI in the 263 same-store consolidated medical office buildings increased 3.8% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 3.2% increase in rate and a 100-basis point increase in margin.", "Sequentially, total same-store occupancy increased by 10 basis points over the first quarter to 91.7%. Same-store stable occupancy was a strong 93%, consistent with the first quarter. Leasing activity remained strong and our retention rate in the second quarter was 80%.", "So we continue to lease space, push rates, manage expenses and drive bottom line growth in our MOB portfolio. Since we acquired Lillibridge in 2010, we have more than tripled our MOB portfolio and scaled our market-leading Lillibridge operating platform. As part of our ongoing portfolio management and capital recycling activities, we are currently bringing a portfolio of nonstrategic MOBs to market.", "We expect to generate around $200 million in proceeds from the sale.", "So during the second quarter, our balance and diversified portfolio delivered strong performance across-the-board, and we are tracking towards the high end of our original same-store cash NOI growth range of between 3% and 4% in 2014.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart, who will discuss our financial results. Rick?", "Richard A. Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. Cash flows from operations during the second quarter of 2014 were $311 million, up 12% from the second quarter of 2013.", "During the quarter, we raised $700 million through the issuance of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.75% and a weighted average maturity of 7 years. The proceeds funded almost $200 million, representing the cash portion of investments in the quarter, CapEx, development and redevelopment and $188 million of mortgage prepayments, with the balance used to reduce the revolver. The mortgage debt prepaid was at a weighted average cash interest rate of 5.9% and a GAAP rate of 4.1%.", "Normalized FFO was $1.12 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of 11% compared to the second quarter of 2013 per share results of $1.01. Normalized FFO increased 11% to $332 million compared to $298 million for the second quarter of 2013.", "Normalized FFO increased due to improvement in all 3 segments, the impact of accretive investments completed in 2014 and 2013 and fees and other income totaling less than $0.02 per share. This strong performance was partially offset by the dilutive impact of asset sales and loan repayments we received in 2013 and 2014 and an increase in G&A.", "Our fully diluted share count increased less than 1% in the second quarter of 2014 to $296.5 million compared to the same period in 2013.", "Our average cash interest rate improved 40 basis points to 3.7% at June 30, 2014, compared to June 30, 2013.", "And we have been able to maintain our weighted average debt maturity at nearly 7 years. At quarter end, our credit statistics remained outstanding with a net debt to pro forma EBITDA at 5.5x, our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 4x and secured debt to enterprise value of 8%.", "At quarter end, our revolver balance was $179 million, and our debt-to-enterprise value was an outstanding 34%.", "The company timely filed its second quarter 2014 10-Q yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The 10-Q and our second quarter and year-to-date 2014 results, as well as the comparable 2013 periods, have been reviewed by our new independent auditors, KPMG.", "KPMG continues to reaudit the company's 2012 and 2013 financial statements. We expect KPMG's work to be successfully completed by September 30.", "We are increasing our 2014 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance range to between $4.39 and $4.43, an increase from our previously announced 2014 guidance range of $4.31 to $4.37 per diluted share.", "Our guidance, if achieved, represents 7% to 8% per share growth excluding noncash items estimated at $0.12 per share.", "Our new guidance range includes the net accretive impact of our Holiday investment that we expect to complete shortly, but excludes any impact from the HCT acquisition. Our guidance does not include the impact of additional unannounced capital transactions or acquisitions or dispositions.", "In summary, we had an excellent quarter and we are well positioned to deliver positive results for the balance of the year. Debbie?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Rick. I did want to take a minute before we open the floor to questions just to comment on our outstanding roster of very successful tenants and operators. And in particular, I wanted to congratulate Andy Smith and his team at Brookfield on their recent completion of the Emeritus merger. We wish Brookfield, who is now our largest tenant, every continued success. And we'd also like to congratulate our new U.K. hospital tenant, Spire on its highly successful IPO. Spire now has over $1 billion equity market capitalization and its business is thriving with a balance payor mix and strong cash flow. Operator, please open the floor to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "For the U.S. RIDEA portfolio, when do you expect the impacts that have kind of held back the same-store growth to wear off? And should we be expecting any sort of reacceleration into 2015?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Juan, this is Ray. As I mentioned in the script, we've got about 140 more units off-line at this time this year than we had last year. Those units will be coming back online over the next several quarters and should help our growth rate, but we will also be continuing to execute on our redevelopment program. So the thing to watch for is the change in redevelopment, over time, as we ramp up or scale back the redevelopment pursuant to opportunities that we're seeing in the market.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And what's the underlying issues behind the weakness in the same-store assets in Canada? And are we close to those assets troughing? And how should we think about growth going forward there?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "So we've got 12 properties in Canada that are operated by Sunrise and account for about 5% of our seniors housing operating NOI. The decline in performance is driven entirely by the Sunrise management at the communities. These properties used to be top performers in our portfolio and we think that they can be top performers again, but there's been significant turnover at Sunrise in Canada in both the regional and property level staff and that's just impacted the performance of these properties across-the-board. There's new staff in place and we'll be looking for that improvement -- those properties to improve going forward and so that's what our expectations are.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And I noticed you include the incremental dispositions for the back half of the year. Could you give us any color on what assets you're looking to dispose of and the yield expectations there? And anything on timing?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. We're looking at a portfolio of nonstrategic MOBs and because the market is so strong, we thought it would be a good time to put together a portfolio of those and bring it to market. And we would expect a fairly sporty pricing on those in the kind of 6-ish plus or minus range.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And just the last one for me. On the dividend, Debbie, you noted the 67% payout. Do you think that the company or the board would look to maybe readdress the payout ratio in the second half of the year, or is that likely something to be reassessed in 2015?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. Well, the board obviously makes a dividend decision every quarter. Ventas' history has really been a fantastic one in this regard, which is to have above average dividend growth, a very favorable payout ratio that makes the dividend both secure and have room for future improvement. And we'd love to be able to continue that pattern because we think it's a very important part of the overall total return proposition we offer to shareholders.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Ray, maybe we can just go back to Canada for a moment just because, I guess, that the confidence obviously you're attributing it predominantly to Sunrise. Do you not think that there's anything going on, Canada overall, in terms of being able to have confidence to do the large acquisition of Holiday? What sort of diligence sort of did you go through because when you look at the Sunrise stats for the 12 assets that you have, I mean, this has not been like a 1 quarter thing. You go back to the fourth quarter of '12, occupancy was over 93% and each quarter it's gone down. I'm just trying to think about the remedies that you have or at what point you can start pushing your manager or be a little bit more asset-management intensive versus it just being a Canadian problem?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Michael, this is Debbie. Just -- I'll take at least one part of that question and I think the most important part. In looking at the Holiday assets that we're acquiring, we've done extensive diligence and these assets have had a good history of NOI growth and are performing very well during the same time period that we've seen the deterioration in the 12 Sunrise assets. We do think that the Sunrise performance is company/manager specific, and we do think that those assets are good assets in good markets that can return to optimal performance in the future. And that's what we are focused on.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I mean the currency has obviously played a part and...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, that's true. That is true. And so that's the other thing, we are -- about 1/3 of that performance differential is based on FX changes because we do report in U.S. dollars at whatever the then current exchange rate is and that does result in some fluctuations on the NOI line. That impact is somewhat mitigated by Canadian dollar borrowings that we have, but that's below the NOI line. But we're very consistent about reflecting FX impacts as the exchange rate changes and that's an important transparency that we bring to our reporting.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "But I guess more broadly in terms of just working with operators, at what point where -- arguably they're operating the assets. At what point in this process in Canada were you getting frustrated, again, because it's been about 1.5 years already of consistent occupancy declines and flattish REVPOR, so I'm just curious how should we think about your asset management, not only for Canada but just in general, in terms of when you see weakness how do you react and what you do?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Well, I mean I think, first of all, we have very good relationships with our operators, and we work with them to try to collaboratively solve problems as they arise in our portfolio from time to time. We also have excellent management contracts that have protective rights, as you know, and when these rights are triggered we evaluate whether we think another operator could do a better job with the assets and what the risk of transitioning those assets is. And so I think in the case of Canada, we look at it and say, they've got new leadership in place. It will likely take some while to understand whether or not that leadership is going to be effective in turning around the assets, and we'll be watching it very closely over the next several quarters.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just last question just general about international. Debbie, you talked about in your opening remarks a growing international business, you called it 5%, I believe, pro forma post-Holiday and the acquisitions. I guess how do you think about where you want to take that percentage? What do you think the right sort of breakdown is if you thought about building a diversity across product type? Is there a certain diversity that you want globally in terms of ex-U.S.?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We don't have a target international percentage that we're looking toward at the moment. I think we're trying to get comfortable in making investments in markets where we believe there are outstanding policy, demographic or other reasons, where we think we can get an appropriate risk-adjusted return and I think we found that in certain cases, certainly with the Spire acquisition in the UK as our beachhead investment and then again, with the Holiday investment that we're doing now. Over time, I would expect -- assuming that we are successful as we make these incremental investments, I would assume that we would grow in the U.K. and Canada in specific asset types, and I do think it is an important extension of our growth and diversification strategy that we've executed very successfully over the last 10 to 15 years.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Here with Jack as well. Quick question, just on the RIDEA portfolio, overall, I think previously you guys have talked about a 4% to 6% same-store growth. I didn't see that in the release, so just curious if you guys were confirming that? And then, I guess with the inclusion of Holiday expected as you mentioned shortly, what would be the contribution from Holiday within that portfolio?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "So the same-store growth assumption that's embedded in our updated guidance is about 4% to 5%. And then I think we've said that we would expect -- or that Holiday would close before September 1, and so there's probably 4 months of Holiday contribution in that guidance number.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And what's Holiday on sort of a same store? What's their NOI growth looking like?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We've talked about our expectations being in the 4% to 5% range.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So also in the 4% to 5% range.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "This is Jack here too. I just want to touch on construction one more time and if there's anything specific in any of your markets you could point out? And maybe just a little bit more specifically, if we look at the markets 6 through 10, it looks like there's a little bit more exposure there, and -- I'm just really trying to parse out when it shows up? And then if it's showing up on the occupancy side or some sort of pressure on rate?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I mean, we're not seeing any significant amount of pressure from new construction in our portfolio. As we said, our portfolio in general has a better construction as a percentage of inventory statistics than NIC and even in markets where there is more construction, our properties are generally outperforming the NIC averages in those markets. So I think it speaks to the quality of our portfolio in terms of the assets, the operators and the locations.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one housekeeping thing. With Kindred, the expectation, the 5 that are remaining, if it does go past October 1, is it full rent, or is it half rent beyond that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. It's full rent through the end of the year and there's a period of time, should anything stretch over, that could be at half rent. So it's a very kind of collaborative arrangement that we reached with Kindred.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Nick Yulico from UBS.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "On the triple-net portfolio, can you explain what items caused the same-store NOI growth to be 4.9%, which is pretty high? I think you mentioned some fees -- rent increases?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes. So fees and rent renegotiations are a normal part of our business. We're proactive asset managers and we're always looking for opportunities to drive value in our portfolio. As you mentioned, our same-store portfolio grew 4.9% in the quarter. More typically, growth is around 3%. So I mean, clearly we had a good quarter, driven by our ability to generate some fee income during the quarter.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And was any of this related to the Kindred portfolio?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "No.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "No.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then going back to, I think you mentioned fees and other income equaling less than $0.02 in the quarter. I think $0.01 of that was a loan repayment. What was the other fees were in this triple-net segment?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "From time to time we have operators that come to us and need certain consents or changes to the documents and those create opportunities for us to improve our position in a lease or generate fees, so it's that type of activity.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "But again, the lion's share of it is really fundamental, which is improvement in rents, escalations, upward roll-ups in rent on maturities, things like that. That's the vast majority of it.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then going back to the dispositions, you mentioned there's $200 million MOB portfolio sale. I think you said you expect around a 6 cap rate on that, is that right?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, in the 6-ish range, I mean, obviously the market will be the market but we feel good about the bids that we're seeing on MOBs and so we think this will be very attractive.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And then how should we think about that portfolio relative to the rest of your MOB portfolio? I mean, is this lower occupancy, is it older quality, I mean what is this...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's not -- it's nonstrategic to the portfolio. Again, I think we're taking the opportunity that we want to be more proactive on in terms of recycling capital and taking advantage of market conditions when we can and using that capital to redeploy into our business strategy.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "But it really is mixed by age, by geography, by size and relationships with the hospital systems probably more than anything, which are not strategic.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. I guess my question was whether these all -- at all, similarly -- you mentioned strong pricing, that this is to some regards a lower quality MOB portfolio, the rest of your MOB portfolio pricing would be sub-6 cap rate or something if that's part of the...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It would. I think it absolutely would be sub-6. There's no question about that and so -- yes, but we think these -- again, we'll command a very strong bid out in the marketplace because they are good assets, they are just not strategic to our Lillibridge business.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last question is on the senior housing segment, I mean, your report -- the same-store you report stabilized. Can you remind us that -- I mean, when you're doing these redev communities is it an entire community, or are you doing a portion of the units? And how does that difference affect whether the assets are in a stabilized versus the overall same-store?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. Great question because they're all a little bit different and I'll ask Ray to describe what we do.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, I mean, there's -- projects can range from $1 million to $20 million plus and depending upon the scale of the project there may be more or less units off-line in a particular building. Sometimes, it's just as simple as upgrading the common areas and sometimes we're going through and redoing entire wings of the building or taking units off-line to add a life guidance. So it really is going to depend upon what the opportunity in that building and that market is. With respect to when we move it into redevelopment, it's really when the significant redevelopment is underway and the project is getting ready to come back online, it will be in a lease up mode.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. So I mean there is some judgment involved but generally if it's a major project and there's going to be some disruption and -- of one kind or another and that is underway, we would put it in redevelopment. But it's not little ticky tacky things.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Right.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It's major projects when they are under way.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities.", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "So just -- why did the -- more or less what was the factor for the same-store NOI growth target for the shop portfolio coming down, call it like a 0.5%, relative to last quarter?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I mean, I think you've got Canada in their...", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So it's mainly a Canada thing?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes. May be a Canada thing.", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then speaking of Canada, you mentioned this is all a company-specific event and hopefully getting fixed. Do you have an estimate that, if it is the case, do you have an estimate of how far below market rents are right now, in those 12 assets?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I don't think it is much a rent issue as it is occupancy and managing expenses. I think the rents are actually reasonably good in that market. I think it's really more increasing the occupancy, as Michael noted previously, in managing expenses in particular, which have increased over the last couple of quarters. So that I think points to that management more than anything. The rates might point to the quality of the markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And do you think that there's anything about the new version of Sunrise, management-only business owned by one of your peers, HCN partially? You think that there's anything about that new model of theirs that is impacting their management style?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, I think that it's obvious that there's been significant change -- multiple changes in the executive level management and ownership at the company and that inevitably has an impact on focus between selling the company and changing owners and changing leadership. And so I think it's really needing a renewed focus in these 12 assets and hopefully Sunrise' executive leadership now is in place and stable and they are going to bring these assets back to their historical performance, which again, was quite good. I mean, these used to be 94%, 95% occupied and we're the top performers in the portfolio. So there's no reason that the assets can't achieve that level again and it just is going to take some focus from executive management and we are working with them to bring that focus.", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And when you bought Sunrise REIT in 2007, there were 63 other assets in the U.S. Is there any impact there, or are those just kind of churning along just fine?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I mean, I think if you look at the performance of our U.S. portfolio, and there are 81 other Sunrise assets in our U.S. portfolio, it's performed very well across the board and I would say Sunrise's is holding up their end there.", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then last question, kind of big picture. You're growing the medical office portfolio by about 30% with HCT, assuming that closes. Have you given any thought about -- I came up, I have to talk a little bit about spin-cos and thought, you mentioned below 5% or below 6 cap rate for the rest of your MOB portfolio. You think that someday you might consider something along those lines to kind of break it up and see what the MOB portfolio is worth on its own.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, we definitely will always look at opportunities to create value for our shareholders, whatever those opportunities may be and whatever the market is indicating, we should be doing to create value. I do think we have assembled an unbelievable enterprise and company that has some characteristics of reliable cash flow growth and diversified asset class, diversified tenant base, et cetera and given that we are sort of 1/3 health care; 1/3 real estate; 1/3 finance there is a tremendous benefit to scale and diversification. And we would think long and hard before we would basically break up what we think is a very, very well performing, very high-quality enterprise. That said, again, we're all about creating value for shareholders and we will hopefully always make decisions that accomplish that.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "First question just on the investment pipeline. Can you just characterize any changes in that from a volume and both sort of bigger size deals and smaller deals and asset classes. Have you guys had to pass on any deals recently as a result of the reaudit?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Good question. No, the pipeline is good. I think again our asset type, we have a huge domestic market. I think we continue to see good deal flow both here and abroad and we want to be -- we have $3.8 billion sort of under contract and pending, so we are excited about that. And as we move forward we'll continue to be prudent, but I would expect us to continue to be able to grow accretively and strategically and we just want to make sure we're continuing to show good discipline and continue to build value for shareholders at what we acquire.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great. And just another question on the guidance. The 3.5% to 4% same-store NOI guidance for the total portfolio, what was that in the previous guidance? And does the new normalized guidance include the cost of the reaudit?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The 3.5% to 4%, it just really means that we're -- we believe we are going to end up in the high range of our original 3% to 4% same-store total company cash flow growth which is very outstanding, I would add, and I think stacks up well, across the REIT space. And in terms of the reaudits, we did say that, that would be excluded from normalized FFO because, clearly, it's an unusual event that is not really core to our cash flow and earnings production.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And then just last question. Can you give us an update on the search for the new CFO?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The search is continuing on. I'm very happy to have my colleague, Mr. Schweinhart here to ensure that the reaudits are expeditiously and successfully completed and to ensure that we have a smooth transition. We are continuing the search and would expect to provide an update as soon as we have one.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Quick question on the acquisition front. When you guys did that HCT deal, there was a lot of talk around HCT being a front runner for the Griffin-America portfolio. That ultimately went to NorthStar. I'm just kind of curious, the dynamics numbers around that and why -- whether you were interested in that portfolio at all or whether it just didn't make sense for you and kind of what the dynamics around that large portfolio being in the market but it going to a competitor of yours.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, we really like the assets that we are acquiring for all the reasons stated, which I won't repeat. I would tell you that the Griffin NorthStar deal is one that really validates the pricing that we have talked about and what pricing there is out there in the marketplace. And it also validates the idea that there continue to be plenty of high-quality assets in our space that are available to fuel continued external growth.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "But it sounds like there were assets you also like, the pricing seemed like what you expected on that portfolio, or it would seem like it's something that you could have competed very effectively for though? Was there any interest on your end, or did -- the deal just didn't make sense from your end given some of your other strategic objectives?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Again, we are focused on all the reasons that we acquired the portfolios that we are acquiring and we really like those and again, we congratulate NorthStar on their acquisition and again, believe that we're in a terrific market to continue to grow.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's fine Debbie. Then the HCT transaction, it sounds like you're still very confident about it closing in fourth quarter. But just again, curious why you decided not to include it in guidance. Is it just because you're not sure about the timing when it could occur in the fourth quarter?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, Holiday's is imminent and we have already funded the debt for that, so it seemed appropriate since we have better visibility into Holiday to include that in guidance at this point. The timing on HCT is more variable and also, really, even if it does close at the end of the fourth quarter, let's call it, that would have very limited impact on 2014, anyways. So this just seems like the best way to provide the best guidance to our investors.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just one more for me, I appreciate the patience. The shop portfolio, could you just talk a little bit about initial trends you're seeing in the third quarter kind of around July, that data in particular?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, good question. But I'm not going to steal Ray's thunder, so let him answer that.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Thanks, Tayo. As you know, the occupancy trends tend to decline in the first quarter and into the second quarter, and then pick up again as we emerge into the third quarter. And we're seeing those trends continue this year in our portfolio. It's also important to note that there are a number of expenses that are sort of backend-loaded in the portfolio typically. It's a little early to sort of say whether or not those are going to materialize, but we always have repairs and maintenance and paint and paper, some vacation expenses and other things that are loaded towards the back end of the year and so right now it seems like traditional historical seasonal patterns are holding.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right. But occupancy is trending up.", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Occupancy is trending up. Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions here. Just speaking with the same-store NOI guidance increase. Though we're tracking towards the high end of the range it does seem to imply some deceleration from the 2Q level and to some degree, the 1H level. We've already talked about the triple-net portfolio maybe indexing a little bit higher than it normally would. I'm just curious on the fee side of things is that something that you typically wouldn't sort of project going forward? And is that where some of that deceleration is coming from? And really, just to trying to get some understanding of what the visibility is on those fees?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Good. Yes, those kinds of upticks of all types, whether they're rent renegotiations or so on, are difficult to predict so we don't typically model them. I think we're -- so the quarters can be variable but I do think we're very excited that we think our overall business is going to generate in the top end of that original 3% to 4% same-store cash growth, and we're glad that all segments are contributing to that. So we just think of -- we don't think of it as -- we don't think of this as accelerating, we think of it as somewhat unpredictable and lumpy. So we view the full year as the true test of what our business is delivering.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's fair. Is there anything there that's sort of causing the uplift here in the last couple of quarters? That you can point ...", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, we've just had good quarters. I mean, and hopefully we'll continue to have good quarters, so that's what we try to do. That's the management value-added that we try to bring to the business.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's fair. Just maybe switching over to shop side of things. I know that the overall range was brought in a little bit, sounds like Canada is sort of the culprit here. But looking at the OpEx growth, it does look like it was pretty limited this quarter. You mentioned some expenses increasing in the back half but just curious, on a year-over-year basis would you expect those OpEx trends to go back up to sort of the -- maybe more inflationary level 2%-ish range and then to hit the guidance does that suggest that you do think that the revenue side will also tick up commensurately?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "Yes, I mean, I think revenue will probably tick up as occupancy increases, rates are generally projected to be flat to slightly down in the second half. And then operating expenses will increase in the second half as I described. I think it's our expectation and so yes, they would probably trend more towards that inflationary level.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just last one for me. On the dispositions I think I heard that -- you say that they're being marketed. Are they in the market today, or are they just getting ready to be put on the market? And what do you think timing-wise when we should see those close?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. Any day now they'll be in the market and the timing would be late in the year, presumably, for execution.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Debbie, a question for you just in terms of how you think about cost of capital when you\u2019re thinking about the couple of large transactions that you guys have pending right now. And just when the circumstance is such that your implied cap rate on our stock is roughly similar to the initial yield on the transactions you're entering into, just curious I think about that from a capital allocation standpoint obviously, you guys are generating some earnings accretion, so just curious about how do you think about all those?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We're very focused on our long-term cost to capital and the fact that we do need to finance things on a long-term basis with a significant equity component and we believe that our job is to continue to grow cash flows with limited risk and a strong balance sheet and so we've been able to do that over an extended period of time. And we do believe also that, frankly, our cost of equity is not reflecting the value of our assets in some ways in the marketplace, and I think you're seeing that in pricing. So I do think that this transaction, or both transactions that we're entering into, are good for our cash flow, our growth rate, the quality of our portfolio and I feel very good about how we're financing them in a very -- I think, a very thoughtful and balanced way.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then a question for you on CapEx, maybe this is for Ray as well, but I'm just curious, I think about this -- on the shop portfolio it looks like your spending about 15% of NOI on CapEx but yet this quarter that NOI stream grew slower than the triple-net business line, just curious how you think about those NOI growths on an after CapEx basis?", "Raymond J. Lewis", "I mean, Michael, I would say that within any one particular quarter, because the nature of CapEx spending is going to be sort of lumpy, you're going to see that relationship move up and down. I think if you look at it over time, we think that the better growth rates that you get from the shop assets compensate for the additional CapEx that you invest in the buildings over time relative to a triple-net lease portfolio, and I think that we believe that holds true.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "When we underwrite these assets, we obviously do it on a before and after CapEx basis, so we look at growth rates and then we look at variability in the cash flows or -- how you would assess those? I think the key point that is important to make is that those assets are the highest quality assets, essentially, in our portfolio and so they again would command a very sporty cap rate that would likely be under 6% even before CapEx. And so you can't really compare a yield on a triple-net lease asset and a shop asset unless they are identical assets. And so I think you have to be careful about how you think about that. But we do always look at growth and return on a before and after CapEx basis.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just, couple more quick ones for me. Just to clarify on the acquired -- or to the acquired senior living assets, I think you mentioned 4% to 5% NOI growth. What timeframe are you taking about that expectation? Is that, just say, 2014 or '15, or is that intermediate term beyond that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, I would call the kind of immediate to intermediate term. So 1 to 3 years, call it.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then last one for me. We haven't talked about skilled nursing on this call, I was just curious if you have any view on how that's performing? It seems like the environment is pretty benign, which seems pretty good. And then just curious, there is also word, at least from the Omega call a couple of weeks ago about a possible 1 billion dollar deal out there. I'm just curious if that's a segment of your portfolio that you would look to grow at all at attractive pricing?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I'm glad you asked about that. I mean we, as part of our balanced and diversified approach, we have always thought that skilled nursing is an asset type that is an important part of the healthcare delivery system for seniors and that well done, well underwritten, well operated, with coverage, it can be a very good asset class to own. Our portfolio of government reimbursed assets has about a 65% quality mix, so we have a very, very high-quality post-acute portfolio and again, I think what we are seeing is that there is a stability in that marketplace and that yields for a high-quality portfolio like we have are a lot lower i.e. values are a lot higher than people are typically ascribing to that portfolio. So we like our post-acute business. We think it's very high quality and under the right circumstances we would consider investing in the asset class, but obviously only with a top operator with good coverage and a yield that we thought was appropriate for the long-term risk and cyclicality of the asset type and reimbursement.", "Okay. So operator, I think with that we're going to close the call and I want to once again thank everyone for their time and attention. And I'm sure everyone's thrilled that earning season is coming to a close and we appreciate the time you spent with us this morning and we look forward to seeing you first thing in September. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Mark, and I'll be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Lori Wittman, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.", "Lori Wittman", "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today, regarding its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2014.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These projections, predictions and statements are based on management's current beliefs, as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events. The forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and contingencies, and stockholders and others should recognize that actual events may differ materially from the company's expectations, whether expressed or implied.", "We refer you to the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and the company's other reports filed periodically with the SEC for a discussion of these forward-looking statements and other factors that could affect these forward-looking statements.", "Many of these factors are beyond the control of the company and its management. The information provided today is as of this date only and Ventas expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations.", "Please note that the quantitative reconciliation between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now turn call over to Deborah A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Lori. And let me repeat to all of our shareholders and other participants a warm welcome for joining us this morning for our third quarter 2014 earnings call. It's great to be here with you to discuss our excellent third quarter results and share our continued growth and progress on numerous fronts, including closed and pending transactions. After Ray Lewis and Rick Schweinhart complete their remarks, we'll be happy to answer your questions.", "Our strong performance showcases Ventas' sustained ability to provide growth to our investors and to our customers. We delivered superior results on a repeatable basis, because of our dedicated team, our deep knowledge of healthcare and senior living, our diversified productive portfolio and our expansive base of leading care providers. These characteristics position Ventas for continued success and value creation.", "First, let me recap a few highlights. We achieved record normalized FFO for the quarter of $1.12 per share, 9% growth over the third quarter of last year, excluding non-cash items. We are also delighted to increase our full-year normalized FFO guidance, because of our excellent results to date and our expectations for the final quarter of 2014.", "Stepping back to look at our larger enterprise, Ventas annualized revenue for the quarter exceeded $3 billion and our adjusted annualized net operating income or NOI totaled nearly $1.9 billion. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain outstanding. Pro forma for HCT, our annualized NOI is approximately $2 billion.", "In addition to driving outstanding results, the Ventas team turned in an incredibly productive quarter and achieved many significant goals. Among them, we closed the Holiday Retirement acquisition for CAD957 million and transition management of these 29 independent living communities to Atria.", "This is our second deal with Holiday and was favorably priced, given the high quality of the assets, which are over 90% occupied and located in attractive local market in seven Canadian provinces. These assets performed well in September, the first full month after closing.", "We also completed over $250 million in additional investments since July 1, at an average yield of just under 7%. The acquired assets are principally triple-net leased and managed senior living assets operated by existing customers. We filed our 2012 and 2013 reaudited financial result, including KPMG's independent audit opinion, which confirmed and reiterated the accuracy of our previously reported results.", "We completed the largest REIT fixed income deal in Canada, raising a total of CAD650 million at an effective rate of 3.5% at an average maturity of seven years. We filed our proxy for our pending $2.9 billion acquisition of HCT.", "We paid a dividend of $0.7250 per share, representing a 65% FFO payout ratio. Our strong divided payout ratio and record of 9% compound annual dividend growth for 10 years is an important component of our total return proposition for shareholders and a significant differentiating factor for Ventas.", "We were proud to appoint a new independent board member, Melody Barnes, who served our nation as the Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. Our full board continues to represent our shareholders with integrity, commitment, experience and independence.", "And we were excited to hire our new CFO, Bob Probst, who will begin at Ventas next week. Bob has an exceptional record of success at every stage of his 25-year career. And we know he will bring energy, a new perspective and a commitment to excellence to Ventas.", "Year-to-date, we've closed about $1.5 billion in acquisitions at nearly a 7% yield. Importantly, over 85% of our year-to-date investments represent follow-on business with existing relationships, and the balance was our first investment in the U.K. with respected hospital operator, Spire.", "At Ventas, we pride ourselves on helping our customers grow. I'd like to take a few minutes to give you some powerful examples.", "One of our recent acquisitions is a $110 million investment in seven senior living properties operated by Milestone Retirement Communities under a triple-net lease. Milestone is a high-quality regional operator, who became a Ventas customer via one asset we acquired with the NHP merger. The latest traction is just one small example of how we work with our existing customers to help them grow.", "As we have gotten to know Milestone's management and observe the quality of care they provide and strong operating results they deliver, we have expanded our business relationship with the company in a series of transactions from one to 12 communities. In total, we've committed $200 million of incremental capital to help Milestone grow, and our recent investment should produce over an 8% unlevered return to Ventas. Milestone is thriving and now operates 22 senior housing communities.", "Similarly, since we acquired the real estate assets of Atria in 2011, its business has expanded by 50% from 118 to 183 communities, and Atria has extended its brand into the attractive Canadian market. We have invested an additional $1.8 billion of capital to help Atria, one of the highest quality providers of senior care in the country continue to grow.", "Avamere is a similar success story. This high-quality Pacific Northwest provider of post-acute care and senior living was a client we shared with NHP at the time of our merger. We owned 28 buildings with Avamere at that time. Since then, we've added 10 buildings and funded a significant redevelopment project to help Avamere grow and position itself as a provider of choice in its market, as it pursues thoughtful strategies for bundled payments and increasing its managed care mix.", "Another way we are committed to helping our customers succeed is by making additional investments in our portfolio. As Ray will discuss in greater detail, we have $188 million in development and redevelopment projects underway with existing tenant operators.", "Turning to our acquisition of HCT, we are very pleased that our acquisition remains on target for a late fourth quarter closing. With an equity component totaling $1.8 billion to $2 billion of the total $2.9 billion acquisition cost, we believe the transaction is balance sheet friendly, contains a reliable equity funding source and provides an attractive opportunity for HCT shareholders to become long-term Ventas shareholders.", "We believe that HCT acquisition will contribute positively to our portfolio of high-quality diversified assets and consistent growing cash flow, and provide new relationships for us to foster and expand. With the HCT acquisition, we will add 10 new senior living operators to our existing customer base, and over 20 new health systems to our MOB relationships, including Baylor and Memorial Hermann.", "Taking a page from our NHP playbook, we will work hard to earn the confidence of our new tenant operators and affiliated health systems, and intend to commit capital to help them expand and grow their businesses. We expect to fund the balance of the HCT deal on favorable terms. The debt capital market continue to be attractive, consistent with our view that interest rates may stay persistently low in the near-to-intermediate term.", "Following HCT closing, as we told you last quarter, we expect to sell a pool of non-strategic MOBs, as a partial funding source for the HCT deal. We will continue to identify candidates for disposition in 2015, as a way to recycle capital, take advantage of favorable market conditions and optimize our portfolio.", "Not only do we have great relationships, we have amassed a fantastic portfolio that is second to none. We are the largest owner of medical office buildings or MOBs in the nation, and our leading MOB platform contains 15 million owned and 5 million managed square feet. Our owned MOB portfolio in 96% on campus or affiliated with hospital system, and over 80% of our MOB NOI is associated with single-A or better rated health system and leading hospital company HCA.", "In addition, Ventas recently ranked as the largest owner of senior living in the 2014 ASHA 50 list, and this segment of our asset base is also extremely high-quality. 80% of our total senior living portfolio is operated by the top-10 national care providers. As a further indicator of portfolio quality, our 270 SHOP assets are 91% occupied and highly productive, generating annual NOI of $20,000 per unit after management fees. And our post-acute portfolio has a very desirable 65% quality mix, also evidencing its attractiveness and productivity.", "We aim to continue building a great portfolio through our investment activities. The current investment environment remains very active. John Cobb and his team continue to burn the midnight oil, assessing the merits of potential transactions. We are also actively evaluating with existing partners, a couple of large class A developments in the MOB and senior living sectors. These projects if they become a reality would be state-of-the-art healthcare and senior living facilities in attractive major markets.", "Our investment approach has consistently focused on allocating capital where we see good risk-adjusted returns, strategic and accretive growth opportunities and positive underlying fundamentals, with an emphasis on private pay assets. We seek to build long-term collaborative relationships with quality care providers, who serve an important niche in their respective markets.", "We acknowledge that there is significant competition in the market, but we also know that Ventas has the experienced team, cost of capital and intellectual firepower to win more than our fair share of deals.", "With our strong and expansive customer relationships, our top-quality portfolio and our consistent investment approach, I am confident that we will continue our long track record of excellent performance and produce reliable growing cash flow and dividends for our shareholders.", "As a final note, I continue to marvel at the healthcare and senior living space, which is highly dynamic. The consolidation and vertical integration, we have been predicting is accelerating. We'd like to congratulate our tenant Kindred on it's recently announced acquisition of Gentiva, the largest home healthcare and hospitals provider in the U.S. Upon the closing of this transaction, Kindred will solidify its position as a nation's premier, post-acute and rehabilitation services provider with over 100,000 employees and $7 billion in annual revenues.", "Kindred has executed a forward thinking strategy of providing comprehensive, coordinated patient care and targeted integrated markets, which will benefit patients, healthcare systems, ACOs and managed care organizations. We are delighted for Kindred success and look forward to continuing to work with the Kindred management team. And now that Kindred is our fourth largest tenant operator, we can even work on growing with them.", "I'm very happy as I am sure you are, as well, to turn the floor over to Ventas President, Ray Lewis.", "Raymond Lewis", "Thank you, Debbie. The third quarter represented another quarter of consistent and strong performance from our diversified portfolio of seniors housing, medical office and post-acute properties, with same-store cash NOI for the portfolio growing by 3% year-over-year in local currency.", "Performance was good across the board. With our balanced portfolio of 1,468 SHOP, triple-net and MOB assets delivering reliable and growing cash flows, which I will now break down by segments.", "Let me start with our seniors housing operating portfolio, operated by Atria and Sunrise and now Brookdale. With the closing of our acquisition of 29 Canadian properties from Holiday, we now have 41 properties north at the border. In order to help you focus on property level performance, we are now providing enhanced disclosure in local currency and the SHOP statistics I will be providing in my prepared remarks will also be in local currency.", "Let me start with our total portfolio. This portfolio now stands at a total of 270 properties and accounts for approximately 30% of our portfolio NOI. The total portfolio produced $132 million of NOI after management fees in the third quarter of 2014, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year. This increase is due to the impact of acquisitions and the steady performance of our same-store stable portfolio offset by decreases in our redevelopment portfolio due to units offline for refurbishment.", "NOI in the 217 properties in our same-store stable portfolio increased 4.4% year-over-year and occupancy grew by approximately 20 basis points to 92.1%. This is 180 basis points higher than the occupancy reported by NIC in its primary markets. RevPOR grew by 2.5% to over $5,600 per month, which is higher than the NIC primary market RevPOR by nearly 60%. The 12 properties in our Sunrise, Canada portfolio began to rebound in our third quarter.", "Occupancy increased almost 200 basis points sequentially to 91.7%, but was flat year-over-year. NOI after management fees was up 9% sequentially. And while improving year-over-year, it's still below our expectations at just under 3% growth. So we are cautiously optimistic that the changes Sunrise has implemented are positioning this portfolio to return to its historically strong performance levels. Occupancy in the 227 properties in the same-store stable portfolio increased 210 basis points sequentially, following historical seasonal patterns.", "Similarly, expenses increased sequentially in the third quarter consistent with historical trends, due to an extra day in the quarter and seasonal increases in holidays, and paid time off, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. We had seven properties undergoing redevelopment in the third quarter of 2014 versus three properties in 2013.", "For these seven properties, NOI was down by about $1.4 million year-over-year in the third quarter as we had approximately 130 more units offline this year versus last. We expect that the redevelopments currently underway will contribute strong growth as they come back online over the next year.", "Lastly on SHOP, construction as a percentage of inventory in the 31 primary markets, as reported by NIC, declined during the quarter to 3.5%. By contrast, in the 3-mile trade area around our buildings, construction was only 2.5% of inventory, due to the high barrier to entry infill locations that characterize our SHOP portfolio.", "Next, I'll cover our triple-net leased portfolio, which accounts for 53% of our NOI and is the engine of our cash flow growth. This diversified and productive portfolio of seniors housing, post-acute and hospital assets delivered another quarter of strong and stable performance.", "Same-store cash NOI for 836 properties that we owned in the third quarter of 2014 and 2013 was up a positive 2.6% year-over-year. Cash flow coverage in the 717 properties in our same-store triple-net leased portfolio for the second quarter of 2014, the latest available information was strong and stable at 1.6x. Moreover, less than one-half of 1% of our NOI comes from leases with cash flow coverage less than 1x. So the triple-net portfolio continues to perform well and deliver reliable and growing cash flows.", "The releasing of the Kindred portfolio is substantially complete. We have now transitioned all, but five facilities, and they are on track to be transitioned or sold by yearend. Building on the success, we have had with our redevelopment in our SHOP portfolio, we are also gearing up redevelopment in our triple-net lease portfolio. We currently have 25 triple-net projects approved, totaling $125 million of investment when fully funded. Most of which is with our largest tenant in Brookfield. Returns should average between 7% and 9%.", "We have a team dedicated to identify these opportunities and presenting them to our portfolio relationships. These investments make our customers more profitable and enable us to generate attractive yields, while upgrading our portfolio. And unlike SHOP redevelopment, we typically receive rent immediately upon funding. So we continue to work with our relationships and actively manage our triple-net portfolio to drive performance and growth.", "Finally, I'd like to briefly discuss Ventas' portfolio of 275 consolidated medical office properties standing over 15 million square feet and accounting for 15% of our annualized NOI.", "Here are a few of the MOB segment highlights for the third quarter. For the total portfolio, NOI at 100% share was $73 million and occupancy was a very healthy 92%. Cash NOI in the 263 same-store consolidated medical office buildings continued to show strong performance, increasing 3.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 2.1% increase in rate and a 110-basis point increase in margin.", "Occupancy was strong at 92% and consistent with last year's third quarter. Sequentially, cash NOI grew just over 1.1% in the stabilized portfolio. Rental rate and occupancy were stable relative to the second quarter. And expense controls and recoveries drove the sequential cash NOI growth.", "Our retention continues to be good at 77% and we are seeing positive net leasing spreads of approximately 2%. So we continue to lease space, push rates, manage expenses and drive bottomline growth in our MOB portfolio.", "In summary, our balanced and diversified portfolio delivered strong performance across the board in the third quarter, and we continue to be on track to meet our same-store cash NOI growth range of between 3.5% and 4% in 2014.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Rick Schweinhart to discuss our financial results. Rick?", "Richard Schweinhart", "Thank you, Ray. The company invested $1.28 billion in the third quarter, repaid $632 million in debt and paid dividends of $214 million. Those amounts were funded by cash flows from operations of $324 million, debt issuances and assumptions of liabilities of $1.7 billion, and sales of real estate and other investments of $132 million.", "During the quarter, we borrowed $725 million in Canada on a one-year bank term-loan at CDOR plus 105 for our Canadian acquisition. Shortly there after, we refinanced the majority of the term loan with permanent financing, with the issuance of $580 million in senior notes in Canada with an average interest rate of 3.5%, and a weighted average maturity of seven years. The proceeds were used to reduce bank term loan. The $32 million of mortgage debt prepaid was at a weighted average interest rate of 7% and a GAAP rate of 3.7%.", "Normalized FFO was $1.12 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2014, an increase of 9%, excluding non-cash items and 8% as reported in each case compared to the third quarter of 2014 per share results. Normalized FFO increased 8% to $333 million compared to $307 million in the third quarter of 2013. Normalized FFO increased due to improvements in all three segments and the impact of accretive investments completed in 2014 and 2013. This strong performance was partially offset by the dilutive impact of asset sales and loan repayments we received in 2013 and 2014.", "We translate our revenue and net operating income from Canada to U.S. dollars reported in our financial statements. This quarter and year-to-date the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the Canadian dollar, which effectively reduces the U.S. dollar amount of that revenue in NOI in our financial statements compared to prior periods. However, because we also borrow in local currency, these currency changes have a lesser net impact on our FFO results, because our interest expense is also lowered when translated to U.S. dollars in our financial statements.", "Our fully diluted share count increased less than 1% in the third quarter of 2014 to 296.5 million shares compared to the same period in 2013. Our average cash interest rate improved 30 basis points to 3.6% at September 30, 2014, compared to September 30, 2013. And we have been able to maintain our weighted average debt maturity at approximately 6.5 years.", "At quarter end, our credit stats remained outstanding with a net debt to pro forma EBITDA at 5.8x; our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 4x, and secured debt to enterprise value of 8%. Currently, our revolver balance is approximately $135 million, and our debt-to-enterprise value is an outstanding 34%.", "We are increasing our 2014 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance range to between $4.44 and $4.47, an increase from our previously announced 2014 guidance range of $4.39 to $4.43 per diluted share. Our guidance, if achieved, represents 8% to 9% per share growth excluding non-cash items estimated at $0.12 per share.", "Our new guidance range excludes any impact from the HCT acquisition, which we expect to close later this year. Our guidance does not include the impact of additional unannounced capital transactions or acquisitions or dispositions. In summary, we had an excellent quarter and we are well-positioned to deliver positive results for the balance of the year.", "Operator, if you would, would you please open the call to questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America", "I was just wondering if you could give us a little flavor for the relationship transactions you noted at the beginning of the call. And what you think could be a sustainable annual or quarterly run rate that investors could sort of pencil in going forward?", "Debra Cafaro", "I would say that it's our view that this business that we do, that's follow on business with existing customers will certainly continue, but the timing and volume of acquisition activity will always be lumpy and difficult to predict. So we are trying to give you some great color on our year-to-date acquisitions, which again were 85% new business with our existing customers.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America", "And then just on the dispositions that you noted, still having some I guess waiting to be sold around the timing of the HCT transaction, how much do you expect to close for the balance of the year and kind of maybe what's left over that you could look at, at disposing in 2015?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I would say that it could be very end of this year, early next year, and we're looking at 200 plus or minus. And in terms of '15, we are working on that and are likely to provide some additional guidance on volume and yield, when we have to about 2015 projections. So I do think we have some opportunities in the market that will be attractive for us to dispose of some additional assets in 2015.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America", "And then if I could get just a comment on what your views on cap rates are. Clearly 10-year treasuries and debt markets have been volatile, but maybe surprised some people and kind of headed down and there have been some big transactions. Sabra paid sub-6 cap rate for Holiday. What's your view on kind of where cap rates are, and maybe in particularly for senior housing assets? If you could comment, if you think the Sabra transaction sort of resets the market or that was more of a one-off in your discussions with potential sellers?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, one thing I would like to say is that we feel really good about the -- almost $4.5 billion that we are closing and underwrote this year between HCT, our Holiday deal and our other transactions that we described. I think the one thing that we some times see earlier than the analysts and the investors is where pricing is going, because we do see such a large volume of transactions.", "So I would say that healthcare assets continue to be attractive, because of their demand characteristics and so on. And the cap rates continue to be kind of in and around the 6% to 7% range, but can go lower based on specific characteristics of a given transaction.", "I mean as you mentioned about treasuries, I mean, I did comment at your conference and I think we said again today that we tend to ascribe a little bit to the PIMCO view that we are going to see a little bit persistently lower rates, because of the global economic situation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays", "I just want to start with the SHOP portfolio. Obviously, really impressive occupancy momentum in the third quarter and obviously Canada helped with that. But I was wondering if you could just touch on maybe were there any different strategies that were deployed this quarter with your operators there? And where did you end the quarter in terms of like a point in time occupancy number?", "Raymond Lewis", "So Jack as you pointed out occupancy did improve sequentially. This is consistent with typical historical patterns. As we look back across the portfolio performance overtime, I think we've always seen in the third quarter that we get a bump. But we were also aided as you point out by Canada. I think the strategies that Sunrise has implemented as well as the new personnel that they put in place are starting to gain some traction and we're hopeful that that will continue.", "And then I think the last thing is that our operators are really pushing on the sales front. And we've seen the move-in trend to be pretty good relative to historical levels. And notably, the move-outs that have been higher in the first and the second quarter have abated. So I think all of that is feeding our occupancy growth rate sequentially.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays", "And then I guess just on the move-outs, is there any real difference you see in the demographics of the people that are coming through? Like is there a change in the age -- and I'm not sure if this is something that you track, maybe the age of the people that are moving in to begin with?", "Raymond Lewis", "Our operators haven't pointed that out to us a driver for the move-outs. I think they're really just saying that we had an unusually high number of move-outs in the first and the second quarter, but they haven't pointed to any particular demographic driver of that age or otherwise.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays", "And then maybe last one is for Debbie. In the press release at the beginning, you mentioned the increase in the number of insured individuals. I was wondering obviously with health reform this year, everybody has got their eye on where that could help the healthcare REITs. I was wondering if there was any point in the portfolio where you have seen that show up, maybe in the MOBs or have you seen any sort of benefit yet?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we are excited to see that we are expecting another $4 million of additional exchange enrollment in 2015; $2.5 million of which we expect to these previously uninsured individuals, and we do expect to see increased utilization from those trends. Actually Todd and I were talking about this as we got ready for the call, and I think we are starting to get anecdotal and more quantitative evidence of whether traffic is up in the MOBs and so on. We do expect 20% increase in outpatient business over the coming years.", "We also think that as hospital admissions increase from these trends, we may see a positive overflow impact into the post-acute business. And interestingly, the LTACs are starting to see some good increase in terms of a Medicaid population that they hadn't had before. So we are seeing some impacts from policy being the low cost, most clinically appropriate settings, and we expect that these numbers from the CBO and from other sources will start to translate into meaningful quantitative utilization statistics in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from UBS.", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "A couple of questions; first, kind of the big picture one on your senior housing operating segment. I mean, you're now in that 4% to 5% same-store NOI growth range for that portfolio. Seems like its a little bit more mature today, maybe less occupancy upside than the past. And what I am wondering is do you think about maybe pruning some of the assets in this segment, selling some of the more mature ones, taking advantage of the very low cap rate market for senior housing and maybe investing into more assets that maybe have more future occupancy growth to perhaps improve the growth rate of that portfolio.", "Raymond Lewis", "I think as we look at our SHOP growth rate, same-store stable at 4.4%, kind of in line with our 3% to 5% expectations that we've consistently articulated for that portfolio, so that's good. But you're right, I mean we consistently look at our portfolio and evaluate properties based on their performance, their forward looking environment with respect to the markets, the physical characteristics of the asset and how they line up against their competitors.", "And I think we're always looking for opportunities to recycle, and we may in fact do some of that overtime. So I think that's a good observation. I would say, I still think there is good upside across the portfolio generally with respect to occupancy. We have tended to outrun the NIC occupancy a little bit earlier and our rates have been higher than NIC, but I think that's reflective of the quality of our portfolio and we expect that it can continue to perform well going forward.", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean that really ties. We're right on the same wavelength, it ties to the comment I made earlier. Remember, they are still is expected to be positive absorption in senior housing in 2015. I would say that -- we've talked about before, one way that we make money for investors, obviously is to try to invest in the right segments at the right time.", "And so trying to make early cycle investments like we did in Atria, like we did in Lillibridge, where we saw the opportunity for cap rate compression and/or NOI increases, and that's how you obviously grow value for investors. And so really coupling the idea of portfolio optimization where you maybe pruning selectively and then redeploying that capital into earlier stage investments is very much top of mind, as we think about the go forward.", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "Just a follow-up on that. When we look at, you reported the top 20 market performance for that portfolio, and then your overall in the top 20 markets are outperforming their 70% of that portfolio. What's going on in those non-top 20 markets, which seem like they're performing a little bit worse, and is that where you'd maybe look to, as asset sale candidates?", "Raymond Lewis", "Nick, that's a great observation. We noticed that as we were preparing for the call as well. We went back and looked at it. And I think there really wasn't any pattern that we could draw from it. I think there were some circumstances of isolated and episodic underperformance in some of the non-top 20 markets, but you're right. I mean, that is a pool, where if we see some patterns or trends there that emerge where we may look to dispose off some assets over time.", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "Just one last one on the guidance. There was this new $4 million to $5 million add-back to your normalized FFO for a change in fair value of financial instruments, which was new this quarter. Can you just explain what's going on there?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. That's just a non-cash charge that relates to movements and swaps and things like that. It's not a cash item.", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "But that was not in your prior guidance, right? And I am just trying to wonder -- ", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. We do. We have always excluded those items, because we do have them on a fairly regular basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "Debbie, a question just in terms of the MOB portfolio that you sort of want to list in, it sounded like the fourth quarter and potential continued asset sales. Can you talk a little bit about sizing of how much you would like to raise from those sales?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think with respect to the MOB portfolio, we are in that $200 million plus or minus range. And then in terms of 2015, again, we'll provide additional detail on that going forward.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "But I guess is there a certain, now as the portfolio continues to grow, would you seek to sell down further assets and how large could sale activity be as you continue to hone in on the portfolio?", "Debra Cafaro", "Right. Well, that's what we're evaluating now for 2015. And I would guess, it could be 250-ish to 750-ish, but really we haven't settled in on a specific plan and we'll be happy to provide more detail on that as we do.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "And then just a question in terms of global, you talk in the press release about building Ventas to be the leading global brand in healthcare. And I know you have spent a lot of time talking about global opportunities, global trends. Clearly you are in Canada; you have had some toehold or at least a pinky toehold in the U.K. Can you talk a little bit about, as Ventas as a brand, clearly you're not operating the assets, your name is not on the buildings.", "Can you talk a little bit about what you sort of envision in building Ventas to be a global brand? And how quickly you want to and how wide you would look globally? And what you sort of really mean by, maybe I'm reading too much into it being in the first sentence, but it just caught my eye.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we are aspirational as you know and always set the bar high at Ventas in terms of our wanting to be excellent and continuing to provide our investors with good growth and good channels for continued growth. So part of that has been the evolution of our thought process around international investing, which as you know Simon has done, and many of the other REITs have pursued successfully.", "I would say that our brand, the Ventas brand is a business-to-business brand; and when we think about it as a leading global brand, we think about it in terms of what investors, capital sources to Ventas think about us, so our equity investors, our fixed income invertors, et cetera. And then what our customers and potential customers think about Ventas as a partner and capital provider.", "So that is the brand, not a consumer-type brand, but one that is recognized and respected by our business-to-business peers. And we also do that by obviously building the brands of our operating partners like Lillibridge and Atria.", "So on the focus question of international, we do have a fairly refined sense of the types of jurisdictions that we would consider investing in. They have to have the right demographics. They have to have the right -- if it's a reimbursement-type asset, they have to have the right policy supports for funding of those assets, including cultural support. And we obviously care about political risk and obviously the efficiency of the capital markets in those jurisdictions.", "So those are some of the things that we look at. And when you go through our criteria set, you end up with a handful or so of potential jurisdictions, where we would consider committing capital.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "And I guess, is there anything, I don't know, if I want to say imminent, but is that spending more of your time x U.S. versus in U.S. today?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I still go back to the fact that we have a $1 trillion healthcare market here in the U.S. that is really fragmented and dynamic. And I believe that the majority, we might even say the lion's share of our investment activity will likely continue to be in the U.S., and we have lots of opportunities here. So unlike some of the other sectors that are very concentrated here, we don't need to go abroad. It's more of an evolution, a natural evolution of our continued growth and diversification and continued efforts, as I said, to provide long-term growth.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "Just last question, because you did mention Simon in terms of their global. One of the things that they did in Europe is buy a 30% stake in another public company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes.", "Michael Bilerman - Citi", "I guess, as you think about going global, would you examine different ways of doing it rather than doing wholly-owned portfolio deals or whole company. Would you actually think about some sort of tie-up like that I mean or you're referencing it more?", "Debra Cafaro", "I would say that we are very creative and experienced in terms of deal structuring, and we would be open to good opportunities. The one thing I do think is very interesting about Ventas and the healthcare REIT model is, typically, when U.S. REITs go abroad to operate, people talk about, well, don't you need a local partner, right. That's a very common reframe when you go abroad.", "Well, healthcare REITs like Ventas are always working with a local partner. So it's a very natural way I think for us. For example, with Spire, they are our local partner and our local operator, and that's a very consistent structure to what we're used to in our business model. But yes, we would consider equity investments and other type investments in entities in a way that Simon did with Kl\u00e9pierre, should they feel like they're attractive investment opportunities.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Couple of questions from our end. The first one is around HCT, and you guys are definitely expressing a lot of confidence about the deal closing in December. Just curious, if there is any insight in regards to how HCT shareholders ultimately will vote, whether you're kind of getting any sense of that around the deal?", "And then, second of all, if they do vote yes and the deal gets done, because of the large amount of retail investors they have in the name that typically tends to sell after these type of transactions, if you have any concern about a lot of selling in Ventas shares from these shareholders kind of post the merger?", "Debra Cafaro", "We started to get a little visibility into their shareholder base, and I do believe that the shareholders will approve the transaction. I have every expectation of that. I would say that this is a little bit different from some of the other private REIT transactions, in terms of post closing sales dynamics, and what I mean by that is this was already a public company, and I think the patterns will tend to follow more along the normal kind of M&A arb type lines, then they will be more private REIT be getting liquidity type lines.", "And so we expect a pretty conventional public-to-public M&A pattern. And I think we should potentially get some lift from the closing of the transaction, because we should get reweighted in the indices upon issuance of the 1.8 billion to 2 billion shares to the HCT shareholder base.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "And then second of all, the recent Germany transaction that MPW announced. Just kind of curious whether that's something you looked at, at any point and if you kind of have any comments generally about that portfolio if it's something you are familiar with?", "Debra Cafaro", "Again, I think that you should assume that Ventas had seen the tremendous volume of deal activity, certainly domestically, and now I would say internationally. And I think we just feel really good about talking about the $4.5 billion of deals that we're doing.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Last one for me. Just going back to the SHOP portfolio again and looking at the U.S. and the slowdown in the same-store NOI to 4.5% this quarter versus 6.6% last quarter, and that's a sort of stabilized portfolio. I wanted to understand the comments you made earlier about the higher amount of redevelopment going on in the portfolio, if that impacted the stable same-store NOI or whether there is something else that's kind of going on that created that slowdown quarter-over-quarter in regards to the same-store NOI growth for the stabilized portfolio?", "Raymond Lewis", "No. The stable portfolio does not include the redevelopment assets. Really what's going on in the stable portfolio is normal patterns that we've seen, where the third quarter has typically grown less than other quarters in the year. And I think it was similar to last year. We just have, as I said, an extra day in the quarter, higher expenses, those sorts of things and I think we may have seen a little bit more of that on the expense side this year. So that is what I would attribute it to, Tayo.", "Debra Cafaro", "Tayo, I think that this is very much in line with our expectations. And when we talked in the second quarter, which was only, I don't know, two-and-a-half months ago, we talked about the seasonal patterns that that Ray is referring to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "So I'm sorry, I may have missed this, and I'm never afraid to ask a dumb question. But when did Brookdale get added to your RIDEA portfolio and how?", "Debra Cafaro", "It got added this quarter.", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "In what fashion you bought or transitioned? I didn't see anything, I was looking.", "Debra Cafaro", "We acquired an asset that was through a relationship we got with NHP that is being managed by our friends at Brookdale.", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "A single asset, is that right?", "Debra Cafaro", "Correct.", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "On HCT, how do you feel about the MOB portfolio, given that it's 70% off-campus?", "Debra Cafaro", "I wish you had been here last quarter, because I waxed eloquent about that very subject. So we feel really good and think that that the MOB portfolio in HCT is one of the big attractions of the portfolio, because it's about 50% of the portfolio. And Todd is very excited to bring those into the fold.", "So a couple of characteristics that make us like them are: they're 97% occupied; have longer lease terms of over eight years; and half the buildings were newly constructed. So each of those metrics will improve those same metrics in our existing market leading MOB portfolio. They're 90% affiliated or on-campus with strong hospital sponsorship and credit quality is strong.", "And so the key point about them is that they are affiliated with leading regional health systems like Advocate, Baylor, Memorial Hermann, UC Davis, they are larger building sizes, averaging over 50,000 square feet. And they are comprehensive or specialty outpatient centers that essential hubs for the affiliated health systems care network. So we really like that they are really at leading edge of kind of successful population health management trends.", "So we also see an opportunity in the multi-tenant ones to bring management inside and leverage a lower bridge platform. So those are all aspects that we really like about it, and Todd is sort of chomping at the bit to get to the closing, so we can bring them into the fold. Aren't you glad you asked?", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "In Canada, RevPOR went from $7,200 in the second quarter to $7,900 in the third quarter. How did that happen in such fast pace?", "Richard Schweinhart", "I mean, again I think Rich that it's a new staff in there, new sales people, focus on nuts and bolts. I mean if you look at it they had improvement in all of the key metrics, right. So your occupancy went up, your rate went up, and your expenses went down. And that to me is just blocking and tackling and executing. And I am hopeful that they can continue to do that.", "Debra Cafaro", "And remember, again as we said last call, these were the top performing assets, it's an irreplaceable top quality portfolio, and so it should be able to do better.", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "And then the last question is on the MOBs that you're selling, I think that was $200 million or so. What do they look like? Are they under occupied? How below the radar screen are they in terms of quality relative to the rest of your MOB portfolio? And do you still think you can get a 6-ish type of cap rate on it?", "Richard Schweinhart", "I mean, I think that portfolio is a combination of stabilized properties that have consistent cash flow, and then properties that are in lease-up that have upside in them and between those two, I think that will be very attractive to buyers, who want to be able to generate additional value going forward out of the portfolio. So I think the 6 cap is pretty reasonable, if you take into consideration the upside that might be embedded in those assets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "Debbie, just wanted to ask you about your new investment activity was fairly modest. And I'm just curious if that's maybe because asset values have risen so much in the private market that it is so much more competitive or maybe a view of your cost of capital maybe trading probably pretty close to NAV these days. Just curious how you are thinking about new investment activity?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, my dad was a mailman and $4.5 billion was far from modest in a year for him. So I'm feeling like we're doing a lot. So I would say in the quarter, we closed $1.1 billion and we also invested a total of $1.3 billion, including development and redevelopment. So we're feeling good about that.", "I think the allocation to capital to a redevelopment and development business is a good risk adjusted return that we see continued capital allocation too. And as I said, we are good investors, we're consistent investors. We've created a lot of value over a long period of time. And we think when we pick our spots, we can continue to invest accretively and strategically, and we'll continue to be smart investors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "And then on your comment to Michael Bilerman about the range of potential asset sales next year, I think you mentioned the top-end could be as high as 750. Just curious, if you got to that high and I appreciate you're going to talk more about this on the next call, but would that sort of be a change in sort of your philosophy on recycling capital, if you got to that high?", "Debra Cafaro", "I want to strongly caution all of you from running with any of those numbers. What we will be happy to do is when we come to you about 2015, we'll be happy to give you some visibility into expected asset sales. I do think and we've been talking about it for some time now and we're starting to implement with the MOB sale that we talked about, a strategy to recycle capital, optimize the portfolio. And those are all positive sort of typical real estate activities. And I think we can probably provide more color on that, which we'll be happy to do in the yearend call.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "And then if I can just ask a disclosure question. I think on the last call someone had asked about foreign exchange and you mentioned that you typically reflect foreign exchange impact at exchange rates. And then this time, I think you're sort of front and center NOI growth presentation on sort of the first page of the supplement, second page was in local exchange rates. And we appreciate the enhanced disclosure in the middle of the supplemental package. But just curious on the philosophy, will we see the local currency be now more of the focus, whereas in the past it was U.S. dollars?", "Debra Cafaro", "Again, we're trying to provide great visibility into property level performance. And if you look at the supplemental page, its 13 and 14, you'll see that we've presented them in both. I don't know if it's 13 and 14 or 12 and 13. But we've presented them in both, and we're talking about them in local, because it gives you that visibility into performance. And we really talked about in our guidance saying that we're assuming sort of a constant exchange rate. And so reporting in local currency is just a different way of saying the same thing.", "Raymond Lewis", "And then, Michael remember that the way that we hedge currency is through borrowing, and that shows up below the NOI line. So I think the best way to look at the property level performance, particularly now that we have 29 more properties in Canada, is to look at local currency. It's starting to become a bigger driver, and I think you'll get a much better picture of the true underlying performance in local currency.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "And then last one for me, just housekeeping. Debbie, I think on this call and also the last one I think you mentioned 65% Q mix for what I think you termed your post-acute. And then on Page 2 of the supplement for the skilled nursing portfolio, it shows a 51% Q mix. So I'm assuming the delta there is just you're somehow bifurcating your skilled-nursing portfolio. Is there anything else on this?", "Debra Cafaro", "No. Actually, it's much better than that, because the long-term acute care hospitals and IRFs are part of the post-acute continuum. And so we have a tremendously high quality portfolio there. And so we're basically taking the whole post-acute continuum and quoting a very high attractive quality mix. So it's actually a great statistic for about 26% of our NOI. So that's a good question, thank you for asking. But we're going to have to hustle here, because there are a couple more people we want to make sure we get to, Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Stifel.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel", "I just want to ask a quick question on the ETT SHOP portfolio. Obviously, can't talk about probably the third quarter results, but how is that ETT SHOP portfolio performance-wise compared to what the existing Atria or Sunrise assets have done? And maybe compare the growth rate of the two over time and where you expect that to be?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think we talked about some statistics of the senior living portfolio. I mean in particular the managed portfolio, last time, there are 29 managed senior living assets and eight operators, who will be new care providers and customers for us. And they have about 94% occupancy and NOI per unit per year of about 17,000. So they are very high quality, and compare favorably with NIC and other kind of wholly private-pay portfolios that don't have skilled-nursing beds or super high acuity all timers in them.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel", "So essentially that probably I should expect a similar growth rate to what your existing SHOP portfolio can do?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I think that that's what we were underwriting and suggesting to the Street.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel", "And then when I think about your development portfolio, you talked a little bit more about the potential for some ground-up development, Class A ground-up development. How do you see -- right now your development is mainly tilted toward RENAV? Do you see your development portfolio tilting a little bit more towards ground-up development over the next, say, 12 or 24 months and how big could that get as a percentage, maybe not as a percentage, but on a dollar amount on the development side?", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean, we really like the redevelopment, because we think its great risk-adjusted return, there're small slugs of capital with existing customers, it improves our portfolio, helps our assets win in the marketplace and our tenant operators win. But focusing on kind of ground-up development, I think we are super selective.", "And we have done ground-up development in Cape Cod with Atria and that's gone really well. We'll do pre-leased MOBs, and we have the in-house capability and partnership capability of doing that really better than any one. And I think if we find kind of, as I said, really compelling projects that have ground-up development and meet the characteristics that we believe are appropriate, then I think we will pull the trigger. But there is a very high bar for us for ground-up development.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel", "And then in terms of these seniors housing industry itself, we have seen a lot of interest in development, in construction, but not a lot of that's translated into new starts. How long do you think the seniors housing fundamentals can remain strong as to where they are now? I mean, how would you characterize where we are in the cycle? Are we near peak in industry fundamentals? Do we still have a couple of more years to go? How are you thinking about the seniors housing industry broadly?", "Raymond Lewis", "I think our view is that we're still in a very good spot in the seniors housing cycle. I think you're right to point out that we haven't seen a tremendous amount of construction relative to the inventory in place. The demand fundamentals remain very good. And so I think we still got a couple of years here of good visibility into positive net absorption in the space.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel", "And one more last quick question. I'm not specifically commenting on the Germany transaction that MPW did, but you and others have not done a lot of investments or any investments really on the European continent, really sticking to the U.K. so how do you think about the opportunities on the continent itself versus the U.K.?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, some of the countries within the euro zone do meet the criteria that I outlined; really great capital markets, efficient, you can borrow very efficiently, and they do have the policy support for healthcare and favorable demographic, so some of those countries would fit within the criteria and framework that I outlined.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel", "If the right opportunity popped up, okay.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel", "I'll hop off. I know we're getting late in the call.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Dan. We want to make sure everyone has a chance to ask their questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "I just have a simple question, I apologize for being a little dense here, but understanding that the same-store NOI trends here in the quarter were consistent with your expectations and given some seasonal impacts in the SHOP portfolio. I am just curious why would seasonal impacts impact your year-over-year trends. Seems like they would be similar in both periods?", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes. I think as I mentioned when I answered the question, we did have a little bit more of the expenses in this year than we've seen in previous years, and so I think that's sort of a difference there.", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "So that should moderate in the fourth quarter?", "Raymond Lewis", "We hope so.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "I just had one question, just a follow-up to Tayo's question earlier on the deceleration in the U.S. SHOP portfolio. Based on the performance that you've seen here in the fourth quarter so far, do you expect that deceleration to continue here into the fourth quarter and do you care to comment on the possibility for re-acceleration into 2015?", "Debra Cafaro", "I would say, last year that the third quarter was the lowest year-over-year growth, and we would expect the fourth quarter to be kind of flattish, and potentially a little bit up. Those are the patterns that we have historically followed.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Based on the industry dynamics that Ray just talked about, do you think there is a possibility that growth could reaccelerate as you look a little further into the future?", "Raymond Lewis", "Certainly, as we finish our redevelopments and lease those up; we continue to work in Canada, continue to focus there to get that turned and back to where it should be. And as we work with our operators to push rates where we can and manage our expenses, give rope and drive occupancy where we need to, I think that we can see some reacceleration in the growth rates.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Remember, the Holy Grail too from a big picture standpoint is to increase kind of the capture rate, if you think one in seven seniors or so uses a senior living community, if the industry can increase that even slightly, that obviously generates a whole new level of demand. And I would say that, that really is the challenge and opportunity for our industry, is to continue attracting more seniors to senior living and making the statistical case that it's better for health and wellness, longevity and frankly long-term costs for the overall system.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets", "Its looks like the Sunrise portfolio in Canada, they were able to quickly stabilize those assets. Did they implement anything special to stabilize that so quickly?", "Raymond Lewis", "Yes. I don't think, Michael, that those are stabilized yet. I still think there is a way for those to go, to get back to their strong historical levels of performance. But I will say we're pleased with the progress that was made during the quarter. The basic things, as I said, were getting the right staff in place at the buildings and executing and blocking and tackling. And I think if they can continue to do that, they should be able to build on that momentum and get them back to where they have been, which is 94%-plus occupancy and strong year-over-year rate growth with best-in-portfolio margins. And there is still room to run there.", "Debra Cafaro", "As my mother said, sometimes when you just pay attention, you do better. So I think that it's a good story, and hopefully, more to follow. Anything else, Michael?", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets", "No. That's good.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you so much this morning for all your patience and your interest in the company. We really look forward to seeing you in Atlanta, and give you chance to meet our new CFO, Bob Probst, and we are very excited that the conference will come right as he begins. And since this is Rick Schweinhart's last Ventas earnings call, I want to thank him again for his tremendous leadership and partnership over the last 12 years. So with that, we'll say goodbye, and look forward to seeing everyone in Atlanta. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

(NYSE:VTR) Q2 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call July 24, 2015 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Lori Wittman - Senior Vice President, Capital Markets and Investor Relations", "Debra Cafaro - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Robert Probst - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Raymond Lewis - President", "Todd Lillibridge - Executive Vice President, Medical Property Operations; President and CEO, Lillibridge Healthcare Services", "Analysts", "Nick Yulico - UBS", "Smedes Rose - Citigroup", "Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Kevin Tyler - Green Street Advisors", "John Kim - BMO Capital Markets", "Todd Lukasik - Morningstar", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "Juan Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Derek Bower - ISI Group", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2015 Ventas Earnings Conference Call. My name is Derik and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We shall facilitate a question-and-answer session at the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lori Wittman, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Lori Wittman", "Thank you, Derik. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These projections, predictions and statements are based on management's current beliefs, as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events.", "The forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and contingencies, and stockholders and others should recognize that actual events may differ materially from the company's expectations, whether expressed or implied.", "We refer you to the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2014, and the company's other reports filed periodically with the SEC for a discussion of these forward-looking statements and other factors that could affect these forward-looking statements.", "Many of these factors are beyond the control of the company and its management. The information being provided today is as of this date only and Ventas expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations.", "Please note that the quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now, for the last time, turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks, Lori, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to Ventas' second quarter earnings call. This morning, we are happy to share a strong Q2 results, discuss our pending strategic transactions and describe how we expect to finish the year strong as a higher-quality faster-growing company.", "Then, Ray Lewis will provide his last update as our President, giving you a report on our portfolio performance and a sneak peek at Care Capital Properties. Bob Probst will finish by describing our senior housing operating and financial results and our outlook for the balance of the year. Following our remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.", "It's obvious that we had an incredibly productive quarter. We drove financial results, accelerated progress on our spin-off, took meaningful steps forward on our Ardent acquisition and expanded our international profile, all at the same time.", "It's always fun to start with strong results. In the second quarter, we generated normalized FFO per share of $1.18, representing 5% growth compared to the same period last year. Cash flow from operations increased 20% and our second quarter dividend per share grew 9%, in line with our long track record of sustainable recurring dividend growth.", "We are also pleased to report that we\u2019ve achieved major milestones in our pending strategic moves to spin-off most of our skilled nursing portfolio into CCP and enter the US hospital space. We believe these innovative decisions will deliver significant benefits for our investors, lenders, customers and employees.", "Starting with our spin-off of CCP, a pure play skilled nursing REIT, we are poised to complete the transaction in the coming month, subject to applicable approvals. We recently filed our amended Form 10 with the SEC and believe it is close to final. CCP is well underway with its debt financing and all of our internal planning is on track. We expect Ventas and CCP to be two faster-growing companies with focused differentiated strategies. CCP will be an exciting external growth vehicle with a great management team, diverse portfolio and strong balance sheet.", "Upon completion of this spin-off, Ventas will have an outstanding portfolio, specifically our NOI contribution from private pay assets will improve to a market leading 83%, the top 20 operators in each sector will account for 83% of our NOI and our post-acute quality mix will improve materially to a best in class 78%. We will also retain significant scale, diversification, financial strength, a high-quality senior housing operating portfolio and best in class MOB or medical office building franchise.", "We have also made significant strides during the quarter toward completion of our pending Ardent investment. Most importantly, we selected a partner for the Ardent OpCo, Equity Group Investments, who will be the majority owner of Ardent going forward. We are delighted with the outcome of our process and our new partner and we look forward to working together with EGI and Ardent\u2019s management team to grow together.", "We expect to achieve approximately a 7.5% going in cash on leverage yields on our real estate investments in these high-quality hospital assets. We continue to target a third quarter closing for this important transaction. After closing, Ardent will remain a top 10 US hospital operator, with a strong financial and operating profile. Both we and EGI are attracted by the massive fragmented and rapidly consolidating hospital sector.", "Hospitals are currently benefiting from major positive trends such as demographics, policy tailwinds such as Medicaid expansion and an improving economy. The recent Supreme Court decision in King v. Burwell to validate federal exchanges and subsidies was just the icing on the cake in terms of our investment thesis and valuation.", "All of those trends are driving growth in admissions and emergency room visits. In fact, according to noted hospital analyst A. J. Rice, Q2 hospital volumes were the best in years, with industry inpatient admissions up 1.2%, ER visits up 3.1% and inpatient surgery is the strongest since 2011. In sum, with Ardent\u2019s experienced, well-respected management team and scalable platform, EGI\u2019s participation and our capital, we are confident we can build a formidable business in the US hospital space.", "During the quarter, we also expanded our footprint in the UK with the follow-on investment with our existing operating partner Canford Healthcare. Our new investment totaling $87 million is in five care homes in the London market, whose operations have been assumed by the quality team at Canford.", "We worked together with Canford following our initial investment with them in January to identify, underwrite and acquire these newly constructed homes, which are subject to long-term triple net lease yielding nearly 6.5% on an initial cash after-tax basis. This is just another great example of how we provide capital to help our customers grow.", "Our investment market remains very vibrant and our pipeline robust. We continue to see opportunities to invest across asset classes and geographies. We intend to continue to grow externally. As we think about our investments, we will stay disciplined; we will focus on value creation, growth and quality for our shareholders and customers; we will carefully underwrite risk and upside; we will be active where we have a competitive advantage; and we will retain our portfolio balance and a strong financial profile.", "Our actions demonstrate Ventas\u2019 leadership and clear direction, with our thoughtful and efficient spin-off, it should create value and position us for higher internal and external growth, with our entry into the $1 trillion new hospital sector with quality partners and real estate and excellent risk-adjusted returns, with our expansion into new attractive markets such as the UK and with our accelerated portfolio enhancement and capital recycling.", "All of this momentum reinforces how bullish I am and Ventas. We have tremendous opportunity to capture value for our shareholders as we demonstrate the superior quality of our portfolio, focus on sustainable cash flow and dividend growth and provide thoughtful capital solutions to our roster of top tier customers.", "On that note, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ray.", "Raymond Lewis", "Thanks, Debbie. Our diversified and productive portfolio of 952 senior housing post acute and hospital triple net lease assets accounts for about half of our NOI and delivered another quarter of strong and stable performance.", "Cash NOI growth in the triple net same-store pool was 1.6% in the second quarter of 2015 and 3.2% year to date versus the comparable 2014 period. Cash flow coverage in our same-store triple net lease portfolio for the first quarter of 2015, the latest available information, was strong and stable at 1.6 times. Each of our senior housing, skilled nursing and hospital portfolios reported stable trailing 12 months coverage at 1.3 times, 1.8 times and 2.2 times, respectively.", "The reimbursement environment remains stable. In the first quarter, we told you that CMS has recommended increases of 1.4% for skilled nursing, 1.2% for LTCHs and 1.7% for IRFs. These recommendations are typically finalized in August and we expect increases along these lines to be implemented in October for the 2016 fiscal year. So our high-quality triple net portfolio continues to deliver reliable performance.", "Next, let me turn to our market-leading Lillibridge MOB business. For the second quarter 2015, NOI in the total consolidated portfolio of 359 properties was $93.2 million, an increase of 35.8% over the second quarter of 2014. Performance was driven by solid same-store results and the addition of 83 properties in January.", "Occupancy in the total consolidated portfolio was up 80 basis points to 92.5% and margins increased by an exceptional 320 basis points, reflecting the quality of the properties we acquired.", "Of the 83 newly acquired MOBs, 37 are long-term triple net leased. And of the remaining 46 multitenant buildings, we have insourced management on 37 assets so far and expect to insource five more by year end. So we are excited about the opportunity to implement our operational best practices in these buildings to drive revenue and reduce operating costs.", "Turning to same-store, the 274 properties in the same-store portfolio delivered year over year cash flow growth of 2.3%. This was driven by an increase in rental rate of 2.1% and strong expense controls, offset by a slight decrease in occupancy. Sequentially, occupancy in the 275 properties same-store pool was up 20 basis points since the first quarter.", "Looking behind the revenue numbers, we are seeing encouraging trends in the business. Our new leases have longer terms, higher base rental rates and lower tenant improvement commitments than during the last few years. So the MOB portfolio continues to deliver stable and reliable performance and growth.", "Before turning the call over to Bob, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the spin-off of most of Ventas\u2019 skilled nursing portfolio to Care Capital Properties. As a reminder, CCP is going to have a diversified portfolio of 355 primarily skilled nursing properties with strong coverage, limited near-term maturities and relationships with over 40 operators.", "We will deliver external growth by investing with quality regional and local skilled nursing operators to consolidate this highly fragmented $120 billion market and grow internally through lease escalations and redevelopment. Our balance sheet will be strong and we will have low leverage to facilitate our external growth.", "Since we spoke to you last quarter, we've made significant progress on the spin-off. First, I'm extremely pleased to report that we have assembled our independent Board of Directors, with a group of six highly respected leaders in the fields of real estate, finance, and healthcare. Second, we have made significant progress with our bank financing and expect to have $1.4 billion in term loans and $500 million of revolver capacity in place at the time of spin-off.", "Third, progress with building out the team and infrastructure has been progressing rapidly and I\u2019d like to thank my colleagues at Ventas, many of whom are pulling double duty, for all of their hard work to make this spin-off of CCP a success.", "Fourth, the CCP team is hitting the ground running and building a pipeline of attractive skilled nursing investment opportunities. We have hired an experienced and well regarded industry investment professional to help us source new investment opportunities and we are actively bidding on deals in our strategic footprint.", "Finally, we are on track to complete the spin in August, subject to applicable approvals. The new leadership team is looking forward to getting on the road, meeting with investors and sharing the exciting CCP story.", "With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert Probst", "Thank you, Ray. I\u2019d like to start by reviewing our second quarter performance for our SHOP portfolio, followed by a discussion of our overall Ventas Q2 financial results.", "In terms of SHOP, I really enjoyed meeting with our operators, touring our fantastic assets and digging into this great business a bit more deeply over the last several months. And I\u2019m very pleased to report accelerated growth of this portfolio in the second quarter.", "NOI in the 234 properties in our same-store portfolio increased 4% in the second quarter of 2015 over the second quarter of 2014. This performance was achieved despite the lingering effects in the second quarter of a severe flu season. Second quarter same-store occupancy growth versus prior year was solid at 50 basis points and occupancy increased in both Atria and Sunrise portfolios.", "Year over year rate growth was also strong at 3.2%, driven by the Atria portfolio. Expenses grew in line with revenue in the quarter, as wage increases were partially offset by benefit savings and procurement initiatives. As a result, same-store SHOP NOI margins of 33.6% in the second quarter were stable versus prior year.", "On a sequential basis and consistent with seasonal patterns, same-store occupancy declined in the second quarter versus the first. Sequential same-store NOI was up 3.9% as seasonal costs associated with flu and harsh weather in Q1 abated in the second quarter.", "As we look to the back half of the year, for the same-store SHOP portfolio, we expect occupancy to trend higher versus second quarter levels. We also believe that current rate levels will hold and expenses will move in line with revenue. Therefore, overall, we expect same-store SHOP NOI growth to approximate or exceed 4% in the third and fourth quarters.", "Turning now to the 305 assets in the total SHOP portfolio, the total SHOP portfolio generated NOI after management fees of $155 million in the second quarter, representing growth of 24% year over year. This growth was driven by the strong same-store performance as well as the acquisition of 66 new properties since the second quarter of 2014.", "Occupancy in the total portfolio at 91% was 70 basis points higher in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year. Our total US portfolio occupancy in the top 99 markets at 90.8% exceeds the average senior housing occupancy reported by NIC by 80 basis points, while our RevPAR exceeds NIC averages by 65% in those same markets.", "Looking at the supply dynamics in the broader senior housing landscape, Ventas\u2019 construction as a percentage of inventory in the 3-mile trade radius around our buildings was 3.2% in the second quarter, which compares favorably to the 4.5% as measured by NIC in the top 99 markets.", "I\u2019d like to now turn to the company's financials. It's important to say upfront how pleased we are with the results of the second quarter and the first half of the year as well as our outlook for the full year.", "Looking at the second quarter, we delivered normalized FFO of $394 million, an increase of 19% versus prior year. Q2 normalized FFO per diluted share was $1.18 versus $1.12 in 2014, an increase of 5%. The solid Q2 growth over 2014, which was ahead of our expectations, is primarily due to the positive impact of accretive acquisitions, same-store portfolio NOI growth of 2.4% led by growth in our SHOP portfolio and income from the sale of healthcare bonds.", "The solid FFO growth was partially offset by a 13% increase in share count in Q2 versus prior year. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2015 increased to 334 million shares compared to 296 million in Q2 2014.", "On a fully diluted share basis, NAREIT FFO grew by a strong 8% to $1.16 per fully diluted share, up from $1.07 in the second quarter of 2014. Normalized FAD for the quarter totaled $1.08 per fully diluted share, an increase of 7% over last year.", "Ventas generated $374 million in operating cash flow in the second quarter, an increase of 20% over Q2 2014. On a per share basis, operating cash flow increased to 7%. The dividend for the quarter totaled $261 million or $0.79 per share, up 9% versus prior year. Our payout ratio remains strong at approximately 67% and provides upside for future dividend growth. Indeed, we expect to increase our combined dividend following the spin by at least 10%.", "Looking at liquidity, asset dispositions and loan repayments year to date raised $591 million at a GAAP yield of 7%, right in line with our guidance. During the second and third quarters [of 2015] Ventas also accessed the debt and equity capital markets. We issued and sold a total of 1.6 million shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $105 million, under our at-the-market equity program, at an average price per share of $64.30. We raised this modest amount of equity to partially fund pending and closed investments.", "In July 2015, Ventas also issued $500 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2026. These notes lengthened our debt duration which now stands at a weighted average of 6.8 years. Moreover, the company currently has approximately $1.7 billion available under its revolving credit facility as well as $410 million of cash on hand. The company\u2019s net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA at June 30, 2015 is 5.6 times. Current debt-to-enterprise value now stands at 35%.", "With that, let me now turn to our updated guidance for the full year 2015. As a reminder, our previous outlook was to deliver 2015 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.67 to $4.75. We\u2019re pleased to now raise and narrow our guidance range of normalized FFO per fully diluted share to between $4.70 and $4.76, representing 5% to 6% growth over prior year. The drivers of this updated guidance included better than expected first half and accretive acquisitions closed in the quarter, partially offset by a later Q3 Ardent closing date than previously forecasted.", "We continue to project full year total company same-store cash NOI growth of between 2.5% to 3.5% in 2015. This compares to the 2.8% same-store NOI growth posted in the first half of 2015. In addition, as we discussed with you at NAREIT, we expect our full-year SHOP growth to be in the lower end of our 3% to 5% guidance range.", "We have assumed no further unannounced acquisitions or speculative fee income in our guidance. This guidance also does not take into consideration any impact from the spin-off of Care Capital Properties. We will formally update guidance once the spin-off transaction is completed. However, to provide an idea of the spin impact on Ventas, the reset of FFO arising from the spin of CCP for one full quarter will be $0.20 to $0.22 reduction in normalized FFO per fully diluted share for Ventas.", "In terms of capital structure, Ventas is committed to a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility and to a target net debt to EBITDA ratio in the 5 times to 6 times range. We have multiple clubs in our bag to achieve this range overtime, including an asset disposition program, equity issuance and, of course, our strong cash flow generation.", "So to sum up, on behalf of my Ventas colleagues, I would like to express how fired up we are about our strong results in the first half and our commitment to finishing 2015 as the superior faster growing company.", "With that, operator, please open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from the line of Nick Yulico, UBS.", "Nick Yulico", "For the skilled nursing portfolio, there is one that closed, recently someone else purchased and there are several other ones out there, you didn't announce any acquisitions, are you guys have to wait procedurally for the spin of Care Capital before you are willing to buy a skilled nursing portfolio out there today?", "Debra Cafaro", "I\u2019ll turn that over to Ray, after I just say that we are able to purchase any asset and we're working on pipeline opportunities for Care Capital because it is a strong external growth story.", "Raymond Lewis", "Nick, Debbie is 100% right. I mean, I think as we\u2019ve said in the past, there are differentiated strategies with respect to acquisitions. We\u2019re going to target the regional and local operators and we've been working with the Ventas team to build a pipeline of those opportunities. So we're going to hit the ground running when we spin-off. But if there were large national operator opportunities as well, I'm sure Debbie and her team would be looking at those opportunities too. So we're proceeding full steam ahead and bucketing the transactions in the appropriate categories for the go forward.", "Nick Yulico", "And then one another Care Capital spin question, originally you were talking about raising debt at Care Capital and dividending cash to Ventas, concurrent with the spin, and you did a bond yield recently, is that plan now off the table, how should we think about that?", "Robert Probst", "You're absolutely right. There is certainly a plan for CCP to raise its own debt and that's gone very well as we discussed in our prepared remarks and then distribute that to Ventas. We will use that to reduce near-term maturities, increase our duration of our debt and reduce our debt net-net. So that is on track and remains unchanged.", "Nick Yulico", "And sorry, can you remind me what the dollar amount would be for that?", "Robert Probst", "We, I think, said before something in the $1.3 billion range, but again it's going to be finalized upon completion.", "Nick Yulico", "And then just one other question on the quarter, it looks like your investment income was little higher than normal, I think you said about you got some income from the sale of some healthcare bonds, could you just quantify what that impact was for the quarter?", "Robert Probst", "Sure. We sold about $75 million [worth of] healthcare fixed-income securities. This was part of our broader disposition planning, indeed its part of our normal course of business as we invest in loans and obviously sold those off in time. That contributed about $6 million in income in the quarter. So that's what we discussed in the prepared remarks.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from the line of Smedes Rose, Citigroup.", "Smedes Rose", "I wanted to ask you just a little on the senior housing operating portfolio, it looks like in your top 20 markets that the sequential growth from first quarter to second quarter was particularly strong in New York and made up quite a bit of the overall increase. I was just wondering if there were some sort of \u2013 is it something that's going on there where you saw better pricing power or some sort of on the move-in side or something that was happening sequentially in the New York market for you?", "Robert Probst", "I think you are right to say New York continues to generate great performance. We have an advantage position in that market, particularly within the Atria portfolio and we've seen occupancy growth, rate growth and that generates continued positive growth in the quarter sequentially and year over year. So that's the biggest piece of our business. As you know, it's performing very well.", "Smedes Rose", "Debbie, just as you\u2019re further down the road with Ardent now, I know you have said in the past that you hope Ventas will become a leader in hospital consolidation. Do you have a sense as to maybe where after you close \u2013 where you\u2019d like to see that portfolio in a year? Would you be happy if your investment goes from 10 to 20 hospitals or from 10 to 15 or how you are thinking about the scope of that opportunity?", "Debra Cafaro", "As we've talked about, we love the Ardent investment. We\u2019re excited to close it. All the pieces are falling in place and we believe it will be a platform for growth in the way that Lillibridge in medical office and Atria in senior housing has been. I think in hospitals, there is this huge market and we will have opportunities. And it will be 6% of our NOI when we close and I could see that growing over time 10%, 12%.", "But we're focused on quality and we want to have hospitals that have leading positions in their markets and in the right markets and have pricing power and sort of growing operations. And that's what Ardent is and we want to continue to go down that path. So we\u2019re very excited about it as you say and I do believe and hope that we will grow.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from the line of Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler", "Wanted to see if you could maybe shed a little bit more light on what pro forma leverage would look like. I think the recent number was helpful post CCP spin, I think that was FFO going down $0.20 to $0.22 quarterly and I was just curious what sort of assumed as it relates to the capital structure in that $0.22? So I guess pro forma leverage and then the assumption to get to the $0.20 to $0.22 on the cap structure?", "Robert Probst", "In terms of our leverage, Ventas pro forma post both Ardent and CCP, what\u2019s inherently assumed is a net debt to leverage slightly above 6 times. That is in part why we reinforced our commitment to the 5 to 6 time leverage in the tools in our toolkit to get there. I think as I noted in terms of the dividend from \u2013 our distribution from CCP, that's going to be a net reduction in debt. But obviously, the strong balance sheet that CCP is going to have to pursue its acquisition strategy is going to net-net be modestly leveraging for us. So that's how we end up at that slightly about six times number.", "Jordan Sadler", "And the $0.20 to $0.22 reflects that dividend from CCP, essentially?", "Robert Probst", "That\u2019s correct, yes. [indiscernible] interest expense arising from the debt reduction is included.", "Jordan Sadler", "And then in the press release there is \u2013 you talk about sort of the funding of Ardent coming from a few different components, including obviously equity. Any thoughts surrounding \u2013 and I'm not asking you about that. Just around asset sales and what the scope of that might look like, any opportunity to pick as a source of funding as well?", "Debra Cafaro", "You\u2019re right on point there. We\u2019ve already sold $600 million of assets this year. And as Bob talked about different clubs in our bag, I\u2019m not a golfer, but I know what that means and that means we have a lot of opportunities to recycle capital as part of this as I spoke about portfolio enhancement as well and capital recycling. And so we\u2019re very confident in our position.", "Operator", "The next question will be from the line of Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors.", "Kevin Tyler", "It's Kevin Tyler here with Michael. Just now that your cost of capital advantage is virtually gone, your shares are trading closer to NAV as we see it, how do you think about approaching capital allocation?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good. First of all, I'm absolutely enthusiastic that our cost of capital advantage is going to return and that's part of the value creation opportunity that I talked about and the quality of the portfolio that we have. And so I\u2019m excited about that. And as I mentioned, we have managed this company and grown through every possible capital markets reinvestment and economic cycle. And we always find a way at Ventas to deliver value and results. And we do it again and again and again.", "And so I feel good about our ability, whether it's through capital recycling or other ways to continue to grow and drive value. I think as we said about the hospital deals, we think we\u2019re skating to where the puck is going. We think that's great risk-adjusted return. We are building a new business in an area where we can have an advantage and clearly can be profitable for shareholders. And so I think we\u2019re taking all the right steps to position the company for continued growth.", "Kevin Tyler", "Just shifting to the UK for a second, can you talk about your appetite in that market currently? Obviously, seeing the $90 million or so that you put to work there. But can you just give us some color on that opportunity set and if you have any concerns surrounding some of the staffing, nursing shortages that we've read about?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, again, the UK market shares a lot of the characteristics that we talked about in terms of being an attractive international market, which are obviously demographics, policy support for healthcare and seniors, very high and efficient capital markets environment so that you can match fund and effectively hedge your cash flows and a big enough market, addressable market for us to make all the brain damage worth it.", "And so we obviously have identified the UK. We had our Spire hospital investment which we are very excited about, Spire being the second largest private hospital operator in the UK, publicly traded with over \u00a31 billion equity cap and that's going well. Now, we\u2019ve identified Canford as a partner there in the care homes market. And as I mentioned, we did our first deal with them in January and now did a follow-on deal with them already to help them grow their business. And so we like that market, we believe we will expand there overtime, but obviously it's on a case by case basis and we've established some good footprints there and we hope to grow those.", "Operator", "And our next question will be from the line of John Kim, BMO Capital.", "John Kim", "Follow-up on Jordan's question. So far you have mentioned capital recycling as the source of funding the Ardent acquisition, but this year you have been basically match-funding acquisitions with dispositions, excluding Ardent. So should we be expecting an acceleration of asset sales in the third quarter?", "Debra Cafaro", "In terms of funding Ardent, we\u2019ve raised $0.5 billion in bonds and we also have a five-year bank loan. And as Bob mentioned, we raised $100 million in equity during and after the quarter in terms of our ATM. So we've got that funding in place, but as we go forward, again, we have talked about a modest amount of additional asset sales and so on as part of our capital recycling and portfolio enhancement initiatives.", "John Kim", "I think Bob mentioned on prior calls that this would be a leverage-neutral transaction. So I just wanted to clarify is that a day one leverage neutral or is it after a certain period?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good question.", "Robert Probst", "Thank you for clarifying. It will not be day one leverage neutral. We think it's appropriate to be able to show with the permanent capital structure to talk about it that way. But based on the financing, as just described by Debbie, it will be slightly leveraging in the short run, again that's why we come back to the discussion around our target from a long-term and short-term capital structure perspective.", "John Kim", "Debbie, you mentioned Equity Group as an important partner for you and your plan to grow together. Given the company's illustrious property background, do you have any idea or an inclination if they are attracted to hospitals as a real estate play?", "Debra Cafaro", "It's important to note that EGI, which for those of you who don't know, is the private equity firm founded and run by Sam Zell. 70% of EGI\u2019s investments are in non-real estate businesses. And they have an impressive and extensive track record of investing success across a wide variety of industries, including energy and healthcare.", "And so they are the equity sponsor of Ardent OpCo, our tenant. And of course, we will be partners then in helping the OpCo grow, but we are the real property partner and we will own all the real estate at the closing and presumably participate in owning additional real estate as Ardent identifies additional acquisition opportunities. And EGI will be the equity sponsor on the operating company side.", "John Kim", "So would it surprise you if they got interested in real estate in the future or have those conversations not happened?", "Debra Cafaro", "We are clearly the best owner of the real estate as a public company, just like EQR is the best owner of apartments on the real estate side and so I think the interest really there in Ardent is in the tenant operator.", "John Kim", "And then I had a question on your disposition disclosure, which I know is relatively new and I appreciate that. But there have been six assets that you sold during the period that had a zero cap rate and I just wanted to understand if that meant there was no operator at these assets or if the facility was basically cash flow negative.", "Debra Cafaro", "Not cash flow negative, just not income producing. It was an infinite return, but we didn't have that little sideways 8 on our typewriter.", "Operator", "And the next question will be from the line of Todd Lukasik, Morningstar.", "Todd Lukasik", "I was just wondering if you guys could comment anymore on the triple net deals done in Oregon and the UK on the senior housing side, specifically with regards to the terms of the leases and what the lengths and any rent escalators that the tenants may have agreed to on those.", "Debra Cafaro", "We will do.", "Raymond Lewis", "So the UK we talked about which was the Churchgate follow-on from Canford, which I think Debbie walked through, which is we think [indiscernible] between 2% and 5%. That's the follow-on deal with Canford. And a small deal we did in Oregon was with an existing customer, Avamere, which we added to their existing master lease that we have in place and that I forgot the specifics, but it is north of 2%.", "Todd Lukasik", "And the lengths are longer term with renewals?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah, the Churchgate, as can be typical in the UK, is longer and the Avamere one I'm guessing is at least 10 years.", "Todd Lukasik", "And then do you guys have any guidance with regards to the dividend payout ratios for CCP and Ventas post spin?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think, again good question, dividend growth is an important part of our value proposition and again we are very proud of our track record of 9% dividend growth for the last 10 years. What we\u2019ve said is on a combined basis after the spin that the combined dividend will go up by at least 10%. We've said in the Form 10 for CCP that the expectation is that there will be 75%, 76% of FFO targeted, normalized FFO targeted as the dividend payout ratio. Bob mentioned our current is about 67% and so there is room for growth there and we\u2019ve hovered in and around that 70%-ish plus or minus overtime at Ventas.", "Operator", "And the next question will be from the line of Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao", "Just wanted to ask a question about the supply here. It doesn't seem to have impacted results in the SHOP portfolio here this quarter and sounds like you still expect 4% growth in quarters three and four. But just curious if you could just maybe provide some qualitative color on what you are seeing on the supply side. It does seem like that went up quite a bit versus last quarter.", "Debra Cafaro", "I\u2019m going to ask Bob to comment in greater detail, but I think the important thing to lead us with is also that the demand side is growing. And the demand side is growing inexorably through the demographics and the fact that over 85 population is the fastest-growing part of the US population and within that Alzheimer's unfortunately and dementia care are two of the growing subsegments of the care that we provide. And so I think it's very important to think about the demand side and balance that as you look at the supply side. And I would turn it over to Bob to talk about the supply question.", "Robert Probst", "We mentioned in the prepared remarks that our inventory construction percentage is about 3.2%. That compares favorably to NIC. I think that reflects the advantage position we have in places like New York as we talked about earlier. There has been an uptick in certain markets for sure as Nick has talked about, as we observed. But again, it's spotty and we like our portfolio relative to where we see that growth. So net-net, not only do we feel good about the growth in the second half as I talked about, but as we think about the supply/demand equation, how that plays out overtime, we continue to be bullish about the SHOP portfolio.", "Vincent Chao", "Just maybe another question going back to the triple net portfolio, the 1.9% \u2013 1.6% same-store NOI growth, I know that does bounce around quarter to quarter and in some cases there might be some fees in there like last quarter. But is the 1.6%, was there anything driving it down the other way this time or is that sort of a normalized run rate outside of fee income that you might get every once in a while?", "Raymond Lewis", "So you are right to point out that from anyone quarter to another we may have more or less fee income in that portfolio. And you look at it over a 12-month period, it typically averages out. In this quarter, we actually had a tougher comp last year because of some fees. So that had a little bit of an impact on the growth rate, but again if you look at it year-to-date, we\u2019re at that 3.2% range which is in line with what is expectation for a normalized rate would be.", "Operator", "And the next question would be from the line of Todd Stender, Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender", "For the new multitenant medical office, the properties acquired in the HCT acquisition, can you go into some of the potential upside that you are looking at, particularly the group of assets that I think Ray talked about that you plan to internalize property management by year-end?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think we've already internalized property management on most of them. And Todd, do you just want to comment on where you're driving value once we take things over from third-party managers?", "Todd Lillibridge", "As Ray pointed out, of the 83, 37 of them are again basically single tenant triple net leased assets. But the portfolio that we\u2019ve insourced to date, namely 37 with the remaining five, we\u2019re bringing \u2013 obviously the leverage platform of those assets and putting in place, if you would, not only those best practices, but many of our cost-saving initiatives which is obviously going to result in driving NOI, while at the same time we see lease up opportunities in the portfolio as well.", "Todd Stender", "Have you guys bifurcated what that potential NOI contribution could look like on a percentage basis, just relative to what the same-store pool looks like?", "Todd Lillibridge", "No.", "Todd Stender", "Todd, while I have you, can you speak to the new medical office building you guys acquired in Indianapolis just to hear what the \u2013 it looks like the expected cash yield is 6.3, but maybe with the trailing number was and any occupancy numbers?", "Todd Lillibridge", "Yes, we\u2019re excited about the most recent acquisition in Indi; it\u2019s a follow-on really to a long-standing almost 12-year relationship we\u2019ve had with Ascension. Ortho Indy is a leading orthopedic practice in Indianapolis and in place, it has been I would say in this current facility for about a dozen years and we have remaining 11 year term on the lease. And as you said, we are in it at 6.3 with escalators and we see it a great contribution to our overall portfolio in Indi where our current occupancy in that portfolio is around 94% and we continue to get great same-store growth out of that portfolio. So good relationship with not only Ortho Indy who is already in our building, but Ascension overall which as many of you know is a leading Catholic health system around the country.", "Operator", "And the next question will be from the line of Juan Sanabria, Bank of America.", "Juan Sanabria", "I was just hoping you could speak to some of the large M&A we have seen in the insurer space, had them in CIGNA today, and any potential increased negotiating leverage they may have on some of the operators that could impact profitability in areas like Medicare Advantage. Have you had any of those conversations or do you have any thoughts you could share?", "Debra Cafaro", "Very interesting question. For all the real estate people on the call, I would just tell you healthcare is so exciting and we are so lucky to be in at the crossroads of real estate and healthcare. So whether it\u2019s the managed care mania that you're seeing with a lot of consolidation there, vertical integration with United and Catamaran PBM, whether it's CVS buying Omnicare which are two different businesses or hospital consolidation as we\u2019ve talked about, it is such a dynamic time to be in healthcare. And that's part of what is so exciting.", "In terms of the specific question you asked and I\u2019ll get off my soapbox is that when we talk about what kind of hospitals we want to invest in, we talk about quality and we talk about why is Ardent a great portfolio. And in that case, it is more of an analysis of dominant market position which is what Ardent has in areas that have good employment profiles, good demographic profiles, et cetera. And so because Ardent has that dominant market position, we feel very confident in their continued ability to drive pricing and volumes.", "Juan Sanabria", "With regards to maybe skilled nursing, I know we have seen some issues with pressures on and growing share of Medicare Advantage. Any thoughts on that with what we're seeing on the consolidation?", "Debra Cafaro", "I would say that Medicare Advantage continues to be a bigger part of the skilled nursing and post acute world. And the successful operators will be the ones who are able to manage into what will be a shorter length of stay, but by showing that they can deliver outcomes that are attractive to managed care providers and therefore increase the pipeline of patients that come from managed Medicare, because those are still very attractive patients for the providers.", "Raymond Lewis", "But our strategy, Juan, is really to back those operators that are consolidating in their local markets, you think about Kindred for instance where they have targeted the cluster markets and they are building out the entire post acute network with home health care, rehab, skilled nursing, LTCHs, and that really positions these operators, whether they are regional operators or national operators, in those markets to line up well with the managed care providers and provide an entire suite of post acute solutions.", "Juan Sanabria", "And just one other question from me. There's been some press articles about your potential interest in a piece of GE Healthcare Finance unit. Maybe you can't speak to that specifically, but if you participate in getting loans in some form, would the view be to having an angle towards or eventually getting a hand on the real estate or is this maybe another opportunity that maybe we should think about a little differently?", "Debra Cafaro", "First of all, my mother told me never to believe everything you read in the paper. So I\u2019ll start with that. And we do have \u2013 look, we don't comment obviously on field rumors as a matter of policy. We have a very small part of our portfolio that is a loan portfolio, as Bob talked about, and we use that sparingly. And we are very focused on being an equity REIT and building the kind of business that we've had consistent with our strategy and really focused on the these value creating activities with Ardent and CCP and that's where our focus is.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Derek Bower.", "Derek Bower", "I just had a couple follow-ups. On CCP, I believe in the Form 10 the pro forma for CCP in the first quarter was $0.72, which is about $0.18 on Ventas' share count. So could you remind us what the difference is again between that $0.18 and the $0.20 to $0.22 that Bob talked about? Is that just G&A synergies?", "Debra Cafaro", "Derek, part of what you have to remember is that the pro forma and so you\u2019ve got adjustments being made for example that you have the acquisitions that were made in the beginning of the year and pro forming those versus other changes that are made. So I don't know that that's really a good run rate, but there is, as well, some G&A synergies that are in there.", "Robert Probst", "Derek, to follow on that, you have three topics: you have the underlying NOI, you have the G&A implications and then the capital structure implications. And the number I quoted you I think is our best view of the real pro forma.", "Debra Cafaro", "Impact on Ventas.", "Robert Probst", "Impact on Ventas, very specifically, correct. And those things don't always follow the accounting rule, so we had some differences there.", "Derek Bower", "Then just going back to the CCP pipeline, Ray, can you talk about, as you guys are starting to work through the deals, what cap rates you are seeing in the market right now, whether it be for one-off assets or if there's anything different between the one-off and a small portfolio?", "Debra Cafaro", "The real property market continues to be firm; people are attracted to our assets for the reliability and growth in cash flow that they have provided, the base nature of the assets. And so from a cap rate standpoint, I would say cap rates have stayed relatively consistent with what we've seen in the past where high-quality senior housing and medical office is in the 5.5% to 6%, and even in some cases a B portfolio could be in that range if it has other attractive characteristics. And in terms of skilled nursing and post acute, really it's in that 6% to 9% range, depending on what it is and the credit and structure and so on.", "Derek Bower", "But as it relates to CCP and the skilled nursing deals, that would be, I imagine, the higher end of that range, so 8% to 9%. Is that the range that you guys are thinking about for new deals?", "Debra Cafaro", "Definitely the positive arbitrage in terms of external growth opportunities for CCP.", "Raymond Lewis", "I think that's right, Debbie. And so I think you're probably trending towards the upper end of that range, that 7.5% to 9%. These are operators where they have fewer capital alternatives and we\u2019re able to get a little bit better pricing power there. So that's sort of what we're seeing and it still has some really nice positive net investment spreads and that is part of the strategic thesis and the opportunity that we are looking to capitalize on.", "Derek Bower", "Are these primarily with existing or new tenants, or new operators that you are bidding on?", "Raymond Lewis", "Both.", "Derek Bower", "And then just last one from me. On the other US markets within your portfolio, can you just remind us again what's driving the double-digit EBITDA or NOI growth this quarter and last?", "Robert Probst", "Sure. It's a relatively small portfolio. You rightly pointed out that this performed very well. We've got some great assets in that pool and some for example a new development from us in Cape Cod is doing very, very well. So you have very specific sort of drivers than, but overall some strong assets in that pool.", "Operator", "And the next question will be from the line of Rich Anderson, Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "I thought I was early in the queue; apologize for keeping you going. Do you have any idea, maybe to Ray, where you think CCP will trade from an implied cap rate standpoint coming out of the gate?", "Debra Cafaro", "What a great question? That's for the market to decide.", "Rich Anderson", "Thank you. Yes it is, of course.", "Raymond Lewis", "I've got my roadshow coming up and I'm going to do my best to tell the story and hopefully the market will recognize what a great company we have.", "Rich Anderson", "Yes, obviously its market driven, but I didn't know if you had a collar that you were thinking about as you prepare for your roadshow. I guess the answer is no.", "Raymond Lewis", "We are going to do our best to tell the great story we have and we will let the market value that.", "Rich Anderson", "One of the differences between this quarter and last quarter in terms of language was in the \u2013 and I know we\u2019ve talked about a little bit more leverage in Ardent, but there was a leverage neutral language in the last quarter as far as the funding and now that has been removed. Is that a function of your stock being down 10% this year or is that just clarifying the language a little bit better based on what you just said earlier about long term versus short term leverage?", "Debra Cafaro", "It's just a timing issue.", "Rich Anderson", "So nothing has changed between then, last quarter and this quarter in terms of how you are thinking about funding it?", "Debra Cafaro", "We continue to think about accretion for example on a permanent leverage neutral basis.", "Rich Anderson", "And then maybe a question for Todd, some of the messaging has changed in my mind as it relates to medical office, specifically on versus affiliated off. I think more and more I'm hearing people say nicer things about affiliated off-campus. 72% of your portfolio is on-campus. I'm wondering if you think that that might show up a little bit in your strategy going forward. Your pure HCN likes off-campus better than many others, I'm wondering where you stand on that issue.", "Todd Lillibridge", "I think, Rich, for the past 20 plus years, we've always believed that affiliated is in fact the number one and key goal in all of this, irrespective of whether this it\u2019s on or off. It just so happens that we build a strong portfolio with a strong group of providers. As you know, 96% today is on and/or affiliated. I think what's important though is the quality of those that are affiliated, because in fact 89% of our portfolio, those that we\u2019re affiliated with are investment grade or better in terms of credit. So we put a lot of stock in who we partner with by the very nature of the hospital and their affiliation with the health system.", "We\u2019re very comfortable going off-campus, HCT acquisition, we were excited about because the affiliation that they have in those health systems, some very leading providers around the country as you know. So again, what\u2019s key in the off-campus is not only its affiliated, but it's of a size and what we would say have a comprehensive nature in terms of clinical services and quality they can deliver to the marketplace.", "So we have what I think is a great balance between 70 on and 30 off, roughly, and I think we're going to continue to see something of that same balance. Obviously, there is a lot of talk about off-campus, but freestanding and off and not affiliated or affiliated with a wrong system, I'm not so sure what you have.", "Debra Cafaro", "Affiliated with whom is important, on campus with whom, important.", "Todd Lillibridge", "Seeking the right partners has been the nature of this business as far as I\u2019m concerned since we got in it 30 years ago.", "Operator", "Next question is from Daniel Bernstein, Stifel.", "Daniel Bernstein", "So just a real quick question on seniors housing and the SHOP portfolio, it looks like management fees went down a little bit in the quarter. Did management fees tweak lower because of the performance in SHOP at all or is that just some seasonality that is not clearly visible?", "Robert Probst", "It's a small number. We think you will see fluctuations over time as we just have accruals in any one quarter that will vary. So I wouldn't say it's reflective of any sort of underlying trend.", "Daniel Bernstein", "There's no reset of any management fees at the Sunrise?", "Debra Cafaro", "No.", "Robert Probst", "No.", "Daniel Bernstein", "And then, Debbie, you said you were skating towards the puck and I think that you are referring towards the hospital. So what kind of opportunities are you seeing out there on the hospital landscape? Are you seeing more consolidation yet? Do you think you're going to see more consolidation? CMS last week or two weeks ago put out some more experimental bundled payment systems out there. So is the investment in Ardent itself, are you seeing \u2013 do you think there's going to be more hospital consolidation going forward the same way we are seeing on the insurance side and elsewhere in the healthcare systems?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I think we believe that the hospital segment is $1 trillion annual revenue market that is highly fragmented. It is rapidly consolidating and there aren\u2019t enough of quality assets in public hands like ours. So that's the basic thesis of the investment.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Todd, I guess maybe in a related question, we\u2019ve heard or seen more monetizations maybe in a trickle of medical office coming out from the hospital systems. Are you seeing more of those opportunities to buy more medical office? And on the same token are you seeing more development opportunities coming from the hospital systems as well? It just seems like MOB monetizations are just ticking up a little bit and I wanted to get your thoughts on that.", "Todd Lillibridge", "I would agree hospital related or hospital owned monetizations are a tick up, but to be honest with you it's not huge over prior years. That is on the acquisition front. And on the development front, we're starting to see some increased activity that is coming out of what I would call some historical highs and then going to historical lows here. Again, planning, but what really is converting into real deals is significantly down from the 2007, 2008 timeframe, that is development. So we will see some activity, but we don't see it to be as clearly as robust as it was in the past.", "Debra Cafaro", "And on the monetization, I believe we are as well positioned as anyone with our 400 plus clients to take advantage of increased monetization that may occur. And so that's good. And we will continue to mine that as Todd has done for a long time.", "Daniel Bernstein", "One quick question, Debbie. One of your S&P 500 peers, Simon, announced a $2 billion buyback with your shares down some. Under what circumstances would you want to buy back your shares? Would that be an appropriate strategy for Ventas or is that not an appropriate strategy for healthcare?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think our jobs as managers and as boards obviously are to be thoughtful stewards of shareholder capital. And over time that means as we have done and created a lot of value by growing and diversifying and building a high-quality portfolio, there may be times in the market where other strategies are appropriate such as dividend increases, et cetera. And basically our job is to make sure that we are pulling the levers that are appropriate at a given point in time to maximize shareholder value and maintain a good strategy and a high-quality company that can continue to deliver over and over, as I said it's the hallmark of Ventas.", "I think we have one more, so with that we\u2019ll clean up.", "Operator", "Final question is Michael Carroll, RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll", "With your recent Canford investment, did you say where those were located in the UK? And if I missed this, were those existing assets or were those developments?", "Debra Cafaro", "They are newly constructed homes that are in and around London.", "Michael Carroll", "And then how deep is Canford's platform and how big can you grow that relationship in the near-term?", "Debra Cafaro", "They are very experienced long-standing operators of senior housing in the UK. And we believe we can continue to potentially grow with them. Over time, I think they've managed over 70 homes during the last 20 years. They are very experienced.", "Michael Carroll", "I know the call is long, so I will stop there.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, that was a good cleanup. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today and as always for your interest in our company. We really appreciate your support and your interest and look forward to seeing you again soon.

My name is Katina and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call. Mr. Ryan Shannon, Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Ryan Shannon", "Thanks, Katina. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the Company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.", "As we've start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws.

Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Ryan and well done. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to Ventas' third quarter earnings call. After our prepared remarks, our senior leaders including Bob PRobst and John will be pleased to answer your question.", "At the outset, I want to state that Ventas is now a better, stronger and faster growing company, well positioned to deliver sustained excellence. We now have an even higher quality portfolio operated by the nation's leaders in five major asset types. Our portfolio is diverse and resilient with multiple areas of growth. Our team is lean and energized and our results are strong. I know I speak for all my colleagues at Ventas when I say, how excited I am to share our strategy, progress and prospects with you at our upcoming Investor Day on November 10.", "Today, I'll hit the highlights of an incredibly productive quarter that personifies what sets Ventas apart and demonstrates our winning edge. It's amazing that the inner disciplinary Ventas team completed two highly structured value creating complex transactions on a tax efficient basis without a snag at the high end of our expectations and in record time during the quarter. And we did so while continuing to deliver solid results.", "Our third quarter normalize FFO of $1.09 per share represents 7% comparable per share growth versus the same period last year. On the heels of this strong quarter, we are delighted to increase our full-year guidance for both normalize FFO per share and full company same store cash flow growth. When we step back our high quality diverse portfolio operated by the 20 operators that lead each sector accounted for our strong performance.", "Within the portfolio our metrics are market leading. For example, our NOI contribution from private pay assets stands at 83% and our post-acute quality mix is 75%. We have also maintained our significant scale at $30 billion of enterprise value, our diversification, financial strength, our high-quality senior housing operating portfolio and our best in class MOB franchise.", "From an investment standpoint, we completed our Ardent Hospital investment on a positive note this quarter. Specifically, we now have $1.3 billion invested in high quality healthcare assets in three key markets where Ardent enjoy a significant market share. Our unlevered going in cash yield is attractive at 8% before cost and about 7.5% on a fully loaded basis.", "The Ardent ownership group is aligned to ensure Ardent maintained its strong financial profile with room to grow. Currently expect the EBITDA ratio is in the low two times. Most importantly, Ardent is an excellent operator and had a great third quarter. In the third quarter Ardent grew its top and bottom line by mid single digit compared to last year. Ardent also showed positive trend in its key performance indicators during the quarter.", "We are confident we can grow with Ardent, because of its scalable platform and ownership groups\u2019 collective healthcare experience contacts in capital. We already have a few projects on the drawing board where we can help our Ardent expanded footprint in its existing market, including potential free scanning emergency department and new medical office building.", "Finally, as a result of our Ardent investment, we've received a notable increase in inbound enquiries from Quality Health System asking how Ventas can help them to grow, better serve patients and physicians and become more efficient.", "Turning to other asset classes, we continue to devote a meaningful amount of capital to redevelopment investments in our portfolio. These redevelopment investments provide excellent risk adjusted return and hence the quality of our portfolio drive superior growth and help our customers expand their market share.", "Examples of ongoing projects include an Atria redevelopment and our high end [indiscernible] Connecticut community and a major repositioning in our Edina, Minnesota Brookdale community. We also recently committed to fund two high-end senior housing developments in outstanding locations in San Francisco and Palm Beach County. In both cases, Ventas is the 20% to 25% managing partner in a joint venture with an institutional capital partner. Atria will manage both completed communities and the unlevered stabilized yields from the project should exceed 9%.", "Turning to another highlight of the quarter, we were delighted to affect our spinoff most of our Skilled Nursing Facilities operated by local and regional care providers at a valuation of $4.3 billion on a tax free basis. This innovative transaction improved our relative cost of capital, strategically repositioned our portfolio, enabled us to distribute to our shareholder CCP common equity value that $8.51 per Ventas share and provided us with $1.3 billion in cash. Post spin, Skilled Nursing Facilities or SNF represent just 4% of our net operating income and our retained SNFs are principally operated by our longstanding partner Kinder Healthcare.", "In addition to this spinoff, we've also executed year-to-date property dispositions and received loan repayments of $700 million, bringing our 2015 disposition total to nearly $5 billion. From a capital market standpoint, we've also been opportunistic and efficient this year, working around periods of volatility and excess supply. On the equity side for example, we've issued $2.7 billion of common equity at pre-spin pricing of $77 per share and raised $2.5 billion in bank and bond financing.", "Bob will address the particulars, but sufficed to say our liquidity is outstanding and our credit profile remains strong. On the investment side, we\u2019re pleased with our completed acquisition volume totaling $5.2 billion year-to-date. With interest rates still low and the private bid for cash flowing assets still high, this quarter we saw some notable large transactions price at historically low cap rate.", "That said we\u2019re beginning to see some sign of wider bid ask spread and longer marketing periods for certain of our asset types. With our emphasis on making value creating investment decisions and our relentless focus on cost of capital, we\u2019re approaching the investment market with discipline. We\u2019re picking the sports where we see accretion, solid risk adjusted return, great real estate, compelling strategic set or the opportunity to help a customer.", "So we\u2019re executing a clear and decisive strategy at Ventas. As we've done so many times in the past, we believe we\u2019re ahead of the market as we invest capital, select operating partners and make portfolio disposition decisions across a broad array of healthcare asset classes.", "We've great momentum at Ventas. We\u2019re looking forward to demonstrating our strategy for sustained growth and excellence, shining a bright light on the terrific Ventas\u2019 team and showing the sophistication and scale of our key operating partners at our upcoming Investor Day. We can't wait to see you there. Bob.", "Robert Probst", "Thanks Debby. Let me begin by reviewing the performance of our portfolio of high quality assets in the third quarter. I would note that unless otherwise indicated my discussion of our portfolio performance excludes the CCP assets that just spun out of Ventas in mid-August.", "Overall the third quarter delivered strong portfolio performance with same store cash NOI growing 4.3% year-over-year. Our triple net lease assets, which account for approximately 45% of total NOI delivered accelerated growth in the third quarter. Cash NOI for the 511 triple net properties in the same-store pool grew 5.7% in the third quarter of 2015 versus prior year.", "Same-store NOI growth in the quarter benefited from the $15 million positive annual rent increase for the 48 Kindered assets released with Ventas in October 2014. Even after adjusting for this releasing benefit, which will cycle out October 01, 2015 our triple net same-store NOI grew at 3.4% in the quarter demonstrating a faster growing portfolio following the CCP spin.", "Cash flow coverage in our same-store triple net lease portfolio for the second quarter of 2015, the latest available information was strong at 1.6 times. Overall, the property level cash flow performance for our triple net operators was solid growing 3.5% in the quarter. Our senior housing portfolio reported stable trailing 12 months coverage at 1.3 times, while our Skilled Nursing coverage improved from 1.8 times to two times as result of the CCP spin.", "Turning now to SHOP. NOI in the 239 properties in our same-store portfolio increased 3.2% in the third quarter of 2015 over 2014. In sum, it was a solid quarter but fell slightly short of our expectation. Our core markets continue to outperform well, driving strong rate in NOI growth in the quarter the total performance was modestly affected by discreet assets specific issues and limited supply impact.", "Our NOI performance was led by continued strong growth across many of our high barrier to entry into locations. Our largest MSA in New York grew NOI nearly 7% in the quarter, while other key markets such as Los Angeles, Boston and San Jose also demonstrated very strong growth in the quarter. In total, our core markets represent more than 60% of our portfolio and has consistently been the engine of growth in short. Further NOI growth in tertiary market such as Cape Cod continued to be favorable in the quarter and the yields of productive development and redevelopment activity.", "Turning to the challenges, specific asset level performance issues in Chicago, Atlanta and Jacksonville contributed 150 basis point drag overall NOI growth in the quarter. We are working alongside our operators to address these specific issues. Additionally, select markets were impacted by new buildings openings over the last year within our relevant trade area, for example, in markets such as Houston and Riley. That said less than 5% of our overall NOI experienced new supply pressure in the quarter.", "Looking ahead at new constructions, we continue to refine our methodology to assess supply impacts and now incorporates seven mile and three mile trade areas around our leased assets based on population density. On net basis, more than 17% of our portfolio does not face a supply surplus based on the third quarter NIC data. Against this backdrop, Ventas and our SHOP operators are working to drive operational excellence to continue to performance across all markets as we planned for 2016.", "In particular, I would like to call up the exceptional performance of our leading operator and partner Atria, accounting for roughly two-thirds of our SHOP NOI, Atria has consistently delivered excellent top and bottom line growth year-in and year-out, including in 2015. I'm fired up that our investor day on November 10th will be at the Atria headquarters. We believe this day will bring to life for our investors, the quality of the Atria team and the scale and sophistication of the operation that underlies this outperformance.", "Finally, let me turn to our market leading Lillibridge MOB business. For the third quarter 2015, NOI in the total portfolio of 358 properties was $95 million, an increase of 38% over the third quarter of 2014. Performance was driven by solid same-store growth as well as the addition of 83 properties in January. In the 274 properties in the same-store portfolio year-over-year cash flow growth was 3.1%.", "This was driven by an increase in rental rate of 2.6% and strong expense controls, offset by a marginal decrease in occupancy. Sequentially, occupancy in the same-store pool has trended up consistently since the first quarter, including 10 basis points sequential occupancy gain in Q3 to 92.5%. So the MOB portfolio continues to deliver stable and reliable performance and growth.", "I would like to now turn to the Company's financials. I'm pleased to report solid FFO performance in the third quarter and our third consecutive increase to our FFO guidance range for the full-year. We're also increasing our full-year company-wide same-store cash flow guidance. One note before diving in, I will discuss our financial performance on both the reported and comparable basis. Our reported numbers include the results of CCP properties for all periods up to August 17, 2015.", "Comparable results adjust all current and prior periods for the assess of the CCP spinoff as if the spin was completed on January 1, 2014. We think comparable comparison therefore provide a true apples-to-apples view of our underlying performance.", "Looking at the third quarter, we delivered reported normalized FFO of $365 million or $1.9 per fully diluted share. On a comparable basis, normalized FFO of $0.98 grew 7% versus the third quarter of 2014. The solid Q3 growth over 2014 is primarily due to the positive impact of accretive acquisitions and same-store portfolio NOI growth of 4.3%. These growth drivers were partially offset with a dilutive impact of $683 million in year-to-date asset dispositions, including an additional $90 million through their last earnings call.", "Early in the third quarter of 2015, Ventas issued and sold a total of 1 million shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $67 million under our at-the-market equity offering program, of which approximately 580,000 shares was previously reported. Also as previously reported in July 2015, Ventas issued 500 million of [408] (Ph) senior notes due 2026.", "In August, in connection with the Ardent acquisition, the company also completed a $900 million five year term loan. Also in August, the company received a dividend from CCP of $1.3 billion. Ventas used these proceeds to repay $1 billion of debt at an effective rate of 3.3%. Debt repayment focused on near-term maturities and mortgages, resulting in an even more attractive maturity profile with a staggered weighted average debt maturity of 7.1 years.", "The company's net debt to EBITDA at September 30, 2015 is 6.1 times, only modestly above our five to six time targets. Current debt-to-enterprise value now stands at 36%. The company has strong liquidity with approximately $2 billion available under its revolving credit facility as well as $65 million of cash on hand.", "With that let me now turn to our updated guidance for the full year 2015. We're pleased to raise and narrow our guidance for reported normalized FFO per diluted share to now range between $4.43 and $4.46, representing 7% to 8% growth over prior year on a comparable basis. This new guidance represented $2.5 raise at the midpoint versus our previous outlook of $4.39 to $4.45.", "We now project full-year total company same-store cash NOI growth of between 3.5% and 4% in 2015, up from the previous 2.5% to 3.5% guidance range. We're updating our same-store SHOP NOI guidance to now range from 2% to 3%, in line with our year-to-date growth of 2.6%. Our triple net same-store growth guidance range is now increased to 5.5% to 6% as a result of the CCP spend and the positive Kindered releasing impact, while our MOB guidance is narrow to range from 2.5% to 3%. We have assumed no further material unannounced acquisitions, new equity or that issuance or asset dispositions in our guidance.", "Finally, to enhance our transparency and respond to shareholder request, we have expanded our investor disclosure in two areas this quarter. First, on pages 23 and 24 of our supplemental reporting, we provide a quarter analysis of our comparable numbers and related CCP impacts. Second on our full property listing on our webpage, we have now included at an asset level a breakdown of our assisted living, independent living and memory care residence splits for our SHOP portfolio.", "With that my colleagues and I will be happy to open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria representing Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Juan Sanabria", "Good morning. I was just hoping to start out, you could speak a little bit about the hospital business and opportunities you see there and if the recent volatility and weakness, some of the public operators has changed your thinking at all, or how you view cap rates potentially for asset opportunities. And if any of the cost pressures were seen in any of the public operators has filtered through to your exposure with Ardent?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning, Juan and thanks for the question. Obviously, we've had a long-term secular thesis on the hospital business, which we're lucky enough to have begun to execute during the second quarter. We have always been focused on quality, quality real estate, quality at hospital operators and as a owner of the real estate, obviously are very focused on the EBITDA line. And I think it's very important to understand that we see Ardent having a very good third quarter and even HCA, I would tell you, announced earnings on the EBITDA line that were at the high end of its previously provided guidance range. And so there is a lot of stability on that big EBITDA line and that's we look at as we try to think about the hospital business, because we are at the top of the capital structure in what we do.", "And in addition, we look at this as having a very high coverage ratio in the case of Ardent in the high two to three EBITDA level. So, we believe this could create a good opportunity for us as we've outlined our strategy to help Ardent grow and really build a hospital business with high quality providers and that thesis remains on target. And we believe that some of the volatility in one particular case has to do with an acquisition and it's not really with the underline fundamentals as we've talked about on the EBITDA line. So that's how we think about it and we would be happy to take any follow-up questions that you have.", "Juan Sanabria", "And just switching gears to the SHOP portfolio, you mentioned some one-off assets specific issues, I think in Chicago, Atlanta and Jacksonville. If maybe you could just elaborate on that just because a couple of those markets screen as high supply markets from NIC perspective and I think you also mentioned that looking at this three mile and seven mile radius that your portfolio doesn\u2019t face supplier issues versus the NIC data. And I was just wondering how we should think about versus the NIC data, is that just you are not at a higher level than the NIC data or you are in line with it or what's your threshold for elevated supply I guess?", "Robert Probst", "Yes Juan, this is Bob. Let me start with the change in methodology, because I think that frames the conversation. What we've done is, we've looked at population density to determine what the appropriate rings are and traditionally we looked at our trade area of three mile radius. We think in many markets a seven mile radius makes more sense, in the top highest density market three mile s continues to make sense for us, but we've fined it to reflect for less dense market that have a broader ring, which we think is appropriate.", "Against that backdrop, we've looked at what are the openings that we've seen in that context in the last 12 months in our markets, and on that basis there are select markets and I highlighted for example, Houston as an example where we have seen an impact and that is affecting our performance. However, today as we look at the quarter, the supply issue really doesn't expand more broadly than that. I think quoted roughly 5% of our business really has been affected as you look at those rings.", "As we look through the windshield we look forward based on start as that\u2019s based on - opening is based on starts. We highlighted we do see obviously an impact and indeed we've updated our supplemental to reflect that as you look on page 13 you'll see how we've refined that. But against that as we look at the market and say based on construction, where do we think we\u2019re, we see 70% of our portfolio 70 where we don't see an excess supply situation.", "Obviously that imply through our markets where there is a supply challenge and to the Atlanta point that would be one, but there are others. Nonetheless, we think 70% is insulated and that really plays to the high barrier to entry market that we participate in. So it is a market-by-market conversation and we think we've refined the analysis as we address it this quarter.", "Juan Sanabria", "And is there any rough sum to what defines excess?", "Robert Probst", "We've really looked at what is the underlying absorption rate in a market and taking into account not only obsolescence, but population growth and penetration and against that where do we think we have more than the normal absorption rate. And we've ball parked that around the 3% sort of range. So we look at that as a threshold against which more than that would really start to become an excess situation. So that\u2019s how we viewed it.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay great and then just last question for me just quickly. If you are seeing any pressures on expenses or what should we be expecting for particular I guess wage growth across the businesses, I\u2019ve been more focused on your idea given your exposure there?", "Robert Probst", "Right, well if you look at the same-store P&L in the quarter, you'll see revenue and expenses largely growing in line with each other, margin as a consequence roughly in line. We do see wage pressure I mean we've talked about that before, the challenge and the opportunities continue to drive productivity against that and have been largely successful on doing that. So as a result, holding in line the rates and the expenses that will vary as you segment the markets and you look quarter-to-quarter there is always some lumpiness inherent in there, but generally speaking, we've nailed to hold that in line.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose representing Citigroup. Please proceed.", "Smedes Rose", "Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask you, you mentioned in your opening remarks some wider bid ask spread and longer marketing times for assets. Could you maybe just talk a little more specifically about what kinds or markets you are seeing wider bid asks and maybe by - across the asset types, and maybe a comment on the product of quality that\u2019s coming to market and overall volume?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. Good morning Smedes. I'm going to turn it over John Cobb. I would say in asset types where perhaps people are bringing lesser [B-ish] (Ph) assets that\u2019s probably where we\u2019re seeing it the most, but John can elaborate.", "John D. Cobb", "Right. You're seeing definitely a widening of the bid ask spreads on more B style assets both in the MOB sector also the senior housing sector. I think when we\u2019re looking we definitely had a lot of more inbounds on the hospital sector where we\u2019re seeing high quality operators come through and we\u2019re right on mark on the spreads there.", "Smedes Rose", "And Bob your leverage came in at 6.1 times, I know it's just a little bit about the high-end of your target range. Could you talk about maybe the plan to bring that down a little bit?", "Robert Probst", "Sure Smedes. We highlighted last quarter as you recall that we expected to be modestly above six times as a consequences of the spin, which was a leveraging event at 6.1 times where we we\u2019re expected to be. At the time, we talked about just having multiple gloves in our bag and those continue to be available to us. We highlighted some additional disposals in the quarter that\u2019s certainly something we will continue to evaluate.", "Obviously we have underlying cash flow that can delever naturally overtime and then equity obviously is an option. So, we are not in a rush, we are patient, the good news is we have great liquidity, I highlighted our maturity profile, the availability under the revolver, and so we want to make sure we're opportunistic and patient and do the right thing. So, pretty much right at where we thought we would be.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico representing UBS. Please proceed.", "Nick Yulico", "Well thanks, good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi Nick.", "Nick Yulico", "The talk was that - it sounds like you are thinking supply has not been that much of an impact, yet if you look at your occupancy year-over-year was down 20 basis points in the stabilized pool, I mean that's basically exactly what the industry did for the NIC data. So, if it's not supply causing that occupancy pressure, what else is it?", "Robert Probst", "Yes, thanks for the question. I highlighted two different drivers in the quarter that were driving some of the weakness and the primary one was more I call it asset specific factors and I highlighted Chicago, Atlanta, Jacksonville. One of the themes if you look within these markets at specific assets that can have a material impact is ED turnover, the executive director at the local level. I mean if they are strong they leave that can have an impact in the short run on occupancy and indeed we saw that in all three of those markets that I highlighted and that was a significant driver.", "I mentioned the overall same-store performance was affected by a 150 basis points by the performance in those three markets, so you can see that can have a material impact on the overall. Obviously we then talked about the fact, the job is to make sure that we are continuing to work to fill those slots with great people and address the other issues that are \"non-supply related\" and that's where the operational excellence of leading our operators like Atria can really come to shine. So we're working hand-in-hand with our operators to make sure we address those issues as they arise.", "Debra Cafaro", "And we did see sequential increase in occupancy in the third compared to the second in the same-store portfolio.", "Robert Probst", "Correct.", "Nick Yulico", "Right okay and then for those three markets I mean have you already - has the operator or you already made changes where we should assume that that occupancy issue or that NOI issue is already sort of fixed or this can also be sort of a problem for the fourth quarter?", "Robert Probst", "Well look I think naturally in the portfolio of multiple assets, you are always going to have some issues right. And I also highlighted the fact that we have I call them the engine of growth in our core markets, 60% of business which has consistently performed very strongly, New York at 7% in the quarter would be the case study of that. For the specific asset issues, absolutely we're working to address those and in some cases we've already taken action.", "I wouldn't want to pretend that's all going to be fixed in a day or in a quarter, it takes time to address these issues, but as I think about them they are transitory, there are things we can address, there are things where you have leading operators to drive great performance, we are having great staffing, consistent systems, great recruitment and those are the ways that the winners can win in the industry. So, we are absolutely working on it, in these markets particularly we hope to see improvement, but I don't want to pretend it's going to be tomorrow.", "Nick Yulico", "And I guess just some follow-up on that is that you are talking about ED's leading, I mean presumably if they are leading maybe they are going to newly build communities right? So wouldn't that be a supply impact?", "Debra Cafaro", "I don't think you can draw a straight line between those at all, I do think in general in the industry there is 50% or so ED turnover in general and so that is just a fact of life in the industry and so, these are just specific markets where I think we're working with the operators to just improve staffing at the building. So I think those are more typical what I would say industry issue that Bob is describing.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay, thanks. Just lastly any - can we get an update on where occupancy is trending so far in the fourth quarter for the year on SHOP portfolio? Thanks.", "Robert Probst", "Yes, Thanks. Inherently in the outlook we gave for the full-year, we're assuming we're going to have some modest growth sequentially in occupancy third quarter to fourth quarter and against that to be able to hold our rate. The spot to your point, spot performances would just suggest that's a reasonable assumption. I think it's important to highlight that we will see some year-on-year challenges, we had some non-recurring benefits in the prior year that were going to be lapping. So that's inherent in that forecast as well, I think the underlying sort of revenue profile though will be solid and very consistent with what we saw this quarter.", "Nick Yulico", "Thank u.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks Nick.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein representing Stifel. Please proceed.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Hi, good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hey Dan.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Hi. So, not that everybody [indiscernible] a couple of questions on that also. If we look at your portfolio today where the construction is, it doesn't look too concerning, but the general start cadence has been moving up, and up, and up for the last four or five quarters. What's your general view and concerns about, if we've look out 12 months 24 months - further down the line or how concerned are you about to supply getting I would say out of hand or just significantly higher than where we are today.", "Robert Probst", "Well, I would start with the couple with the factors. We highlighted 70% of our portfolio today. We think is insulted based on the methodology that I described and we do have a great portfolio in that regard. That said, 30%, certainly does have exposure and we've seen that trend up as NIC has highlighted, no question about it. So what are we doing against that? I mentioned operational excellence is one way to really partner with the legs of the Atria to drive outperformance, so this is also about share gain.", "I think there is an opportunity to drive penetration. We've talked a lot about the value proposition of senior housing and how we need to make sure that's well understood. At 10% penetration it doesn't take more than one point of penetration growth to fill all the building in the United States. So that's clearly an opportunity. I mean at the same time, we have to think about portfolio strategy and how we think about our markets and our assets in that context and all of those things as we play our portfolio that as we look forward we think are going to be necessary and important. That said, we like senior housing, we like the SHOP business, we like our operators, we like our position and we are bullish on continuing to drive growth in that business.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Have you seen any current new developments start to struggle and discount against your properties at this point, I mean the other I guess related to question to that would be, if we can get really granular on the construction that's out there, what kind of price point are those assets that relative to your assets in those markets. I mean I think that's not just a level of construction, but what's being built out there as well that I would like to hear about relative to your portfolio", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean, I think in general, we've taken a conservative or broad approach in terms of what's competitive with our asset across different price point. So that's actually a more conservative slice at looking at developments and I think from time and memorial in real estate you see that when new assets are filling, generally their owners will try to do that on an accelerated basis and that's typically where you see the impact and then that impact tends to evaporate as the new building sells. So, there is nothing different in what we're seeing than what you would normally see in this part of the cycle.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay. And then switching gears a little bit to the investment side of the external growth in portfolio, you are starting to see bid ask spreads widen out, but I would say they are probably pretty thin relative to historical levels. At the same time, we see high yield bond spreads really have widened out, but do you see any opportunities to - again maybe this isn\u2019t a long-term strategy but a short-term strategy to go ahead and invest a little bit more on the CMBS side or somewhere in a debt stack within the healthcare real estate?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good question. I think there has been a good level of stickiness on cap rates, because the assets continue to be attractive to institutional capital and international capital, et cetera and that really speaks to the resiliency and the quality and the strong cash flow from assets like we own which is good. We have seen the debt market widen out in terms of spread and we've done a good job over the years of taking advantage of different spots in the capital stack, because we are expert capital providers and that's part of I think to excellence that we bringing and so we are constantly evaluating in our investments decisions across the board, public-to-public, private-to-public, we're in the capital stack mez, bonds, et cetera within the healthcare universe.", "We believe there are good risk adjusted returns and opportunities and still maintain a diversified portfolio, still have a margin at safety and still the strong balance sheet and so I think there could be a opportunities in that vein and we're constantly as part of our investment team is evaluating those opportunities.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay. I appreciate that. Not a question, but just a general comment. Thank you for expanded information on the senior housing portfolio and the supplement on website is very helpful. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well we appreciate your saying so. So we work - there is a lot of people here who worked very, very hard to make Ventas excellent and also be responsive and transparent to the investment community and so we appreciate your saying so.", "Daniel Bernstein", "I'm happy to do so. I'll hop off and let others ask questions. Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "All right, let\u2019s roll. Next up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya representing Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Good morning everyone. Just a two specific short questions and one kind of longer one if you can indulge me. First of all, I just want to make sure I got this right for 2015 guidance same-store NOI growth guidance is 3.5% to 4%, but yet as a 3Q year-to-date you are at 4.4%, is that something you would need to happening in the fourth quarter that I'm missing?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes.", "Robert Probst", "Yes, I highlighted the - short answer yes. I highlighted the Kindred releasing benefit that is coming to an end October 1, so you will cycles out of that in the fourth quarter. Even without that you are above 3% and that\u2019s above where were previous CCP spin. So it demonstrates accelerated growth there.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Yes, totally got it thank you now. MOB portfolio 3Q pretty strong same-store NOI growth of 3.6%, but a lot of it seemed expense driven rather than top line driven. Just curious further outlook to kind of maintain operating expenses at current levels or if would expect to see a slowdown in same-store NOI growth going forward if the top line doesn\u2019t move much?", "Todd Lillibridge", "Tayo this is Todd. We continue to control given our platform, our expense line. I think we've done that you year-over-year consistently around our controllable. I think you are seeing that here in the third quarter which again we continue to see and we\u2019ll see that really throughout the balance of this year.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Got it, okay.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, and occupancy trended up in the quarter sequentially.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Okay that\u2019s helpful and then lastly Debby this one is more for you. It's just I mean we've brought up a lot of concerns that the investors have had about the hospital space over the past month or so and given the results that some other public guys have had. Brookdale has had its own unique issues that\u2019s creating concerns about the outlook for senior housing. You are seeing a couple of the Skilled Nursing guys who are talking about pressure on volumes and also kind of talking about all this DOJ OIG investigations into overbilling on the therapy side. I mean there just seems to be a lot of headline risk across several of the healthcare property types. Sort of against that backdrop I mean what can Ventas really do to kind of just prevent people getting overly concerned about these issues and the potential impact on the company whether will or not?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay, well that\u2019s a big question, I'll try to answer it briefly. It is fun to be in healthcare right now. I have talked about it as a dynamic sector. 20% of the GDP and like real estate 20% of GDP and we feel lucky to be at the intersection of those. We have a long-term secular thesis in the hospital business, which as I mentioned, we continue to espouse and believe there will be opportunities in this $1 trillion revenue business in the U.S. that is the nerve centre of healthcare, top of the food chain whatever label you would like to put on it and I think there is lots of opportunities there as healthcare continues to evolve those, hospital providers are going to be in the centre of it all with more and more influencing and control over where patients are treated and physicians and so on.", "So we remain excited about that and I think again, we have a great history in healthcare, we have managed Ventas for the benefit of shareholders through every imaginable reimbursement, capital markets and economic cycles and we have continued to deliver and perform. And so the way we address all of that excitement if you will cross sectors and healthcare is a due we've always done which is to find the operators, invest in the best real estate, have a margin at safety, stay financially strong and flexible and be really, really smart about how we work on diversification, portfolio mix and so on.", "And I think our hospital investment is evidence of that. Our spin is evidence of that. Our building, the MOB business with Todd is evidence of that. And so everybody has their ups and downs, everybody has their cycles. I think business teaches you to be humble, but at the same time we have demonstrated over and over again that we are good at managing this company for the benefit of shareholders and delivering results.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "All right Debby Cafaro for NIC president 2016, I like that.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well thank you very much. So let\u2019s move on to our next questioner.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson representing Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.", "Richard Anderson", "Thank you. Good morning. It's a quick yes or no question. Maybe if I could paraphrase your hospital kind of thesis given the uncertainty out there. You view that as an opportunity from the standpoint of consolidation perspective, is that the right way to kind of paraphrase your view on hospitals right now?", "Debra Cafaro", "That\u2019s one part of it, yes.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay, I said yes or no. So I guess I'll stop there. The triple net growth of 5.5% to 6% what does that compare to previously? How much of that go up with the spin of CCP?", "Robert Probst", "Rich it's Bob. It's a little bit tough to kind of what you way through that because there is Kindred impact I described which cycled out October 1. If you take that out and you look to other performance in the quarter we are in aggregate well above 3% and in triple net above 4%.", "Debra Cafaro", "which it was 2% to 3%.", "Robert Probst", "And it was 2% to 3%. I think as we step back and think about when you look sort of like-for-like overtime what\u2019s the differential in growth rates in triple net as a consequence of the spin, we could see something in the sort of neighbourhood of 40 basis points as a good proxy. So, when you kind of cut through it all that's how we think about it.", "Richard Anderson", "And then last question, Debby you could probably give an unvarnished view on skilled nursing now at 4% excuse me of your portfolio. A lot of talk about CMS and bundling and all sorts of pilot programs to move people out of post-acute into home health. I'm curious to what degree you think that that would be a concern in the space and also to what degree it cause you to spin off CCP, how much the dog wag the tail or the tail wag the dog from your perspective on that specific issue?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I mean look we've always said that we believed that Skilled Nursing Facility and other post-acute have a critical role to play in the delivery of care to seniors in the U.S. and we continue to believe that. I would say that as we go toward bundled payments and things like that I do believe we're going to see the hospital providers controlling a lot more at the dollars, which again plays into our hospital as the nerve centre thesis. And there will be a role clearly for a low cost setting, outpatient care, like we own with the Lillibridge business and that's an important part of the evolution that healthcare, but we do believe that the hospital business is going to continue to influence more and more of where patients go in post-acute settings.", "And to that point we specifically kept for example Kindred that is a leading post-acute provider in the U.S. and as we see them execute an excellent [indiscernible] around integrated care markets, I think they with the data that they have and the expertise and skill they have will likely be a winner as healthcare continues to evolve. So, long answer, but we believe in the post-acute space, we're happy with the portfolio that we've retained and we do think the hospitals will continue to play a larger role frankly in post-acute care with bundling going forward.", "Richard Anderson", "Are you hanging more of your hat on Kindred's home health business now, you think?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I think what's interesting is that we're hanging our hat more on Kindred as the leading post-acute provider with this very evolved, integrated care strategy in their market where they can be a one-stop shop for post-acute patients in any setting as they are discharged from the hospital. And so that's what we like about the Kindred story.", "Richard Anderson", "Understood. Thank you very much.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you Rich.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Kim representing BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "John Kim", "Thank u. On your 2015 guidance, your merger related and audit expenses went up significantly to $154 million for the year from $85 million last quarter. Can you just discuss why there was such a large increase in just the past three months?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes.", "Robert Probst", "Sure, yes, there is really a couple of key factors there, one is obviously we closed Ardent in the quarter and so we had the deal cost associated with that. And then secondly we had obviously the spin separation related cost on that, both of those we kind of consider our transactional expenses.", "Debra Cafaro", "And the spin was not in the previous, because we had not guided to that.", "Robert Probst", "Right, exactly we had not included the spin costs as you recall in the last call, but plans to do so once we have spun it out. So those two really are what is driving that difference, it\u2019s obviously focused in the third quarter where all the action happened.", "John Kim", "So, your prior guidance even though the full-year guidance did not include the expected costs from CCP?", "Robert Probst", "Correct, we were explicitly excluding the impact of CCP. We gave you the dimensions of it in terms of $0.20 to $0.22 that quarter, but we didn't give the specifics particularly around things like transaction separation costs.", "John Kim", "Okay. Well, this year it's over 10% of your FFO and transactions do occur every year. So, can you just maybe discuss why it's added to normalized FFO?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, it's an apples-to-apples comparison. We have always had normalized FFO, net of transaction cost, because obviously we exclude forward transactions from our guidance and if we simply stop doing transactions that cost would go away. So, we are trying to give investors the clearest indication of the underlined performance of the company. So that's why we started doing it year ago and why we had continued to do it on a consistent basis.", "John Kim", "Debby based on your discussion of the wide bid ask spreads in the market, is the logical progression that until cap rates move up that acquisitions and disposition volume will probably slowdown or continue to slowdown?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well again as I mentioned, we are disciplined investors and I think we have the opportunity to move around the wheel in terms of our diverse asset type that we have and so that's a real benefit to us, but we've really identified the kinds of activity that we think will be value creating and we're at the strategic, great real-estate, we are helping the customer and so on and so acquisition volume is always difficult to predict which is why we don't it, but we have acquired probably I don't know $3 billion plus a year over the past consistently over the past years and we will know what our volume is as we evaluate opportunities and see which one of them we think create good value for our shareholders.", "John Kim", "But that would be on the disposition side of block and does that slowdown in third quarter?", "Debra Cafaro", "We had originally I think talked in the beginning at the year about half a billion potentially for 2015. So we've well exceeded that with the $700 million year-to-date, so we feel good about that and we will continue to try to be thoughtful and good capital allocation includes, reviewing assets for sale and we'll continue to try to do a good job there as we look into 2016 as well.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then finally on Brookdale, can you just discuss if you have seen any deterioration in operations and in any of your assets with them?", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean, I think our experience with Brookdale is very consistent with their publically reported information.", "John Kim", "So that would be a yes?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think, they have - again it's pretty consistent with their overall public performance.", "John Kim", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott representing Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.", "Michael Knott", "Hey, good morning. Few questions\u2026", "Debra Cafaro", "Hey Michael.", "Michael Knott", "Hi. On the revised 2015 SHOP guidance range, why that so large for one quarter lastly, it sort of implies of four point possible range for 4Q?", "Robert Probst", "Good question. I think we feel on the base case pretty solid. I think we mentioned we're continuing to do something to try to drive growth and that's going to result in some over under. So it might be overly wide to your point, but I think we want to leave ourselves a little bit of flexibility. So, I think run rate as I kind of go back to - if you look at the underlying run rate, we feel pretty confident in the fourth quarter revenue line and kind of we're that's going to come out.", "Michael Knott", "Okay and then I'm going to use the modified version of Richard Anderson's yes or no, if you had to make a bet on where you will set 2016 SHOP guidance will be better or worse than the 2% to 3% for 2015?", "Debra Cafaro", "I can\u2019t wait to talk to you about that.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. So you are not going to opine on that one?", "Debra Cafaro", "That's a very consistent process we follow to rollout guidance and there is lot of work involved to do so and we will be happy to share that with you when it's ready.", "Robert Probst", "We're working on that process with our operators right now.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. I thought Rich\u2019s approach might help me on that one. If you theoretically broke out your NOI growth, just conceptually for next year for SHOP, just staying on that same topic if you thought about it split between the 70% that you say is supply protected and the other 30%, how wide is that gap between those two buckets?", "Debra Cafaro", "Isn't that a variation on the first?", "Michael Knott", "Or just with your 2% to 3% for 2015 maybe you can think about it that way. Is it that materially different or not?", "Robert Probst", "Yes, look I think where there is new supply that comes online, there will be an impact. There is no question about it and that will look different than the New York City and where you have and continue to see consistent growth, what's that spread it\u2019s not something I would want to call today, but I assume it will be a differential. I think the thing we keep coming back to is to say the core engine is performing well, we like that. Our job is to make sure we continue to look at that other pieces there and how we can address that and to quantify that at this stage would be tough.", "Michael Knott", "Okay last one for me if I can. Just on the triple net portfolio within senior housing, it looks like the occupancy has continued to decline, so I'm just curious A, on the supply concern there and then B, is that coverage at risk of kicking down in other word you have two decimals.", "Debra Cafaro", "Can I just return to the prior thing, I mean obviously we have a lot of our triple net senior housing portfolio with Brookdale and this is second quarter data. So again, I think it's pretty much consistently following the publically announced comments from Brookdale that has an outside impact and again we believe they are going to get that back on track and so we feel good about that portfolio.", "Michael Knott", "Okay, but it's not at risk of rounding down to the next coverage level?", "Debra Cafaro", "At some point theoretically, but again it's a trailing 12 months number through the second quarter and it\u2019s been pretty consistent there at 1.3.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. Fair enough thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler representing KeyBank Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Jordan Sadler", "Good morning. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi Jordan.", "Jordan Sadler", "Good morning. So, I'm looking at the disclosure for the senior housing operating portfolio the trade area construction, the 4.1% supply number. Is that consistent with disclosure from last quarter or could you give us what that number was last quarter?", "Robert Probst", "Yes. So it has changed, you are absolutely correct. The 4.1% is on the methodology as I described earlier with seven mile and three mile range, the old methodology was three only. On the three only basis we would have been at 3.2%.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay and what was the last quarter of seven mile basis, do you have that?", "Debra Cafaro", "We have it on the three mile basis.", "Robert Probst", "Yes on a three mile basis, so like-for-like 3.2% last quarter 3.2% this quarter. So trend wise under the old methodology no change.", "Jordan Sadler", "And under the new methodology trend wise, do we know?", "Robert Probst", "We haven\u2019t got that\u2026", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay, I get it. And then I guess along the same lines, but really taking it from the other side, the demand side. We see the population growth estimates and we know them, but you sort of I think probably touched on the potential for increased penetration that could fill up the entire portfolio globally, nationwide. Can you talk about what you are seeing from a penetration standpoint sort of efforts to increase the level of penetration and if you think they are effective.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I think it's interesting, Bob comes from a marketing type companies and consumer products. And I think it's fair to say that we\u2019re still somewhat neanderthal in our industry from his standpoint about how the market and improved market share, and I think his experience is going to help us and our operators to get better at that. But it's really interesting. I think the industry has incredible opportunities to sell the value proposition of what we are offering in senior housing. The wellness benefits to a senior of not being isolated, which has been deemed to be more dangerous than smoking.", "And also to sell - in selling the value proposition to charge for the kind of tier that\u2019s being delivered to. In many cases high acuity residents. So that\u2019s the big opportunity. I think you see also the opportunity for sales and marketing efforts which are really all kidding aside that\u2019s very rudimentary levels Brookdale is now of course rolling out its new marketing campaign which is I don\u2019t know if you have seen it, but it's quite good. And I think we have opportunities again on selling that value proposition and more sophisticated local and national marketing to really making impact on penetration.", "Robert Probst", "And I would only add in more segmented offerings, so you don't have just sort of one size fits all, but you have different types of offers whether it would be by type as we've talked a lot about AL, et cetera, but also by price point amenities sort of environment and bringing some of those learning from other industry leaving even within REITs that have done that well. So I think those are all opportunities.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay.", "Jordan Sadler", "Yes, well that helpful. Lastly on that penetration. Is there anything that you have historically that talks about your changes in the net penetration rate maybe over last 10 years?", "Debra Cafaro", "It's been relative constant and again as Bob pointed out 1% of penetration sells up all the open units in the whole country. So it is a real opportunity and hopefully the industry will be successful in moving that as we look to this next five year period. So we've to move on Jordan sorry.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin representing Barclays. Please proceed.", "Joshua Raskin", "Thanks. I appreciate you guys taking the question. I just wanted to flash out you talked a couple of times about the long-term hospital strategy being able to start affecting that strategy with the Ardent acquisition. So it sounds like you guys are under the belief that more and more dollars will go through the hospitals through bundling. And I just want to see what are your thoughts on the long-term payor mix and volumes and the value of inpatient hospital. And then should we understand this as Ardent being the management company that you will use to acquire or are you listening to incoming calls in the sense that you would be willing to look at investments with other operator?", "Debra Cafaro", "Let's just take that last one first, which is I do think because of the quality and experience Ardent's management team, it's scalable platform. We do have an opportunity to grow and consolidate with Ardent just as we did the Lillibridge MOB business, just as we've done with the Atria. But I also believe that we are going to build as we have in these other businesses a business and the inbound calls really are where we could work with the quality hospital system to really do some of sort of sale lease back transaction with them, and that would be a separate way for us to grow that business.", "As then in terms of the hospital again being the nerve centre of healthcare delivery, we do believe that the hospitals will play an increasingly large role as these different segments or sites of care start to convert in a post HCA world, and the hospital will be more influential and where the patient goes where comes from, where it goes, et cetera and that's part of why we want to align with that giant, very influential industry as you well know as we continue to invest in healthcare, we think that's a very important piece of the overall holistic delivery of healthcare and that they are at the top of the food chain.", "So, that's one thing and then in terms of - we look at this as really owning a market if you will of real-estate and not only the core hospitals but also the feeder and out-patient facilities that the hospitals may own, because healthcare has provided has holistically. And so, we would imagine that in that overall system because of demographics, because of improving economy, because of more insured patients, we're going to capture bigger volumes overtime.", "Joshua Raskin", "And then do you have a target in terms of how big you want the hospitals to be as the percentage of the total NOI?", "Debra Cafaro", "Our focus is really on the quality of the operator and the real-estate and their position in the market just like we've sort of done our MOB business where we've really done business with the best and 89% of our NOI comes from investment grades, hospitals, affiliations and HCA. So, it's really more of the quality of the opportunities that we get presented that will drive how big that piece of pie can get and the timing of our growth in that business.", "Joshua Raskin", "Okay, and then last one just I think you said Ardent specific in the third quarter, talked about growing both top line and bottom line, any commentary specifically around payor mix and what they are seeing for commercial volumes?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I mean mix stayed relatively constant and so I think they had a good quarter across the board.", "Joshua Raskin", "Okay, thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you. Okay lets go guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender representing Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Todd Stender", "You mentioned earlier that the CCP spin improved your cost of capital. Can you just discuss what factors you look at to make that statement?", "Debra Cafaro", "An improved relative cost of capital and what I mean by that is simply when you strip out market tinges say in the REIT market that multiple improved and so it's just as simple as that.", "Todd Stender", "And the ratings agencies, do they make any comments on now you don't have SNF exposure?", "Debra Cafaro", "I would say that the rating agencies have acknowledged in our conversations with them that we have a higher quality, more private paid portfolio that is very attractive and so I think we agree on that.", "Robert Probst", "I think they would say it's a credit positive?", "Todd Stender", "Okay thanks and just a quick one for Todd, can we hear your expectations for what the MOB portfolio, same-store is going to look like, maybe just your revenue expense in NOI growth?", "Todd Lillibridge", "Well as Bob alluded we are modified our guidance. So, we see ourselves in that 2.5% to 3% range, I think we will be at the upper end of that range by year end and we see that range going into 2016 as well.", "Todd Stender", "And any changes to your CapEx assumptions?", "Todd Lillibridge", "No, not as we it now, except for the fact I think we're going to see some significant redevelopment opportunities in our portfolio next year.", "Todd Stender", "Great. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you. Okay, we have a couple more or one more? Okay finish that and clean out.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Michael Carroll representing RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Michael Carroll", "Can you guys give us some color on the hospital inbound calls that you received are these from for profit operators and what did they need to be capital for?", "Debra Cafaro", "Again, the hospital sector is very gigantic and Todd has about 400 clients, so I won't go down his call list, but it's both type I would say as we've mentioned before there is not for profit, there is for profit, there is publicly traded for profit, there is private equity backed for profit. So this is all across the board and so I think what the opportunity we have is really to show how we can really provide capital to high quality operators that will help them run their business better, we'll help them grow, we'll help them consolidate market share and then they would use those proceeds for sort of income producing, consolidation, adding debt covers, that type of thing, I see all the kinds of high returning activities that a hospital can do.", "Michael Carroll", "Then last question does the dislocation in the public hospitals stock prices over the past month or so, does that provide then causes more opportunities to deploy capital in a space or is it just too early to tell?", "Debra Cafaro", "I think it's too early to tell but I do believe in this long-term secular thesis and I do believe in the recent activities and excitement in our space will give us greater opportunities and we'll be patient, we will look for quality and we'll look to win with the winners as we have every other segment so thank you.", "Michael Carroll", "Great. Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Any other questions, Mike?", "Michael Carroll", "No, I'm good.", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Great, well thanks for bearing with us guys. We really appreciate as always your time and attention. It was an incredibly productive quarter and we can\u2019t wait to see and move on the 9th and the 10th.

My name is Whitley and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now turn the conference over to your host for today, Ryan Shannon, Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Ryan Shannon", "Thanks, Whitley. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The projections, predictions and statements are based on management's current beliefs as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events.", "These forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and contingencies and stockholders and others should recognize that actual results may differ materially from the company's expectations, whether expressed or implied.

Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure referenced on this conference call and its most directly comparable GAAP measure as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks, Ryan and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. Welcome to the Ventas first quarter 2016 earnings call. We are delighted to be here with our colleagues to discuss large trends fueling our business and report on our strong first quarter results from our diverse high quality portfolio.", "Following my remarks, Bob Probst will review our segment performance and financial results before we welcome your questions.", "On the heels of a productive and value creating 2015, we started our year off strong. Building off our advantaged properties, platforms, and people, we extended our long track record of excellence this quarter.", "We generated normalized FFO per share of $1.04, representing comparable growth of 7%, versus the fourth quarter 2015. And we are right on track to deliver our full-year expectations of 3% to 5% comparable normalized FFO per share growth, despite projected net asset sales and resultant modest deleveraging in the back half of the year.", "We are well positioned over the short-term and long-term to capture opportunities and continue to grow cash flow and value for our investors. Our strong positioning is based on the decisions we made and actions we took in 2015, particularly the CCP spinoff and our acquisition of Ardent, large macro trends that favor our business, our financial strength and flexibility and our well covered dividend with room to grow.", "Let me address some of these factors. We are excited to do business at the intersection of two large and dynamic industry with powerful fundamentals and growth prospects. Both healthcare and real estate represent nearly 20% of our nation's GDP. Our $1 trillion healthcare real estate market is fragmented and continues to be ripe for consolidation. We are still in the early stages of asset migration from private to public [indiscernible], given that only 15% of healthcare and senior housing real estate assets is owned by REIT.", "Over time, Ventas' excellent diversified platform should be a magnet for asset flow. Our long-term growth prospects are also supported by the increasing demand for healthcare and senior living products and services, created by a large and growing ageing population. Longer life expectancies increase the need for health and senior care and seniors have immense spending power and wealth. Our assets and operators will be the beneficiaries of this wave of oncoming demand.", "Turning to the upcoming change to the global industry classification standard, making REITs a standalone GIC. We anticipate that this change should attract more capital to our industry over time.", "At Ventas, we believe our size, leading position in healthcare and senior housing, track record of disciplined capital allocation and excellent team, make us attractive to generalist investors. Honestly, if I were a generalist investor, looking at GDP growth of 0.5% in the first quarter, corporate profits declining for three consecutive quarters and global weakness, Ventas looks incredibly attractive.", "We have a 4.7% dividend yield with room to grow, significant liquidity, a BBB+ balance sheet, diversified business model, high-quality assets, an impeccable track record of consistent growth in income over cycles, opportunities to grow externally and powerful increasing demand from consumers for our real estate. To my mind, that's a compelling value proposition.", "So, whether there is a new GIC or not, why wouldn't you want to own Ventas. That said, we are obviously focused on our core REIT investors, who are crucial to our continued success. And we will continue driving to deliver outstanding results for all of our stakeholders.", "As we look at our company, we also like our positioning with a diversified, balanced and high quality portfolio, generating 83% of our NOI from private-pay sources. Our outstanding SHOP assets are located in highly attractive markets, with strong home values, median income and seniors population growth.", "In our MOB portfolio, 88% of our NOI is affiliated with investment-grade hospitals and HCA. And 96% of our NOI is on campus or affiliated with leading healthcare systems and hospitals. Finally, Ventas' entire portfolio is advantaged, with only 4% of our NOI derived from SNFs, who are adapting to evolving payment models and upcoming RAC audit.", "Ventas enjoys a strong presence across the five verticals, in each case doing business with the nation's leading providers. This exposure and expertise enables us to invest capital across cycles to create value for investors and customers and fund operator consolidation.", "Although, the vast majority of our NOI is from private-pay sources, I do want to note that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS, recently announced its proposals for fiscal year 2017 Medicare reimbursement rates.", "In general, Medicare rates for different government reimbursed asset classes are slated to increase by varying percentages, subject to previously announced initiatives or other offsets. We view the proposals as in line with our expectations.", "On that note, we recently reached positive agreements with Kindred on our long-term acute care or LTAC portfolio to better position it for success. Our agreements contemplate disposition of seven LTACs and retaining full rent under our master leases with Kindred. This is just one more example of our long-standing collaborative relationship with Kindred, where the companies have repeatedly found innovative ways to create value for both sets of stakeholders.", "So, with our portfolio performing well, our liquidity and balance sheet strong, our customers leading their industries and our team aligned and efficient, we are continually looking for ways to create additional value through investment activity that delivers good risk-adjusted returns.", "As we have for the past several quarters, we are being highly selective in picking our spot, as we consider investment opportunities. Our focus continues to be on committing capital to high quality hospitals, funding our selective development and redevelopment projects and helping our customers grow.", "We also have found some intriguing investment opportunities in superior real estate at different layers in the capital stack, such as our recent investment in a secured junior loan tranche of Blackstone's core life science assets, principally in Cambridge, San Diego, and San Francisco.", "In the acquisitions arena, we see a very deep and active financing investment market for MOBs with interest from a variety of investor categories. In senior housing too, we see aggressive activity from private equity and pension funds among others, even when communities are in areas with significant construction starts.", "However, the deal size in senior housing has been trending towards the smaller end of the spectrum. In hospitals our efforts continue to gain traction as more providers and their constituents are interested in the benefits that our capital can bring to their organizations. Our conversations with hospitals and health systems have been accelerating and broadening.", "So, I have complete confidence in our role as the leading capital provider in our five asset classes, and our team's ability to capture opportunities and grow cash flows and value for our investors. However, as you know, the timing and volume of our future investment activities are not subject to precise prediction.", "In closing, for almost two decades, we have used the Ventas advantage of superior properties, people, and platforms to translate the powerful forces of consolidation, demographic demand and dynamism in the large healthcare and senior housing real estate market into consistent growth, income and value creation for our investors. And today, as we stand at the corner of healthcare and real estate, we are well-positioned to continue doing so.", "Now to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst.", "Robert Probst", "Thanks, Debbie. I'm pleased to report a strong first quarter for Ventas, which included solid same-store growth, 7% comparable normalized FFO per share growth, and even stronger balance sheet. I'm equally pleased to reaffirm our full-year guidance for 2016 of 3% to 5% comparable normalized FFO per share growth.", "On that note, let me first discuss the performance of our highly productive portfolio of nearly 1,300 diversified healthcare and senior housing properties. Same-store cash NOI growth for the company's total portfolio for the first quarter was 2.9%, excluding certain items in the respective 2016 and 2015 periods, and 1.7% on a reported basis.", "Turning to our first quarter 2016 segment level performance, starting with SHOP. Our SHOP business performed well in Q1. Our reported same-store SHOP portfolio increased 2.9% for the first quarter of 2016 over 2015, which is at the high-end of our 1% to 3% full-year guidance. This reported performance was delivered, despite incurring unanticipated real estate tax expenses of $1.2 million in the current quarter, relating to prior-years.", "Without these expenses, same-store SHOP NOI growth would have been 3.8%. Our intentional rate-driven strategy, as well as the quality of our portfolio was visible in the quarter with same-store REVPOR growth of 4.7% in Q1 2016 versus prior-year. The aggressive rate increases had an impact on occupancy, but resulted in overall strong revenue growth of nearly 4% in the quarter.", "Adjusting for the aforementioned property tax charge, operating expenses grew in line with revenue and margins held steady. Consistent with our full-year guidance, our Q1 performance was led by the engines of growth in our high barrier-to-entry coastal infill locations.", "Our core markets represent more than 70% of our SHOP portfolio NOI. NOI in these markets increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the first quarter. Within these key markets, New York, Los Angeles and Boston posted particularly strong results to start the year.", "We did see the performance impacting Q1 of new units coming online within our relevant trade areas in select markets. As expected, NOI from communities in these markets declined low single-digits in the quarter in aggregate, driven by occupancy pressures.", "Encouragingly, based on the latest NIC data, new construction as a percentage of inventory across our SHOP portfolio declined 10 basis points sequentially to 4.4% in Q1 2016. Our framework by which we evaluate and quantify the NOI impact of new construction in 2016, shared on our last earnings call in February, has held up very well this year. We affirm our full-year guidance for SHOP 2016 reported same-store cash NOI to grow in the range of 1% to 3%.", "From a phasing point of view, the second quarter 2015, generated our strongest NOI delivery last year, and hence is our most challenging comparison period in 2016. For the full-year, we project continued strong rate growth on lower occupancy levels versus prior-year with growth fueled by the continued momentum in our core markets.", "Next, I'll cover our triple net lease assets, which account for 44% of our NOI. Triple net reported same-store cash NOI was roughly flat in Q1 versus prior-year. The first quarter 2016 results did not contain $5 million in fee income we received in the comparable 2015 period. Adjusting for this item, triple net same-store cash NOI grew 2.9%, reflecting customary rent escalations.", "Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple net lease portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2015, the latest available quarterly information, was stable at 1.6 times. Coverage in our triple net same-store senior housing portfolio remained strong at 1.3 times with solid low single-digit trailing 12 month EBITDARM growth at the assets. Our deliberately constructed post-acute portfolio, partnered with industry leader Kindred, now represents only 12% of Ventas' NOI, post the CCP spinoff.", "Our same-store post-acute cash flow coverage remained a strong 2.0 times in Q4 2015. Finally, our Ardent triple net coverage held steady at 3.0 times, with solid performance across nearly all key performance indicators continuing into 2016.", "We are pleased to raise our triple net full-year reported same-store guidance by 50 basis points to 2.5% to 3.5% growth. Our Q2 and full-year cash NOI will benefit by $3.5 million in lease modification fees, without loss of rent from the recently announced Kindred LTAC deal Debbie mentioned earlier.", "Let me close the segment review with our MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. MOB cash NOI in the 270 property same-store pool, grew 4.2%. First quarter 2016 results, benefited from an early lease termination fee with net value of $2.3 million. Adjusted for this item, MOB growth in Q1 was 1%. Q1 revenue grew as a result of a modest rate increase on in-place rents, partially offset by lower recovery income, and occupancy declines, driven by the aforementioned early lease termination.", "NOI benefited from cost productivity in the first quarter on the heels of a mild winter. We continue to forecast the MOB segment will grow reported full-year same-store cash NOI in the range of 1% to 2% in 2016. We expect a softer second quarter, then to trend higher in the back half of the year as we fill budgeted vacancy. We remain confident in our valuable MOB business and the Lillibridge platform.", "Turning to Ventas' overall financial results; I'll refer to our results on a comparable basis, which adjust all prior periods for the effects of the spinoff. First quarter 2016 normalized FFO, totaled $1.04 per fully diluted share, representing 7% growth on a comparable basis over the first quarter 2015. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by the carryover impact of 2015 investments, including Ardent, together with new investments in the first quarter and same-store NOI growth.", "Ventas made approximately $150 million in new investments in the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the company funded nearly $40 million of development and redevelopment projects during the quarter. To fully equity fund these new investments, since our year-end 2015 earnings release in February, Ventas opportunistically issued a total of 1.6 million shares of common stock under our ATM for gross proceeds of approximately $100 million at an average price of $62.30.", "Year-to-date, Ventas has issued 3.3 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $190 million. Ventas also continued its asset disposition program, selling seven properties thus far in 2016, for an aggregate sales price approaching $70 million.", "As a result of these deliberate steps, the company's net debt to EBITDA ratio improved sequentially to 6.0 times; now within our five times to six times targeted range. Further, fixed charge coverage is exceptionally strong at 4.6 times, while debt to total capitalization approximated 34%.", "Finally, we're pleased to affirm our guidance to deliver 2016 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.07 to $4.15. This range represents the comparable normalized FFO per share growth rate of 3% to 5% over 2015. We also affirm guidance for total company same-store 2016 cash NOI to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3%.", "Our guidance continues to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million, inclusive of dispositions closed year-to-date. We intend to use the net proceeds to reinvest in approximately $200 million of incremental acquisitions and also to reduce debt.", "Our guidance therefore assumes further modest reduction in leverage below the 6.0 times net debt to EBITDA observed at the end of Q1. With the strong 7% increase in normalized FFO to start 2016, we expect that further leverage reduction, asset sales and refinancing activity over the balance of the year will bring the full-year FFO per share growth to our 3% to 5% guidance range. We have assumed no additional material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity in our guidance.", "In summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of our strong start to 2016 and confident in our prospects for the remainder of the year.", "With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Michael Carroll", "Yeah. Thank you. Hey, Bob, can you talk a little bit about the 30% of senior housing assets in the SHOP that's going to be impacted by supply? And has that competition already come online or is that weighted in the back half of this year?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning, Mike.", "Michael Carroll", "Good morning.", "Robert Probst", "Hi, Mike. Thanks for the question. The framework you referred to, just as a reminder, is the one we laid out in February, which attempted to quantify the impact of supply where we talked about 70% of our portfolio, which is in equilibrium or better in terms of supply/demand and 30%, which potentially has a supply surplus.", "To answer your question, the first quarter really, we think proved out that framework very much in line. As I mentioned, the 70% engine grew mid-single-digits, very much in line with our expectation. The 30% did have an impact, it declined at a low single-digit rate.", "Again, very much in line with guidance provided in February. So, performing very much as expected and that is with units coming online. So, we are seeing units coming online. That began about Q3 of last year and will continue basically through the year, as per the NIC data. So, very much consistent with what we told you.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And then does that unit coming online, is that going to ramp up throughout the year? Is it going to remain consistent kind of just stable pressure?", "Robert Probst", "Well based on the NIC data, our observation is things tend to get pushed out, as you look at the openings. It looks to be fairly steady over the balance of the year. But also continuing into the first two quarters of 2017 based on that data.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. Great.", "Robert Probst", "But no big...", "Michael Carroll", "And then Debbie, can you...", "Robert Probst", "Go ahead.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. Great. And then, Debbie, can you talk a little bit about the life science investments? I know that this is property type that you've wanted to get into for a little while now. Is this just a single opportunity or do you see other opportunities in the future?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah. Thanks for asking. We think our life science investment is a great investment on a standalone basis. A great sponsor in Blackstone and this was the core kind of best of the biomed real estate, this tranche of the financing.", "So, regarding life science, I think we've been very consistent for five years in our thoughts, which are that it is a good asset class, it's only 5% of the pie. And so, under the right circumstances like we found here, if there is an opportunity to make a really good investment we'll do so. But, it's not a must-have like we articulated about the MOB back in 2008, 2009, which is almost 40% of the $1 trillion pie.", "Michael Carroll", "Great. Thank you guys.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Robert Probst", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please proceed.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hi, Good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi, Juan.", "Robert Probst", "Hi, Juan.", "Juan Sanabria", "Just wanted to ask around the same-store guidance. So, you bumped to triple net and I think you said that's about 40% of the portfolio. Is there any message there with expectations for the rest of the portfolio maybe skewed to the lower end of the guidance or should we not read into that anything?", "Robert Probst", "Yeah. Juan, I wouldn't read anything into that. We called out the key driver of that triple net increase was really the Kindred LTAC deal that Debbie referred to, which for the triple net segment has an impact to raise. But, overall it doesn't materially raise the range. So, the guidance stays as is therefore.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. Great.", "Robert Probst", "Go ahead.", "Juan Sanabria", "And then the second question just \u2013 you kind of hit on in, in your prepared remarks, Debbie. What do you think the impacts will be for the industry of the RAC audits? I know there is a history in the hospital business where you are now more involved in, kind of what are your expectations? How this could evolve and impact coverage levels and/or the operators?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. So, the RAC audits were recently announced, they are called recovery audit contractors, who come in and sort of look at the billings under Medicare. And as you mentioned, that process has occurred over time with hospitals who are well through that including inpatient rehab, but it's new to post-acute.", "And I think that you may see some impact either from operators, perhaps more conservatively coding and you may see some impact as you saw in [indiscernible] some years ago, where there are some objections to billings either past or present and that can have some impact on cash flows or EBITDAR.", "From our standpoint, we believe that Kindred, who is our principal post-acute partner, is very well positioned. The services that Kindred provides are clinically mandated and approved and it has a really good infrastructure to \u2013 that is ready \u2013 because obviously, it's been in the [indiscernible] business as well, that's ready to deal with the RAC audit, so we feel good about that.", "Juan Sanabria", "Great. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Please proceed.", "Michael Bilerman", "Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. Good morning. Debbie, I was wondering, if you can just spend a little bit more time on the biomed investment, in terms of, did you do that by just buying it directly from the banks?", "Were you sort of involved with Blackstone in taking a slice or making that investment at a 10% yield? And then I had some [indiscernible] I just want to understand the \u2013 where you came in, at what level and where your sort of partners are at effectively?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah. Well, we have a great relationship with Blackstone, who we admire greatly. And we also have a good relationship with your firm that was involved in the financing. And so, this was really an opportunity that was presented to us that we think is a great risk-adjusted return in a pool of assets that were very, very prime as a segment of the biomed business and about which we had a lot of knowledge and information to begin with.", "Michael Bilerman", "And so, where are you within the capital stack? The 10% is a little bit higher, so I don't know if you bought the bonds at a discount or if you're just at a higher tranche in the cap stack?", "Debra Cafaro", "We're at a \u2013 I would call it a lower tranche, we're in the high-70%s kind of loan to cost, so very attractive there. But at the lower end it was bought at par.", "Michael Bilerman", "And then have you had any discussions with Blackstone at all? And clearly, you mentioned you had a lot of information. I can't remember if you're company A, B or C. But at some point, has there been any discussion about, is this a potential entry to buy assets, buy a portfolio and maybe a swop and do a larger transaction at some point?", "Debra Cafaro", "Wow, you have an overactive imagination. But I like it. I would say that, this is a good standalone investment that we made with a lot of expertise that my partner John Cobb has in the debt market and with our friends at both those firms. So, you should just think of it as a great standalone investment.", "Michael Bilerman", "Okay. And then just one last one just on SHOP same-store, it was up 3% in the first quarter. You really didn't change the outlook for the year. And so, I don't know, if you just expect decelerating or is it just more conservatism or is there something that we should think about within the SHOP portfolio going forward that would impact those numbers?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, Bob will answer. But again, the guidance is on a reported basis, and so \u2013 Bob?", "Robert Probst", "Right. And on that basis, we delivered 2.9% in the quarter, Michael.", "Michael Bilerman", "Yeah.", "Robert Probst", "Therefore at the high end of the range, we're holding the range at 1% to 3%. So, certainly you could see consistent growth across the quarters to achieve that high end. The range is really dictated by the impact of supply, which we talk a lot about. And should those trends continue as we saw in the first quarter, we would be pushing towards that higher end, but the range is there for a reason.", "Michael Bilerman", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Please proceed.", "Nick Yulico", "You talked about private equity institutional investors having strong demand for seniors housing. What are your thoughts about potentially selling some of your non-primary senior housing assets which seem to be underperforming? And would you be interested in that? What type of pricing you think you might be able to get on that?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, first of all, we do believe in having a high quality portfolio, and having diversification and balance in that portfolio. And that includes markets, asset types, et cetera. So, as we look at our normal capital recycling in terms of dispositions, I think senior housing is one of the areas that we would consider having in that pool and we've said that. And we're constantly checking the market and constantly reviewing our portfolio for the best candidate for capital recycling.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. And then just one other question I had was on Holiday Retirement. When you made that investment back in \u2013 what was it, 2013 \u2013 there were some, I think pretty big initial escalations in the rents I think close to sort of 4% or 5% for several years. Can you talk about your comfort in being able to still get those escalations? I recognize it's not a gigantic time for you, about 3% of NOI. But still there has been some management turnover at Holiday, there has been declines in coverage as reported by one of your competitors out there who has a portfolio with them. And so, what I'm wondering is, if we should be confident that you can continue to get that extra straight-line rent benefit in your FFO there?", "Debra Cafaro", "So, yes, we did buy a Holiday portfolio. It's a high quality one. It was one of the earlier more curated portfolios that Fortress put out there. We did structure it well in, in a way to get 4.5% escalators in the early years, the last one of those is in 2016. And we would expect over time that portfolio to, A, on the rent side go back to more normalized level, and over time to grow into normalized coverage. So, the new CEO I think has some great ideas. I think the portfolio in general in the company at Holiday had a good start to the year. And so, we feel fine about our rent and feel good about it.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore of Stifel. Please proceed.", "Chad Vanacore", "Hey, good morning, all.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi.", "Chad Vanacore", "Just think about your MOB portfolio and the $2.3 million lease termination fee. What percent of NOI was the tenant that terminated their contract? And has that tenant been replaced or you're going to have to work back through it sounds like?", "Debra Cafaro", "What percent of total MOB NOI was that tenant?", "Chad Vanacore", "Yeah.", "Robert Probst", "It was about 1%, roughly of the total. I think it's a little bit of a complex story, just from a timing point of view. And then in the quarter, we had the lease termination fee benefit, which drove the 4.2%. But obviously that tenant left and we need to therefore replace that tenant to see the timing issue of having to replace that tenant. And the occupancy decline you saw sequentially was really described by that tenant in total. So...", "Debra Cafaro", "Just like office.", "Robert Probst", "Yeah. Just like in office. So, you'll see that, and we highlighted that second quarter impact of that. And then as we fill that back up, you'll see the benefit in the back half.", "Chad Vanacore", "Okay. And does that lease termination fee cover what you would have gotten until the end of the year and that's why you haven't accurately changed your MOB same-store growth profile?", "Debra Cafaro", "We quoted the net benefit, net of the rent, we would have received in the period. I think the lease would have expired prior to the end of this year.", "Chad Vanacore", "Okay.", "Robert Probst", "And it was in our budget when we came into the year. So, therefore, in our guidance.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. And then, how should we think about changes in your portfolio pro forma for the changes in the Kindred leases? Like what's going to happen to Kindred rent coverage post the transactions?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. Good. So, thanks for asking about that, because we were trying to count here how many good deals that we and Kindred have done together over the last, however, many years, and I think it was eight years or nine years. And this most recent one is a good example of how both the companies have elevated and improved their portfolios through \u2013 over time as we've engaged in these transactions.", "So, what we've said is, we have strong coverage now at [indiscernible] times in our post-acute portfolio. When you look forward, we've kept all the rent, we would expect to exit seven of those LTACs. And of course, we have changes in reimbursement in the LTAC sector starting to come into play in 2016 in September for Kindred.", "And so, when you look at all that net-net-net, we would expect a temporary 10 basis points to 20 basis point impact on coverage as we work through and then normalizing as we come out of LTAC patient criteria.", "Chad Vanacore", "Okay.", "Debra Cafaro", "So, that's the net effect of a whole series of things. But this single transaction I think is a great way for both of us to position that LTAC portfolio to succeed.", "Chad Vanacore", "And, Deb, what percentage of NOI do LTACs represent for you? And how does that change pro forma?", "Debra Cafaro", "It's about 6%. And since the rents is \u2013 we're keeping all the rents, plus we are getting $6.5 million, it stays 6%.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. And then just one last question on the SHOP portfolio. It looked like occupancy was down quite a bit, 100 basis points sequentially or so. Is that from the new pressure that you're seeing or what's driving that?", "Robert Probst", "Yeah. There is an element of seasonality, but year-over-year we highlighted that, it's really driven by the rate increase, so very intentional desire to drive rate, this is a wonderful business, needs driven, and we believe a real opportunity to continue to drive rate recognizing the value proposition of senior housing.", "So, we've very intentionally been putting our foot to the accelerator on that, knowing there would be an occupancy impact; but net-net-net, we highlighted a 4% revenue growth in the quarter and a strong underlying profit as a consequence. So, we think a good move.", "Debra Cafaro", "But again, sequentially, you would typically see this pattern separate...", "Robert Probst", "Seasonality...", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah.", "Robert Probst", "...when you look sequentially.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. That's it for me. Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Robert Probst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Vincent Chao", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just sticking with the SHOP commentary here. Understanding there is typical seasonality here in the first quarter and it did drive rate, but I guess I would have thought there would have been some benefit from the milder flu season this year. And also just curious, the decision to push rate so hard this quarter, what was driving that ahead of pending supply and that kind of thing?", "Robert Probst", "Yeah. We think we push rate appropriately, that's again very intentional. And I always talk about the value proposition, whereby if you try to replicate the services at home of senior housing, it would be twice as expensive as on average it is within the senior housing community. So, there is clearly opportunity to drive pricing, and the operators have seen that and embraced that in our SHOP portfolio. So, that's strategic in my mind. What was the other part of the question?", "Vincent Chao", "Oh, just I guess I would have expected a little bit of a tailwind year-over-year, just given the milder flu season this year.", "Robert Probst", "Right.", "Vincent Chao", "And I was just wondering if that showed up or if there was some other offset?", "Robert Probst", "Right. We said ceteris paribus, all else equal, that would be a benefit is certainly true. But the world is never ceteris paribus. There's lots of things that were going on. So, it was helpful.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah.", "Robert Probst", "But, it wasn't something that would drive outsize performance. And net-net, when you step back from the adjustment for tax, we grew nearly 4%. So, clearly a strong quarter.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah.", "Vincent Chao", "Got it. Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up on the guidance just for disposition proceeds. I think it was $350 million last quarter, $200 million this quarter; I think that's just maybe because you've already spent some of that money. But also it seems like the wording did change a little bit, and I'm probably parsing this too much, but specifically calling out debt repayment this time as opposed to sort of redevelopment and development spend. Anything to read into that?", "Robert Probst", "No. I think it's \u2013 I'm glad you asked the question, because what has not changed, if we look full-year is $500 million of dispositions and $350 million of acquisitions that is the same from our last guidance.", "We expressed the acquisitions in the press release as $200 million incremental which is from here, as we did $150 million in the first quarter. And so, that $350 million is just kind of a timing issue when that money is being spent.", "The balance is fungible in that we can talk about either redevelopment or we can talk about debt reduction, it's simple to understand that we have approximately a $300 million of gross debt reduction inherent in that forecast, if we have $500 million of dispose, $200 million of incremental acquisition the balance will be debt reduction. So that's the math, but redevelopment hasn't changed either, so.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah. And the key point is that we also generate cash flow, which is fungible, as is source as well and so.", "Robert Probst", "Right, which is a partner to that.", "Debra Cafaro", "You should feel we're very consistent with what we said before.", "Robert Probst", "Absolutely.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And I think that is it. Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Tyler with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.", "Kevin Tyler", "Yeah, good morning. On SHOP on the expense side, does your NOI guidance forecast 4% plus or minus increases over the balance of the year? And I was just curious how much of the 4% that we saw, or 4.5% this quarter was related to minimum wage versus executive director retention?", "Robert Probst", "Right. Well, first off all, it's important to highlight that that real estate tax charge, which I identified is in the reported results through the expense line in the quarter. And therefore, you need to adjust that out, if you're looking at a more underlying performance, and that's in line with revenue and roughly in that 4% range as you highlight.", "Within that clearly, there have been wage pressures, whether of minimum wage or as we have shortages of nurses or whatever else, but that comes right back to the need to drive our rate in part and parcel.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah. And it's consistent with the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year.", "Robert Probst", "And so, holding margins through rate, covering that expense pressure and at the same time driving cost productivity importantly as part of that through operational excellence, is inherent in that holding net margin for the full-year.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay. Thanks. And then on the development side, you've got a quite a bit going on in the senior housing front in desirable and somewhat dense markets, Foster City, Fort Lauderdale. But the densest urban cores, are they currently attractive for you just as we've seen some of your competitors move in? In Manhattan, for example, if you could get land what reservations might you have about developing in a more dense setting like a Manhattan, Chicago, San Francisco, for example?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, it's nice that we were able to acquire the Atria portfolio, when we did, which had as its largest component, the New York MSA, which has been a great market for us. And as you point out, we do have two high quality developments ongoing. Both would be operated by Atria; one in Foster City in the San Francisco MSA and one in Palm Beach County. Obviously, both attractive areas.", "And we continue to look at development and redevelopment opportunities with Atria and others in all these markets. And would feel positive, frankly, about if we found a good site in any of these dense markets to do a development that we had confidence in. Our bar on ground up development, however, is very high. And so, we want to make sure that we're really underwriting it carefully and have confidence in the outcomes.", "And that's why, we have just kind of the MOB in downtown San Francisco with Sutter and these two senior housing developments in these great areas with Atria ongoing right now.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay. Thanks. And then, Debbie, just talking a little bit about your deal making track record in the past, certainly has been one that's very \u2013 looked fondly upon, has been fantastic. And as you look to turn around tough situations you've done so effectively many times in the past and in the skilled nursing space. But today with some dislocation in the markets and then maybe sporadically throughout healthcare is too strong. But, there has been a little bit more dislocation than in the past. What gets you excited or where do you see opportunities to apply your turnaround expertise?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, thank you for the compliment. It didn't always feel like it at the time, but hopefully in retrospect it is a very good track record of disciplined capital allocation by our team.", "Look, I mean, what gets us excited at Ventas is making money for our stakeholders. And that has come and will come in many different forms, but that's what gets us excited. And that's that we are going to continue to drive toward.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.", "Richard Anderson", "Thanks, and good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi.", "Richard Anderson", "So, just when I think about the three buckets \u2013 triple net, you have RIDEA and you have post-acute \u2013 those by which we kind of debate the good and the bad. In RIDEA, we can get into the whole bundling and how that's going to work itself out from a REIT perspective and same with post-acute. But the one thing I want to point out and kind of isolate is the senior housing triple net, which we have for a long time been willing to sit on relatively thin rent coverage. I know you have 1.3 times in an EBITDARM basis, but on EBITDAR it might be closer to 1.1 times. And then when you factor in the capital expenditures which are borne on the operator, do you get below one times on average? And if so, what's your comment about that from a long-term perspective as from your \u2013 from a REIT standpoint?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we think we have a high quality diverse portfolio with leading operators in our industry, the Brookdales, the Holidays and so on. And the portfolios are well underwritten with credit support and the assets, as Bob said, are growing, EBITDARM. And so, we feel we're at a good level of coverage that's market-based or above market base. And with a reasonable CapEx imputed, we're above 1.0 times...", "Richard Anderson", "Okay.", "Debra Cafaro", "...probably closer to 1.1 times. And so we feel good about it.", "Richard Anderson", "But, and you're not \u2013 I'm not directing this at you, because everyone is kind of in the same boat senior housing triple net. I mean do you think that there is a day where we'll have to kind of do a refocus on rent escalators and think more in terms of what \u2013 making sure those escalators aren't in excess of the EBITDAR growth of the underlying organization?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. Yep. I think that's a really very good comment, because over the years, there has been I think a lot of misperception amongst investors that one type of investment, call it SHOP has risk, and one, call it, triple net doesn't have risk and so on and so forth.", "When we do underwriting of any asset that we're acquiring \u2013 at the end of the day, those assets have to produce cash flow. And so that is what we are focused on always first and foremost. And then along with it, in all these areas, is it a leading operators, what's the asset, and the management team's position in the marketplace, can we provide additional structural support in the case of triple net and like guarantees and security deposits and so on? But at the end of the day, we are looking for good assets that are going to perform through good operating partners and that's true regardless of structure. So, you make a good point. And I think we've done that successfully.", "Richard Anderson", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Rich.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "John Kim", "Thanks. Good morning. Debbie, can we get your updated views.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi.", "John Kim", "Hello. Can we get your updated views on the impact of bundled payments implementation and how significant this changes the landscape for demand across the spectrum? Specifically, there has been some early evidence of home health potentially gaining market share. And I was just wondering if you could address that as well?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. Good question. Look, I think bundled payments are going to help hospitals, let's start there. And that was, of course, one underpinning of our hospital thesis and investment as hospitals control more of these dollars and patients. And so far, again, these just started in the 67 markets on hips and knees in April of this year.", "Kindred has said that as far as this project goes, it's going to have minimal impact they believe and impart I think they're using this new project to prove out that they are the best positioned post-acute provider in the country, who can deliver really good post-acute care, limit readmissions and do so for a reasonable cost. And that's, of course, the providers in post-acute, who are going to thrive in the future.", "But, there can be as part of these trends, some evidence that some patients will go directly from the hospital, either to senior living frankly, or to home health. And that's a trend that has been going on for some time, and will continue.", "But again, the skilled nursing guys have a role to play in the post-acute delivery of care and there are plenty of these patients, believe me. Plenty of people are having hips and knees replaced. And so, hopefully, there are enough patients for everyone.", "John Kim", "So, hospitals are managing the process, but they are not necessarily the lowest cost setting. So, how concerned are you about this and will there be some losers and winners in the hospital world?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I think, there will be winners and thrivers and consolidators, like Ardent and others, like HCA. But again, they're sort of getting the payments in the bundled payment, and they are paying the post-acute providers. And so, we believe that the hospitals will do well, and the post-acute providers who can deliver quality and do so at a low cost, and limit readmissions are going to get more market share.", "John Kim", "Okay. And a question for Bob on your cash flow statement. Free cash flow from operations historically has mirrored normalized FFO, but this quarter it fell well short of that. From what I can see this is...", "Debra Cafaro", "I am so \u2013 thank you for asking that, because that's something we talked about and we are happy to answer.", "Robert Probst", "Which I'm assuming is, why is it lower? And it's really timing, if you look at it. We had a number of things, particularly in the accounts payable line that in prior year \u2013 if you compare to prior year, we had the Kindred fee and other fees we've referred to in the first quarter, which benefited cash flow in the first quarter of roughly $40 million.", "Debra Cafaro", "Of last year.", "Robert Probst", "Of last year. To bring it back, typically Q1, is an outflow just seasonally from a timing point of view on the payable line. So, last year was really more of an anomaly as far as that goes.", "And the other one is really timing around interest payments on bonds that are flowing through interest payables. So, they're really timing issues, John, but it's a good catch, absolutely. So, you should see that turnaround to the balance of the year.", "Debra Cafaro", "We always pay attention to cash flow.", "John Kim", "Great. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks a lot.", "Robert Probst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Jordan Sadler", "Good morning. I guess, I might be accused here...", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi.", "Jordan Sadler", "...of having an active imagination possibly. But maybe you can help me understand what's going on with the SHOP portfolio. I guess same-store occupancy is down 90 basis points, right, despite a mild flu season. But last year it was up 60 basis points in what seemed to be a more difficult flu season. So, I am just \u2013 what seems to be going on here?", "Robert Probst", "Yeah. I don't think, you should be so focused on flu solely, right? Because there's a number of factors, clearly that as we've said all else equal is a tailwind. You have a number of factors that are impacting occupancy this quarter, we talked a lot about rates, certainly the rate is intentional and is driving majority of that. There is also an impact of the new units coming on line and affecting occupancy as I said in my prepared remarks. So, that is coming through that line as well. And again, in line with our expectation. So, it's really a combination of factors, where it's really hard to pull out anyone.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. And then in terms of free rent just in the senior housing world, are you or any of your triple net tenants currently offering free rent upfront as an inducement?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well...", "Jordan Sadler", "Is that changing at all?", "Debra Cafaro", "I would say that obviously when we look at rents, we're looking at it on an effective rent basis, there are targeted markets, for example, Brookdale has talked about it, where they're providing concessions in some cases that they use that after the Emeritus merger. And a lot of those Brookdale has said are \u2013 they expect to burn off and not be replaced during 2016. So that would be one example.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. And are you guys using concessions as well or you're not seeing the same thing per se?", "Robert Probst", "No. Quite the contrary. We're going the other way as I said, we're driving rate, not discounting. And the NIC data would suggest in terms of rate growth that similarly across the industry, there is good rate growth. So hopefully, others are seeing the same, which is a great value proposition in senior housing.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Todd Stender", "Hi, just a quick one for me. Bob, you highlighted the drop in new senior housing construction earlier. I just wanted to get a sense of your \u2013 what you're hearing from your operating partners, maybe your updated thoughts on the trajectory of new starts, at least over the near-term?", "Robert Probst", "Right. I would describe it as a modest sequential decline. We talked about 10 basis points in terms of units under construction. So, we're certainly not doing the touchdown dance yet on that. I think, where is it headed from here? It's a good question. We don't have a lot more information than you do. I think everybody is starting to understand without there, there's been a lot of talk about supply clearly. And so, lenders and developers and everybody else taking note, we hope is what's going to happen, but only time will tell. We have no evidence to suggest that's true.", "Todd Stender", "Okay. Thank you, Bob.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks.", "Robert Probst", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks for being patient with us, Tayo. Good morning.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Of course, not a problem at all, Debbie. I know everyone is always interested in what you have to say. A couple from my end. First of all, skilled nursing; again, you have a very small portfolio, but it's heavily focused on the national operators. And I'm just curious what you're seeing on that end just given when we look at your rent coverage, it has been coming down about 10 bps for the past two quarters or three quarters?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. So, most of the change in coverage is due to the fact that rent went up significantly in the fourth quarter of last year. So, we think that's a good thing. You want to have a good coverage, but you don't want to have excess good coverage. You want to hit that optimal point. And so \u2013 and yes, most of our 4% of skilled nursing is with Kindred, we have some with Genesis as well.", "And look, I think, what you're going to see, as we've talked about over time is, we have very strong coverage at two times. You are going to see I think some continued pressures on the SNFs business and we are in a great spot with our partners, who have credit and who are leading operators to work through those changes and we deliberately retain this portfolio because we believe in it.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Great. Okay. That's helpful. Then the second thing, medical office buildings, I know we've kind of gone through the tenant vacating and the impact on numbers for the quarter. But when I take a look at rent growth for the quarter, it still seemed like it wasn't much. And again, I guess one thing I always struggle with on the MOB side is same-store NOI growth tends to be 2%, 3% consistently, but yet everyone is kind of paying these very low cap rates for these assets. So, I'm just trying to understand why it continues to make sense to pay these very low cap rates kind of industry wide?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah. Good observation. And again, happy that we acquired our MOB portfolio, which is very high quality again in that 2010, 2011 time period. I think what drives people to really like MOB is that they are a low cost setting. You see the demographics and the utilization statistics with the baby boomers and again the 10,000 turning 65 every day. You see the Affordable Care Act, which is improving the insured population in many states.", "And then what you're getting as an investor is you're really getting above \u2013 even at relatively low cap rate, you're getting above core returns with core like characteristics, very reliable, consistent, steady, financeable asset. And in this global thirst for yield, where we've talked about why people like U.S. real estate assets, that is a very attractive value proposition, and I think that's why you're seeing all these new entrants and a lot of interest in this asset class.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, again, I appreciate you indulging me. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing at this point in the UK? Four Seasons put out some pretty weak results a few days ago; but again, I know their portfolio is very heavily focused on getting funding from the local authorities. But overall, what you're kind of seeing whether on that end or on the private-pay end would be helpful?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, in the UK, I think what we're \u2013 we have a small senior living portfolio, and then a very nice public partner in Spire, who is in the hospital business, where we have a triple net lease. And we have triple net leases frankly on both segments in the UK.", "I think what we're seeing there in the private-pay as well as the more long-term care business is that there are changes in rules and regulations that affect staffing. And that is in fact, putting some pressures on the operators there.", "Our portfolio has been doing well. It's a small portfolio that we've grown, and we like, but I think on a larger scale basis for both the government reimbursed and the private-pay, there are some trends there that are compressing margins.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much. And again, overall I thought the quarter was pretty good. So, well done.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah. So, thank you very much. I will thank all my colleagues at Ventas for contributing to delivering great results. And I thank all of you for your interest in our company and your support of our company, which we appreciate greatly. And we look forward to seeing everybody at NAREIT in June.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Ryan Shannon, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Ryan Shannon", "Thanks, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company\u2019s announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure referenced on this conference call and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company\u2019s supplemental disclosures schedule, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thank you, Ryan, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas second-quarter earnings call. We are delighted to be here with our colleagues to report on our strong results from our diverse, high quality portfolio, discuss our pending investment in life sciences and medical real estate, and provide color on macro trends. Following my remarks, our CFO, Bob Probst, will review our segment performance and financial results, and walk through our full-year guidance before we welcome your questions.", "We have great momentum at Ventas. Building off our superior properties, platforms, and people, we extended our long track record of excellence this quarter. If you invest in Ventas for reliable growth and income on a strong balance sheet, then this is a good quarter for you. Leading with results, we delivered $1.04 in normalized FFO per share, representing 7% year-over-year comparable growth, and we remain on track for 3% to 5% normalized FFO growth this year.", "We were opportunistic and access the debt and equity capital market, again demonstrating our commitment to financial strength and flexibility, as well as our expertise in capital markets activity. As you know, we love cash flow because it enables us to reinvest in our business and pay you a dividend. Our strong and secure dividend yield of nearly 4% is very attractive and has plenty of room to continue to grow.", "Our strong performance is fueled by our market position at the exciting intersection of healthcare and real estate, two large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth prospects. Within this attractive space, our incredible team has made strategic decisions and executed our strategy with sustained excellence. As a result, we have differentiated our portfolio and our company, benefited our shareholders, and shaped Ventas for continued success.", "Recent examples of our disciplined capital allocation moves include our successful spinoff of most of our skilled nursing business and our entry into the large, growing hospital space with Ardent, both completed last year. The elevation and evolution of our business continued this year with our recent deal to announce to acquire $1.5 billion in high quality, life science and medical real estate operated by best-in-class developer, Wexford.", "We believe the Wexford deal is both financially and strategically attractive. With a going in cash yield on stabilized assets of 6.8%, it is a wonderful fit with our goal of delivering reliable growth and income through cycles. This investment represents an accretive institutional quality entry into the large and growing healthcare driven research and development space. It adds an adjacent business line that further diversifies our portfolio and cash flows and adds a large component of private pay NOI to our business mix.", "The powerful combination of attractive properties, superior platforms, and outstanding people creates the Ventas advantage. All three are on display with the Wexford deal. The 25 Wexford properties we will acquire are new, Class A assets that are environmentally advanced and architecturally appealing. I hope you will go to our website for a property tour to see this portfolio. The assets are also well leased to highly rated, top-tier universities, academic medical centers, and research companies, including Yale, UPenn Medicine, Washington University, Duke, and Wake Forest.", "Like other areas of our business, our prospective tenants are market leaders. The universities in our portfolio account for fully 10% of all university life sciences research and development spending in the U.S. That is an outstanding way to enter a new space. It was really fun to travel up and down the East Coast with Ryan recently, visiting these hotbeds of academic and commercial research, cutting-edge medical activity, innovation and education.", "The Wexford acquisition also creates another superior platform for Ventas growth. The Wexford team has a terrific reputation within the sophisticated tight-knit community of elite universities. Demand is increasing as universities face difficult decisions about capital allocation. In this environment, combining Ventas\u2019s capital with a trusted developer who can deliver complex projects that benefit leading institutions should be a winning formula.", "We have an exclusive pipeline for growth with Wexford with two assets under development coming online in 2017 and nine development sites available to satisfy growing demand in research hubs anchored by leading universities. We already have identified one potential new development project adjacent to UPenn Medical, which could get greenlighted soon. We are hopeful we can grow the business like we have with Lillibridge and Atria.", "The Ventas people and culture will once again truly exceptional in the Wexford deal. We have always admired the Wexford business and have worked on it many times in the past. So when we were recently presented with the opportunity to acquire it, we were a knowledgeable buyer with an incredibly fast, sophisticated and interdisciplinary team.", "With our deep knowledge of the business and assets, substantial trust among the players, a good structure, and accommodative capital markets, we were able to execute with excellence. If less is what happens when preparation meets opportunity, then Ventas is lucky indeed. Hats off to the team and thanks to the many Ventas investors who participated in our Wexford equity funding in July. We sincerely appreciate your support.", "Next, I would like to comment briefly on the investment market. We are remaining highly selective as we consider investment opportunities in the current market. Our cost of capital has improved significantly, but we will only execute on deals we believe will generate reliable earnings growth at an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Thus, our focus continues to be on committing capital to high-quality hospitals, helping our customers grow and funding selective development and redevelopment projects.", "With the addition of Wexford, we expect our capital allocation to pre-lease university-based development projects to represent a larger percentage of our investment pie. We believe strongly in our ability to invest capital across cycles to create value for our investors and customers. This confidence flows from the combination of our advantage position within five and soon-to-be six asset classes, our relationships with market-leading customers and platforms, and our team\u2019s hard-earned experience and skill.", "Before closing, it is worthwhile to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. In the healthcare arena, we see an acceleration of the transition to value-based payment models. Just this week, CMS announced that it will layer on additional mandatory bundling for cardiac care in 2017. This and other developments support our thesis that hospitals are beginning to exert even more influence and post-acute patient care and class, and that revenue streams for skilled nursing providers will likely remain under pressure in the near-term.", "In the longer term, diversified post-acute care providers like Kindred who can deliver quality care in a variety of settings, maintain a sound capital structure and adequate liquidity, and enjoy the benefits of scale should have a competitive advantage. From an economic and market standpoint, we are benefiting from multiple tailwinds that favor our business, including domestic GDP growth that continues to hover in the low single digits; a global thirst for yield; the creation of a new REIT global industry classification; and historically low long-term borrowing base.", "In this environment, U.S. real estate and Ventas should thrive. With our need-based, demographically driven business model, a superb track record of consistent reliable growth, external investment opportunities, a best-in-class per credit profile, a differentiated business mix that is 84% private pay, and a secure, nearly 4% dividend, Ventas should continue to be a magnet for investment dollars.", "Now, to talk about our positive quarter, I am happy to turn the call over to Bob.", "Bob Probst", "Thank you, Debbie. I am pleased to report solid earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet in the second quarter. Let me jump right into the performance of our high-quality healthcare and senior housing properties, which together delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 3.5% for the nearly 1,200 assets in the company\u2019s quarterly same-store total portfolio. Performance in the quarter was led by our triple net leased business, which accounts for 43% of our NOI.", "Triple net reported same-store cash NOI growth was 6.2% in Q2 versus the prior year. Growth in the quarter benefited from a $3.5 million cash fee associated with the previously announced collaborative agreements between Ventas and Kindred. Excluding the Kindred fee, triple net same-store cash NOI grew 4.1% in the quarter, principally reflecting strong in place lease escalations.", "Cash flow coverage and our overall stabilized triple net lease portfolio for the first quarter of 2016, the latest available quarterly information, improved 10 basis points sequentially to 1.7 times. This strong coverage level reflects the quality of our triple net leased properties and of our operators. Coverage in our triple net same-store senior housing portfolio remains stable at 1.3 times. Coverage trends were supported by low single digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months.", "Our decision to spin off the majority of our postacute portfolio in 2015 continues to be validated. Our remaining postacute portfolio where SNFs now represent only 4% of our NOI demonstrated market leading same-store cash flow coverage at 2 times in Q1 of 2016. Finally, Ardent triple net coverage held steady at 3 times and continues to perform well at the assets. Ardent showed positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators in both the first and second quarters.", "With the strong first half of the year and the majority of lease escalations now in place for 2016, we are pleased to update our forecast for the triple net segment to grow reported full-year same-store NOI in the range of 3.5% to 4%, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint. We are happy to report another solid quarter in our SHOP portfolio, generating Q2 same-store cash NOI growth of 2.1% versus the prior year.", "This result is right in line with our expectations and reflects our most challenging year-over-year comparison period in 2015. The framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range for the year is holding up very well in both the second quarter and the first half of the year. And with the first half now under our belt, we have performed at the higher end of our guidance range with H1 growth of 2.5% versus the prior year on a reported basis.", "In the second quarter, as expected, our rate-driven strategy continued to fuel our earnings with RevPOR growth of nearly 4%. Our high barrier to entry infill coastal markets continued to be the engine room of our overall SHOP portfolio growth in the second quarter. These communities, which represent approximately 70% of our SHOP NOI, grew Q2 same-store NOI mid-single digits on continued strong rate growth.", "Major coastal markets, including New York, LA, and Boston, continue to drive consistently outstanding growth in both rates and NOI in the quarter and the first half. In select markets, we observed the impact of new construction coming online within our relevant trade areas. In these communities, same-store NOI posted low single digit declines in aggregate, driven by occupancy and wage pressures. Again, this performance is consistent with our framework for the approximately 30% of our SHOP portfolio located in markets with a new construction surplus.", "Construction as a percentage of inventory in our trade areas as reported by NIC increased in the quarter by 40 basis points to 4.8%. Importantly, however, the amount of our SHOP NOI that is affected by new supply remains at roughly 30%. We have observed that a significant number of projected openings as reported by NIC have been delayed into 2017, and that anecdotally financing and completing new developments may be getting more challenging.", "Overall, we are pleased with our SHOP performance through the first half of the year. We are, therefore, raising our full-year guidance for SHOP reported cash NOI in the full-year same-store asset pool to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3%, up from our 1% to 3% range previously communicated. Strong rate growth on lower year-over-year occupancy led by our high barrier to entry markets is expected to fuel this NOI performance.", "Let me close out the segment review with our MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas\u2019s overall NOI. MOB cash NOI in the 353-property, quarterly same-store pool grew nearly 1% in the second quarter and increase 2.3% in the first half. Both the second quarter and the first half benefited from in place rent escalations and continued cost productivity from the Lillibridge platform, partially offset by lower occupancy.", "For the balance of the year, we are actively filling the leasing pipeline to backfill budgeted moveouts and to cover increased repair and maintenance costs expected in the back half of the year. For the full-year 2016, we continue to forecast the MOB segment will grow same-store cash NOI for the full-year asset pool in the range of 1% to 2%.", "Turning now to our overall financial results. This was a very busy and productive quarter for Ventas. In the second quarter, we generated strong FFO growth, reduced refinancing risk while capitalizing on favorable market conditions, and further strengthened our credit profile.", "First, our earnings growth. Second-quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.04 per fully diluted share, representing 7% growth on a comparable basis over the second quarter of 2015. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by the carryover impact of 2015 investments, including Ardent, together with new year-to-date investments in 2016 and second-quarter same-store NOI growth.", "Ventas made $65 million in new investments in the second quarter of 2016, including $30 million of acquisitions, and $35 million of development and redevelopment spending during the quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet in Q2 through the issuance of a total of 3.5 million shares of common stock under our ATM for gross proceeds of approximately $232 million. We also capitalized on the strong debt capital markets and took refinancing risk off the table in the quarter. In June, we tendered and ultimately retired in full the $550 million 1.55% senior notes maturing in September 2016. The September note was retired principally through the issuance of a $400 million, 3/8 seven-year unsecured note. Demand for Ventas\u2019s debt offering was very high with the order book 7.5 times oversubscribed. As a result of this cumulative capital activity during the quarter, we have an even healthier balance sheet and excellent liquidity.", "The Company\u2019s net debt to EBITDA ratio improved from 6.1 times at year end 2015 to 5.8 times at the end of the second quarter. Ahead of our expectations. We have lowered gross debt by nearly $300 million since the beginning of the year. Our fixed charge coverage is exceptionally strong at 4.6 times, and our debt to total capitalization is outstanding at 30%. And we did not stop there.", "Following the quarter end, we elected to lock in our attractive return and accretion on the Wexford acquisition through a block equity issuance. Concurrent with deal announcement in early July, Ventas sold 10.3 million shares of common stock for total proceeds of $736 million at an issuance price of approximately $72 per share. We plan to hold the proceeds in cash until the Wexford closing. The temporary FFO cost of this strategy is $0.01 a month, notably dampening our Q3 FFO per share assuming a Q4 Wexford closing.", "We believe the short run dilution of pre-funding is more than offset by the longer-term value creation of this strategy. And that is a good segue to our full-year guidance for the Company. We are updating our normalized FFO per share guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.05 to $4.13, representing 3% to 5% growth over 2015 on a comparable basis. Put simply, the modest $0.02 revision from previous guidance reflects paying $4.00 for the certainty that comes with the Wexford equity pre-funding, as well as Q2 deleveraging, partially offset by the accretive impact of Wexford post-close.", "Our second FFO per share guidance is expected to be lower than our first-half results, driven by these same factors. Setting aside capital activity, our underlying same-store portfolio performance is solid. On the heels of a healthy first half, we are raising the bottom end of our total 2016 same-store NOI guidance range by 50 basis points. 2016 same-store NOI is now estimated to grow in the range of 2% to 3%, up from the Company\u2019s previous range of 1.5% to 3%.", "Our guidance continues to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million, inclusive of $75 million in dispositions closed year-to-date. No further material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity are assumed in guidance. In summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of our productive and strong first half of the year and is committed to sustaining our track record of excellence.", "With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hi, good morning.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Bob Probst", "Good morning.", "Juan Sanabria", "Debbie and Bob, maybe you could speak a little bit about EBITDA growth expectations. Your guidance at the midpoint does seem to imply a bit of a deceleration, and maybe if you could just talk about the confidence level within the new range and how you are seeing your rate strategy playing out? It appears to be working in the primary markets, but any change to how that is working out in the other 30% of the secondary and the tertiary markets.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. We will be happy to address our senior housing operating expectations for you.", "Bob Probst", "Sure. Well, first of all, we are very pleased, Juan, with the first half. As I mentioned, we expected to have a strong first half and we did, and it really has been fueled by the interim I keep referring to, because of the key coastal markets like New York, like LA, like Boston, which have continued to grow mid-single digits. On the back of that, as you referenced, the rate-driven strategy you see the strongest rates and NOI growth in those markets, and that is very much as expected. So we are really pleased with that. At the same time, the construction impact, again, very much in line with the initial guidance we gave in February and the framework we put around that. Indeed, the impact of the new units coming online is on the better end of the guidance that we gave in February.", "And as a consequence, net, net, net when you step back and look at the portfolio in the first half, 2.5% growth above the midpoint of the guidance towards a higher end. So we feel very good about the first half, and that is the core reason why we are raising the guidance for the back half of the year. The reason for the range continues to be very consistent with that framework of engine room performance continuing to drive forward a potential variability depending on the impact of new construction. And that is the reason for the range in the back half. But, fundamentally, the confidence in the guidance is solid.", "Juan Sanabria", "And do you expect the growth to accelerate or decelerate looking at the third and into the fourth quarter?", "Bob Probst", "Well, look, I think you can see a scenario of, if you stick to what we had in the first half, to get the higher end, again, as we were in the first half. So the lower end of that will be dictated by supply, and the big question is, when are those new units coming online? What does that look like?", "One of the things we have seen and others have commented on is deferring new units coming online into 2017. That would obviously be good. That gives more time for absorption of existing inventory. And if that were to happen, we expect to be at the higher end. But it really would be a function of when that inventory comes online and what the impact is.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then, just a second question on dispositions, you still have a share on that left to do relative to the guidance. If you can give us any color on what tax for that, that\u2019s you are looking to sell and maybe why the death of the buyer pools and cap rate expectations? And are you looking to monetize any of those assets in the weaker secondary or tertiary markets?", "Bob Probst", "Sure. So we have $500 million in the guidance for the year, as you readily pointed out, $75 million year-to-date. We feel very confident in that guidance for the year. The markets are good. We have said before and it continues to be true the focus areas include MOBs, some senior housing, and potential loan repayments, and we have line of sight very much for the guidance number of $500 million. Obviously, back-end weighted, so it has an impact in the back end. But feeling good about that guidance number.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Bob Probst", "Next one.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Smitty Ross from Citi. Your line is now open.", "Michael Bilerman", "It is actually Michael Bilerman here. Debbie, I was wondering if we can talk about Wexford, and you commented having worked on it sometimes and having a lot of knowledge. And so when you are presented with it, you were able to act fast, and you called out three variables that ultimately led you to win: the trust that you had with the other parties, the structure that you presented, and then commented as capital markets. And I recognize stars have to align for any deal to occur and you have said that before. How would you rank those three variables as we think about other transactions that could happen?", "So how important is the capital market side versus the trust that the seller has and the structure that you are creating? How would you weight those and rank them?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, one of the biggest factors, as I mentioned in my remarks, Michael, is that, do we believe that we are entering at a good risk-adjusted return and that the assets are going to produce reliable growth and income? So that is the number one factor in all deals, definitely. And obviously, our funding costs are critical because we are here to add value for shareholders. And so appropriate capital markets is extremely important, and I would say, having a good relationship with Blackstone and the Wexford management team is a helpful facilitative factor in the transaction as well. And the structure is always I would say a helpful factor, but normally it is not this positive. It is really those cash flows.", "And here, when we look at Wexford and these are new assets or Class A assets and about three-quarters of the NOI is from tenants who have investment-grade ratings, have billion-plus market cap, have AA rated or universities. That, to us, is a really good risk-adjusted return when you are looking at 10-plus a year length of lease maturities. And so everything came together, I think, in a really positive way. The fact that we have looked at the deal before, I think, really shows our discipline and patience, and that is really how we operate here. And so we are very excited about it, and I hope that answers your question.", "Michael Bilerman", "Yes, no, it does. And I was wondering, how would you debate \u2013 there has been some that have sort of compared this to some of the core life science markets where cap rates are in the 4s% to 5s%, and then taking it one step further, if Wexford came in at high 6s%, it has to be lower quality or there has to have much higher risk involved in that portfolio because it is commanding a cap rate that is significantly in excess of where stuff in Cambridge or South San Francisco would trade. How do you defend some of that criticism?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, I would say the following. The Wexford business is a very institutional business. It matches incredibly well with the Ventas business model. And I do think that there is a natural segmentation, frankly, between this part of the business and the Cambridge, et cetera, cluster market strategy. I would say to you that the reliability of these cash flows is extremely high, and they will produce this reliable growth at income that Ventas prizes and that our investors prize. But it is a different game in Cambridge, really, and there\u2019s excellent players like Alexandria and Blackstone who will invest in those 4% or 5% cap rate markets and deal with the turnover and all of that. But Wexford fits with the Ventas business model.", "And that is really the key thing, and it is a very reliable, consistent growth in income with institutional tenants and even cross-selling opportunities with medical assets as well. So that, I think, if anything, the deal is just a good one for our shareholders, plain and simple.", "Michael Bilerman", "Great. And just last one for me. Can you talk a little bit about the Ardent pipeline and where you stand now that the managers are under AIG and where do they stand in terms of growing the platform with you as a capital source? When we should expect additional acquisitions there?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. Well, as you know, we are big believers in the growth opportunity in our hospital business. We are really happy with the Ardent investment and the Ardent management team. It is performing very well. We have said all along that this is a big, long-term secular opportunity, and we want to build a great business here. We have also said we are going to be very selective and we are. We want high quality with all the characteristics that we\u2019ve talked about over and over again, and we think we can scale this Ardent business.", "But it is a business where we will stay selective and, therefore, difficult to predict when transactions will meet the hurdle and we will have something to announce. But, really, we feel optimistic about the opportunities and feel really good about the Ardent investment and, hopefully, more to follow at the appropriate time.", "Michael Bilerman", "Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Your line is now open.", "Nick Yulico", "Good morning. I had a few questions on your senior housing operating segment. If I look, your portfolio has been kind of steadily losing occupancy quarter by quarter over the last year, which suggests you probably can hold rate growth high forever. So you also cited supply being an issue for 30% of your portfolio. So I guess I am wondering, big picture here, how does senior housing growth get better in coming years? It seems like it should be getting worse.", "Bob Probst", "Well, Nick, if I step back, big picture, I will emphasize again the value proposition of senior housing. We are bullish on senior housing. Short, medium, long-term, because when you look at the services that seniors get in senior housing communities, economically to replicate that at home is twice as expensive. Not to mention the social benefits of being part of a community, which are proven to be enhancing and extending life. And, therefore, there is a great product offering here where affordability \u2013 importantly, we have affordability, if you look at net worth among seniors, affordability of senior housing is not negating issue. They can afford comfortably on average to enter senior housing.", "So that, together with, of course, the aging population, the megatrend of longevity, has a huge tailwind to this business, give me and us confidence in that business. Now, within that, as you rightly point out, we have been driving a rate strategy in light of that value proposition. We think that is a smart move that really is very much predicated on the annual rent letter. And that increase we saw this year, which was among the highest we have had, has held nicely and is proving out to be a good strategy.", "At the same time, we are being sensitive to the occupancy impacts, and this is proving out to be a good formula. One that will be dynamic, though, and we will make sure we are managing well because it is a more complex equation between rate and occupancy. But, nonetheless, again, we like where we are. The strategy is proving out very much in line with where we expect it to be, and then short, medium, long-term, this is a great business.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Bob. Just a follow-up is, I think you had said that \u2013 you have been saying that your second quarter was one of your toughest comps. And I wasn\u2019t sure if that was due to occupancy or otherwise, but if I look at what you had over 91% occupancy in the third and fourth quarters last year, it seems like you also have some tough comps in the back half of the year. So maybe you can just explain how we should be thinking about your guidance and what it assumes four \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 I forget This has been mentioned yet, but occupancy, whether it is sort of declining year-over-year, if that is built into the guidance in the back half of the year.", "Bob Probst", "Right. Okay. So looking at the guidance for the year in the back half, what we expect to happen is we narrow the gap, if you look year-over-year, in terms of occupancy relative to the first quarter to the second. That is still lower than last year. We hope to continue to narrow that gap at \u2013 on a full-year basis, occupancy will be below prior year. However, rate, we continue to expect will be strong and to hold with where we are, and that is really important in part to cover costs. And, therefore, the paradigm of the P&L is one where revenue growth very much in line with expense growth to deliver the guidance we gave for the year.", "So that is the P&L profile. I think if you look within construction markets, you will see a different dynamic where we still see rate growth, albeit not as strong, and you do see some occupancy pressure. And so for that 30% of the portfolio, you do see a slightly different P&L. But again, because of the engine room, it is more than offset by the key markets to deliver the overall year.", "Nick Yulico", "Appreciate it. Thanks.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Nick.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Tyler from Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.", "Kevin Tyler", "Yes. Good morning, thanks. The triple net assets, the customer growth I guess that I expect from those more in the 2% to 3% range and you reported 4% in the quarter because of the Kindred fee, it didn\u2019t seem like there was a ton of role or any role in the portfolio, and I know you mentioned escalations. But can you just explain how you got to 4% and maybe why it is running, at least so far this year above the normalized pace?", "Bob Probst", "Sure. I will highlight a few things. One is, we mentioned the Kindred deal that we did in April, which, as part of that, you will recall, we reallocated rent to more productive assets. We saw that in the second quarter. That is a same-store benefit that contributes to the 4% and will continue to do so as that rent, again, was reallocated to assets that could sustain that given the strength of those assets. So that is one driver. And then, second, we have a couple of higher escalators. We have talked about holiday, for example, in the past in the senior housing business, which we are seeing the benefit of, again, also expected to continue into the back half when we look at it. So in place escalators, notably with a few significant drivers, are really what is underlying that, Kevin.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay thanks and holiday rolls off this year, correct?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Our last 4%-ish escalator is in 2016, yes.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay. Thanks. And then, within the triple net bucket, Ardent is certainly a part of that, and CMS was out with some hospital quality star ratings. And just on some quick numbers that I looked at, it looked like the average star rating for Ardent was kind of in the 3 out of 5 range, and I am just wondering how you think about that number, just in general the ratings, but then 3 out of 5 going forward, does it change revenue? Does it have any impact on the way people make their decisions? We are early, but I am just curious thoughts on that.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. Oh, I am so glad you asked that. That did come out this week, and if you eliminate the 20% of hospitals that were not rated and you look at the percentages, Ardent performed well above average and, in fact, in its markets, performed better than the competition. So we were pleased with the outcomes. I know that the management team there is focused ultimately on certainly having everything 3 and above and, ideally, everything in at least a 4. But that is a rarefied air. So we were happy with Ardent\u2019s performance and particularly in its market that it is outperforming the competition on quality ratings.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay. Thanks. And then, the last one I had, Bob, just going back to SHOP for a second, on the other more tertiary markets, the 500 bps of occupancy decline was higher than I would have thought. And I am just wondering, is there anything more than just supply, or is it really supply specific? Its sounds like you are attributing most of it to the new competition, but is there any operational missteps or anything operator specific that might be in there as well?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Kevin, because we are very transparent in almost all \u2013 virtually all of our SHOP assets are in same-store, there is a redevelopment asset that is bringing down that number, which is the principal driver as it goes through significant redevelopment. And, of course, redevelopment can both suppress as well as over time increase same-store performance. So that is what is really happening there.", "Bob Probst", "And it is such a small pool, Kevin, that it really stands out on the page. And we saw the opposite to Debbie\u2019s point last year where we had a ramp-up in one of the redevelopments that really flattered that segment. So you will see ebbs and flows in that bucket simply by size.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. It is a tiny pool", "Bob Probst", "Redevelopment is a very small pool.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. It is a tiny pool", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay. I guess I was under the impression that most of the major redevelopment was on the Atria assets in SHOP, but is there more going on beyond that? Is that what you are\u2026", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, that is an Atria asset in SHOP.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It is in Cape Cod, which is considered by the MSA nomenclature to be a tertiary market.", "Kevin Tyler", "Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.", "Rich Anderson", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Hi, Rich.", "Bob Probst", "Hi, Rich.", "Rich Anderson", "Great quarter. Is the risk of a SHOP going negative off the table now as you see it today? SHOP NOI growth; same-store NOI growth.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Our guidance would certainly suggest so.", "Bob Probst", "The math of the guidance, Rich, would say it is going to grow in the back half, and certainly our experience in the first half supports that. Again, because of the quality of the high barrier to markets in their momentum. So that is why we raised the lower end of the full year.", "Rich Anderson", "I\u2019m thinking further out, though, disruption 2017, 2018, anything. I mean, so that is the conversation.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We will be excited to give you 2017 guidance as soon as we can.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. Debbie, do you have an opinion today as you see it, if the new cardiac bundling programs would be more or less damaging to the skilled nursing business versus CJR?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, that is a loaded question. I would say you wrote an interesting note on that. And I did mention that the value-based payment \u2013 the transition to value-based payments is accelerating with the addition of this new cardiac bundle that is going to be mandatory in, I think, 98 markets in 2017 on top of the CJR. We don\u2019t even know what markets the 98 are yet, and so there is a limited amount of clarity we can provide. But overall, the bundling initiatives, which will continue to come as part of the evolution of the healthcare system, in general, should favor high quality hospitals, and, while longer-term may present opportunities for the winners in skilled nursing, in the near term will likely create some pressures on the business. In terms of quantifying it, again, too early to say on the CJR because we have only been in it since April.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. Fair enough. And then last question for me on Wexford. So you mentioned 10% market share. So you expect to just traffic in that corner of life science, a.k.a. university type business, or do you see yourselves also kind of trafficking in the more conventional space like the research hubs of Boston and San Diego and so on?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. Well, one direct answer and one clarification. We are focused on building the university-based institutional part of that business, which is really Wexford\u2019s core business, and they are far and away the leader in that market. So a great brand, trusted developer, and we believe there is opportunities there to grow that business and have some on the drawing board now, as I mentioned. And that is really where we are going to focus. And the clarification is that these 11 universities that we are already doing business with in the Wexford portfolio \u2013 so 11 universities that are tenants, they account for 10% of all university life science R&D spending, which is amazing when you think about it, that this pool of tenants that accounts for 10%. So our strategy will really be to grow with those leading research universities and then, also, kind of target the next 20 or so institutions in terms of research and development.", "So we think we can grow with the tenants we have, and we have those development sites, most of which are in those markets. And then, we also have additional institutions that are top- tier research universities that we would hope to grow with as well.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. Just one quick one. Do you ever intend to bring in the management function as well, like you have with Lillibridge and so on and fully run it, or are you satisfied with the current structure long-term?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We are actually pleased with the structure, and we have a great example of that in our PMB relationship in medical office. Because it is really a really high quality development platform that we have exclusive relationships with to fund and own preleased premier projects like the Sutter building in California that we are building in downtown San Francisco. So we see Wexford very similar to that, and we think it is a great structure that works for both sides and has worked well for us in the past.", "Rich Anderson", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thanks, Rich.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.", "Jordan Sadler", "Thank you. Good morning. So, on Wexford, similar \u2013 just a follow-up there. How is the exclusive going to work with the Wexford platform? Meaning will the yields on acquisition be similar to what you paid, or do you take any development risk at all?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It will be, again, yes, similar to what we have with PMB and very straightforward, which is, when Wexford has projects, we will work on them together. We have the exclusive rights to fund and own them on market terms.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. So each asset would be negotiated, individually.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes. I mean, we would expect to have, like we do with PMB, development profits in the deals that we would do with Wexford.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. So that infers that the returns would be better than the stabilized cap rate that you guys paid for the in place portfolio.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "In general, yes, but, of course, if it were fully preleased to a AAA credit, I mean, that would be one thing. And if it were \u2013 it is just like any other type of deal that you look at. It will be market based, and we will gain the benefits of a substantial amount of the development process.", "Jordan Sadler", "So you would buy something that was non-stabilized and let them lease it up, like if it had an anchor tenant, for instance.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, honestly, it is like everything else. From example, we are developing this premier MOB in downtown San Francisco that is anchored by AA rated credits that are held, and we make a decision on that with X amount of pre-leasing based on our expertise, knowing that that \u2013 and this is why the businesses are very similar. You have strong institutional support from AA rated institutions for a big component of the building, and that anchor tenant drives the demand for the building to fill in the spaces that are not preleased by that institution. It is exactly parallel. And so every deal is different with PMB, and every deal will be different with Wexford. But we are very excited about the prospects and, as I said, have some things on the drawing board that we think are very attractive.", "Jordan Sadler", "And how does the Wexford portfolio in that business rollup within the organizational structure at Ventas? Is that going to be under the MOB Lillibridge umbrella or other?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It will be its direct line", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. Thank you. One clarification. And this \u2013 on the SHOP portfolio, REVPOR it sequentially looked like it was flat or maybe down a little bit. Is there anything going on in that? I know that the increases in the portfolio and rate came through, I think, in the first quarter, but anything that would have driven it to be flatter as opposed to rising?", "Bob Probst", "Yes. It is flat, as you say, sequentially and up approximately 4% year over year. The big benefit of the rate bump happens in the first quarter where the majority of the increase comes. And then if you look at \u2013 typically, you will see some small drift from there, just to the dynamic of move-ins and the acuity associated with that. So I wouldn\u2019t really read into anything there. Jordan.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thank you. Okay.", "Jordan Sadler", "It\u2019s great.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Michael Carroll", "Yes, Thanks. With regards to the Wexford platform, Debbie, I know you highlighted several near-term development opportunities that you guys are tracking. But how many projects that you comfortable pursuing at once with that platform right now?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Hi, Mike. Like everything else, it will be a function of what is available and will be opportunistic, and we will \u2013 we are a large company. I mean, we are a $36 billion, $37 billion company. So if anyone project is $100 million, $150 million, I think we could certainly manage multiples at one time, assuming we think that they meet our risk-adjusted return expectations. So I like the idea. Unlike a big office building, for example, you\u2019re going to have basically uncorrelated assets under development at one time. You might have one with a Washington University or one with a UPenn or something like that, and so this would be uncorrelated. But we are large enough and have the financial strength and flexibility to do multiple projects at one time.", "Michael Carroll", "And given the growth prospects that you are tracking right now, how big do you think you can grow that platform over the next three to five years?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we want to be reasonable about the expectations. We are very optimistic about it, but we would imagine that in five years, it could be anywhere from 1.5 to 2 times. We have certainly scaled the Atria and Lillibridge businesses. But it is always a function, again, of what the opportunities are presented and whether they meet our capital allocation discipline and whether we think they are going to make money for shareholders.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. Great. Then, the last question, can you give us additional color on the Company\u2019s investment outlook outside of Ardent and Wexford? I mean, what is your specific strategies right now in the MOB in the senior housing spaces?", "John Cobb", "This is John Cobb. I see, we have been very disciplined on how we have approached it. We have looked at the hospital space, like you said. We have looked at now the life science space with Wexford. But we\u2019re also focused growing with customers, and you saw the three deals this past quarter. We did two deals with Lillibridge and one with PMB, and we are focused on growing with our customers and doing some development and redevelopment.", "Michael Carroll", "So then the MOB and senior housing investments will be more smaller transactions with your existing relationships?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "It depends on the opportunities. Of course, we want to help our customers grow. We want to be help them do tuck-ins and fill in markets and so on. And, in addition ", "Bob Probst", "Yes. I think if we saw a Class A portfolio that had \u2013 where we had a Ventas advantage, we would be aggressive, if it made sense for us and our customers.", "Michael Carroll", "Great. Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Market. Your line is now open.", "John Kim", "Thanks, good morning.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Hi, John.", "John Kim", "Last year and again today, you made a very solid case about hospitals becoming a big opportunity for your Company, and then you sort of pivot with the acquisition of Wexford. Can you elaborate on how difficult it is to source high-quality hospitals, especially when you are competing against the communities and HCAs of the world?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We feel very optimistic about the longer-term opportunities to scale Ardent and build a high quality hospital business. The sector is gigantic. It is a $300 billion-plus space. It is consolidating. And, importantly, I truly believe, in my nerdy University of Chicago way, that assets will flow to the most efficient owners and that we are in such an efficient owner with significant expertise. And so I feel very confident about it, and we are working hard on it. All investments are really based on opportunities set, though, and we have said over and over that in the hospital business in particular, we will be selective on quality. And so the thesis remains intact. In fact, it continues to be very exciting to us, and it is really a matter of time, I think, which is a little bit more unpredictable. But we feel good about it.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then in terms of dispositions, can you comment on what you are seeing in terms of pricing in the private market? Historically, healthcare REITs have been price setters, and it seems like this year your cost of capital has improved, but you are also being a little bit more disciplined. So what are you seeing as far as the private market buyers?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Heck, we have always been disciplined. There is a deep market with new entrants who, once you invest in medical office and senior housing, they are very financeable assets. And the good thing, as you point out with our cost of capital and just our overall strength of our business, is that we are sellers by choice. So what we are trying to do is create options in terms of sale and continue to refine our portfolio and do some routine capital recycling. And so I think that is all to the good. And so we feel right on track with our guidance and feel confident about the market for those assets.", "John Kim", "I may have missed this, but did you provide a guidance on cap rates on your dispositions?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, it really depends. As I said, we are sellers by choice, and so we have a pool of opportunities that we can decide whether to do or not. And so the cap rates will depend on what we decide to ultimately pull the trigger on in terms of disposition.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then, a final question on your SHOP guidance. Today, we got a weak GDP print of just 1.2%, which is good for your share price, I suppose, but probably challenging for the environment overall fundamentals. What happens to your strategy if we enter into a zero growth or recessionary environment, and is that factored into your guidance at all?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right. We are in a relatively Goldilocks environment for REITs in general, I would say, and for Ventas in particular as I mentioned. We have been in this slow growth in the U.S. economy for a while, that what I would say is that in the financial crisis and recession, senior housing was the only real estate asset class that continued to show positive NOI growth. Our business \u2013 our guidance is based upon a continued low single digit GDP growth. However, what I would say is, because of our long- term leases, if you look at the kinds of things we are doing with Wexford, if you look at our business mix and our business model, we have inelastic demand, growing demographics, long-term leases with escalations, where our business really should and has in the past in recessionary environments, continued to produce reliable income, and I would expect that going forward.", "John Kim", "Agreed. But the last recession you were mostly triple net, and this time around you have a higher percentage of operating portfolio assets. So I\u2019m just wondering in this \u2013 if we enter a recession time this period, how confident are you that that part of your portfolio is going to be resilient?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think resiliency is exactly the right word, and I think that what Ventas continues to offer to investors, which is highly valuable, is a very protected downside on cash flows with significant upside from internal and external growth. And that is more valuable now than ever.", "John Kim", "Great. Thank you.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thank you. Okay. We have time for a couple more", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Chad Vanacore from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.", "Chad Vanacore", "Hey, good morning all.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Bob Probst", "Good morning.", "Chad Vanacore", "So, looking at your SHOP portfolio and digging a little deeper, it looks like there is a much greater decline in the secondary markets. Now, would you classify those as higher candidates per disposition, or would you expect those operations to turn around?", "Bob Probst", "I think if you step back, there is a strong correlation, as I describe our engine room markets versus those that have some construction exposure, there is a high correlation between primary and secondary markets. Now the performance you see in the secondary market does have a number of those supply challenge markets in it. Witness Indianapolis and Knoxville, for example, to take a couple specifics, whereas the primary markets I talk about in New York and LA and Boston all the time, clearly those aren\u2019t primary. ", "If you step back, I think from a portfolio point of view, that is a little bit of an artificial segmentation that is really NIC driven. We step back and like our portfolio and are looking at ways to be able to, for example, help Atria continue to drive operational excellence, help invest behind that, help them build scale, and even in some of these markets, we continue to see that we gain share in those markets because we have great assets that are run really, really well. So it is not a matter of reacting to the here and now, but thinking about how I can grow short, medium, and long term, and we have not only the assets but the operators to do that.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. So not really candidates for disposition. You think that those operations will turn around.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, everything is a candidate for disposition. And, as I have mentioned with the portfolio that we have, we want to continue to think about where we can optimize the portfolio, where we can recycle capital, and we want to optimize that. And so we review the portfolio on a regular basis and think about the best ways to create pools of potential disposition candidates, and I would say SHOP and MOBs are in that pool, along with loan repayments, as Bob mentioned. And so I would just think about it that way.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. And then, I forgot \u2013 either Michael or Jordan had asked about priorities for acquisitions. I might have missed that. Would you say hospitals first and foremost and then some life science expansion, or how would you rank order your assets priority?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "n no specific order, I would say, as John mentioned, helping customers grow and being a good partner, development and redevelopment, which will be with Wexford, with Atria, et cetera, with Sutter, and PMB and then putting capital to work, supporting Ardent\u2019s growth within the hospital space. So those are key capital allocation priorities.", "Chad Vanacore", "I don\u2019t want to make you choose amongst your children, but where do you think the most compelling returns are right now for you?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I am not going to choose between my children. So let\u2019s take that another time, and we will go to our last question. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Tayo Okusanya", "I will try not to hold us up for too long.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "You are bad and cleanup, come on it\u2019s a good one.", "Tayo Okusanya", "A quick one just around Wexford on financing. I know we have the equity bit in place. How should we be thinking about the debt piece of that transaction?", "Bob Probst", "Well, there\u2019s is two pieces to that equation. One is certainly debt and the other are dispositions, both of which are going to cover the balance. So we did obviously do $750 million on the pre-funding, and the balance will be split between those two.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Got it. Any sense of timing when our long-term financing will be locked in?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "About the time of the closing, which we estimate to be in the fourth.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. Perfect. And then the second thing, Debbie, what are your thoughts right now just around the UK in general, especially on the senior housing side?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, we have a very small investment in UK senior housing. The assets are performing as we expected. We like our partner there. We continue to look at opportunities in the UK. The regulatory and operational environment there has been challenging for the operators, and so we are continuing to do work, and that is how we feel about it. We like our investment. It is small. We are glad we have a presence in the market that enables us to be opportunistic and knowledgeable as I mentioned before, so that is how we are thinking about it.", "Tayo Okusanya", "When you see the regulatory side has been challenging, can you expand on that a little bit?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, there\u2019s new staffing roles rules and things and enforcement activities of that staffing that have increased costs, and the operators are getting kind of up the curve on that. And that is what I mean.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. Great. You guys keep fighting the good fight. Well done.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We care about our investors, and I would just like to close by saying that we know that demand for healthcare and senior housing products and services is going to increase exponentially as people live longer and our aging population grows. With our diverse high quality portfolio, our leading platforms for growth, and our cohesive team, we believe that Ventas and our shareholders will benefit from this wave of oncoming demand and increasing life expectancies. We really appreciate your time and interest in our Company, your continued support of the Company, and nothing makes us happier than making money for you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Ryan Shannon with Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Ryan Shannon", "Thanks, Donaman. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company\u2019s announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company caution that these forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and contingencies, and stockholders and others should recognize that actual results may differ materially from the company\u2019s expectations, whether expressed or implied. ", "Additional information about factors that may affect the company's operations and results is included in the company's Annual Report and Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the company's other SEC filings. ", "Ventas expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations. Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure referenced on this conference call and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company\u2019s supplemental disclosures schedule, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Ryan. And good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas third quarter earnings call. We are delighted to report on our strong financial results brought to you courtesy of the Ventas advantage, our excellent people, platforms and properties. Today. I'll also discuss our close and pending major transactions and provide an overview of economic and market conditions. Because we've been so productive, there is a lot to cover. Following my remarks, Bob Probst will review our segment performance, financial results and full year expectations. After that we will welcome your questions. ", "Leading with results, this quarter we delivered a $1.03 and normalized FFO per share, representing 5% year-over-year comparable growth. We also demonstrated capital markets excellence and positive trend in our credit profile. As a result, we are also pleased to improve our full year normalized FFO per share and same store NOI guidance. Our strong and consistent performance is fueled by our market position at the exciting intersection of healthcare and real estate. Two large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth prospect. ", "Recent activities continue to demonstrate that we are executing on our strategy allocating capital wisely and doing what we said, a Ventas hallmark. We have built an exceptional enterprise that continues to deliver reliable growth and income from a high quality, diverse portfolio on a strong balance sheet.", "Our innovation over the years and especially the spin-off of most of our skilled nursing assets and other development since the third quarter of 2015 have produced a differentiated business mix and put us in a great position for continued success. ", "Let me highlight just a few of the platforms and property that are driving our positive outlook. First, during the quarter we closed on our exciting and accretive $1.5 billion acquisition of institutional quality like science, innovation and medical real estate leads by top universities, academic medical centers and research companies. Our new tenants include Yale, UPenn Medicine, and WashU. Like other areas of our business, our tenants are market leader accounting for fully 10% of all university life science, research and development spending in the US. This investment represents a great entry into the large and growing healthcare related R&D space. ", "It adds an adjacent business line to Ventas that further diversifies our portfolio and cash flow. At a 6.8% going-cash yield for the 23 Class A operating properties, we are delighted with the Wexford investment. We are also benefiting from an exclusive development pipeline with Wexford. There are two assets already underdevelopment in the portfolio anchored by Duke and Wake Forest and nine development sites for future growth. We are already making progress on a high profile, potential new development project adjacent to UPenn Medical. This demonstrates the attractive growth opportunity that should flow from combining Ventas' capital with best in class developer Wexford. ", "Likewise our investment in Ardent has proven to be a channel for growth. Last year during the third quarter we closed our acquisition of Ardent's hospital real estate and articulated a vision for building formidable, high quality hospital business in this large, dynamic space. We chose Ardent as our beachhead investment because it is a winner and potential consolidator with its good hospitals, significant market presence, attractive payer mix, good quality of care and strong margin. ", "We also design the growth strategy that focus on scaling Ardent's experience management team and strong infrastructure. At that time, we identified some desirable acquisition target and legacy hospital partners for LHP who's at the top of the list because it shared these desirable characteristic. We are now happy to say that Ardent has inked a deal to acquire LHP just like we drew it up on the board.", "As healthcare premier capital provider, Ventas is fueling Ardent's growth by providing a $700 million secured loan enabling Ardent to acquire LHP. This deal is attractive both financially and strategically for all Ardent partners and shows our continued ability to align with market leaders to support their growth. ", "Financially, the loan will be accretive to Ventas' 2017 earnings with a going in floating interest rate of approximately 8%. Ardent will remain financially strong and expect to achieve significant synergies. We are happy to say that Ardent continues to perform very well on its base business through the third quarter. Strategically, the LHP acquisition expand Ardent's existing business by 50% making it the second largest privately owned hospital company in the US with annual pro forma revenues of $3 billion and major market share in its diversified location. It also provides Ardent with very valuable partnership with top not so profit health system and academic medical center. ", "As a result, the LHP hospital enjoys strong brand recognition, clinical integration, good market and favorable payer relationship. We expect the Ardent LHP deal and our loan to close in the first quarter of 2017 subject to customary regulatory and other condition. Ventas is committed to being a positive influence in our industry to maintaining strong relationships with the nation's leading providers of care and to working collaboratively with them to create value. Recently across our business line we made good progress advancing our customers' interest in areas important to them. Here are a few examples. First, we recently reached mutually beneficial agreement to modify our decade long agreement with Sunrise Senior Living. In short, we provided long term stability in the management contract with Sunrise and Sunrise agreed to reduce the management fees we pay under that agreement on a permanent basis. ", "Other changes to the agreement align the companies towards profitable growth and enable Sunrise and its dedicated on-site employees to focus on providing superior services to seniors and their family. We also entered into a new multiyear pipeline agreement with Sunrise, giving Ventas the right to fund a pool of new Sunrise roundup development. Second, we've also reached agreement with various customers to cooperate with them on modest asset sales or asset buyback. These included the recently completed sale of seven long -term acute care hospitals, or LTACs with Kindred to a new operator. And a pending disposition of 11 non strategic senior living asset with Brookdale.", "This approach can give the care providers operating flexibility and higher cash flow and also enabled Ventas to recycle capital into attractive development, redevelopment or acquisition opportunities. We are committed to finding way to support our customers' effort to improve their own results and performance in ways that also benefit our portfolio and protect Ventas shareholders.", "As a result of our portfolio performance and accretive acquisition, we drove good cash flow from operations this quarter too, enabling us to pay our investor a strong and secured dividend of over 4%. We expect our Board to increase our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2016. When we look at the investment market, we continue to see attractive opportunities but we remain highly selective. We focus on deals that would generate reliable cash flow and cash flow growth at an appropriate risk adjusted return. Our capital allocation is also strategic emphasizing sectors with upside and situations like Lillibridge, Atria, Wexford, and Ardent where significant future growth potential exist from consolidation and/or development.", "Our ability to invest capital across cycle to deliver value to our investors comes from the combination of our advantaged position within fix asset classes or vertical, our strong relationships with market leading customers and platform. And our team hardened experience and skill. The macro environment unbalanced continues to be favorable including GDP growth in the 2% to 3% range and a global thirst for yield that is accelerating foreign investment into US real estate. While the expectation of higher interest rate can initially dampen enthusiasm for REITs and real estate, we are still enjoying the benefit of incredibly low long-term borrowing rate, reasonable job growth, rising household income, low inflation and improving corporate confidence as expressed in surging M&A activity.", "Hopefully, we will also have certainty about the election soon. All of these conditions should be positive for commercial real estate fundamentals and growth. At Ventas with our need based demographically driven best business, a super track record of consistent reliable growth, external investment opportunities, a terrific credit profile and an advantage business mix, we should continue to thrive. ", "Finally, the third quarter marked the anniversary of our Ardent deal and the successful spin-off of most of our skilled nursing facility. When I reflect on the tremendous improvement in our enterprise since then I really like what I see. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, we still generate over $2 billion in an annualized NOI. Our assets are higher quality, our business is more diverse, and our cash flow is robust and even more reliable. And most of our business is with the nation's leading care providers and research institutions. And we enjoy multiple channels of growth. We are also lucky to have a best in class team that truly enjoys working together for the benefit of shareholders.", "Now to talk about our positive quarter, I am happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst.", "Bob Probst", "Thank you, Debbie. The third quarter was represented from the hallmark of Ventas' performance for over a decade. Strong earnings growth and even stronger balance sheet. On the back of that performance we are pleased to update and improve our guidance for both FFO and same store NOI for the full year 2016. Before I get to our overall financial results and guidance, let me start by reviewing the performance of our high quality healthcare and senior housing properties, which together delivered same store cash NOI growth of 2.4% for the nearly 1,200 asset in the company's quarterly same store total portfolio. ", "Performance in the quarter was led by our triple net lease portfolio which accounts for 42% of our NOI. Triple net reported same store cash NOI growth was 4.2% in Q3 versus the prior year, driven principally by strong in place lease escalations. ", "Cash flow coverage and our overall stabilized triple net lease portfolio for the second quarter of 2016, the latest available quarterly information, was strong and consistent with prior quarter at 1.7x, reflecting the quality of our triple net lease properties and of our operators. Coverage in our triple net same-store senior housing portfolio remains at 1.3x. Coverage trends were driven by low single digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months.", "Our shareholders continue to benefit from our decision to spin-off the majority of our post acute portfolio in 2015. And SNF now represent only 4% of Ventas' NOI. Cash flow coverage in our stabilized post acute portfolio is 1.9x. This rent coverage level though it declined of 10 basis points sequentially, is still best in class among peers as skilled nursing operators remain under pressure. ", "Finally, Ardent continues to go from strength to strength delivering continued positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators. Adjusted admission, revenue and EBITDA have continued to trend favorably through the third quarter. With solid year-to-date performance, we expect our triple net segment to deliver towards the mid point of our 3.5% to 4% full year 2016 same store NOI range. ", "Moving to our SHOP portfolio. Before we jump into results, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the value senior housing through lens of Hurricane Matthew to South East United States. Our leading operators took every precaution and ensure the seniors in our communities were safe and secure as Hurricane approached, including stockpiling food supplies and fuel for generators. Staff members went above and beyond to make the residence safety their number one priority often staying overnight and supporting sister communities in area. The support that our seniors received before, during and after the Hurricane highlights the value of senior housing. Dedicated staff and resources, peace of mind, safety and security and a sense of community even in the most challenging situations. All of us at Ventas thank our senior housing operator team for their continued skill and commitment to seniors and their families. ", "Let's turn to the Q3 SHOP results. The framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range for the year continues to hold up well. Our SHOP portfolio delivered a solid quarter generating Q3 same store cash NOI growth of 2% versus the prior year. Rate showed continued strength growing 3.6% in the quarter versus 2015. Additionally, same store occupancy grew 60 basis points sequentially, while the year-over-year occupancy shortfall narrowed to 30 basis points. ", "Operating expenses rose nearly 5% driven by upward wage pressures, tampered by the lower fees from the new Sunrise agreement. The positive impact specifically of the permanent reduction in Sunrise management fees is approximately $1 million per quarter effective July 1, 2016, and therefore benefited third quarter results. Our key coastal markets such as New York, LA and Boston continue to be the engine room of our overall SHOP portfolio growth in the third quarter. Our high barrier entry infill communities overall represent approximately 70% of our SHOP NOI and grew Q3 same store NOI mid single digit on continued strong rate growth. Also notable was the strong top and bottom line performance in the quarter of our Canadian portfolio, driven by very positive results from Atria' integration of the Canadian assets we acquired in 2014 and from our high quality Sunrise Canada portfolio.", "Throughout 2016, we have consistently discussed our framework in regards to the impact of new supply on performance. This framework continues to be valid through the third quarter. Our NOI exposure and markets with the new supply surplus continues to represent 30% of our SHOP portfolio. And consistent with the framework and the initial guidance range we established at the start of the year, our same store NOI in Q3 in these communities decline mid single digit in aggregate. When combined with the mid single digit growth from the 70% of our portfolio in high barrier markets, we blend to the 2% overall same store NOI growth in the quarter. We also continue to see the positive growth impact of redevelopment overall on our results. As a reminder, virtually all of our SHOP assets are in the same store pool including redevelopment properties which can both suppress as well as increased same store performance over time depending on stage of completion of the redevelopment. ", "This is evident in the performance of the small pool of assets in the tertiary markets in the quarter where the disruption from a full scale redevelopment in Cape Code impacted growth. For the full year 2016, we are trending towards the mid point of our full year SHOP guidance range of 1.5% to 3% same store NOI growth for the full year same store pool. ", "Looking ahead to 2017, we are working in close collaboration with our operator partners as they set the annual rate increases for existing residence for next year. We are encouraged by the continuing pricing power in our portfolio and the clear value proposition of senior housing as Hurricane Matthew demonstrated. ", "Further, we continue to believe strongly that the leading operators and the best assets will continue to out perform and we like our position. We are excited to round out the segment review with our newly renamed office operations reporting segment, which now includes our medical office business as well as our newly acquired life science and innovation centers. Taken together these new assets now represent approximately 25% of Ventas' annualized NOI. In our supplemental reporting this quarter, you'll be able to find further details behind the office operation segment. ", "We are pleased with the early performance of our life science acquisition which closed in September. The 23 operating assets are performing well and in line with underwriting. The two development assets are underway are on schedule. And we see exciting growth potential in the pipeline of future new development. ", "In our medical office business, cash NOI and the 354 property quarterly same store pool increased modestly in the third quarter consistent with our expectations. Third quarter results were driven by rate growth from in-place rent escalations, mostly offset by lower year-over-year occupancy resulting from expected move outs as well as the timing of repair and maintenance spend. We continue to make progress on filling the leasing pipeline. Therefore, for the full year 2016 we expect the MOB business will also trend towards the mid point of our 1% to 2% same store growth guidance range for the full year asset pool.", "Turing to our overall financial results. In the third quarter, we delivered superior earnings growth and balance sheet strength supported by terrific capital market execution. ", "First, our earnings growth. Third quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.03 per fully diluted share, representing 5% growth on a comparable basis over the third quarter of 2015. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by the accretive investment together with the third quarter same store NOI growth.", "Ventas made over $1.5 billion in new investments in the third quarter of 2016, principally for the 25 life science and innovation centers managed Wexford. During and following the quarter in order to fund Wexford, we issued over $900 million in equity at an average gross price exceeding $73 per share. This included a block issuance in July for approximately $750 million as well as over $175 million of new ATM issuance in the quarter. We also made progress in our capital recycling program, realizing nearly $200 million in aggregate gross proceed during and immediately after the quarter, principally from loan repayments. The company's normalized FFO results in the third quarter benefited by $0.02 per share from receipt of net fee associated with the repayment of loans in the quarter. Our year-to-date share of proceeds from asset sales and loan repayment now totals nearly $275 million. And we have line of sight for the $500 million of full year gross proceeds including in previous and current guidance. ", "To round out the capital activity in the quarter, we also issued our best 10 year bond in the company's history raising $450 million of 10 year senior notes at an all effective yield of 3.22%. This represented the lowest spread to treasuries and the lowest dollar in 10 year rate in Ventas' history. In addition, the issuance was in very high demand demonstrating strong investor confidence in Ventas' financial strength. ", "The outstanding capital markets activity during the quarter ensures that our balance sheet and liquidity grew even stronger. The company's net debt EBITDA ratio held steady 5.8x at the end of the third quarter. Our fixed charge coverage grew to an exceptional 4.7x, our debt to gross asset value improved to 39%, and our secured debt to total indebtedness reached 6%. ", "Let me closed out the prepared remarks with our revised full year guidance for the company. We are updating and improving our full year 2016 normalized FFO per share guidance to now range from $4.10 to $4.13, up from previous guidance of $4.05 to $4.13. An increase of nearly $0.03 at the midpoint. The new guidance represents 4% to 5% growth in normalized FFO over 2015 on a comparable basis. Our improved guidance range is a result of year-to-date portfolio performance, closed accretive acquisitions and excellent capital market execution. ", "On the heels of positive year-to-date portfolio performance trends, we are also raising the lower end of our total 2016 same store NOI guidance range by 50 basis points. 2016 same store NOI is now estimated to grow in the range of 2.5% to 3% up from the company's previous range of 2% to 3%. Our guidance continues to assume 2016 asset disposition of approximately $500 million. We assume the loan Ardent to fund the LHP acquisition closes in Q1 of 2017 and therefore is not included in our 2016 guidance. No further unannounced material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity are assumed in guidance. ", "In summary, the entire Ventas team is pleased with our highly productive third quarter and our track record of sustained excellence throughout 2016. ", "With that I'll ask the operator to please open the call for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Juan Sanabria", "Good morning. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the Sunrise agreement that you modified. It sounds like you had a $1 million reduction in expenses that was fully baked into the third quarter that helped your same-store NOI growth. What did you give them in terms of the incentives, if you could just walk through how that works?", "Debra Cafaro", "This is Debbie, Juan. What I would say about the agreement is that it's a mutually beneficial one where we were able to provide Sunrise with good long-term stability in its management contract for the original term. And we were able to make sure we were really aligned for growth going forward and also we were able to achieve as you said some lower management fees. ", "Juan Sanabria", "Is there going to be any increased costs if they hit in tenants fees that would offset that $1 million in savings at some point? How should we think about that?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, you should think about I'd say very positively which is that we've actually created incentive for Sunrise to grow even more than the old agreements provided for. And if they do, there will be shared benefit to both companies from hitting those goals which are stretch year goals.", "Juan Sanabria", "And did the management fee go from like a 6% to a sub-4%?", "Bob Probst ", "No. It is not. It is again to percentage decline, you can see on the face P&L 1 through the management fee line, the change is very clear on the face of the P&L, but the $1 million is permanently for a year starting this quarter and carrying on is a good number. ", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. And then just secondly, I think you mentioned some Brookdale dispositions. Could you give us a sense of, A, did Brookdale exit the operations, or did they buy back those assets themselves? And then pricing expectations there -- and were they impacted at all by rent coverage levels at the facility?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good. So again this is a really good opportunity I think for us to work with our customers and benefit them in a way that also is good for Ventas shareholders. So this is still at the very early stage. It is 11 asset, we've agreed to jointly market those assets with Brookdale. So we would be exiting those assets together and a new operator would take over. And our portfolio would improve, Brookdale's performance would improve as a result but again it's a modest transaction in $20 million plus range. So at the margin but again a good example of how the companies can work together to benefit those sets of shareholders. ", "Juan Sanabria", "Just one last one from me if you don't mind. On the MOB portfolio, you guys have lagged a little bit. You've had some occupancy headwinds and some pressures from expenses. How should we think about that going forward relative to, I guess the typical 2% to 3% that we generally see?", "Bob Probst ", "Juan, performance of the quarter very much in line with expectations. We talked earlier in the year about significant move out which flatter the first quarter in particular and we have to rebuild that pipeline. We are doing that successfully. We expect to see sequential improvement in our occupancy line as we think about the balance of the year. We talked about reaching the mid point of our one to two point guidance which implicitly is a confident vote in fourth quarter so we feel like we are on track. ", "Operator", "And our next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is now open.", "Smedes Rose", "Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask you as you look at the pace of expense growth at the RIDEA portfolio, was it a little higher because of, and maybe, overtime associated with Hurricane Matthew? And also just as we look forward, what sort of rate increases do you think that portfolio would need to drive in order just to maintain margin?", "Bob Probst", "Sure. Good question and I'll approach that both sequentially and year-over-year. Sequentially you have a day's difference and you have seasonality, so I wouldn't look at the sequential growth rate because it isn't representative, year-over-year however we have approximately 5% growth in the expense line and that's principally driven by labor. And it is due to factors we talked about before whether that is minimum wage pressures or just a tightening labor market. And so that is certainly something, we are keeping a wary eye on, we've got a price to cover that and that's where -- therefore I come to the importance for example of annual rate letter and really being smart about where you have pricing power and getting the ability to cover your cost through improved pricing. So that is something we are likely to see carry on. ", "Smedes Rose", "Okay, because I think this year you talked about a 4% rate increase that kind of moved through the system. If the operators are able to push a similar rate increase for next year, do you think that's enough to maintain where you are now, or just to -- I mean it seems like the pace of expenses is higher than that now. So I was just sort of wondering has that maybe spiked a little bit in the third quarter. Or is that truly kind of the run rate going forward?", "Bob Probst", "I caution using any quarter as representative. There are always ebbs and flows. I think it is safe to say as we talked about early in the year 4% as a good benchmark. We saw a bit of pressure on that in the third underlying drivers of that I think we expect for the foreseeable future in the near term carry on. And so therefore we need to have the smart pricing decision on top of that. That as we think about 2017 is particularly important. ", "Smedes Rose", "Okay. And then just sticking with senior housing for a second, you mentioned you're exiting some of your Brookdale assets. But would you consider purchasing other Brookdale assets that would be potentially more productive going down the line? I think there are a number of things going on with their portfolio across the different owners.", "Debra Cafaro", "We have a good relationship with Brookdale and they are one of the largest obviously senior living providers. And we've been doing business with them since 2005. So I would hope that over the years as we have we will engage in lots of different types of discussions with them to grow and to dispose as we just talk about in ways that can be beneficial for both of us.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies LLC. Your line is now open.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Hi, good morning, everyone. I just want to talk about the Ardent deal a little bit. And again, on a longer-term basis, a couple of things I wanted to understand. Do you have an ability to kind of do a loan to own, and actually own any of the real estate, number one? Number two, is there any risk of Ardent prepaying the loan early, and is there any prepayment penalties associated with that? And number three, what kind of acquisition pipeline does the deal create for you on a going-forward basis?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I love the way you say loan to own, I wish I could say it as beautifully but what we really have committed to in the hospital business and with Ardent is to help Ardent grow and extend their business in a really high quality selective way. And that means of course great market share, great assets and good payer relationship, good mix. And so LHP meets all of those and what we've tried to do is create a bespoke capital solution for the deal that really enabled Ardent to win the deal and will enable Ardent to close the deal. And gives us great optionality as you point out it is a well structured loan, if we get it paid back we'll be quite happy, there are limitation, a lock up period and so on the repayment. And of course LHP has this great partnership with very high quality not for profit system and academic medical centers and in that regard we wanted to be good partners to them. And if they believe over time that there is an opportunity to gain real estate ownership we would be very open to that. But the key is really developing this relationship with not for profit, fueling Ardent's growth and creating obviously a larger rolodex of relationship in for profit and not for profit quality healthcare business. So we are very excited about this and I think it does a lot for us, for Ardent and for EGI.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Got it, okay. That's helpful. The second question on the senior housing operating portfolio: just taking a look at the quarter results, again, there's some OpEx pressure for sure. What is the -- is this opportunity to get even more aggressive with rental rate increases to kind of offset some of that OpEx pressure going forward?", "Bob Probst", "Yes. Tayo absolutely and I mentioned earlier the need to understand your portfolio where you have pricing power. This is the time of the year where we are working in collaboration with our operators around the annual rent letter which is an important part of the revenue line for the forward year. And therefore we need to take advantage of that pricing power and the value senior housing which I keep espousing, the value proposition is tremendous and therefore we need to recognize that through that price. So we will be very thoughtful about that as we head into 2017.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just the last one from me; thanks for indulging me. Just going back to Juan's question around Sunrise. Again, I know it might be difficult to give a lot of details about the changes, whether for competitive reasons or you guys have non-disclosures and things like that, but it would still be helpful to just get a better sense of you guys are getting $1 million a quarter in savings trying to get a better more detailed understanding of what Sunrise is getting that makes this mutually beneficial to them.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you for your sensitivity to the situation. I would just say that Sunrise is really getting the ability to have stability in this management contracts for the original term. Again opportunities to align both of our companies towards profitable growth. ", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. But again the term didn't change, so it's not as if they'll now have the management contracts for a longer period of time. It seems like -- I mean did they -- is there some type of promote that they get at a certain point, if they hit certain margin requirements? Or just kind of anything we can kind of get a sense of what is the opposite side of this transaction? ", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, as I mentioned we've established some positive growth target in the new arrangement and should Sunrise outperform those then we will both mutually benefit. ", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. It's just that it's very hard to try to model this now because something's changed, and we're just not quite sure what that means going forward.", "Debra Cafaro", "Just be happy. ", "Tayo Okusanya", "All right, Debbie. All right. Okay. I will let you guys go. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Both Ventas and Sunrise are happy so you can share that. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And our next question is from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.", "Rich Anderson", "Thank you and good morning. If I could just finish that Sunrise dialogue, is there any change to the way by which a given contract can be cancelled? Or there are still the same types of covenants involved in terms of their performance?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we basically have modified the contracts to convert single asset right that Ventas has into more favorable but full contract provisions.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. Okay. That's interesting, okay. And then would you have produced -- would you have had to reduce your SHOP same-store growth had it not been for this revision?", "Bob Probst", "No, Rich. Thanks for that question. And I highlighted the fact that we are expecting to hit the mid point of the range for the year. And even adjusting for the benefit of the Sunrise agreement that would still put us right into that guidance range.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. And then lastly, I am fielding a few questions on LHP and I want to give you the opportunity to respond here. Can you talk about to the degree you know -- their coverage metrics currently, pre-merger with Ardent? There is a perception about their kind of C credit worthiness in terms of their debt costs and what not. If you could give a perspective on why LHP is the great opportunity for Ardent, or if it's an opportunistic investment for Ardent to improve upon what is maybe something at a lower scale than where Ardent is operating? If you could comment on that.", "Debra Cafaro", "Absolutely. So again LHP is extremely attractive because and then we noted that at the very beginning of our deal last year and that's because they have really strong market share exceeding 60% really good margins, really good mix and as I mentioned these valuable partnerships with brand names that give pricing power. And so it is a real gem and in terms of we are looking at 2017 expected performance. And I'll tell you that LHP now is borrowing in the 4s. And so we think that the credit market is understanding the credit worthiness of the company based on that. ", "Rich Anderson", "Do you have any comment about how they are covering their rents, their existing hospitals?", "Debra Cafaro", "As I understand it, they only have one aspect and it is performing exceeding well. [Multiple Speakers]", "Rich Anderson", "One asset it doesn't own I guess. Instead of being rent, maybe talk about interest coverage.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean as we look forward we expect to see very strong coverage of our loan which is at a higher interest rate as well as rent on the pro forma organization. ", "Operator", "And Our next question is from Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.", "Michael Knott", "Hey, good morning. Just to touch again on the Sunrise question, I was just curious if that was contemplated in last quarter's guidance; and just sort of what drove the need to do that arrangement -- redo that arrangement now? ", "Debra Cafaro", "As I mentioned, we have myriad ways at Ventas is working all the time to produce results and cash flow for shareholders and to be a good partner to our customers. And this fits really squarely within that. And our business is very dynamic, it always evolving and we have opportunities all the time if we are wise enough and alert enough to see them to work with our partners whether it is the kind of Kindred LTAC sales that we just completed or the Brookdale deal that we just got launched or this agreement with Sunrise to really find innovative ways that are creative, that are customized, that help both companies achieve the goal that they have. And the Sunrise deal fit squarely within that. ", "Michael Knott", "Okay, thanks. And then just with respect to pricing power, can you help me understand the difference that you guys are seeing between renewals versus new residents, and discounting, and things like that?", "Bob Probst", "Sure. It really is the market by market conversation based on the dynamics of that market, Michael. But I can say is if you look at across our portfolio as the rate growth that we had and we saw 3.6% RevPAR growth in quarter. We see growth pretty consistently across the portfolio. And I think in the next data if you do the same you see that rate is up pretty significantly. And we see that in our portfolio. Now there are always pockets where there are exceptions both above and below the average. But I'd say overall we are seeing good rate opportunity. And again the opportunity to carry that forward as we look ahead. So the pricing power is there and it is real.", "Michael Knott", "So it's not just on the renewal side? You're not seeing increased discounts for new residents? It's fairly balanced, it sounds like you are saying.", "Bob Probst", "Yes. I mean the revenue line is going to be a function of both moves ins and the annual rate letter on a blended basis, very positive and again it is market by market dynamic but overall across the portfolio we feel good about the price. And that is as you know has been the strategy from the beginning of the year and it is held in very well.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. And then if I could just ask one more quickly just on your thoughts on allocating capital? Obviously you have a very favorable cost of capital, and you continue to emphasize your discipline, which is admirable. Just curious your thoughts on -- do you expect that you will see more opportunities? Are you thinking about anything on the senior housing side? Just curious if you will -- in general, you expect additional investment going forward as opposed to the last couple quarters? ", "Debra Cafaro", "We are seeing attractive opportunities and that is one of the beauties of our diversified business as I mentioned with the six vertical. I think over cycles we've consistently seen good opportunities to allocate capital in the right ways, hopefully at the earlier stage of cycle and we continue to see that. I think we look John and his group looks at tens of billions of dollars of transaction every year and this year is no exception.", "Operator", "And our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "John Kim", "Good morning. I had a question on Ardent or a follow-up on Ardent. So some of the hospitals that have merged recently have struggled with integration, and most publicly Community Health. How should we be comfortable that Ardent is any different with LHP?", "Debra Cafaro", "Great question. So the hospital market does seemed to be a little bit of tale of two cities and I can't speak for the community deals that they have done which have been large and in the rural to rent, Ardent was a huge consolidator when he was the number two executive at HCA over the years and really started the hospital consolidation craze, if you will. And so we have a lot of expertise, so here at Ventas and also at Ardent and of course with Sam Zell's organization which is the majority partner in Ardent. To make sure that we have a positive integration, we don't take anything for granted and there will be lots of people focus on having a smooth integration. But thank you for that question. ", "John Kim", "But as far as the leverage post-deal and perhaps synergy expectations, can you just elaborate on what they are for Ardent?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think the synergies are likely to be significant. We would hope to achieve those over a couple year periods with a majority and achieve in the first year. And so we feel really great about that. ", "John Kim", "As far as the --. ", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean remember, we are also just so you know to keep this in context, and these are five hospitals. ", "John Kim", "Right. As far as the loan you provided to them, did they approach more traditional lenders first? And I just wanted to make sure that they were paying cash interest and not PIK.", "Debra Cafaro", "We paid -- we are a dividend paying company so we like cash payments. So it is cash and it is a floating rate loan and our view on it, it is a market loan, it is attractive for all parties and we were able really to step up and provide a lot of certainty and expertise to EGI and Ardent. And that was I think really beneficial for the deal as a whole. And all three parties I think are happy about it. ", "John Kim", "Okay. On CapEx, your CapEx as a percentage of FFO has trended down this year by about 100 basis points. I'm wondering where you see that going forward, especially as you've increased your office and SHOP portfolio.", "Bob Probst", "Sure. Well, certainly as we think about the redevelopment and development pipeline that something we've talked about that we are really excited about. And we get strong risk adjusted returns on that area with the addition of Wexford clearly there is new opportunity there as well. So I'd expect to see those expenditures go up. At the same time on a non recurring type FAD CapEx if you like, I think we've been quite disciplined and maintain the right level of spend to invest in the properties but also being mindful of cash flow. So I'd say it will trend up through those high return opportunities. We step back from it all and look at our underlying free cash flow, we feel very comfortable we can service that. So aren't concerned about the financing. ", "Debra Cafaro", "I am glad that you've noticed that our FAD is going up because of course that's very beneficial to our cash flow. And also the Wexford assets are very new and so we would not expect to have a significant amount of recurring CapEx on that, 25 assets portfolio. So hopefully that's helpful. ", "John Kim", "Yes, it is thank you. And then finally, just a follow-up on Brookdale. Can you just discuss if there's an opportunity to reshape your portfolio further with them, either through dispositions or maybe even acquiring some more of their assets?", "Debra Cafaro", "We are going to have to move on. But like I said we -- our work is never done. And so we continue to work with our customers, with our partners to benefit both companies. So let's move on to the next question. ", "Operator", "And Our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Jordan Sadler ", "Thank you. Good morning. As it relates to the Sunrise agreement, is there an opportunity for you guys to I guess roll this agreement out more broadly -- maybe approach Atria with something similar? I guess I don't know exactly what it is that you have done, but can you do what you did with Atria?", "Debra Cafaro", "Every agreement is customized to the specific situation. We have very positive agreements with Atria and we've now reworked the Sunrise agreement in a way that we feel in sense align growth and allows them to have stability and take care of seniors. So each is unique, I think we have improved the Sunrise situation and we like the Atria situation but it is a customized approach. ", "Jordan Sadler ", "Okay. I guess the nature of my question is, it seems like your agreement is aimed at -- you know, Sunrise has been the beneficiary of the great top-line growth, the revenue growth you have been able to achieve, but doesn't necessarily share as much in the expense growth. And so this agreement seems to maybe help them share a little bit. And I guess I was curious if you would look to do the same thing because you have been getting great top line, but there are expense pressures. So just given the nature of these management agreements, would you try to maybe do that a little bit more broadly with your other SHOP operators?", "Debra Cafaro", "I mean part of our expertise is really developing these contracts in ways that incent the behavior and outcomes that we want. And in general those types of management agreements do have incentive sharing. And the art is really figuring out under different environment what those levels are and what the percentage sharing is. But in both cases with Atria and Sunrise we have that. And we therefore are aligned towards profitable growth. ", "Jordan Sadler ", "Thanks so much. And one last one on LHP. Seems both these topics are getting a lot of airtime today.", "Debra Cafaro", "Nice talking about them. ", "Jordan Sadler ", "Okay. Good, good. I'm hoping not to pester you too much. So I'm just curious; you made a comment in reaction to a question or response about a 4% rate that I think LHP were borrowing at. And I was kind of curious about the differential between your loan rate and maybe what they are able to borrow at otherwise in the market.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean as I mentioned LHP is an attractive, they are well capitalized and therefore they have an attractive borrowing rate. We believe the five year floating rate loan that we made to help Ardent acquire LHP is a market loan and is an attractive one at the same time that benefits the consortium of owners that is trying to move Ardent toward being the best privately owned hospital company in the United States. ", "Operator", "And our next question is from Chad Vanacore of Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Chad Vanacore", "Hi, good morning, all. So just thinking about the structure of the loan to Ardent. Are you going forward more inclined to provide secured financing of this type rather than outright own the real estate?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay. I am ready. So we are inclined to be the leading premier capital provider to the best healthcare senior housing and research companies in the world. And what we do to do is to customize capital solutions for specific circumstances and help our customers achieve their objective. And in this particular case that evolves the secured loan which has of course been part of our business from time immemorial. So the beauty of our business again is we have multiple vertical, six of them, we have -- we are doing business with the consolidators. We are in a gigantic sector and we can invest at different parts of the capital structure. Whether it was the BMR mezz that we did or this secured loan or sale lease pack et cetera. And that is part of the formula that we've used to deliver reliable growth and income to investors for so long. And so this fits in that pattern. And it was a customized solution. It enabled -- our willingness to step up with this capital enabled Ardent to get this deal with certainty because we provided certainty and so that's why we did it. And I think it provides great optionality down the road. And so we feel very happy about it. ", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. And from your prior answer to Tayo, I wasn't sure -- it sounded like you don't have a purchase option on a property. Is that true?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we have the right to should asset be sold to be the acquirer of those assets. But of course that involves cooperation amongst all the parties should they ever decide to do that. But we are in the right position if that ever comes to path.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right, so that is a right of first offer?", "Debra Cafaro", "If they ask then several comes to market, we will be in a good spot. ", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. You noticed -- you brought up the low end of your same-store cash NOI guidance, but you didn't actually change the individual segment guidance. Can you talk about what gave you more confidence in the overall, if you didn't change the individual segments?", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you for noticing that increase. ", "Bob Probst", "Yes, certainly the confidence in the performance of the portfolio is what's driving that increase. We increased in last quarter as you know, increased it again this quarter. I mean that's just due to portfolio performance overall. And within that each of the segments we identified we think will be at the point and that led us to overall strong performance. So that confidence in year-to-date plus the fourth quarter is why we did it.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. Then one last one for me: have you seen any change in cap rates in senior housing back half of the year?", "Debra Cafaro", "There haven't been a lot of transactional data to look at. But we haven't seen anything significant to comment upon. All right. Let's keep going. We have a few more.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Michael Carroll", "Yes, thank you. Real quick on Ardent, how scalable is that platform? And I'm basically trying to get is how big can they get, or how big does Ardent want to actually grow?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good, good. Well, remember we are talking about a sector that\u2019s a trillion dollars in annual revenues. Over $300 billion in real estate value. So what we've always liked about this business is that it is fragmented, very capital intensive, it is consolidating and we just need to do a little bit to be successful. So those are good characteristics. So look we want to make sure we effectively integrate LHP and it delivers results that we believe it will. But 80% of this market is owned by not for profit and academic medical centers and so we like this additional entr\u00e9e into that community which of course Todd has had his whole career as well. So we like that aspect to it. So I think over time we want to build suite set of formidable high quality hospital business. And that's a long game. But the opportunities are quite large. ", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, great. And then Bob on the SHOP results was there more of a focus on improving occupancy this quarter, as the rate jumped up about 60 basis points sequentially? Or was that just a seasonal impact?", "Bob Probst", "Well, sequentially we saw a nice increase that seasonal typical this time of a year. But also narrow the gap year-on-year which was encouraging to us. And is consistent with what we've talked about last quarter. And so again very much in line with what we had or trade a quarter ago. ", "Operator", "And our next question is from Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Vincent Chao", "Good morning, everyone. Maybe just staying with the hospital opportunity, we talked about potential in Ardent, but I'm just curious how focused you are on potentially adding new hospital operator partners versus tapping the Ardent opportunity.", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. Good question. I would say that, again, while the opportunity is large we are going to remain selective. And in this business we care deeply about who the managers are. And so we do have multiple ways we can grow this business. I think it's a great advantage to try to scale Ardent in the way we have some of our other businesses because you are capturing those synergies and so on. And so that really helps a lot but over time, I'd imagine like our other business lines that we will have a multiple opportunities to grow with potentially multiple partners. ", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Is there anything you can comment on -- I think you said that the business is doing well, but just any comments you can make on sort of admission rates that they are seeing at Ardent?", "Bob Probst", "Yes without specific numbers I think if you look across the board and their key performance indicators green is what you will see, positive trends through the third quarter consistently through the third quarter adjusted admissions, revenue, EBITDA are three highlighted and so a lot of momentum this revenue is going from strength to strength and that's what we are seeing in our business. ", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thanks. Just one last one, just going back to the same-store discussion: on the triple net side, it does seem like the midpoint would suggest acceleration from the third quarter. Kind of was just curious if there's anything specifically that you know about that's going to cause that to move higher? And then I think, if I recall correctly, there are some larger than normal escalator deals in there that would roll off at the end of 2016. Is that right?", "Bob Probst", "In terms of the growth rate in the fourth quarter, I think you will see it looks and feels very much like what we saw in the third to get to that full year number so not anticipating anything unusual. ", "Debra Cafaro", "And also true that at least one of our triple net escalators has early year outside escalators and that the last one of those would be in the fourth quarter of this year. Yes, it would revert to more normalized level. So all right one more. ", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Nick Yulico", "Hi, everyone. Just going back to this Sunrise question, I want to be clear. Is the actual base management fee being reduced, or is it only a change to the performance management fee?", "Debra Cafaro", "The base is being reduced. ", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. And, sorry, did you quantify what the percentage amount was or the sort of benefit is from an expense standpoint?", "Bob Probst", "I just gave a million dollars per quarter number so you can back-of-the-envelope that based on the revenues in the P&L.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. All right, thanks. And I guess just lastly, just a bigger-picture question for you, Debbie, is how you're thinking about senior housing exposure overall. We are getting later in the cycle; occupancy seems like it peaked a year ago. Supply is having more of an impact. If you go back to sort of the big debate of five, six years ago, it was whether it made sense to take a lot of operating exposure in senior housing or just stay with triple net. It feels like we are now past the period of outsized growth in operating, and maybe triple net is going to outperform. So how do you think about managing your overall senior housing portfolio? Are you looking to maybe sell some assets, reduce some of your operating exposure? Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you. Well, we believe in balanced and diversified portfolio that over time again will deliver reliable growth and income as it has I would say that in our senior housing operating portfolio which is about a little bit more that a quarter of our business, we have enjoyed tremendous growth as you point out and it is really some of our best assets in the best market. And so we like owning those assets. They will go through normal cyclical activity, but at the end of day in all the assets we owned whatever structure we own them in, the asset have to perform and grow and product EBIT arm growth over time. And so we really like our spot. We like the diversification. We can always modify kind of at the margin or wholesale as we did with SNF business. But on balance, we really like the diversification of our business and also the quality of our SHOP portfolio. ", "Nick Yulico", "Thanks. ", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, thank you for being patient. And to everyone on the phone, if you are still there, thank you for joining us today. We sincerely as always appreciate your interest in our company. We look forward to seeing you at NAREIT.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ryan Shannon, Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Ryan K. Shannon", "Thanks, Tiara. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the Company's announcement today regarding its results for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2016.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the Company.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thank you, Ryan. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas year-end 2016 earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues as we discuss our excellent productive year, highlight our continued execution of our business plan and discuss our outlook for 2017.", "Our results and our 2017 expectations are completely consistent with the preliminary view we shared with you about a month ago. The Ventas Advantage of superior properties, platforms and people has enabled us to consistently deliver growth in income and outstanding performance through multiple cycles for almost two decades. Our success has been founded on solid strategic vision, innovative and rigorous execution and a stable team with the skill and the will to excel.", "With our commitment to diversification and balance in our high-quality portfolio, our financial strength and flexibility, and the insight to allocate capital wisely in five asset types across the capital structure, we have enjoyed an enduring advantage in value creation.", "These principles powered our great year in 2016 as we reinforced our position as the premier provider of capital to leading healthcare and senior living companies and university-based research institutions. They will also serve us well as we look forward to 2017, despite a changing macro environment.", "I am happy to share some of our important accomplishments during the year. First, we delivered 16% total return to shareholders, outperforming the S&P 500 and the REIT and healthcare REIT indices. Our 17-year compound annual return to shareholders is an exceptional 25%.", "During the year, we grew normalized FFO per share by 5%, at the high end of the guidance range we presented at the beginning of 2016, and we did so on an even stronger balance sheet than we expected ending the year with a meaningfully enhanced credit profile. We worked with our leading operators to grow our same-store cash NOI through operational excellence initiatives and focus.", "We made or committed to investments of nearly $2 billion, including our exciting and accretive $1.5 billion acquisition of a high-quality new life sciences and innovation center portfolio, affiliated with leading universities, academic medical centers and research institutions. This deal is a winner with great yield approaching 7%, attractive real estate, long-term leases with institutional quality tenants and a leading developer partner in Wexford. It also added an important new channel for growth and we already have a robust pipeline with significant near-term acquisition and development opportunities.", "We also delivered reliable income growth to our shareholders by increasing our dividend by 6%. Ventas has one of the best dividend growth records in the REIT industry, and it remains an important component of the value proposition we offer to shareholders.", "To fund our business, we once again demonstrated excellence in capital markets by completing over $2 billion in highly attractive long-term senior note and equity offering. We also generated additional funding sources by accelerating our capital recycling and portfolio optimization plans, receiving over $600 million in profitable loan repayments and disposition proceeds from non-strategic assets.", "We cooperated with several of our customers to help them achieve their business objectives and increase their cash flow, while at the same time protecting Ventas and optimizing our portfolio. These mutually beneficial arrangements with Sunrise, Brookdale, Capital Senior, Kindred, and others, demonstrate our commitment to our customers and our ability to find innovative solutions that benefit both companies. Key among these agreements is a $700 million SNF disposition deal we reached with Kindred to enable Kindred to exit its skilled nursing segment at a very favorable cash rent yield to Ventas of 7%.", "Finally, we also delivered an innovative capital solution to our partners, Ardent and Sam Zell's EGI, to fund their pending acquisition of high-quality acute care provider LHP and scale the Ardent platform into a $3 billion revenue company operating in six states. With its major market share, valuable not-for-profit relationships and strong margins and payor mix, LHP is a great fit for Ardent and we hope to close our investment at the end of the first quarter.", "As a result of our 2016 activities and 2015 spin-off of most of our skilled nursing properties, Ventas has created an industry-leading differentiated portfolio, highly diversified by asset type, business model and tenant. Specifically, our owned portfolio generates 93% of its revenue from private pay sources. Our SHOP portfolio represents approximately 30% of our net operating income. Our attractive life science and medical office building segment generates about 25% of our NOI.", "Our operating and development partners are the best in their respective businesses. Our triple-net leases, representing 42% of our NOI, have virtually no lease expirations through the end of 2018, and none of our tenants represents more than 10% of our NOI. And finally, at the end of this year, we expect to generate only 1% of our NOI from skilled nursing facilities.", "During my 18 years at Ventas, we have seen a lot of changes in our markets as we've become the premier provider of capital to leading healthcare and senior housing operators and research institutions. We've navigated successfully through multiple economic, capital markets and reimbursement cycles and have continued to grow with strength and integrity.", "That said, we now face a period of significant macro volatility and uncertainty. Whether it's major tax reform and its impact on real estate, modifications to the healthcare system, interest rates, or the unknown contours and economic impacts of potential trade barriers or immigration trends, none of us knows exactly what's in store for our businesses.", "What we do know is that Ventas will operate with intensity, experience and skill at the dynamic intersection of healthcare and real estate, two of the largest and growing sectors of GDP. We will focus on managing the risk and capturing the opportunities that a changing environment presents to us, through development of the right strategies, prudent capital allocation and excellent innovation and execution. That's what the talented and cohesive Ventas team has done successfully for almost two decades and it's the same thing we intend to do in 2017, to create value for investors and customers.", "Let me share some of our specific priorities for the year ahead. Enhancing our balance sheet through lengthened debt maturities and increased liquidity to take advantage of opportunities and preserve value in the context of a more volatile and uncertain environment; allocating and recycling capital prudently by investing principally in life science, high-quality acute care hospitals and customer-related growth, and by making smart divestitures including our SNF sale as a way to further differentiate our excellent portfolio mix; investing in our future growth and higher quality asset base through selective development and redevelopment, especially in our exciting new life sciences business and premier senior housing and MOB assets with leading developers and tenants, like AA rated Sutter Healthcare in San Francisco; continuing to build on our Advantage platform, including Atria, Ardent and Wexford; capitalizing on increasing convergence we see between healthcare providers, managed care companies and senior living operators; engaging in mutually supportive and beneficial transactions with our customers; driving cash flow growth and performance in our high-quality assets to deliver reliable growth and income; and continuing to align, motivate and challenge our team, which provides a winning competitive edge.", "It is indisputable that senior living and healthcare real estate is a great place to be. Underpinning our confidence is the incredible market that will certainly provide long-term opportunities for assets to be owned in the most efficient hands, like ours. The senior population in the U.S. will grow rapidly, and with it, demand for our real estate sites where essential home, care and comfort are provided to individuals and their families and groundbreaking research is conducted every day.", "We also foresee that senior housing and healthcare providers will work with each other and with managed care companies to limit readmissions, control health care costs as our nation ages, and advance the nation's health and wellness. We expect to be a full participant in these trends, supporting this operating convergence with our capital.", "So, while we may experience near-term challenges from peaking deliveries of senior living units in 2017 or potential changes to the Affordable Care Act, the opportunities in our $1 trillion fragmented market are unmistakable, inexorable and gigantic. That is one reason we continue to see significant interest in all of our asset types from private equity, pensions and sovereign wealth funds at robust pricing.", "In the midst of a highly dynamic environment, we are confident that we can continue to capitalize on these opportunities. We have the properties, platforms and people to continue leading our sector. The entire Ventas team is excited and ready to deliver in 2017 and beyond.", "Now, I'm happy to turn the call over of our CFO, Bob Probst.", "Robert F. Probst", "Thank you, Debbie. I am pleased to report another strong year of cash flow performance from our high-quality portfolio of healthcare, senior housing and life science research properties. Our overall same-store cash NOI increased 2.7% for the full-year 2016, right in line with our 2.5% to 3% total Company same-store guidance range. Our fourth quarter same-store NOI growth of 2.9% was also right in line with our expectations.", "Let me detail our 2016 performance and 2017 guidance for our portfolio at a segment level, starting with our triple-net business which accounts for 42% of our NOI. Our triple-net portfolio grew same-store cash NOI by an excellent 3.7% for the full year 2016 over 2015. In the fourth quarter, triple-net same-store cash NOI increased by 4.5%, driven principally by strong in-place lease escalations and rent reallocated to more productive assets from the Kindred LTAC lease modification agreement in Q2.", "Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net leased portfolio for the third quarter of 2016, relative to the above information, was consistent with prior quarter at 1.7x. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained at 1.3x, incorporating escalator growth for the trailing 12 months that exceeded 3%. Coverage trends in senior housing were supported by low single-digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months.", "Cash flow coverage in our same-store post-acute portfolio was 1.8x. Our shareholders continue to benefit from our spin-off of the majority of our SNF assets in 2015, together with the anticipated sale of our Kindred SNF assets in 2017. We expect that the spin-off and Kindred disposals will together achieve a highly attractive blended cap rate approximating 7%. It will reduce our exposure to the skilled nursing space to only 1% of Ventas' NOI.", "Specialty hospital coverage declined by 10 basis points to 1.9x, in line with our expectation, as Kindred entered the new LTAC patient criteria in the third quarter. As a reminder, Kindred expects this transition will have the most impact on asset performance through the first half of 2017, after which the net mitigated impact of criteria begins to ease. During the year, we also pruned our Kindred LTAC portfolio and extended leases on remaining LTACs for eight years, while Kindred navigates through the new rules on patient criteria.", "Finally, Ardent continues to drive strong performances and stand out as a leading hospital platform, delivering sustained positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators. Rent coverage at the assets improved 10 basis points sequentially to a very strong 3.1x in Q3. Third quarter 2016 results for Ardent compared favorably to even the very best publicly traded hospital systems in the U.S. Meanwhile, adjusted admissions, revenue and EBITDA continued to trend positively through the fourth quarter of 2016.", "For 2017, we expect our triple-net portfolio overall will grow in the range of 2.5% to 3.5%, driven by more normalized in-place lease escalations in the year. As we discussed in prior calls, 2016 benefited from outsized escalators with certain tenants as well as nonrecurring profits and fees from various value-creating transactions. Consistent with prior practice, our outlook does not include the benefit of new fees in 2017. Taken together, these items result in more moderate yet still attractive triple-net same-store cash NOI growth in 2017.", "Moving on to our senior housing operating portfolio, the framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range one year ago held up very well throughout the year, both for the full year and the fourth quarter 2016. Our same-store SHOP cash NOI increased by 2.3% for the full year 2016 and grew over 1% in the fourth quarter, both right in line with our expectations.", "In both the fourth quarter and full-year 2016, REVPOR increased at approximately 4% overall, driven by our high barrier to entry coastal markets where we have attractive pricing power. We also saw strong pricing in independent living rents, in the care component of assisted living revenues.", "Labor cost increases driven by wage pressures exceeded 5% in 2016. These increases were partially tempered by the benefit of $2 million in lower Sunrise management fees in the second half of the year.", "Our framework for predicting the impact of new competition on performance was accurate throughout 2016. Our premier coastal markets in the U.S., such as New York, Los Angeles and Boston, provided the engine-room of growth for our overall SHOP portfolio in the fourth quarter and for the full year. These high-quality infill communities represent 70% of our SHOP NOI, and for the fourth quarter and full year these communities increased same-store NOI mid-single-digits on strong rate and revenue growth.", "Canada also delivered very strong performance, increasing NOI by nearly 7% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. We observed elevated levels of new building openings in our trade areas in the fourth quarter. Our NOI exposure in markets with a new supply surplus continues to represent 30% of our SHOP portfolio, or less than 10% of Ventas' overall NOI. Our same-store NOI performance in the fourth quarter in these communities decelerated to a mid-single-digits decline via occupancy pressure, as a result of the cumulative impact of new deliveries.", "Net-net, the 70% of our portfolio in high-barrier markets powered same-store NOI growth overall, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year.", "Turning to 2017, we remain bullish on the value proposition of seniors housing and we expect the SHOP portfolio to grow same-store NOI in 2017 in the range of 0% to 2%. We are encouraged by continued pricing power in our SHOP portfolio, which fueled our growth in 2016 and continues to present opportunity in 2017. In fact, both Atria and Sunrise implemented accelerated rent increases through the annual rate letters issued this January. These rate increases appear to be holding up well in the first quarter. Given over 70% of annual SHOP revenue is determined by these rate letters, they are extremely important to our full-year SHOP profit delivery.", "A more severe flu season thus far in 2017 will pressure occupancy in the first quarter. A slower start to the year, together with new deliveries throughout 2017, will likely result in a widening of the occupancy gap in 2017. Nonetheless, the aforementioned strong rate increases support expected NOI growth overall for the year.", "The accelerated level of pricing is also important in light of the continued labor wage pressure, which we estimate will approximate 4% to 5% for our SHOP portfolio overall in 2017. The carryover impact of Sunrise fee reductions from the revised contract signed in Q3 2016 act as a partial offset to these wage pressures.", "We expect deliveries of new supply in 2017 to outpace the elevated levels observed in 2016. And with 30% of our SHOP portfolio with the supply surplus, we anticipate mid to high single-digit NOI declines, a deceleration due to the cumulative impact of new units online. That said, new construction as a percentage of inventory within our trade areas has held steady at 5% overall over the last several quarters and we are seeing early signs that suggest new starts may be slowing.", "Encouragingly, the 70% of our portfolio located in high-barrier markets are expected to continue driving mid single-digit NOI growth in 2017. In fact, we continue to invest in attractive high-return redevelopment projects in these advantaged markets, with six new projects totaling $70 million now underway to help fuel our growth over the medium and long term.", "Let's round out the portfolio review with our office operations reporting segment, which includes our medical office business as well as our newly acquired life science and innovation centers. Taken together, these assets now represent approximately 25% of Ventas' annualized NOI.", "The 23 operating assets acquired through our life science investment, which closed in September 2016, performed very well in the fourth quarter and are in line with underwriting. We expect two more properties to come online late in 2017, adjacent to Duke University and Wake Forest. Finally, we have already made exciting progress in scaling the life science platform by green-lighting two new ground-up developments associated with the University of Pennsylvania and Washington University.", "In our medical office business, cash NOI for the full-year 2016 same-store pool of 270 assets increased by 1.3%, in line with guidance. In the fourth quarter, same-store NOI increased 2.1%. Fourth quarter results were driven by rate growth from in-place rent escalations and expense controls, modestly offset by lower year-over-year occupancy. On a sequential basis, as expected, we made progress in the fourth quarter in growing occupancy with sequential occupancy increasing by 40 basis points to 92%.", "Looking ahead to 2017, we expect stable and steady growth of 1% to 2% from our same-store office portfolio of 364 medical office assets. This guidance assumes modest occupancy and revenue growth as we continue to fill the leasing pipeline through 2017.", "Turning to our overall Company financial results for the full year 2016; in 2016, we delivered strong earnings and dividend growth together with enhanced balance sheet strength. These results were driven by increase in cash flows from our high-quality properties, optimization of our portfolio through continued capital recycling, and terrific capital markets execution.", "Income from continuing operations per share for 2016 grew 36% to $1.59 compared to 2015. Full-year 2016 normalized FFO totaled $4.13 per fully diluted share, representing a 5% growth on a comparable basis over 2015. This strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by accretive investments, lower transaction costs, positive property performance, and profits and fees from transactions with borrowers and tenants.", "We closed on $1.6 billion in acquisitions in 2016, including our acquisition of 23 high-quality life science and innovation centers. We also invested over $140 million in high-return redevelopment and development projects in 2016.", "We accelerated our portfolio optimization and capital recycling program during 2016. Ventas sold properties and received final repayment on loans receivable for proceeds totaling nearly $620 million at a gain of $100 million and with 8% cash and GAAP yields. These proceeds outpaced our previous guidance of $500 million, including approximately $350 million in proceeds realized late in the fourth quarter.", "Importantly, we made great strides in enhancing our balance sheet and financial strength in 2016. We demonstrated capital markets excellence by issuing $1.3 billion in equity over the course of the year at an average gross price of approximately $70 per share. We also raised $850 million of new senior notes, including our most attractive 10-year bond in Ventas' history with an all-in rate below 3.25%. Meanwhile, we retired or refinanced approximately $1 billion of in-place debt, yielding approximately 2.3% on a GAAP basis.", "This cumulative capital activity during the year further bolstered our balance sheet. At year-end, the Company's net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.7x, a 0.4x reduction from our year-end 2015 leverage of 6.1x. Our fixed charge coverage grew to an exceptional 4.8x; our net debt to gross asset value improved by 4 percentage points to 38%; and our secured debt to total indebtedness reached 6%.", "Let me close out our prepared remarks with our full-year 2017 guidance for the Company. In 2017, we expect to demonstrate continued enterprise strength through ongoing strategic dispositions, by extending debt maturities and through continued investments in our attractive platforms.", "Our expectation as we begin the year is for 2017 income from continuing operations to range between $1.72 and $1.78 per fully diluted share. We expect normalized FFO per share to range from $4.12 to $4.18. We expect the total Ventas same-store portfolio to grow cash NOI by 1.5% to 2.5%, with all segments contributing to growth as described earlier.", "Our guidance range assumes continued capital allocation discipline. We expect our ongoing capital recycling program to generate $900 million in disposition proceeds, at a 7% to 8% GAAP yield. This includes $700 million in proceeds at a gain approximating $670 million in the second half of the year through the potential sale of 36 skilled nursing facilities.", "Disposition proceeds are expected to be redeployed at approximately the same rate into new 2017 investments approximating $1 billion, principally to scale our life science and acute care platforms, including $700 million in secured debt financing to fund Ardent's acquisition of LHP. The LHP deal is expected to close late in the first quarter of 2017. We also expect to invest in future growth through attractive new ground-up life science developments, with our development and redevelopment funding expected to accelerate to approximately $300 million in 2017.", "A note on quarterly phasing; we expect a softer first quarter sequentially in 2017 due to nearly $350 million in late Q4 2016 dispositions, the proceeds of which are principally being held as cash until they can be redeployed into our LHP acquisition in late Q1. We plan to drive an even stronger financial profile and liquidity in 2017, including refinancing approximately $1 billion of low-cost short-duration debt with longer-dated notes.", "Our outlook assumes 358 million weighted average shares in 2017, compared to 348 million shares outstanding in 2016. The increase in share count arises from the full year impact of shares issued in 2016 and we do not assume new equity issuance in 2017.", "Net, we forecast our leverage at year-end 2017 to be in line with our strong year-end 2016 position. The result of this 2017 activity underscores the continued excellence of Ventas as enterprise and our team's confidence in our ability to continue to create value for our shareholders.", "With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Juan Sanabria", "For the [indiscernible] portfolio, how are you guys thinking about the trajectory of that same-store growth? Could there be any quarters throughout 2017 where the growth goes negative but the full-year is still positive? It just looks like you've got pretty tough comps with [indiscernible] in the second half in particular and rolling the benefit of this lower Sunrise fees in the second half as well. How should we think about growth?", "Robert F. Probst", "For the full year, just to reinforce, we expect to grow. So the guidance of 0% to 2% is the full-year outlook. As we look at phasing, I expect that will grow throughout the year. And fairly consistently, there are puts and takes. We mentioned for example the flu season in Q1 highlighted that the occupancy challenge from that is going to affect Q1. However, for the first half we also have the carryover benefit of the management fee savings on Sunrise. So net-net-net, as we look across the quarters, we expect fairly consistent growth. No hockey stick type movements either way.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. And then on the MOB platform, you guys had I think 1.2% same-store growth in 2016 and kind of 1% to 2% in 2017, which is below the kind of the typical trend we see for most MOB platforms at 2% to 3%. If you could just delve into what is driving that kind of lower growth and when should that start to reaccelerate?", "Robert F. Probst", "So, 1.3% was the growth last year. And if you unpack that a little bit, we had an interesting year in the sense of a significant tenant departure early in the year, then having to refill that pipeline in terms of tenancy in the back half. That's what we saw in the fourth quarter, we saw the sequential improvement and 2% growth in the fourth quarter, just in line with our expectation, and reiterating the same steady type of growth in 2017. I'd highlight we have fairly significant rolls in 2017 relative to history. So that's our challenge to meet and beat in 2017 on the top line. So that's really how I think about it. It's going to be a top line driven business but very steady and predictable.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay, great. And just last question for me, for hospitals, how are you guys thinking about making incremental investments with the uncertainty, Debbie, you alluded to with the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act? Are you changing how you are underwriting or are you kind of hitting the pause button, or how are you looking at things on the hospital space at this point in time?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We are excited about our investment in Ardent, which as Bob said is performing very well. We're executing on the game plan, which is to scale that platform as we hope to fund the acquisition of LHP in 2017. And LHP is a real gem. So I think our strategy of acquiring really high-quality assets, scaling the business, and we're very focused on executing on that this year. And in addition, we have said all along that we are going to be very highly selective, which we have been and we'll continue to be, but we have a gigantic secular opportunity and we will continue having conversations with people, and should there be additional opportunities that we think will create value, we will certainly pursue them. So that's where we stand on the business right now.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. Thank you very much, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is open.", "Smedes Rose", "I wanted to ask you on \u2013 you mentioned Bob that Atria and Sunrise have rolled out accelerated rate increases. And I was just wondering, when you say that, does that mean that they are increasing what they normally would have done or are they impacting more customers sooner for rate increases, what does that mean exactly?", "Robert F. Probst", "Sure. So as you know, Smedes, in January for most of the business, not all but most of the business, the annual rent increase for in-place residence goes out. And the point I made this year is, we had more aggressive, it would be the right word, accelerated rate increases for this year versus last year, and particularly so I'd say in the Sunrise portfolio, and Atria has historically had the same methodology but I think we saw more alignment between the two operators this year. So, strong growth and stronger than last year in terms of that rate later, which I mentioned is really important to the full year revenue number.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "And I think one of the real benefits that Bob has brought to our senior housing business in working with our care providers is really understanding pricing and where we're making money and making sure we're pricing appropriately for the care and the home that seniors are receiving, and so really deconstructing what the pricing should be and matching it with the services that are being provided and the quality of the residence that's being provided. So, double-clicking, triple-clicking into pricing and making sure that we are matching pricing with needs and services.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay. And then just on the supply as you break out in your supplement, it continues to kind of tick up a little bit sequentially. Do you feel like 2017 is a peak year in terms of construction, you mentioned that you're seeing some slowdown in starts, or kind of maybe a little more color on that?", "Robert F. Probst", "Sure. So let me start with deliveries first. And so, we saw elevated deliveries really in the second half, beginning in the second half principally of last year, and we expect that to continue to increase in terms of new deliveries in 2017 versus 2016. At the same time, when you think about new starts, we've seen through the NIC data that for two quarters now for our trade areas we've had 5% construction to inventory, so level amounts in both quarters. And as we look at the data, we said, some early signs perhaps that that new starts may be slowing. And so that gives us some hope about that, but the delivery certainly in 2017 will be elevated even versus 2016 levels.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Michael Carroll", "I know, Bob, in your prepared remarks you kind of talked about the LTAC portfolio and Kindred's plans to mitigate the new patient criteria. Can you explain how they plan on mitigating some of that weakness?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I'll take that, Michael. So as we talked about before, Kindred spent a year or two preparing to move into patient criteria, which Select Medical, another LTAC provider, went on successfully almost a year prior. And so Kindred was highly prepared to make this transition. And essentially, Kindred has been adopting a strategy of really identifying patients who are eligible for LTAC reimbursement as well as developing a strategy where they can care profitably for what are called site-neutral patients. So, I have every confidence that Kindred will be able to go into criteria in accordance with its expectations and work through the reimbursement and mitigate some of those impacts as we look to the back half of 2017. So, that's a shorthand way to describe a very complex transition.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And then real quick on the coverage, I guess that 1.9 or 1.8 now, I mean how much further should we expect that to drop as these mitigations kind of take hold?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right. I mean, what we've talked about in the past is, over time we would expect it to be maybe 20 basis points, 10 to 20 basis points, all else equal, but there will be a trough and then of course they'll elevate out of that in the back half of 2017 and into 2018. So, in and around that neighborhood, and again, very expected I guess and that we have confidence in Kindred's ability to execute and we have good long-term lease arrangements with them as we go through the transition.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Steve Sakwa", "I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Wexford, and it sounds like you've got some robust development opportunities there. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about the deal, what's gone well, maybe what have been some of the challenges, and maybe talk a little bit more about the returns and the opportunities on the development front?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Sure. First of all, we're very excited to be in this business with the university-based R&D tenants, and it's UPenn Medical, it's Yale, it's Duke, Wake Forest, really leading institutions who account for 10% of university-based R&D spending in the U.S. And I think the opportunity \u2013 and also Wexford is the name in this business, so being partnered with them I think is a real advantage \u2013 and the business opportunity is really very much like the MOB opportunity.", "For example, which is to say we have these big institutions, they have a lot of demands on their capital, and they don't need to own or build all of their real estate. And so, we have this great nucleus of assets now, we have a great development partner who is renowned among the universities for what they do, and the business plan is to scale that platform by doing more business with the universities who are already in our tenant base and to do business with additional leading R&D universities, very simple.", "And what's exciting about this acquisition is that, A, the assets we acquired are excellent and are performing well, and then B, the demand for what we're doing is very strong. And so, we see additional follow-on opportunities in the pipeline with one very well-known university, we also as Bob said have green-lighted a couple of other projects, one adjacent to UPenn in downtown Philadelphia, another one related to WashU, and the pipeline is very robust.", "And so, we think this can be a great channel for growth for us. It's really come in sort of fast and furious and our job is to make sure we're doing good underwriting and that we're available to build this as a real growth opportunity for the Company. So, we're excited about it.", "Steve Sakwa", "And could you provide any parameters around sort of unlevered development yields in this business?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Of course it always depends on the amount of pre-leasing, et cetera, and what the credit quality is, things like that. But in general, we'd\u2026", "Robert F. Probst", "7% to 9%.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We'd be looking at 7% to 9% yields.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Ullico from UBS. Your line is open.", "Nick Ullico", "Just I guess first off on , Bob, going back to the senior housing operating guidance this year, I know you gave some detail on how to think about occupancy and labor expenses. Is it possible to get a little bit more of a breakout for the same-store revenue growth versus the same-store expense growth?", "Robert F. Probst", "For 2017 specifically in terms of the outlook?", "Nick Ullico", "Yes.", "Robert F. Probst", "Sure. Yes, let me unpack that a little bit. In terms of occupancy, we finished the fourth quarter about 120 basis points down year-on-year. Our expectation as we come into the first quarter as I mentioned is with the flu and with these new deliveries that that gap would widen. I would put that, that versus prior year, I would put that in the 200 basis points down range.", "At the same time, really importantly, the pricing that we expect to see if we delivered REVPOR of 4%, I think given that we were more accelerated in our rate letters this year, we expect to see something north of that in terms of rate. And that's not, to say it again, because of the wage pressure in the 4% to 5%, that's for labor I should say, that 4% to 5%. Total cost will be below that growth rate as we drive efficiency and utilities and things like that. So that's the algorithm net-net-net to get us down to the 0% to 2% outlook.", "Nick Ullico", "Okay, that's helpful. And then going back to Ardent, can we get a feel for the ultimate ACA benefit that they've gotten? I mean, if we look at the public hospital operators, it's been between around 5% to as high as 15% as EBITDA benefit for operators in 2016. Do you have a sense for where Ardent would fall in that range?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I do, and if you look at Ardent pro forma with LHP, they will be in six states as I mentioned. Only two of those are Medicaid expansion states. Our general view is that the potential impact on the companies as a whole would potentially, assuming no mitigation, be less than the potential synergies from the transaction. And so we have a built-in buffer there as well as obviously as a landlord we have over 3x coverage. But just at the operating level, we think that what we're doing is really smart and we have a built-in cushion there should there be any impact from a change to the Affordable Care Act.", "I do think it's interesting, and I caution investors not to equate equity operator prices with the reliability of lease streams, but I would note that if you look at like an HCA for example, their stock price was $66 last year at this time, it's $84, $83 to $84 now. I mean, I think there is recognition that these good companies will continue to be good and what these excellent operators do over the decades is they know how to hold the levers in this business to create positive cash flow, and that's what we would expect Ardent to do with a very seasoned CEO that's been through this for three decades. And so, we feel good about it.", "Nick Ullico", "That's helpful, Debbie. Just I guess one last question is, it sounds like there is some acquisition opportunities heating up a bit in hospitals but more so on the non-profit side. Is there any opportunity for you and Ardent to participate in that?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well, good. I mean, we're really focused on closing LHP and are excited about that because it's a gem, and what comes with it, as you point out, are these really valuable not-for-profit relationships with academic medical centers and other large not-for-profits like a sanction. And so, that is one incremental step toward this gigantic opportunity. And again, we'll continue to have conversations, but our focus right now is really closing LHP and then we'll take it from there.", "Nick Ullico", "All right. Thanks everyone.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Vincent Chao", "Maybe just to stick with the last line of questioning, Debbie, maybe if you could expand a little bit, you mentioned some cushion at the operating level beyond just the coverage. Exactly what are you referring to there, like what are some of the things that can help offset some of the potential ACA pressures?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Should there be ACA pressures, which honestly I think there may be a lot of easier policy priorities to accomplish in the near term, but should there be something, I think they will be first of all pushed out, and secondly, we have \u2013 we announced that there would be significant synergies in the merger between the two companies, which again only have two of the six states in Medicaid expansion. And so, we think that's more than enough cushion should there be impact from an ACA repeal.", "But the key thing is, what is the replacement? The replacement may be fine, and so it may have no impact. The key thing is, what is the replacement, and of course we would expect that that replacement would not take effect for one to multiple years.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, just trying to clarify that point. And then just on the hospital opportunity, which you are very happy with the Ardent performance and still looking to scale that business, I guess from a pipeline perspective given some of the uncertainties out there, have the pool of potential acquisitions changed at all on the hospital side or are you still seeing the same level of potential?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "As we said, we're going to be very selective and we're going to play at that top percent of operators and assets that have significant market share, that have quality outcomes, that are efficient, et cetera, and so those conversations will continue over time and it's a really gigantic opportunity, it's a $1 trillion revenue business, the acute-care business.", "Vincent Chao", "But I guess have the conversations changed at all in light of some of what's going on out there with regard to policy?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Really I talked to Todd, he is here with me, and we were at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, and honestly, the hospital acute-care providers are going about their business, which is creating efficiencies, driving quality, all the things that they were doing before. And many of the changes that are in the health care system are so already embedded in what they are doing, I would say that that is really what they are focused on, execution of their business.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.", "Michael Knott", "A question for you just along the lines of ACA potential repeal, can you just touch on how you think that might impact your MOB business and maybe helps us in decision-making with regards to space?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Right. So I would say that again let me just repeat a little bit of what I said, which is that the acute-care providers are going about the business of driving efficiencies, quality, improvement, M&A, et cetera, and they are some of the biggest customers obviously in the MOB business, and we have a really high-quality portfolio that's affiliated with some of the top hospitals. And so, while uncertainty generally can delay decision-making and things like that, we may see some of that this year, I do think that we are well-positioned to continue creating stable growing cash flows in our portfolio.", "Michael Knott", "Okay, thanks. And then just on the investment side, do you mind just touching on what you're sort of seeing out there, the pulse of the investment market, any changes in cap rates or appetite, is there a slowdown because of some of the uncertainties? And then, I think Bob used the word 'discipline' with respect to your investment activity. Just curious if we could also sort of infer that 'caution' is a word that you are applying to your investment activity opportunity set just given where we're at in the cycle?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "So I think what's really interesting is that we are seeing huge continued interest at very robust pricing as I mentioned across our asset types, and it's coming from pension funds, it's coming from sovereigns, it's coming from private equity. And I think that is a sign that people value our assets and they see the big opportunity in our business.", "When we talk about being disciplined capital allocators, as you know, we have always been about doing things that create value for our investors and hopefully being good partners with our customers at the same time. And so, I would not conflate those two words.", "I think we are disciplined when we think about our cost of capital, when we think about risk-adjusted returns and when we think about what is going to create value, and that's always been a hallmark of Ventas'. And that's partly why we have such a good track record of total return, that's why we have a good track record of capital allocation and growth in income, as we take that very seriously, and we think about deals on their own and also how they affect the balance and mix in our portfolio.", "So, we will be disciplined, we've always been disciplined, and take all those factors into account as we continue to make investments.", "Michael Knott", "Okay, thanks. And then just one more for me if I could, and thanks for the time, on senior housing, I know you've emphasized, Bob, the strength of the rate letters that are going out and there's this kind of dichotomy between reduced occupancy but strong pricing power. Can you just talk about how long do you think that can persist, and if we look into maybe a year from now as we think about 2018 just with all the continued supply growth, deliveries in 2017 and then probably similarly high in 2018 I would argue, can you just talk about the outlook for pricing power, how long can that dichotomy between occupancy and rate growth sort of persist? Thanks.", "Robert F. Probst", "Sure. Good question, Michael. I keep coming back to the value proposition of senior housing and let's not forget the big picture of the cost of replicating the services that you receive in the senior housing community. It's twice as expensive to do so at home, not to mention the benefits of being in a community. And that I think is a truism every market that we go into and everything we hear. And the value-added of the services in your report highlights this, of assisted living services, the value it provides to residents. And I don't think that generally speaking [indiscernible] we priced that value necessarily to the point that we can. And so, we are seeing in 2017 the opportunity to do that. Because of the value proposition, I see the opportunity to continue to do so.", "I come back to the framework though of looking at the high-barrier markets where you have the demand, where you have the wealth, where you have little supply in your competition, that's the area where we have pricing power and that's where we're focused, and I think that can continue. But clearly, the supply is going to have an impact in the balance of the portfolio.", "Michael Knott", "And just a quick follow up, so in general, you think sort of stronger renewal rent prospects and then maybe weaker on the new rent side can continue for a while just given what you talked about, the value that's provided to residents, et cetera, seems like that can persist?", "Robert F. Probst", "Yes. So we have not only the annual increase but also street rate. We expect to see year-over-year growth. Again, that's driven by those engine-room markets where we see nice increases, not at the level necessarily of the rate letter but still nice growth. So it's both that we see particularly in that 70% of our portfolio, that is the high barrier to entry markets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.", "Richard Anderson", "Thank, and I know one hour is the magic number, so I'd be quick. So in your disclosure, you've had this footnote before for SHOP. It says it excludes closed units during periods of closure, which is kind of a funny way to say but I assume it's been a lot of thought put into it. What does that mean like and how substantial is that relative to the impact it might have on your growth profile in the SHOP portfolio?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, it's very minimal. It's like, for example, if there was a fire and the building was closed down or a flood or something like that, that type of thing, very minimal.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay then, short answer is good with me. And then for 2017, you pointed out Canada was a leader at 7%-plus, or whatever it was, for 2016, what do you think that Canada/U.S. breakdown might be for SHOP in 2017?", "Robert F. Probst", "First of all, thrilled about the Canada performance, it grew mid-single for the year, it's great, 7% in the fourth. And if you look at occupancy, pushing 95%. And so I'm just sounding like a broken record here, but the opportunity as we think about 2017 is very much with a 95% occupied building to get some pricing.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Plus they have good hockey.", "Richard Anderson", "Hockey, yes, really. All right.", "Robert F. Probst", "Yes, it's really hockey. So it's going to drive Canada next year, or this year, 2017.", "Richard Anderson", "So Canada will again be a leader you think?", "Robert F. Probst", "Yes.", "Richard Anderson", "To the degree it was this time? I mean that was pretty substantial.", "Robert F. Probst", "It will be a nice grower, no doubt, it will contribute nicely.", "Richard Anderson", "Could that mean that U.S. could be a negative number?", "Robert F. Probst", "Again, we have a range. So at 0% to 2%, you could probably back into math to suggest that to be true.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Multiple permutations.", "Robert F. Probst", "So that's where you are in the range.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay, sounds good. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Chad Vanacore", "So thinking about fourth quarter earnings, FFO was largely in line, FAD was a little bit lower than expected, and it looked like that was on CapEx spending. And I know you had warned us about this last quarter, but it still seemed to come in a little bit higher at around $45 million a quarter. So, should we expect that to be a run rate through 2017 or does that moderate or increase?", "Robert F. Probst", "So FAD, relative to what we put out a month ago, in the range in terms of dollars, I think we're about $1 million below the $1.27 billion of our outlook, and that was really CapEx timing as much as anything. I would step back and say, in terms of FAD CapEx focus areas, MOB is one area of focus in particular, but I wouldn't infer anything kind of beyond that.", "Chad Vanacore", "Then what we should be thinking like on average per quarter?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "If you look at the reconciliation for 2017\u2026", "Robert F. Probst", "We have about $125 million of what I call FAD CapEx in the year. It tends to be more back half weighted, typically the fourth quarter, to ramp a little bit in the fourth quarter. But again, it depends a little bit, Chad, just on what's going on in terms of the projects. You could have a [indiscernible], so it would be lumpy for example. So, there is an extreme seasonality to that number.", "Chad Vanacore", "Okay, thanks. And then just speaking of pricing growth, you mentioned pushing aggressive pricing on the SHOP portfolio. What's the difference in pricing between at 70% of SHOP that seem to be in high barrier entry markets and the 30% that's facing competition?", "Robert F. Probst", "In terms of absolute REVPOR\u2026", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Again, I think the pricing is really an enhanced way to appropriately have the operators be paid for the care and services that they are providing and to match pricing with the value that the families and the seniors are getting, and we are doing that more effectively I would say in 2017. And Bob will take the rest of that.", "Robert F. Probst", "If you look at the 70% versus the 30% at REVPOR, the 70% equilibrium markets, there's not a significant difference on REVPOR. What's different is the growth rate between the two.", "Chad Vanacore", "So pretty [indiscernible] what you're saying is, pricing in a more competitive market, that growth is going to be smaller than the high-barrier market, is that right?", "Robert F. Probst", "Yes, exactly.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Well said, yes.", "Chad Vanacore", "Okay, all right. And just one quick update, the Kindred portfolio sales, I think you left most of that in Kindred hand. Can you give us an update of where you are in that process?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I can and would encourage you to listen to Kindred's call later because they'll give a more fulsome update because they are on point there. Our understanding is that it's going well and there's a lot of interest. As I talked about earlier, that there is a lot of interest in all of our asset classes and this would presumably be no exception. And so, we are anticipating on balance a second half execution of that transaction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "John Kim", "So last year in your supplemental, you broke down a sizable revenue enhancing CapEx figure of $110 million, and this year that figure is not in your supplemental. Do you still have this program or is it just now reclassified somewhere else?", "Robert F. Probst", "We absolutely still have the program, John. We changed a little bit the presentation to really highlight on that one page, I'll call it the FAD CapEx breakdown, sustaining CapEx, versus the prior pages which demonstrate the development and redevelopment. So really just tried to differentiate and distinguish the different types of spend. But the program is very important and a huge priority for us. As we've said, in fact we're going to\u2026", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Accelerate it, yes.", "Robert F. Probst", "Increase our amount of spending from $140 million to $300 million, round number, 2016 to 2017. So it's key, it's a core priority.", "John Kim", "And so can you just remind us or maybe provide some color on what constitutes a redevelopment, and also if you have a projected yield on your existing program?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "If we have a what, I'm sorry?", "John Kim", "A projected yield.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Okay. So in those numbers, we're talking about this selective redevelopment and development program we talked about, we would include within that ground-up development like our Class A downtown San Francisco medical office building, it would be our newly opened senior living community, Foster City in Northern California, it would include any life sciences, as we mentioned potential developments with UPenn or WashU that we talked about. And it would include some redevelopments that we've done over time where there are significant impacts on the community where we for example add a life guidance or memory care unit or build another wing or convert parts of the building to other uses, those types of things.", "And we tend to, as John said, we tend to look at 7%-plus returns depending again on the profile of the tenancy, the pre-leasing, the credit quality in the ground-up developments. I mentioned the San Francisco MOB, we've got AA rated credit, it's substantially pre-leased building. That's one type of yield. As we're doing these redevelopment projects, I'd say high single-digits, low double-digits unlevered expectations for returns.", "John Kim", "Okay, that's helpful. So the redevelopments are mostly additive, not just enhancing existing units?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I mean, principally they are redos of things or additions of things, yes.", "John Kim", "Got it, okay.", "Robert F. Probst", "That generate a return.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "That generate a return, yes.", "Robert F. Probst", "That generate returns as distinguished from the FAD CapEx which are profit sustaining type initiatives, roofs and boilers and things like that.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes.", "John Kim", "And Debbie, you mentioned briefly the share prices of some of the public operators. I'm just wondering if you find it preferable for your operating partners to be public or private.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "We are agnostic. We want our operators to be great at what they do, leaders in their markets, provide good quality care, and operate with a lot of integrity and compliance. So that's what we like. And we have the lion's share of our portfolio as we've reshaped our business over the last couple of years, is with those leading operators. So we have a few more questions. I'm sorry, but we have to hustle, we have a few more questions that we still want to take, John. We'll be happy to\u2026", "John Kim", "Sure, no problem.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.", "Jordan Sadler", "In terms of your acquisition discussion and guidance in terms of deploying $1 billion or so in 2017, you're focused on life science and the acute-care hospital pipeline. So should we expect the life science deployments principally to be through development, is that right?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes.", "Jordan Sadler", "So, no new really stabilized property acquisitions there outside of Wexford?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "There could be \u2013 again, when we give the $1 billion, it's pretty straightforward. We've got $700 million that we are funding on the Ardent acquisition of LHP. Then we have $300 million of other, some acquisitions of stabilized assets, some are developments of life science that we've talked about. And so\u2026", "Jordan Sadler", "I guess my question is, as you are looking out and pursuing and underwriting transactions, I'm just curious what your interest level is, where the best risk-adjusted opportunity is among the segments that you are invested in?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Yes, I think the best risk-adjusted segments are the areas we have identified for capital allocation, which will be really high-quality hospitals, definitely growth in the life sciences segment, principally by development but also by potential acquisitions, and follow-on opportunities, and customer oriented activities. That's where we have been focusing the last couple of years and that's where we'll continue to focus and that's where we think we have the best return, in addition to of course the development/redevelopment that we just talked about.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. And so, on the other side, the trimming that you're doing, which is also identified, but there's a couple of hundred million that's not necessarily, your trimming could be done presumably out of the MOB and senior housing portfolios, as you've done\u2026?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "I think the trimming \u2013 so we are talking, I think it's important to identify this capital recycling that we are doing in 2017 of $900 million of dispositions and then $1 billion of investments. So the $900 million straightforward to, it's the Kindred $700 million and then some dribs and drabs $88 million we just closed on some senior housing with a customer that was a good mutually beneficial deal. So that covers about $800 million of it, and the rest is kind of dribs and drabs to get to the $900 million, and I've already gone over the $1 billion. So that's the capital recycling that we've talked about that really is value creating.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Joshua Raskin", "Thanks for fitting me in at the end. I guess I'll just ask a quick one. Just getting back to the slowing of new construction, I wonder is there specific data on maybe markets or how long that takes to get the deliveries, et cetera, just when you would expect that to start showing up in terms of results.", "Robert F. Probst", "I'd say, one thing to point to is the data we referenced that could suggest some slowing is NIC data, where if you look both for IL and AL at starts, in both cases they are the slowest that we have seen since 2012 to 2014 in that range. So, it's a couple of data points. Anecdotally, around financing would be another one, difficulty in financing, difficulty of lining up construction at a reasonable cost, et cetera, et cetera. So those are some of the facts that would indicate it may be slowing, but it's still early to call that.", "Joshua Raskin", "Yes, I didn't know if you were seeing anything in your specific markets anecdotally more than the broad NIC data of just saying, okay, here are the markets, and then I didn't know if the $88 million of divestitures, maybe that was related to what you're seeing in certain markets, et cetera.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "The divestitures were really with one of our customers, their underperforming assets. So we were able to sell those at a fixed yield and increase their cash flow and improve our portfolio. So, everybody was happy. So that was something that was a unique sort of solution that worked for both companies.", "Joshua Raskin", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Todd Stender", "Thanks for hanging in there.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Likewise, for everybody.", "Todd Stender", "Is Todd Lillibridge there? MOB question for him.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "He is.", "Todd Stender", "All right. Same-store NOI growth in MOB has picked up a little bit in Q4, got you over 2%. But your outlook for this year would only top out at 2%. I just want to see if you can go through some of the drivers behind your growth expectations. That's part one. And part two is, maybe just touch on the stuff you sold in Q4.", "Todd W. Lillibridge ", "As Bob mentioned, we were within our guidance this past year at 1.3%, at the midpoint roughly, and as we have said, 2017 guidance again really at that 1% to 2% range. And you are correct, we did finish the Q4 on a year-over-year basis at 2%. Our leasing and therefore occupancy was up in Q4 where we got to 92%. So we see a steady year. But again, as Bob mentioned, we do have a bit of a peak in terms of overall renewal activity that we're going to be faced with here in 2017. So, we factored that all in, and again, we feel very comfortable with our guidance for 2017 between 1% and 2%.", "Todd Stender", "Great, thanks. And then how about what you sold in Q4, any characteristics we can point to where there's single tenant or smaller buildings?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Non-strategic assets that we thought we got a really good price for and that were more valuable to the tenant user than they were to us. So, good transaction there.", "Todd Stender", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Tayo Okusanya", "It's just a quick one. Just kind of given some of this recent news around Brookdale, I just wanted to, could you just talk a little bit again about if Brookdale does kind of end up in play, what rights do you have as a landlord for the company?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Good. Okay, so Brookdale as you know is an important customer of Ventas and they are an important industry participant with 80,000 employees and 100,000 seniors that they care for every day. We have a good relationship with them. We have excellent agreements between the companies. And we continue to try to work with Brookdale, as we do with all of our customers, to continue to enhance and improve our mutual businesses.", "Tayo Okusanya", "But I guess specifically, do you have to approve a transaction or like how exactly will that look if the entire company is being sold?", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Tayo, how long have you known us?", "Tayo Okusanya", "I'm just trying to get an answer there.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "All kidding aside, I mean we care deeply about the success of Brookdale and we will continue to try to work with them as we have with our small disposition deal that we have in the market and as we have with our other customers to try to continue making them a success.", "Tayo Okusanya", "All right, I had to give it a try.", "Debra A. Cafaro", "Thank you. With that, I think we're going to close the call. We're going to thank everyone for their patience and we really appreciate your tuning in to hear us talk about our great year and what we hope to accomplish in 2017 on your behalf. So we look forward to seeing you and thank you again for your interest and attention.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

(NYSE:VTR) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call April 28, 2017 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Ryan Shannon - IR", "Debra Cafaro - Chairman & CEO", "Bob Probst - CFO", "Analysts", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America", "Nick Ullico - UBS", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank", "Chad Vanacore - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities", "John Kim - BMO Capital Markets", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ventas First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Shannon, Investor Relations. Mr. Shannon, you may begin.", "Ryan Shannon", "Thanks, Taika. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the Company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.", "As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the Company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Ryan. And good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas first quarter 2017 earnings call.", "I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas college as we review our positive results, discuss our fast start to the year executing on our strategic priorities and confirm our outlook for 2017.", "The Ventas advantage of superior properties, platforms and people has enabled us to deliver consistent growth in income and outstanding performance through multiple cycles for almost two decades. The first quarter continued our pattern of resiliency and performance as we delivered a $1.03 per share in normalized FFO, driven principally by excellent property NOI growth from our high quality diverse portfolio.", "Our year is also off to a great start in other key areas. As the premier capital provider to leading senior living and healthcare companies and university-based research institutions, we have been exceedingly active and productive during the two months since we last spoke with you. It has always been a hallmark of Ventas that we do what we say.", "So, I'd like to highlight a few of our significant year-to-date achievements that show how much we've accomplished towards the strategic priorities we established for the year. We've enhanced our balance sheet by increasing our liquidity through revolver capacity growth to $3 billion and an $800 million bond deal, we've linked into our debt maturities and substantially increased our liquidity. Liquidity will enable us to take advantage of opportunities and preserve value for stakeholders.", "We've already accomplished our investment guidance of completing over $1 billion of investments in high quality assets that provide superior risk-adjusted returns and build out our leading platforms. And our $700 million skilled nursing or SNF sale remains on track. Completion of the SNF disposition will further differentiate our excellent portfolio mix, provide proceeds to repay debt and generate a material profit.", "As you can see, we are allocating and recycling capital prudently as we use the proceeds of our late 2016 and early 2017 dispositions also completed at a significant gain to invest in new, high quality medical, life science and innovation projects, such as the South Street lending project associated with Brown University. South Street Lending is a 100% preleased, contain state-of-the-art medical teaching labs and simulation facilities and we expect it to be fully open later this year.", "We also continue to expand our investments into our future growth and a higher quality asset base through selective development and redevelopment. For example, we've committed to or begun significant expansions of our University based life science pipeline with projects affiliated with University of Pennsylvania and Washington University and we expect to fund an Atria ground-up senior housing development in the Greater Philadelphia MSA.", "Those investments also represent significant progress towards our goal of building out our best-in-class platforms. Already, we've expanded the Wexford business by 25% since we acquired it last year.", "We are also building out the Ardent platform but expanding Ardent's acquisition of LHP, transforming Ardent into a leading care provider, generating $3 billion in annual revenues and operating in six states. Ardent continues to perform very well. The acquired assets and enterprise have significant market share, strong margins, excellent payer mix, material synergy opportunities and outstanding relationships with not-for-profit and academic medical centers. The deal is excellent fit for Ardent's business and early integration efforts are going well.", "We've also expanded our relationships with an existing senior living customer, investing on this $200 million into triple net leased senior housing assets and we've engaged in mutually beneficial sale of asset transactions with other customers.", "As we continue to focus on driving cash flow and enterprise efficiency and effectiveness, we grew cash flow from operations this quarter by 21% and same property NOI by 3.9%. So, we have put some great numbers up on the board already this year. Our terrific team at Venta\u2019s is energized by the momentum we have to accomplish even more as we look to the balance of the year.", "As a result of the continues progress we've made, Venta has created an industry-leading differentiated portfolio, highly diversified by asset type, business model and tenants. Among other things, our owned portfolio generates 93% of its revenue from private pay sources.", "Our shop portfolio represents approximately 29% of our net operating income. Our attractive life science and medical office building segment generates about 25% of our NOI. Our triple-net leases representing 41% of our NOI have virtually no lease explorations through the end of 2018. None of our tenants represents more than 10% of our NOI and we expect to generate only 1% of our NOI from skilled nursing assets by year end.", "As we look at the macro environment, we continue to see volatility and uncertainty in the markets, in public policy and in the geopolitical sphere. The U.S. and other Western democracies continue to grow albeit slowly as today\u2019s GDP print shows. Although employment and inflation indicators have continued to trend positively.", "While the new administration is attempting to jumpstart the U.S. growth trajectory with its policies, it is unclear yet whether its proposals on taxes, regulations, trade or healthcare will do so, or whether there is sufficient support in Congress to pass the administration's agenda.", "In this environment, we continue to believe its most important for Ventas to remain financially strong and liquid, maintain diversification and balance in our portfolio, drive cash flow and efficiency in our enterprise, allocate capital wisely, continue to elevate the already outstanding quality of our portfolio, make selective investments in our future growth and keep our team together and focused on creating value for customers and shareholders.", "Before I turn the call over to Bob, there is one final point I\u2019d like to highlight. Our diverse high-quality portfolio has never been more valuable than it is today. As equity capital flows and inquiries continue to accelerate across of our asset classes. These capital sources range from public firms, private equity, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and other domestic and international players.", "This surface of equity capital is attracted by the resilience, demographics, demand profile and risk adjusted returns in our business. So, we remain excited and optimistic that the Ventas business is situated at this dynamic and increasingly valuable intersection of healthcare and real estate. I am confident that we have the right portfolio mix, strategies and tenure team to capitalize on our premier position and enjoy an enduring advantage in value creation.", "With that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst.", "Bob Probst", "Thank you, Debbie. I am pleased to report another strong quarter of cash flow performance from our high-quality portfolio of healthcare, senior housing and life science and innovation properties. Our overall portfolio had an excellent start to the year, with same store cash NOI growth of 3.9% in the first quarter. ", "Let me detail our first quarter segment performance before moving to overall financial results and our reaffirmed 2017 guidance, starting with our triple-net business, which accounts for 41% of our NOI. Our triple-net portfolio with same-store cash NOI by an outstanding 4.7% for the first quarter of 2017, driven principally by strong in-place lease escalations and rent reallocated to more productive assets from the Kindred lease modification agreement in Q2 of 2016.", "I would highlight that the benefit of the rent reallocation cycles out of beginning of the second quarter of this year. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net lease portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the overall information was consistent with the prior quarter at 1.7 times.", "Rent coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained at 1.3 times, incorporating escalator growth for the drilling twelve months that exceeded 3%, while coverage remains stable, operator cash flows have recently been compressed by occupancy declines and labor expense growth.", "Nonetheless, our senior housing coverage benefits from operator, market and acuity level diversification as well as strong lease protections for Ventas. It is also important to note that triple-net senior housing portfolio overall has lower levels of construction as a percentage of inventory than the net industry averages.", "Within our post-acute portfolio, SNF cash flow coverage held at 1.7 times, despite continued operating pressure in the SNF segment. After completion of the expected Kindred SNF sale in the second half of 2017, SNF sale only represent 1% of Ventas' NOI and we\u2019ll enjoy very strong rent coverage.", "Our final coverage in the fourth quarter declined by 10 basis points to 1.8 times. This change was in line with our expectations as rent escalated and Kindred completed its first full quarter under the new LTAC patient criteria.", "We are encouraged by Kindred's Q4 same-store volume and revenue growth amidst the revised criteria. As a reminder, Kindred expects the impact of this transition will peck in first half of 2017 after which the net mitigated impact of criteria should begin to ease.", "Finally, Ardent continued to drive outstanding performance through the first quarter of 2017 and stands out as a leading hospital platform, delivering sustained positive momentum and same-store adjusted admissions, revenue and EBITDA.", "Rent coverage of the assets was strong at three times in Q4. Fourth quarter 2016 results for Ardent compare favorably even with very best publicly treated hospital systems in the U.S. and early stages of the LHP integration are on track.", "With regard to Medicare reimbursement, CMS issued proposed rules for fiscal year 2018 in-patient hospitals, LTAC, IRF and SNFs. The in-patient hospital proposal included a net 2.9 payment increase, which was ahead of expectations. While the LTAC proposed rule was in line with expectations. The IRF and SNF proposed rules included a 1% payment increase. These proposals are subject to a common period before final rules are issued later this year.", "For 2017, we continue to expect our triple-net same-store cash NOI overall will grow in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% driven by in-place lease escalations.", "Moving on to our senior housing operating portfolio. We had a positive start to the year in our SHOP business. Same-store cash NOI in the quarter grew 2.9% in line with our expectations. Unpacking the first quarter results further, same-store revenue increased nearly 2% driven by solid rate growth partially offset by lower occupancy.", "As expected, first quarter occupancy was pressured by typical seasonal patterns together with cumulative new unites coming online in a more significant flu seasons. A further note on the flu. This season was more severe and occurred later in the quarter in 2016. The flu impacts both move-outs and move-ins as communities are close to tours and new sales as a result of flu quarantine.", "Encouragingly, RevPAR increased by more than 4% overall when adjusted for one last day in the first quarter versus the 2016 leap year. This rate growth was driven by accelerated in-place phase rate increases and our high barrier to entry coastal markets as well as through increased pricing of care.", "Operating expenses in the quarter rose approximately 2% in line with revenue. Ongoing wage pressure in the 4% range was mitigated by effectively flexing labor versus occupancy while controlling nonlabor-related costs, a benefit of our senior housing scale with leading operators and efficient operating platforms. The results also benefited from reduced Sunrise management fees and performance incentives in the quarter.", "Turning to market level performance, we were pleased to see the momentum continue in our high barrier markets including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. These communities Q1 same-store NOI by mid-single-digits on very strong rate growth exceeding 5%. Canada also posted very strong performance, increasing NOI by nearly 7% in the first quarter.", "Elevated levels of new building openings in markets including Atlanta, Denver and Chicago continued in the first quarter, our NOI exposure in markets with a new supply surplus continues to represent 30% of our SHOP portfolio or less than 10% of Ventas' overall NOI.", "Our same-store NOI performance in these communities declined by mid-single digits as a result of the cumulative impact of new deliveries. Nonetheless, our portfolio in high barrier markets powered same-store NOI growth overall.", "New construction as a percentage of inventory within our trade areas when prior periods are revised for the NIC data improved by 10 basis points to 5.5%. At the same time, as is typical in the NIC data, delivery scheduled for Q1 were pushed to future quarters. We continue to actively manage our SHOP asset portfolio, transitioning assets to new operators and business models and renegotiating management agreements about a few of the clots in our bag we have recently used to maximize value.", "In terms of our full-year outlook we continue to have confidence in our SHOP portfolio same-store NOI guidance range of 0% to 2%. The implied modest NOI growth at the guidance midpoint for the balance of the year is driven by the wider occupancy gap entering the second quarter and anticipated new supply coming online through the balance of 2017.", "Despite near-term challenges, we remain encouraged by the resiliency of our high-quality senior housing operating portfolio, operated by the nation's leading care providers. The strength in our core markets reflects the continued long-term opportunity in senior housing.", "Let's round out the portfolio review with our office reporting segment, which is comprised of our University-based life science and innovation portfolio and our high-quality medical office business. Together the office portfolio accounts for approximately a quarter of our NOI. Our life science operating portfolio continued to perform well through the first quarter and is in line with underwriting.", "Sequentially, occupancy increased by 250 basis points to an outstanding 97%, driven by our attractive Wake Forest School of Medicine property that is 100% leased to Wake Forest University. Progress in capitalizing on the growth opportunity in this business has already exceeded our high expectations with more than $350 million in follow-on investments since acquisition in 2016. We now have four development projects underway totaling over 900,000 square feet and a rich pipeline of opportunity is still ahead.", "In our medical office business, same-store cash NOI in the first quarter increased by 3.7%. First quarter results were driven by in-place lease escalations and the benefit of lease termination fees. Adjusted for these fees the MLB business grew same-store cash NOI by 1.5% in line with expectations. The first quarter exhibit strong tenant retention exceeding 80%.", "As we noted in February, our lease rollovers this year are higher than normal levels and the team is actively working to maintain occupancy levels. In summary, our full-year outlook continues to forecast cash NOI growth of 1% to 2% for our same-store medical office assets.", "Turning to our overall company financial results and our outlook for the year. We delivered a strong start to the year with solid financial results, excellent capital allocation and an even stronger liquidity profile. Income from continuing operations per share for the first quarter 2017 grew 22% to $0.44 compared to the first quarter of 2016. First quarter normalized FFO totaled $1.03 per fully diluted share, a modest decline versus prior-year.", "First quarter results were driven principally by strong property performance offset by the impact of 2016 dispositions and a higher share count. We closed on over $1 billion in attractive new investments in the first quarter, including the expansion of our acute-care hospital platform through a $700 million loan investment to scale Ardent to the second largest for-profit private hospital system in the U.S.", "We also invested $130 million in high quality University-based life science buildings, which added an exciting new affiliation with Brown University. We're also on track with our continued portfolio optimization and capital recycling efforts. In the first quarter, Ventas principally sold senior housing properties and also received final repayment on loans receivable for proceeds of approximately $100 million with gains exceeding $40 million.", "Our efficient and effective operating model was on display in the quarter. Cash flow from operations increased by 21%, driven by cash earnings and we absorbed the life science acquisition without material incremental G&A cost of the company. We also moved as planned to a forward-looking long-term equity incentive plan as a result of investor feedback, with a modest non-cash transition cost excluded from FFO in the quarter and expected for the year.", "We made great strides in enhancing our liquidity and maturity profile. We raised $800 million of five and 10-year senior notes to extend our maturity profile debt. We also closed this week on a new revolving credit facility, increasing our immediately available borrowing capacity from $2 billion to $3 billion, extending our maturities through 2021 and improving our pricing and terms.", "Our long-term track record of growing cash flows on a strong balance sheet resulted in an impressive oversubscription from our banking partners and we sincerely appreciate our lender's strong support of the company. Our credit metrics in Q1 include best-in-class fixed charge coverage of 4.6 times debt-to-gross assets of 40% and secured debt to total indebtedness holding steady at 6%.", "Net debt to adjusted EBITDA rose modestly to 5.9 times, a temporary increase, which we expect will reverse when the disposition proceeds in our guidance are received in the second half of the year.", "Let me close out the prepared remarks with our reaffirmed full-year 2017 guidance for the company including the following. Income from continuing operations is expected to range from $1.72 to $1.78 per fully diluted share. Normalized FFO per share is forecast to range from $4.12 to $4.18. Total portfolio same-store cash NOI is anticipated to grow 1.5% to 2.5% while segment level growth expectations also remain unchanged.", "Our guidance continues to assume that our capital recycling program will generate approximately $900 million in disposition proceeds of which $100 million has been closed to date. The outlook includes $700 million in proceeds at a gain exceeding $650 million through the expected sale of 36 skilled nursing facilities in the back half of the year.", "Investments included in guidance consist principally of the $1 billion of investments completed year to date. In addition, our total development and redevelopment funding is expected to approximate $350 million for the year, demonstrating the progress in allocating capital to these high return projects and scaling our life science and innovation business.", "Consistent with previous practice, we do not include any further material investments, dispositions or capital activity in our outlook. We assume approximately $358 million weighted average shares for the full year of 2017. We do not assume any new equity issuance in our guidance.", "To close we are pleased and excited by the strong start of the year and committed to continued excellent execution of our strategy and our priorities.", "With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Smedes Rose from Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Michael Bilerman", "Hey. Good morning, it's Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. Debbie, I want to pick up on your final comment where you talked about inquiry from equity capital sources and also the fact that they\u2019re interested in your space. Can you talk about how those discussions are going about whether you want to use that to liquefy some of your holdings or are you looking at this as co-invest for new investments?", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks Michael. Good morning and good morning Smedes. So, what I think is really important as I highlighted are these the incredible interest in the space from existing players, new entrants of all types and there are good reasons for that interest.", "So, the way we look at it is that every environment is going to give us an opportunity to create value and we view that interest as one more tool in our toolkit that could be used either to team up for growth and/or could be used to recycle capital or both. And it will depend on the individual situations and opportunities, but it\u2019s a very positive development.", "Michael Bilerman", "I guess you close to doing anything either selling existing assets or using those capital partners to grow and advise how at the forefront this is for you?", "Debra Cafaro", "I would say it is a very knowledgeable, but nothing eminent.", "Michael Bilerman", "All right. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Michael Carroll", "Yes thanks. Debbie can you give us a little bit more color on the Kindred SNF sales and what type of hurdles that are left to clear for both you and Kindred in order to complete those sales?", "Debra Cafaro", "Sure. Good morning. Let me recap the transaction for you and this is a very mutually beneficial transaction for Ventas and Kindred and the two companies work very well together to enable Kindred to achieve its strategic objective of exiting the SNF business.", "So, the way it works from our side is Kindred will either purchase from us in connection with third party sales or otherwise, 36 SNFs for $700 million or as an alternative if that does not occur, they would renew those 36 SNFs out through 2025.", "At the present time, we expect Kindred to we believe transaction is on track to sell those assets as Kindred has stated publicly and that\u2019s our current expectation, but either way, we\u2019re in a good position as we look forward on those 36 SNFs.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And then I guess last question, looking at your LTAC coverage ratios, and correct me if I'm wrong, I believe that you previously indicated that coverage could drop 30 basis points with the patient criteria rolling out. So, is it safe to assume that coverage should stabilize at this level and maybe improve over time?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well as Bob pointed out, the LTAC just started going through their patient criteria and the trough of that we expect to see really through mid-2017 and then would presumably start to improve through the back half and into '18 and remember we report on the trailing 12 basis.", "So, we\u2019ll be well into '18 I think before you see the impact of the coverage improvement of those sequential quarters should expect to see an improvement in the net mitigated impact of criteria towards the back half of '17, subject of course to seasonality as we see in that business.", "Michael Carroll ", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hi good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Juan Sanabria", "Just a question on following up on the Kindred question, do you see any risk from I guess the lower than expected CMS initial rate increases as for their first set of guidance on that rate increases for 2018 and the changes in the reimbursement for the higher therapy, do you see that as a risk at all for the dispositions?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I see we\u2019re up late last night reading the CMS website. So, good for you. As you correctly point out, the market basket came out for fiscal year 2018 for the SNF last.", "It\u2019s a 1% increase, which is in line with what we expected from several years ago that was what was cancelled in a couple years ago. In terms of proposed rule to change some of the reimbursement for 2019, which is what I think you're talking about, I would say that this has been on our radar screen for quite a long time as we looked at the higher therapy utilization and so this is at some point an expected change from us.", "I think the important point is that it is intended to be revenue neutral. There is a long way from here to a final rule and I think it's really just something that for us will be not overly relevant as SNFs will be 1% of our business.", "But I do see that this is where CMS and OIG and the other regulatory authorities have targeted which is to adjust that and shift the way they pay the SNFs away from some of the ultra-high therapy categories and really into the nursing and Tier component of the business.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thank you. And then the second question on the RIDEA business, solid start to the year particularly on the expense controls as flagged but what should we think of in terms of occupancy and especially expense control for the balance of the year and your ability to recapture lost occupancy from the flu?", "Bob Probst", "Juan its Bob here. And I agree a positive start to the year, 2.9% quite happy with that. And within that in particular the rate growth we see on an adjusted basis for the day year-over-year over four that was really important sign for us for the quarter and for the year. So that\u2019s really encouraging.", "The occupancy change certainly impacted by the flu and new supply coming online, in line with what we had told you back in February, I think I mentioned we were probably the 200 basis points down range. I think that\u2019s probably a good place to pencil in for the balance of the year. We are starting from a lower point as we enter in the second quarter. We will follow seasonal patterns obviously, but we expect there is still to be a gap and that\u2019s principally with new construction coming online.", "The important thing you highlight to is not only prices, its expenses. Nice to see expenses in line with revenue and driven in part by controlling your cost, flexing labor versus occupancy to make sure you protect your margin and we saw that in the first quarter. So that\u2019s an important part of the balance of the year.", "Juan Sanabria", "So, you expect that to continue that lower expense growth.", "Bob Probst", "Well you have the wage pressure we've talked at length outlines about that continues to be part of the equation for sure. We've said 4% to 5% for the year, we saw about 4% in the quarter. So, it's really our job to make sure we are mitigating that\u2019s to these other means flexing labor, driving the indirect costs to hold that in line with revenue. So that\u2019s the job to be done. ", "Juan Sanabria", "Thank you. ", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Ullico with UBS. Your line is open.", "Nick Ullico", "Thanks, hi everyone. Turning back to the same-store expense question, Bob the 1.9% in quarter, if I look here that was the lowest level you've had since the end of 2014 and you've been running 3%, 4% since then.", "So, I was hoping you could unpack this a little more and explain, I know you talked about flexing labor, but it's still a little bit hard to understand how the expense growth could have been so low in the quarter?", "Bob Probst", "Well, thanks for asking, I think an important thing to highlight in this extra day last year versus this year. That clearly has an impact both on expenses and on revenue. Depending on how you bill, there is a revenue in fact in some cases for us, we have operators that bill by the day.", "And when I talked about the RevPAR adjusted about 4% it's recognizing that fact, but obviously for expenses that has an impact across the portfolio. And so that is one of the items you need to lay as you look at 1.9% year-on-year, or even sequentially, you have to factor in the day's impacts. So, there is an unusual item there I would highlight.", "Nick Ullico", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then one clean-up accounting question here, you had $2 million of merger deal cost on your income statement, I thought acquisition cost are generally not being expensed any more, can you just explain what are that related to?", "Bob Probst", "Good catch. We'll continue to have you'll see in our full year outlook money in that line item. Things like net deal costs will run through there. So not every deal happens. Clearly, because of the new roles you\u2019ll see some capitalize will successful deals, but what you basically see running through there are run rate costs on deal that don\u2019t happened.", "Nick Ullico", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just last question Debbie, for you on medical office, from talking to brokers, it sounds like cap rates have come down sort of around 5% for some of the highest quality medical office product year-to-date. So, I\u2019m wondering whether you can still expand your MOB business through acquisitions giving where pricing is today? Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks Nick. I would say that we're very happy to have a large and attractive medical office building business and believe we created a lot of value in terms of that time that we acquired the business and how we scaled at probably seven times since we got together with Todd and his team back in 2010.", "And I am excited about the continuing compression in cap rate that ties exactly to what I was talking in terms of the institutional interest in our asset classes MOBs being a prominent one and people really, really love the assets. They're core-like qualities with still exactly about core return and that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about where the valuation is.", "Nick Ullico", "Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Yes, good morning, everyone. Just a couple for me. First of all, cograts on the quarter. I thought things look pretty good.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Tayo Okusanya", "The line of credit and the expansion on it, is that, are you guys signaling your expecting to be more involved in transaction going forward like is that expansion signaling anything to us?", "Debra Cafaro", "It is a direct result of what we outlined as our strategic priorities. I think that in this environment that we have, we believe that liquidity in an important competitive advantage, and as I said it is offensive and defensive. It enables you to take advantage of opportunities through financial strengths and it also protect shareholder's capital and those are both core values obviously.", "And so, we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet, but we are always active on acquisitions and having greater liquidity we think is our top strategic priority for the year and we\u2019ve already done a great job expanding the revolver by 50% or $1 billion, so we\u2019re very happy with that.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Then secondly, going back to the proposed changes to the SNF case mix, and again understanding that you guys elaborate a little SNF exposure going forward, but you take a look this\u2026", "Debra Cafaro", "Could you please say that again?", "Tayo Okusanya", "You have very little SNF exposure going forward.", "Debra Cafaro", "Anywhere I am sorry. Go ahead Tayo.", "Tayo Okusanya", "No worry that way you're coming from. I guess what I am trying to understand with that is that again the theory here is that although the overall dollars may not change, when you take look at the reallocation that CMS is proposing, it seems to have some real impact for SNFs that historically have been very heavy in regards to utilizing the high therapy rug categories.", "And that seems to be like a general complaint regulators have had again quite of few of the large public SNF operators. So, I guess my question is would you expect some all those large SNF operators, if this thing is going to go through to be heavily negatively impacted even though overall dollar still remain to be roughly the same.", "Debra Cafaro", "Great question. A couple things, one is as you mentioned, this has been on the radar screen. I think people have been reviewing, these ultra-high therapy utilization minutes as you point out and this is a consequence of that. And so very much a continuation of the trends that we have expected and seen in this business.", "I would tell you that there is an estimate and this would in fact for the public operators result in a modest diminution of EBITDAR, but the real issue is that the good operators in healthcare businesses are constantly working through these changes in reimbursement.", "Typically, they're telegraph very early on. There is a lot of industry comment and there is a transition period. And so, I think you have to look at potential behavioral changes, which the rules want to incentivize and generally you\u2019ll probably see less utilization of those therapies and those high categories, but the good operators will be able to hopefully manage through that in a relatively a neutral way.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. That's helpful. Then lastly on the LTAC side, please indulge me, I do understand that the increase of the 1% mandate increase, but based on other changes that they're making, CMS is actually forecasting overall LTAC payments come down about 3.75%. Again, when you kind of take a look at that and understand what Kindred is doing, what you generally expect the impact of that to be to the LTAC industry?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, and that's exactly what we factored into, what we were talking about before in terms of there is a very specific guidance provided by Kindred, who is the leading LTAC operator of what the mitigated and unmitigated impact is and what are share is expected to be as it effects coverage and the 2018 CMS rule is perfectly in line with our projections and Kindred\u2019s expectations.", "Kindred is mitigating the impact, again as we talk about how operators do this through taking more site neutral patients and that's becoming an important part of the business driving volume and then hopefully being able to contain cost. And so that is how Kindred has express visibility to mitigate the impact of those changes and again very well telegraphed and understood and it\u2019s up to Kindred then to execute its business plan within that context.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Vincent Chao", "Hey, good morning everyone.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Vincent Chao", "Just wanted to go back to the SHOP conversation, we talked about the occupancy staying at sort of the minus 200 basis point level year-over-year, just given the flu plus also the supply coming online. But I\u2019m just curious in terms of the revenue growth, which was very strong and the rent growth this quarter, with occupancy down and supply coming up, how much do you think rent across will be impacted going forward?", "Bob Probst", "Great question. Probably sound like a broken record here, but I do believe we have strong pricing power and senior housing both up and our approach as we thought about the base rent increases was looking where we had advantage positions, high barrier to entry markets with pricing power and pricing to reflect that.", "Not only in base rent but also in car provision and we did not see financial move out quote as a consequence of any material kind and that to me is really encouraging. Where we see -- clearly see pricing pressure is in the market where new supply is coming online and that's no surprise, that's as expected.", "And in that situation, we're a price taker and we need to make sure we're watching occupancy vis-\u00e0-vis price. And the good news for the portfolio overall and the high barrier to entry markets we compete in is that drives overall growth for the portfolio, but it\u2019s really a tale of two cities as you look at the different markets.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. And then on the 5.5% supply as a percentage of inventory in your markets, can you -- do you have a sense of what that might trend to? It sounds like it will get worse over the course of the year, but just curious if you have a sense of what that will translate by the end of the year?", "Bob Probst", "Yes, it has been trending consistently flat for our portfolio here for about three period in a row which we're encouraged by.", "Debra Cafaro", "And that's start, that's start.", "Bob Probst", "Percentage of inventory when restated as Nick does, we do now and to be able to see what is the like-for-like period to period and on that basis, we improve modestly in this period. So that's encouraging. I also noted at the same time and this is not unusual more of that construction rolling forward and being pushed in future quarters in terms of what to expected to start.", "And that is the dynamic we've seen and continue to see that file wave a bit moving forward. So, we'll see where it goes, but three periods in a row now of being flattish is encouraging to us.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Thanks, and one just maybe cleanup questions and in the commentary on the MOB seems to annoy growth for the quarter the lease termination fees were noted as a positive variance. Do you have a dollar value of that lease termination fee?", "Bob Probst", "It's slightly over $2 million, so when adjusting for that you come back to 1.5% growth on a more underlying basis pretty much in line with our 1% to 2% guidance.", "Vincent Chao", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. our next question comes from Chad Vanacore with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Your line is open.", "Chad Vanacore", "Hey. Good morning, all.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. So just thinking about same-store shop occupancy, which was down significantly 150 basis point that's more than NIC MAP Data would suggest but Bob you had mentioned last quarter you expected somewhere around 200 basis point. So, does that imply further declines in second quarter and then you assume any occupancy recovery late in the year in your budget?", "Bob Probst", "Yes, I think we certainly foresaw some of the impact here on the flu when we had the February call and that clearly is an unusual item as you look at the quarter and the sequential impact, there is always a softening in the first quarter sequentially, but that was exacerbated I think by the flu no doubt.", "That 200-basis point range is really for the full year and reflects the range we've given of guidance overall. So, we're starting from a lower point. There is new supply coming online through the balance of the year and therefore that 200 basis point is part of the range of expectation going forward.", "Now I hope we can do better. I hope we have 160 now down. I hope we can tie in that gap and again that's what the operators are very focused on, but the range reflects that that gap being either consistent or slightly wider based on new deliveries.", "Chad Vanacore", "And are those pressures more concentrated anywhere by geography?", "Bob Probst", "Sure, so the new construction will not be surprised as you look at the NIC data. Markets like Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit, Chicago, that's where the pressure is and that's the 30% we talk about within our SHOP portfolio where the pressures are, but again the New York's and LAs and San Fran's powering along and very strong.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. Yeah, great and just one more, 1Q CapEx was under the average for the year, when do you expect that to ramp up and guidance implies an increase about $10 million a quarter through the balance of the year?", "Bob Probst", "Right. So, we're about $25 million in the first quarter. Our guidance is the 130 range, so clearly a ramp on the balance of the year. Very typical to see in the back half in particular that's been to ramp.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. And then just split up the CapEx spend between MOB and SHOP.", "Bob Probst", "Core fed CapEx give me a minute, we'll get back to you with that number.", "Debra Cafaro", "We have to move along. We have a few more callers that we would like to take questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.", "Rich Anderson", "Thanks. So much pressure. So, with every new day it seems new message from the administration as it relates to the U.S. healthcare. I'm curious to what degree that's affecting your investment strategy in the hospital business specifically. I know you know quality, growth and all that I get that, but there has to have been some change when you consider all these inputs and outputs from the Trump administration, is that true?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I would say that you're right that one day it's terminating faster and the next day it's not and the next day it is again and so there is a little bit of policy whiplash going on across all businesses certainly including ours. And we have always said that we believe the hospital business is a huge secular opportunity for us as the leading capital provider and that we would do business with high quality assets and high-quality providers and I think we've done that.", "Right now, our focus is on the integration of LHP and Ardent, which we said is going well and we're continuing to do work, but obviously we'll be very, very selective in allocating capital while there is a wide range of possible outcomes.", "I would say that most of our hospital customers and relationships in parts business are full speed ahead with all of the things that they have been focused on for many years, which are unrelated to repeal and replace and its value-based care, it's cost containment, it's quality, its expansion of market share etcetera.", "And so, to summarize we continue to believe it's a great opportunity for us long-term. We have been selective and we'll continue to be selective and we think that right now, we're cautious but continuing to work in the business.", "Rich Anderson", "Right and then in 2009, circa 2009 you were given credit for hunkering down protecting the balance sheet and not necessarily being overly aggressive from an investment standpoint. You just we're always active on acquisitions, but do you see yourself in more of a hunker-down mode? Do you -- if there was a zero-acquisition year, would that be a bad thing for Ventas?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well thank you for the watch out memory lane there. We did get an A-plus for reading the market right and protecting the firm, which enabled us then to come out of the financial crisis early, faster, stronger and then go back into growth mode.", "I think we are always reading the external environment. We are nimble. I think we've been able to find ways in different environment to create value and certainly, the liquidity is an area of focus from a opportunistic and a risk management standpoint.", "We've already closed a $1 billion in attractive investments and we have really over the last 18 months I would say shifted our capital allocation efforts really into this selective hospitals, customer related deals and the high-quality investments in future growth with the development, redevelopment pipeline and that's what we foresaw and I think we're in exactly the spot where we wanted to be on those things coupled with really smart dispositions.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. Fair enough. I'll let you to get the next questions. thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Rich.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "John Kim", "Thanks. Good morning. Debbie, on the capital sources that you mentioned are looking to invest in the market. Do you expect there are going to be price leaders in any particular asset class and drive values up?", "Debra Cafaro", "I don't understand -- could you repeat the question I'm sorry?", "John Kim", "How competitive do you think there will be on pricing versus REITs?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think that there is a strong bid as I pointed out in our asset makes our asset extremely valuable. I think this has been going on again for a while and it continues without abating and it's in fact accelerating. So that makes our assets more valuable and it requires us as we have done to shift our focus on capital allocation to where we see the best risk adjusted returns.", "And that has been in you can see this funding of the Ardent expansion where we're getting almost an 9% return, good risk adjusted returns, scaling the platform. We're investing in these higher yielding, yet high quality and future growth development, redevelopment opportunities and we\u2019re doing smart dispositions among other things.", "So, there are always ways we like it that our assets are more valuable but there are always ways given our position in the market, given our diversified portfolio, given our relationships and platforms where we can invest attractively and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.", "John Kim", "And then that deal cost that you record in the first quarter was that related to Brazil?", "Debra Cafaro", "No, it was not.", "John Kim", "Okay. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.", "Michael Knott", "Hey guys, saving the best for last I see.", "Debra Cafaro", "Absolutely go for it.", "Michael Knott", "A question for you, on the SHOP portfolio, still trying to understand, it seems like you had said it\u2019s encouraging to you, it seems like it was just outright better than you expected in terms of occupancy and on the expense side, but I guess should we infer that is really just a timing issue that the flu has bled into 2Q in terms of occupancy.", "So just trying to better understand that and then also if you can cut it through between U.S. and Canada and then the better markets versus the worst markets where you talked about last quarter the bifurcation in terms of those two types of markets?", "Debra Cafaro", "It was a good quarter.", "Bob Probst", "Yeah absolutely, we were very pleased with it and let me talk about the markets a bit, thanks for asking. The Canada result continues to be really strong. 7% in the quarter, we saw similar growth last year. Occupancy is pushing 95% and we see real opportunity for further pricing there and we have a wonderful portfolio in that country.", "So that\u2019s really powering and helping the business and similarly, I keep talking about the engine room markets in the U.S., New York, LA, San Francisco, Boston. We continue to go from strength to strength in those markets and the pricing is really taking hold there and that\u2019s really positive.", "The other part of the portfolio continues to be the same markets and you know as well as I which ones those are and again, the competitive pressure we see there is on price. We see labor pressure there. So, all the same dynamics we expected are happening, but overall those strong markets are driving the business. So, we had a strong start. So, we\u2019re encouraged. ", "Michael Knott", "So that was better than expected across the Board or did Canada do better than you expected and the U.S. was kind of as expected?", "Bob Probst", "It was pretty consistent with expectation I would say.", "Debra Cafaro", "Great. So, with that Ryan, I think we\u2019ve completed all the questions and I just want to close by saying that we are delighted we were able to deliver strong results this quarter across the Board. We have a great high quality diverse and balanced portfolio, great financial strength and liquidity.", "We\u2019ve been expanding our leading platform, focusing on cash flow and cash flow growth and value creation and we have a great team here at Ventas that\u2019s working hard for you. So, with that I want to just say let\u2019s go pens and with all due difference to our friends in Washington and we look forward to seeing everyone soon.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Mr. Ryan Shannon, from Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Ryan Shannon", "Thanks, Terence. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. ", "The projections, predictions, and statements are based on management's current beliefs, as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and contingencies, and stockholders and others should recognize that actual results may differ materially from the company's expectations, whether expressed or implied.", "We refer you to the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the company's other reports filed periodically with the SEC, for a discussion of these forward-looking statements and other factors that could affect these forward-looking statements.", "Many of these factors are beyond the control of the company and its management. The information being provided today is as of this date only and Ventas expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations.", "Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure referenced on this conference call and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.", "I will now turn the call over to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Ryan. And good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas second quarter earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues. We\u2019ve continued our momentum this quarter by delivering really good results, growing cash flows, and executing on our strategic objectives.", "I\u2019ll touch on performance briefly, and focus on our continued capital allocation strategy, our leading operators, our formula for value creation, macro trends, and our great people. Following Bob\u2019s review of our financial results, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. ", "The second quarter continued our pattern of strength as we delivered growth and our normalized FFO to $1.6 per share, driven principally by property and NOI growth from our high quality diverse portfolio and excellent investments. We are delighted to reaffirm our full-year guidance of $4.12 to $4.18 per share, compared to $4.13 in 2016. This expected growth in normalized FFO per share at the midpoint of our range is notable because we are simultaneously completing $1 billion of dispositions to improve our portfolio, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, and we are investing in future growth through selective development and redevelopment.", "As an enterprise Ventas is and always has been focused on delivering consistent reliable cash flow and dividends from a high quality diverse portfolio on a strong balance sheet. And we are proud that we are continuing to do exactly that. After a terrific start to the year, we continue to make significant progress on our capital allocation priorities. Here are some examples.", "To invest in our future growth, we committed to four Class A senior housing developments or major redevelopments in terrific locations with our leading operating partners Atria and Sunrise. These are mutually beneficial arrangements with long-standing operating partners and in the case of Sunrise, the development flow directly from the revised agreements we reached with Sunrise last year.", "We also allocated capital to help other customers grow during the quarter, including a modest expansion of our senior housing footprint in the U.K. A major piece of our capital allocation strategy, which of course includes decisions about where to grow and where to shrink, has been to reduce our investment and skilled nursing facilities or SNF and Medicaid programs. ", "Here too, we have made demonstrable progress. Kindred recently announced they had signed a deal to exit its entire skilled nursing business. As part of that transaction, we expect to sell our 36 SNF for $700 million, at a very attractive 7% cap rate on cash rents. With the sale, SNF will represent only 1% of our NOI, and our private pay revenues as an enterprise will rise to 94%.", "Our top capital allocation priority for reasons described more fully in a moment is expansion of our institutional university-based life science business, which now accounts for 6% of our NOI. In Q2 alone, we have opened two brand new assets, South Street lending and Chesterfield, where we expect Brown University and Duke University respectively to take occupancy by year-end.", "And we\u2019ve broken ground on two new ground-up developments; one in new city adjacent to Penn Medical in Philadelphia and another affiliated with WashU in Saint Louis. Our pipeline of additional development and acquisition opportunities remains robust as our leading platform Wexford continues to use its sterling reputation and experience to assist top tier universities in developing attractive research, medical, and technology hubs. ", "Turning to my second topic, our leading platforms, we are pleased to highlight that Ardent Healthcare Services continues to outperform and deliver excellent results through the second quarter. With its successful integration of its strategic acquisition of LHP, with its outstanding and experienced management team, and the pipeline of acquisition opportunities, Ardent has validated our $2 billion plus vote of confidence in the company.", "Ardent now generates $3 billion in annual revenues, employs 18,000 individual, and serves patients in six states. We\u2019re also proud to say that seven Ardent hospitals were recently named by modern healthcare in its prestigious 150 best places to work with, wonderful recognition for Ardent\u2019s team, especially when you consider that Ardent operates 20 hospitals within a Universe of over 5,000 hospitals nationwide.", "We continue to work with our partners Ardent and Sam Zell's EGI on further growth as we consider opportunities to acquire other high-quality healthcare assets and fold them into the scalable Ardent platform.", "Let\u2019s know turn our attention to Ventas\u2019 demonstrated formula for value creation. As I mentioned on our last call, our diverse high-quality assets have never been more valuable, and we continue to see all-time high pricing across asset types in the market. I\u2019d like to highlight two cases in point. Our medical office buildings and our Life Sciences assets that are at different stages of value creation.", "Our MOB business now generates nearly $400 million, and net operating income annually comprises 20 million square feet and represents 19% of our NOI. It is 95% on-campus or affiliated with 84% of our NOI derived from buildings with investment-grade tenants and HCA. Occupancy is a robust 92%. We allocated capital to our MOB business early in the valuation cycle. The 4 MOB\u2019s became one of the hottest asset classes, prized for its steady reliable cash flows, and increased utilization from baby boomers turning 65.", "Our unleveraged yield on our MOB portfolio is an incredible 7.5%, inclusive of all of our post acquisition CapEx. Given the recent benchmarks for MOB transactions in the mid-to-high 4s, our investment has created literally billions of dollars of value for our shareholders. We expect our University life science business to follow a similar pattern of investment and value creation. ", "In fact the recent mid-to-high 4s yield on MOB sales represents a great comp for these assets, given their significant similarity. Like MOB, like science assets are fueled by an ageing population dealing with illness and chronic condition. The buildings are anchored by highly rated large institutions and those institutions are the engines of economic growth in their communities and magnet for other tenants.", "Our university-based life science portfolio of 25 operating assets stacks up favorably from an analytic standpoint to recently traded MOB portfolios. Our 25 assets are better occupied at over 97%, newer with longer lease terms and a higher proportion of credit tenants. Yet in our university-based life science business we are still investing at 6% to 9% unlevered stabilized yield providing excellent risk adjusted returns.", "Our thesis is that this attractive portfolio should ultimately be valued at cap rates comparable to high-quality MOB's. That\u2019s why we are so excited about the opportunities and are committed to dedicated dedicating significant capital with Wexford to build out this attractive value creating business.", "Turning to the macro front political and policy uncertainty continues to weigh on healthcare, taxation, regulation and trade. Washington has been wildly unpredictable, although last night or I should say, this morning's - early-morning vote should restore some stability to the healthcare environment as the majority leader of the Senate concluded that it is \u201ctime to move on\" from the efforts to repeal some or all of the Affordable Care Act.", "Now the real estate community can buckle up for the tax reform rollercoaster ride as major changes to the tax code are proposed, many of which would have significant consequences for all public and private real estate companies. Yet the debt and equity capital markets remain remarkably favorable.", "Therefore our view is that we should in all events remain financially strong and liquid, maintain diversification and balance in our portfolio continue to drive cash flow and efficiency in our enterprise allocate capital wisely, staying nimble, and opportunistic, and continue to elevate the mix and quality of our portfolio. We want the Ventas team to work together to deliver superior long-term performance and reliable enterprise growth in income on a strong balance sheet to our holders.", "Before I turn the call over to Bob, I do want to touch on the extraordinary and cohesive Ventas team and the planned change we announced this morning. Todd Lillibridge will transition to a senior advisor role at the company in early 2018. We intend to commence a search for a new leader of the MOB business promptly and expect to complete the transition in the first quarter of 2018.", "Todd is committed to leading the Lillibridge MOB business until his successor joins us, when we expect him to undertake a variety of responsibilities and initiatives for the company. As you all know, Todd is a great partner. He also happens to be a visionary. He has founded his namesake firm over 25 years ago with the goal of providing comprehensive real estate solutions to high-quality health systems.", "Todd pioneered the idea of MOB's as a unique institutional real estate asset class. He created a strong enduring company, Lillibridge Healthcare Services that we were lucky to combine with in 2010. Since then, we have grown the MOB business together by an amazing seven times. ", "We look forward to continuing to work with Todd and his team to deliver strong MOB results and lead a smooth transition to a new MOB leader. Todd's commitment to our organization and his colleagues and clients is truly exemplary and gives you some insight into the special Ventas culture. That commitment extends throughout the Ventas team. We are aligned, consistent, and focused on the success of the company and our colleagues.", "Unquestionably the strong culture and our people create our winning competitive edge and underpin our long-term growth, reliability, and performance. In sum, I\u2019m confident that we have the right portfolio mix, relationships, strategies and team to capitalize on our exciting position at the dynamic intersection of healthcare and real estate for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.", "With that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst.", "Bob Probst", "Thank you, Debbie. In the second quarter, our overall portfolio of healthcare, senior housing, and office properties, grew same-store cash NOI by 1.5%. Let me detail our second quarter portfolio performance by segment before turning to overall financial results in 2017 guidance.", "I\u2019ll begin with our triple net business, which accounts for 39% of our NOI. The triple net portfolio grew same-store cash NOI by 2% for the second quarter of 2017, driven principally by strong in-place lease escalations. Adjusting for the impact of a roughly $3 million fee received in the prior year, same store triple net NOI growth in the second quarter 2017 was a strong 3.5%.", "Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple net lease portfolio for the first quarter of 2017, the latest available information was 1.6 times a sequential decline of 10 basis points from the fourth quarter. This change in overall coverage was driven principally by IRF and LTAC coverage, which declined as expected by 10 basis points sequentially to 1.7 times driven by rent increases and the continued impact of the LTAC reimbursement change.", "As noted in its first quarter earnings call, Kindred continues to execute on its patient criteria mitigations strategy, and expects the net mitigated impact of criteria should begin to improve in the second half of 2017. As updated by Kindred as Ventas in June, we continue to expect the attractive $700 million sale of our Kindred SNFs will be completed by year-end 2017. ", "Given the pending sale, we are now excluding those assets from our coverage and same-store supplemental reporting in current and prior periods. As a result of the sale SNF will represent just 1% of Ventas\u2019 NOI. In our triple net seniors housing portfolio, rent coverage remained at 1.3 times. Rent escalators for the trailing 12 months increased low single digits, outpacing asset level cash flows.", "Nonetheless, our triple net senior housing portfolio benefits from strong lease protections, operator and geographic diversification, as well as solid asset level cash flow coverage. Finally, Ardent\u2019s strong performance continued in the first half of 2017 with volume, revenue and EBITDA growth ranking among the top performance in the industry in the first quarter. ", "At the asset level for the Ventas properties, rent coverage remains strong and stable at three times in Q1. The LHP integration is proceeding very well, synergies are on track and the team is motivated and performing at a high level. For the total triple net same-store portfolio in the full-year 2017, we continue to expect cash NOI will grow in the range of 2.5% to 3.5%, driven by in-place lease escalations.", "Moving on to our senior housing operating portfolio, consistent with prior guidance assumptions, same-store cash NOI in the second quarter grew 0.4%. Unpacking the P&L further, second quarter same-store revenues increased nearly 2%, driven by attractive rate growth of over 4%. Rate growth was partially offset by 200 basis points of year-over-year occupancy decline.", "As discussed on our last call, the lower occupancy starting point entering Q2, due to a late and severe flu season together with the impact of new deliveries resulted in a widening of the occupancy gap in the quarter. Overall expenses were contained in the quarter increasing by 3%. Our operators continued to control non-labor costs and deflects labor versus occupancy. ", "At a market level, we continue to see very attractive growth in high barrier to entry markets such as California and Canada, which drove very strong top and bottom line growth. The performance in Canada was particularly exceptional, growing and NOI by nearly 12% in the quarter. Despite the strength in certain high barrier markets, elevated levels of new building openings in select markets constrained our portfolio growth.", "The second quarter saw the highest number of new units coming online in recent experience, with the overall deliveries of new units in our trade areas up 50% sequentially from Q1 of 2017. New openings were concentrated in high construction markets, including Dallas, Salt Lake City, Atlanta and Denver.", "Switching gears to a forward view, construction in progress as a percentage of inventory, within our trade areas improved by 20 basis points sequentially to 5.3% in the second quarter, encouragingly representing the third consecutive sequential improvement in this metric. For the full-year 2017, we are maintaining our shop portfolio same-store NOI guidance range of 0% to 2% growth.", "The guidance range is a function of the level and timing of new deliveries and operator execution in the back half of the year. The high-end of the range implies roughly 2% year-over-year NOI growth in the second half, driven by delayed new openings and the resulting occupancy gains. Conversely, the lower end of the shop guidance range implies approximately 2% NOI year-over-year declines in the second half, assuming accelerated new openings further widens the year-over-year occupancy gap.", "As a mild reminder, like last year NOI should be lower in dollar terms in the second half versus the first half of the year as a result of technical factors like the number of days in each period. So, shop performance seems to be playing out as we predicted when we initiated our 2017 guidance. Our shop operators are sharply focused and incentivized to manage our shop assets with excellence to ensure bottom line performance in 2017.", "A final note on senior housing. We are encouraged by strong demand reported by Nick in the top 99 markets where absorption reached almost 3% in the second quarter. This supports our view of the strong value proposition of seniors housing and with our premium real estate located in high quality markets, we are well positioned to take advantage of the coming demographic tailwinds.", "Rounding out the portfolio review is our office reporting segment, which is comprised of our university-based life science and innovation portfolio and our high-quality medical office business. Together, the office portfolio accounts for approximately a quarter of our NOI. Our life science operating portfolio continued to perform very well through the second quarter. ", "Sequentially, new leasing drove 90 basis points occupancy increase to an excellent 97.5%, while revenues and NOI increased almost 4%. In our highly valuable medical office business, same-store cash NOI in the second quarter increased by healthy 2.2%. Second quarter results benefited from approximately 2% revenue growth driven by low single digit rate increases together with year-over-year and sequential operation occupancy gains.", "Given the higher than normal level of lease rollovers in 2017, our team has done a terrific job in managing occupancy by driving new leasing and maintaining strong tenant retention that exceeds 80% year-to-date. Our full-year outlook continues to forecast same-store cash NOI growth of 1% to 2% for our same-store medical office assets.", "Turning to our overall company financial results and our outlook for the year. We delivered excellent results and enhanced financial strength in the second quarter. Second quarter 2017 income from continuing operations per share grew 5% to $0.42, compared to the second quarter of 2016. Normalized FFO per share in the second quarter grew 2% to $1.06, compared to the second quarter of 2016.", "Second quarter results were driven principally by accretive investments and improved property performance versus prior year. Ventas funded investments of $110 million in the quarter, including $53 million of acquisitions helping our operator partners grow in our seniors housing triple net portfolio, and $57 million of funding for our share of development and redevelopment projects currently underway.", "To fund investments, Ventas issued and sold 1.1 million shares of common stock under the ATM program for net proceeds of $74 million, and sold properties and received final repayments on loans receivable for proceeds of $45 million. During and following the quarter we also committed the future growth through new development and redevelopment projects and seniors housing in MOB's with total project costs of $188 million.", "We continued to drive enhanced financial strength through excellent capital raising. We tapped the attractive Canadian bond market in May and issued 275 million Canadian dollar five-year notes at 2.55% to refinance short-term low rate Canadian debt, thereby extending our debt maturities, while providing natural currency hedges.", "Meanwhile Ventas delivered attractive cash flow growth in the quarter with 5% growth in net cash provided by operating activities. Ventas also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.775 a share representing 6% year-over-year increase, as well as a well protected FFO payout ratio below 75%. The result of this cumulative activity is an even stronger financial position. ", "Net debt to EBITDA improved 10 basis points sequentially to 5.8 times, which we expect to further improve upon receipt of disposition proceeds by year end, fixed charge coverage remained best in class at 4.6 times, and secured debt to total indebtedness improved sequentially to 5%.", "Let me close out our prepared remarks with our reaffirmed full-year 2017 earnings and same-store guidance for the company, including the following. We continue to expect income from continuing operations to range from $1.72 to $1.78 per fully diluted share. Our normalized FFO per share forecast continues to range from $4.12 to $4.18.", "It is a Testament to the strength of our portfolio that even with all the expected portfolio changes asset sales leveraging the funding of developments and senior housing supply our normalized FFO grew year-over-year in Q2 and is expected to grow full year at the midpoint of our guidance range. ", "Total portfolio same-store cash NOI is anticipated to grow 1.5% to 2.5%, while segment level same-store growth expectations also remain unchanged. The $700 million Kindred SNF sale at an 8% GAAP yield is expected to occur in phases, beginning in the third quarter, and to be completed by year-end 2017.", "The high-end of our current FFO guidance range assumes the majority of proceeds received late in the fourth quarter of 2017. Earlier, larger dispositions coupled with the associated paydown of 2% LIBOR-based debt will reduce FFO by approximately $0.01 per share per month.", "Upon completion of the SNF sale, Ventas is expected to record a gain exceeding $600 million, which will increase the company's net income per diluted common share. Consistent with previous practice we do not include any further material investments, dispositions, loan repayments or capital activity in our outlook. ", "We assume approximately 359 million weighted average shares for the full-year 2017 with no new equity issuance contemplated. To close, we are pleased with our performance in the year and our progress on executing on our strategic priorities.", "With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Michael Carroll", "Yes, thanks. Debbie, can you give us some color on the company's - are the company in which you guys are tracking in the acute care hospital space? And is a plan to mainly grow with Ardent or are you willing to make investments with different operators?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning Michael. I would say that we are involved in both undertakings. As you know, when we first invested with Ardent and with Sam Zell, we believed it was a scalable investment opportunity because of the high quality team there and the good platform. And that has played out exactly as we expected, and I would continue to expect that there will be opportunities with our partners to grow there. ", "And we also, in a very selective way could pursue opportunities with high quality health systems, so long as they share the kind of characteristics that we\u2019re looking for, which I would describe as many HCA type characteristics, which are basically great market share, good payer mix, good branding, opportunity for margin improvement and so on. So, we\u2019ve very consistent in that regard. It is a gigantic market and we\u2019re focused on a very high quality slice event both with Ardent and separately.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And then I guess, I'm not sure if we're done with the repeal replay, seems like everything comes back, I guess every week or so about something new that could be passed, but as we get more clarity on the new health care environment and what's the GOP may or may not do, do you believe that Ventas can be more aggressive deploying capital in this space?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well again, we are going to be consistent and very selective in the types of investments we will make in this trillion dollar highly fragmented sector. We\u2019ve talked about Todd\u2019s expertise over the years. We really are expert both in our management team and our board in identifying the kinds of opportunities we think fit with our strategy. It is helpful certainly that we may have more clarity given the Senate majority leader\u2019s view that it's time to move on to, as I said tax reform and defense bills and so on, and so that\u2019s helpful. But this is long-term secular thesis that we have that will play out over decades and so we\u2019re going to continue to pursue that with consistency and strength and I believe we will be successful at it.", "Michael Carroll", "Great, thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is open.", "Smedes Rose", "Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask you on the SHOP assets for the U.S. portfolio and you sort of talked about some of the ranges for the outlook, so could you see that be negative for the year or do you think that will, are you guys expecting that to improve in the second half back into positive territory?", "Bob Probst", "Hi Smedes, thanks for the question. The range obviously of 0 to 2 for the year, which we reconfirmed today really recognizes that new deliveries are primary drivers of the performance and the balance of the year, difficult to predict clearly. So we think it is appropriate to have a range for the back half of the year, and we are pleased with our start, I think it is hard to say we are right where we expected to be, whether it be top or bottom line. With the balance of the year that range is really a function of those new deliveries. So, we will have to see how that plays out.", "Smedes Rose", "Well just on that front, are you seeing any changes or hearing about any changes in capital of the ability for construction and senior housing?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes.", "Bob Probst", "Anecdotally it is continuing to get more difficult, financing is getting more difficult finding good operators is getting more difficult. I mentioned that we said three now - periods in a row where the construction to inventory metric has improved, so that\u2019s encouraging. So anecdotally and quantitatively I think we\u2019ve seen some positive trends.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay, thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Smedes.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Your line is open.", "Nick Yulico", "Hi, good morning everyone.", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi Nick.", "Nick Yulico", "Just a first question on kind of Lillibridge, I guess I was reading through the filing, first off it is not clear, it sounds like there might, there is not much of any G&A impact, may be you could just clarify that. ", "Debra Cafaro ", "I think you\u2019re right that it will be not much of a G&A impact that\u2019s correct.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. And then is there, I guess the plan there, are you planning to keep the Lillibridge name and is there a no-compete for Todd?", "Debra Cafaro ", "Well, we were very happy to acquire Todd\u2019s business in 2010 and combine forces with him and we like his name, and so we're going to keep it, and he likes it too, so he will probably use it. Like all of our executives Todd has a 12-month no-compete from - after leaving the company and we hope he will stick around for a while doing lots of good things for us, after he transitions the MOB leadership role.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. And then, Debbie I just wanted to ask about acquisitions, if you look at your leverage, your balance sheet, it puts you in a good position to do a larger acquisition. So, I want to hear your thought about the investment opportunities out there, you mentioned asset pricing being strong across healthcare real estate, so does that restrict your acquisition opportunities?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well we are in a great spot. As you correctly point out, and I think we can compete and win in transactions where we are focused on winning. And that\u2019s a great spot to be in. We have really picked our spots and been very clear about our capital allocation priorities over the last couple of years, and I think we have the ability to really execute on those. And so we feel really good about that.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. I guess just going back to the pricing commentary, I mean did that relate to specific asset classes like medical office where pricing has gotten pretty aggressive and may be little bit more difficult to do acquisitions versus some of the other types of real estate you're looking at?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes. I mean, we like what we see in terms of value creation. The institutionalization and performance for example the MOB\u2019s is now sort of a mid-to-high 4s cap rate. I think in seniors housing, we have grown with customers we have been selective and we're focused on some high quality redevelopment both in MOBs with our center project in down town San Francisco, and in senior housing with our new projects with Sunrise and Atria.", "And then we continue to build this Life Science business where we see great opportunities and selectively in the hospital and health systems business as we discussed. So, there is lots of opportunity for us to do that and when we see investment opportunities that really add to our strategic direction, add to our portfolio accomplish things and our high-quality, I think we can very well compete and win on those opportunities.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay, thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.", "Rich Anderson", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Bob Probst", "Good morning.", "Rich Anderson", "So, on the Life Sciences kind of a priority growth platform for you right now, can you comment on the size of the university market for that and the competitive landscape and then as an anecdote to that, you mentioned you know you are buying in the 6 to 9 range, but you think it\u2019s worth a four handle or maybe a low five, do you feel yourself in a competitive advantage in the sense that you may not be consensus among other investors in this space, and so you could be a little bit more aggressive to win deals, is that a fair way to think about it?", "John Cobb", "Yes this is John Cobb and I think, we think the size of the market is 4 billion to 5 billion or pretty big. We feel that with the Wexford brand and our brand. We have a great value proposition to the universities. Where we see the 6 to 9 is really on the development side. We think that when you, we can build to those yields, which is what we\u2019re doing in new city and Penn and then WashU that once we build and fill them up to 95% occupancy we think that\u2019s where we get the value creation.", "Debra Cafaro", "And what\u2019s really interesting, just another stat on that is, the existing tenants that we have, these universities, Brown and Yale and Duke and UPenn just the existing portfolio, 25 assets, those universities account for 11% of all US R&D spending by universities. We think we can expand with those tenants and are working on that. Then there is another cohort that really accounts for the next kind of 30% of US University R&D spending, and that\u2019s where we are targeting and we have ongoing discussions with Wexford with virtually all of that next cohort. So, that\u2019s kind of the target market Rich.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, so beyond - beyond the universities in terms of the buyer poll for this asset class, who are you competing with?", "Debra Cafaro", "We pretty much as John said, I mean I think we have a great opportunity with limited apples-to-apples competition because of Wexford's brand, relationships, and track record where the University see us and then our institutional nature partnered with them. So they see that, those completed projects, they see the brand names that have already had success with this. They see us with our institutional long-term hold, and I think we really have the market pretty much in an attractive spot for us to win a large percentage of these development yields and that\u2019s why we\u2019re excited about continuing the opportunity.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. And then last question you ought to talk about how healthcare could fill the void for e-commerce and retail establishments and of course we are saying that in many respects with some of the different levels of types of care that you can get in a retail environment, do you see - how do you see that evolving over the next five years or so? Do you think like, Macy's and Sears, these big blocks of space could somehow be occupied by some sort of healthcare component or are they just too big, so you really got to go smaller when you are looking at those types of assets?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good question. You know what I would say is, everybody wants to go where the demand is. And the demand is in healthcare and senior housing. And so it is a great spot to be in. I would say that there may be some successful at the margin opportunities for that type of conversion, but in general based on the sort of regulatory environment and new rules that are coming out for example that are pushing outpatient services that hospitals offer back toward the campus because of pricing changes.", "We think that the conversion of retail to medical would be a limited phenomenon over the next five years. And obviously the box size is relevant as well. But I really think the way hospital and health systems really provide outpatient services is being driven by the regulatory environment back closer to the hospital campus and that\u2019s very important.", "Rich Anderson", "Interesting. Okay, thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.", "Michael Knott", "Hi everybody. Question just on skilled nursing, it is going to be down to 1%, and just curious if you're thinking about taking that all the way to zero, and with what timing?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well we\u2019ve gone from 70% when I started to 1%, so we're pretty happy about that. We will continue to be opportunistic and smart as we have, I believe we\u2019ve been in our capital allocation, which as I said includes disposition activities. Right now we don't have any plans in that regard, but we will continue to be patient and opportunistic and if we have opportunities to do anything in our portfolio in any of the asset classes, we will always look at that if we think it\u2019s going to create value.", "Michael Knott", "And then on the hospital front, it sounded like you were saying it would be possibility for Ventas to further expand in that business outside of Ardent and EGI, did I hear that correctly?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, and that\u2019s consistent. I think what we have always said is, this is a huge market. It\u2019s fragmented, there are a lot of high quality, highly rated health systems that we\u2019ve been doing business with for 25 years. We think this scalable Ardent platform with the management team is a great place to do bolt-on acquisitions and we have shown that that has been occurring and we\u2019re very pleased with the way that is playing out, and with Ardent's performance. But there also is an opportunity in this gigantic market to pursue other potential opportunities on a very highly selective basis. And that\u2019s consistent with our thesis from the beginning.", "Michael Knott", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Steve Sakwa", "Hi thanks, good morning. Debbie I was wondering if you or Bob could just maybe comment a little further on the occupancy decline in the SHOP portfolio, was there anything regionally that you noticed in that basis point, the 200 basis point drop?", "John Cobb", "Sure. I\u2019ll take that Steve. The 200 basis points down is right in-line with what we talked about last quarter. We entered the quarter at lower point as you know from the flu, which was more severe and occurred later in the year then this is normal. And then we saw the new deliveries come online as I mentioned. The regions and the locations of that new supply of the same that we\u2019ve been talking about for over a year and a half now, I highlighted Dallas, Salt Lake City, Denver, Atlanta is a few most notable, but the same markets that you read about when that report comes out are the ones that we\u2019re seeing. It is contained to the same 30% of our SHOP portfolio that we\u2019ve been talking about for some time. So, it is not new, but there was an increase in the amount of deliveries in those markets in the second quarter.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay thanks. And then I guess secondly, may be Bob this is for you, but just in terms of equity issuance in using the ATM, how are you sort of thinking about that and you know obviously the balance sheet has gotten much better, but how are you sort of thinking about raising equity capital and is the sort of primary sort of financial determinants sort of earnings accretion or I assume any via the much less important factor when you are looking at issuing equity?", "Bob Probst", "Well coming back, we agree we feel very good about the balance sheet and the financial position we are in. Our net debt to EBITDA is a really good. Our fixed charge coverage is fabulous. Our liquidity is really strong, our cash flow is very strong, so we feel really good about our position and have multiple options. In the quarter itself we did make commitments to investments of about $110 million.", "We funded that in part with ATM that\u2019s just one of the clubs in the back that we use as a relatively small amount, but efficient and it is one of the ways that we will fund new investments, but dispositions are another and we view that very considerably over the last year including $1 billion this year. So, multiple ways to finance ourselves.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay, thanks. That's it from me.", "Debra Cafaro", "All right Steve, thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital. Your line is open", "John Kim", "Good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "John Kim", "Hi. If you look for a new leader for your MOB business, I am wondering how you envision this business changing, are you looking for someone with more of an acquisitive or a development background or different relationships going forward?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, I think that we have a bias towards a leader who will be results oriented, proven record of accomplishment, and a deep understanding of the healthcare industry. I don\u2019t - if they have a nice head of hair and a great smile like Todd that would be an added bonus, but that\u2019s generally the direction we\u2019re looking. John\u2019s team is really in-charge of all of our investments, including MOB investments, and so it will be great to have a partner who can assist in that regard, but the MOB leader is really running the business.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then earlier this week it was revealed that Amazon has a healthcare division, I know its early days still, but can you comment on how you think technology and data is going to change demand, and offer any of your assets classes?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I mean that is obviously - Amazon has been a disrupter in a number of areas. We believe, again why are people going to healthcare and they are going to healthcare because that is where there is incredible, inexorable, demographic demand and so everybody wants a piece of that. I do believe that technology will change and enhance the delivery at healthcare services as it has been doing for quite some time. And basically it hopefully will drive down cost of providing healthcare in the country. But we believe that we will continue to see increasing utilization of our assets from this demographic ways that has started and will continue to come.", "John Kim", "These technology changes, when do you think they will start to make an impact? Is that over next couple of years or is it really longer term?", "Debra Cafaro", "Certainly not in the near term and so over time, I mean again we want healthcare delivery in the United States to be enhanced and delivered efficiently and so our job is really to align ourselves with leading providers who are always going to be there delivering high quality healthcare services for this ageing demographic and that\u2019s our business model and that is what we are really focused on.", "John Kim", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Jordan Sadler", "Thanks. I wanted to just go back to your comments on life sciences being sort of a big area in focus in terms of capital allocation, would you similarly look to expand that business outside of may be University or outside of Wexford?", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning. Good question. Look, right now as I said, we\u2019ve got this big task in front of us with great opportunities to allocate capital in a very value creating way and we are really focused there. I also said that we will continue to be nimble and opportunistic as we continue to grow cash flows and no reliable way. And so we will remain open to other opportunities. Our focus is on the investment opportunities with Wexford in the university-based business that are staring us right in the face with their very robust pipeline, and so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay, that is helpful.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good.", "Jordan Sadler", "And I was going to toss my hat in the ring for the Todd Lillibridge see it like John Kim, but I don't have the good head or hair, so probably kept me out. So, but seriously congrats there on the stewardship of capital and in that investment, Todd\u2019s leaving so brings the question to me, obviously you made a lot of money there, would you look to monetize a portion there or is that still an area of focus for investment?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well we have a great MOB business, I think its value is perhaps underappreciated by investors and that\u2019s one reason we really wanted to highlight it. We\u2019re happy that we invested at the early stage of value creation, and really built this business seven times from 2010, but we continue to look for opportunities to grow, but also to prune the portfolio as we think is appropriate, and so that\u2019s where we stand.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. Hey Bob, can I just as you on the occupancy on the SHOP portfolio, you were down 200 basis points year-over-year, I know you affirmed the same-store expectation, but do you think that that gap could widen further into the back half of the year or does that seem unlikely at this point?", "Bob Probst", "Yes, we in the low end of the range what\u2019s implied in that Jordan is that we could see a widening of that year-over-year gap, sequentially. Conversely at the high end, we could see an improvement and it\u2019s really again a function of the timing and pacing of new deliveries, so that\u2019s what dictates the range in the back half.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chad Vanacore from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Seth Canetto", "Hi, Good morning.", "Bob Probst", "Good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Seth Canetto", "This is Seth Canetto on for Chad. My was first question on the SHOP portfolio centers around expenses, you know they are up sequentially, I think last quarter was a little artificially low based on number of days, but just focusing on expenses and giving your portfolio on high coastal markets, top MSAs are you guys seeing a slowdown and wage pressure at all?", "Bob Probst", "We started the year seeing 4% to 5% wage growth and that\u2019s been pretty consistent in the first half of the year. In the quarter, we posted overall expense growth of 3%, so by definition the operators are doing a really good job of not only flexing that labor relative to occupancy, but also driving indirect costs down and are very much focused on that, but the 4% to 5% wage accounts in volume I would describe it, consistent volume wage growth has been pretty consistent.", "Seth Canetto", "Alright. And just on flexing labor, I mean if the year-over-year occupancy deteriorates further, which I guess is kind of depended on the deliveries online, but is the flexing something that they can keep doing as long as occupancy is declining to help offset that, is that how we should be thinking about that?", "Bob Probst", "Well there certainly is a point where fixed cost kicks in. I don't think we are there. I think there is certainly plenty of headroom, and again this is a very market-by-market centric conversation, but I think there is still continued room to be able to flat labor for sure.", "Seth Canetto", "All right and then just shifting gears to the LTAC business, you know coverage declined as expected, and I think it is safe to assume that it should stabilize towards the end of 2017 and into the beginning of 2018 when you guys report the numbers. So, I guess what gives you confidence that Kindred will be able to mitigate that business and then improve the coverage there?", "Debra Cafaro", "Great question. Kindred commented on the business in its first quarter call, and I think that you\u2019ve got it exactly right about the pattern that in the early quarters you would expect unmitigated impact to be larger and then as Kendrick\u2019s mitigation strategies take hold that impact will be lessened and improved considerably. I mean that will take place in the back half and then into 2018. I mean the bottom line is Kindred is the best LTAC operator ever.", "I mean this is their historic business, I think they are showing good opportunities to increase their compliant patient population, improve and take some site neutral patients, to control expenses, and to improve mix in terms of Medicare advantage and other favorable asset types because of course as you know, now you can have shorter lengths of stay with those patients and I think Kindred feels good about the fact that Medicare advantage and Managed Care payers believe that there\u2019s a good value proposition that Kindred could provide on a shorter length of stay basis than the historical norm. So that\u2019s what gives us confidence in Kindred's ability to operate this portfolio and manage through the patient criteria changes successfully.", "Seth Canetto", "Okay great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, good to talk.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Hi yes, good morning. Just a quick one from me, the same-store NOI, the occupancy for the SHOP portfolio, I know you kind of talked about it, kind of being dragged down a little bit by flu season and things like that, could you talk specifically about how you are expected to come back a little bit in the back half of the year, is it really just slowdown in delivery like, what else do you kind of expect to kind of go on to kind of close that gap?", "John Cobb", "You hit the key one, which is slowdown in deliveries and the ability for lease up and absorption to happen. And one of the things - I want to make sure everyone notice the fact that the demand growth is stronger absorption with 3% year-on-year as per the NIC data which is really encouraging, but obviously a lot of units in lease-up. So, we need to have some time for that absorption to happen. No seasonality typically, one would see a pickup in the back half, but it really comes down again to this question of pacing in new deliveries.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Got you. Okay, anything from, I know some other operators had like bans on admissions because of the flu and things like that, is all that kind of stuff coming off?", "John Cobb", "That\u2019s really a first quarter phenomenon Tayo and we are back in the normal season I'd say. So nothing unusual like that that\u2019s occurring now. It\u2019s really about the summer season and gaining market share and operating with excellence in the context of supply demand.", "Tayo Okusanya", "That\u2019s helpful. But another quick one on the MOB side, again it sounds like there are a couple more large portfolio transactions in the market that could kind of go at mid-4% cap rates, again just while that\u2019s all great for NAV and how does one really kind of think about a world of buying MOB\u2019s at, you know high-quality MOB\u2019s at the mid-4%, like is that really sustainable longer term do you guys kind of expect some of that stuff to kind of turnaround, and in the near term you kind of wary of making acquisitions, like how do we kind of think about that well just kind of giving the typical 2% to 3% same-store NOI growth profile of MOB.", "Debra Cafaro", "Well great question, and I think that the way we think about it is, our value creation opportunity is generally to invest early in asset types where we think there will be cap rate compression, and/or cash flow growth and we evidence that the example, I would say in the MOB business and in senior housing, and we have been consistent at Ventas in our ability to see those trends, invest early, and create value for investors through cash flow growth in the assets and/or cap rate compression.", "So, what I would say is, we have this really great business with a diversified portfolio, and one of the ways that we\u2019ve been able to deliver reliable growing cash flows over cycles for almost 20 years is this underappreciated ability to allocate capital around the wheel as I call it, where we can and have been able to consistently find good risk-adjusted return investments, so that if one asset class happens to be exceedingly valuable, we have lots of other places to go to find good investments that deliver good risk adjusted return and meet our investment criteria.", "And that has been, I think an underappreciated, but very important part of our long term success. And so that\u2019s how we think about it. We have a great business. We have five verticals. We have a great investment team, and expertise and relationships and we will use those for the benefit of our shareholders to make progress.", "Tayo Okusanya", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "All right. So with that I think we will end today's call. I\u2019m just shocked and disappointed that no one congratulated me on winning the Stanley Cup, but it\u2019s been a great summer so far. I\u2019m really, really pleased with where Ventas is in our performance, and we hope everyone has a great summer and we look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you so much for your interest in the company and your attention this morning.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call maybe recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ryan Shannon, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Shannon", "Thanks, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement today regarding its results for the year end quarter ended December 31, 2017. As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.", "The company cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and contingencies, and stockholders and others should recognize that actual results may differ materially from the company's expectations, whether expressed or implied.

Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Ryan. And good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas year end 2017 earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined on today's call by our standing team. As we discuss our excellent year, highlight our enterprise strength and value and provide the framework for our 2018 expectations.", "The Ventas advantage has allowed us to deliver sustained excellence through cycles for two decades. This success has been founded on solid strategic vision, foresight and innovation, proactive capital allocation decisions, rigorous execution and a stable expert team. As we enter 2018, which is Ventas' twentieth year anniversary, we are confident we will continue our long track record of excellence as the leader in our space.", "Let's start by quickly recapping 2017, which was a record year for Ventas, setting new highs for net income and revenue, generating 5% operating cash flow and dividend growth and delivering normalized FFO same-store property cash NOI growth at the high end of our expectations.", "To enhance our diverse portfolio, we made nearly $2 billion in value creating investments, including significant expansion of our exciting University-Based Life Science business, profitably disposed of almost $1 billion in assets and completed several innovative deals with our leading operating partners.", "We made significant progress on our commitment to environmental, social and governance matters and received numerous prestigious recognitions for our outstanding ESG profile. Our team stayed strong, smart and unified as we executed our business plans with great success.", "As we look to 2018 and beyond, we're laser focused on finding ways to deliver value for investors. We've anticipated and are prepared for today's market and business conditions. Every environment end cycle provides opportunities for those like Ventas through our experience, strong and nimble enough to take advantage of them. That's what the Ventas team has done for the past 20 years.", "With that as a backdrop, we expect to grow our total same-store portfolio cash NOI 1.5% to 2% in 2018. Our expectations are benefiting from our portfolio diversification and mix with nearly two thirds of the business in our office and triple-net lease segments, while our SHOP portfolio is currently working its way through a timing mismatch of supply and demand, exacerbated by this year's severe flu season.", "We know that demographic demand from seniors will increase significantly, which should benefit performance in the SHOP portfolio in the coming years. Our enterprise is expected to generate approximately $3.5 million on consolidated revenues and $2 billion in consolidated net operating income in 2018. We expect our normalized FFO per share to range between $3.95 and $4.05 per share.", "During the year, we again intend to demonstrate capital allocation success by generating $1.5 billion as we harvest profits from the successful investments we've made. These include, receipt of full repayment on nearly $850 million of plus 9% well secured, well-structured loans in life sciences and hospitals, completion of a joint venture with an institutional capital partner on the valuable senior housing portfolio and a sale of other assets.", "We intend to recycle these proceeds and process into our future growth by ramping up to over $400 million. Our funding of premiere development and redevelopment projects, principally towards the life science and MOB assets and by retiring outstanding debts in a rising rate environment.", "While these capital allocation decisions do have an effect on our year-over-year FFO expectations, they're the right steps in the current environment to realize gains from successful capital allocation, diversify our capital sources and prove our financial strength and flexibility and create further dry powder where the market adjust to the changing rate environment.", "We also continue to pursue and evaluate opportunistic investments across our verticals. We remain focused on allocating capital wisely, where we find attractive risk adjusted returns, see a significant competitive advantage or strategic upside or can help a customer achieve its goal.", "We've averaged over $2.5 billion in annual investment volumes since 2012 and haven't built any material acquisition activity into our projections for 2018, consistent with our long standing historical practice. If we see investment opportunities that are attractive and high quality, we have the capacity and the ability to execute on them.", "Our 2017 and nearly 2018 activities highlight the benefits of our partnerships with leading platforms and the value of our properties. Due to the strength of these platforms the quality of the portfolio and strong forward demographic demand, institutional equity interest in Ventas' assets and operators is exceedingly high.", "Here are some recent proof points. Atria recently received a major equity investment in its operating business from Fremont Capital. This recapitalization demonstrated Atria's increased value since our original investment and validated Atria's leading market position as an outstanding senior housing care provider in a highly fragmented market.", "Second, Kindred recently agreed to be acquired by two experience healthcare investors, who are putting significant new equity capital behind the Kindred management team and their LTAC, IRF and rehab business. With recent positive reimbursement news and continued operational strategies taking hold, our LTAC should generate improving results in 2018. We know how long and hard our friends at Kindred worked to achieve this positive outcome for Kindred shareholders and we look forward to continuing to partner with them.", "Third, we see significant institutional interest by global capital sources in the creation of a joint venture for our portfolio of over 70 senior housing communities. We recently transitioned to a newly formed manager ESL. We were pleased to successfully complete the transition of these communities and our strategic investment in ESL last month. We're confident ESL will capture operational upside and additional value from this portfolio. ESL has already become a sort after manager in senior housing and we're delighted to back industry veteran Kai Hsiao and an experienced team of executives in this highly strategic new management company.", "Ardent continues to thrive and perform exceptionally well through year end. With its pending acquisition of East Texas Medical Center in partnership with the University of Texas System, Ardent is expected to generate over $4 billion in revenue from its operation of 31 hospitals in seven states, with 40% average market share.", "And finally, our leading life science platform Wexford remains to source a significant growth and value creation. In 2017, we invested nearly $400 million in development commitments and acquisitions, including projects anchored by or affiliated with Brown University, Virginia Commonwealth, UPenn and WashU.", "This exciting business line with top tied highly rated research institutions and companies has grown nearly 40% since inception. And we continue to see growth opportunities at attractive risk adjusted returns as we invest to meet the needs of premiere research institutions and companies. We are also very pleased to see that congress has significantly increased NIH funding over the next few years.", "A word on our dividend and tax policy before I close. The recent tax cuts as we all know provided significant rate reduction to 21% for US corporations. In addition, owners of pass through businesses including real estate companies received an effective rate reduction to just under 30% at the highest marginal rate. That rate also applies to reap dividends.", "We were pleased that our board recently increased our dividend 2% because our growing reliable dividend is an important component of the total value propositions we offer our shareholders. To provide our shareholders with the benefit of the new rate, our fourth quarter 2017 dividend will be taxable in 2018 under the new improved rate. Our dividend increase further demonstrates our confidence in our business and our cash flow. And that's a good segue to my conclusion.", "In short, we remain bullish on our business and our company. We have near term burgeoning demographic demands, a large fragmented industry, a proven consistent strategy, a strong balance sheet, excellent operating partners, a growing development pipeline of trophy assets that will become additives to earnings in the future, a cohesive experience team and a track record of superior performance through cycles, the Ventas team is ready for another 20 years of success.", "With that I'm happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst.", "Robert Probst", "Thanks Debby. I'm happy to report another strong year of cash flow performance from our high quality portfolio of healthcare, seniors housing and office properties. Our total property portfolio delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 2.5% for the full year 2017. At the high end of our 2% to 2.5% total company same-store guidance. All segments contributed to this growth and each delivered at the midpoint to the high end of our original same-store guidance ranges.", "In 2018, we expect our total property portfolio to generate continued positive same-store NOI growth in the range of 0.5% to 2%, benefiting from diversification of asset class, operators, geography and business model. Let me detail our 2017 performance and 2018 guidance for our properties at a segment level starting with our triple-net business.", "Our triple-net portfolio grew same-store cash NOI by an excellent 3.7% for the full year 2017. In the fourth quarter triple-net same-store cash NOI increased an outstanding 4.2% for the third quarter of 2017. Trailing 12 months, EBITDA and cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net lease portfolio for the third quarter of 2017, related to the above information was consistent with prior quarter at 1.6 times.", "Coverage in our triple-net same-store seniors housing portfolio was 1.2 times, down from 1.3 times last quarter as a result of escalated growth outpacing underlying asset level cash flows. Cash flow coverage in our same-store IRF and LTAC portfolio held stable at 1.6 times despite rent increases and the impact of the LTAC reimbursement change.", "Finally, Ardent performed exceptionally well throughout 2017.Third quarter 2017 results were strong compared to leading publicly traded hospital systems in the US, with admissions, adjusted admissions, revenue and EBITDA growth did impact. As a result Ardent rent coverage held strong at three times. For 2018, we expect our triple\u2013net portfolio overall to grow from 3% to 4%, driven by in place lease escalations.", "Moving on to our senior housing operating portfolio, our SHOP results for the full year and for the quarter were right in line with our expectations. Indeed, our initial SHOP guidance provided in February 2017, proved to be highly accurate throughout the year and top to bottom through the P&L. Full year same-store occupancy in 2017 declined by 180 basis points versus 2016, driven by the cumulative impact of new deliveries in select market. Growth for the year approached 4% and fuel the bottom line.", "Operating expenses were held to 2% increase despite labor wage growth of 4%. For the full year, same-store cash NOI increased by 1.3%, above the midpoint of our original guidance. The occupancy gap versus prior year narrowed to 180 basis points in the fourth quarter, with our new deliveries continued to pressure revenue. Q4 expenses were held under 2% through a continued management of direct and indirect costs. At the bottom line Q4 same-store SHOP cash NOI declined modestly in line with our expectations.", "We continue to see strength in high barrier markets including Los Angeles, San Francesco, Boston and Ontario. Despite the strength, we observed mid to high single digit NOI declines in markets affected by new competition, most notably within secondary markets.", "Turning to 2018, we expect full year same-store SHOP cash NOI to be lower in the range of 1% to 4%. SHOP same-store cash NOI is expected to decline in 2018 due to the full year occupancy impact of a severe flu season as well as the cumulative impact of new supply in certain markets. Let me expand on each of these drivers.", "First, flu. This flu season is the most severe in years in terms of duration and reach across most markets of the United States. Flu related hospitalizations are up nearly 70% among seniors aged 65 years older. Those supportive of hospital and MOB volumes should negatively pressure senior housing occupancy in two ways, through accelerated resident move outs as well as limited move ins due to community quarantines.", "The second driver of 2018 SHOP guidance is the cumulative impact of new supply. The elevated levels of new deliveries we observed in 2017 are expected to further accelerate in 2018, with new openings approximating 3% of inventory in our trade areas. On a positive note, new starts in Q4 '17 were down nearly 20% in our trade areas. However, delayed new deliveries increased overall construction to inventory by 30 basis points on a restudy basis to 6.2%.", "In light of these two drivers, we expect that same-store occupancy in 2018 will decline in the range of 200 basis points versus 2017. In terms of a rate, we continue to see opportunity to drive in place rent increases for existing residents. The majority of the 2018 realtors have now gone out and average 4% across the portfolio and thus far are holding up well. Price competition on new resident rates are expected to dampen overall growth for the year to approximately 3%.", "From an expense perspective, a tight labor market and competition for staff is expected to drive wage pressure in the 4% range, partially offset by fluxing staff and managing non-labor costs. Therefore, we expect same-store cash NOI to range from minus 1% to minus 4%. The range is a function of the timing and occupancy impact of new deliveries and the resulting price competition in the supply challenged markets.", "Although the current supply demand miss-match is compressing near term profitability, we continue to believe in the long term opportunity in seniors housing and in our excellent market position with our high quality real estate operated by a select group of the nation's leading care providers.", "Let's round out the portfolio review with our office reporting segment, which represents approximately 25% of Ventas' NOI. For the full year 2017, office same-store cash NOI increased by 2% at the high end of our guidance. Q4 was the first quarter in which our office same-store pool included both our life science and our medical office portfolios.", "Our life science portfolio performed incredibly well in the fourth quarter drawing same-store cash NOI by 5.6%, as new leasing in our well forced assets to our life science occupancy is 330 basis points higher to an outstanding 97.4%. The benefit of our ongoing development pipeline will begin to benefit the same-store pool starting in 2019.", "Turning to our highly valuable medical office business, MOB same-store cash NOI for the full year 2017 increased by 2% at the high end of guidance. Our teams did an excellent job managing occupancy despite 33% higher lease expirations in 2017. Tenant retention in 2017 rose to over 80%. Revenue also benefited from in place lease escalations that exceeded 2%.", "In 2018, we expect 1.5% to 2.5% growth from same-store medical office portfolio, guides us to stable occupancy, just like continued lease expirations at elevated levels, low single digit rate growth and expense controls. On a combined basis, our office portfolio of life science properties and MOB assets is expected to grow same-store cash NOI in the range of 1.75% to 2.75% for the full year 2018.", "Now, on to our overall company financial results, in 2017, we delivered earnings growth at the high end of our guidance range, completed more than 1.8 billion of investments and 900 million of profitable dispositions with gains exceeding 700 million, made significant progress in enhancing our financial strength, raised our dividend and executed our strategic initiatives.", "Normalized FFO grew 1% to $4.16 per fully diluted share at the high end of our $4.13 to $4.16 guidance range. Our same store cash NOI for the portfolio grew 2.5%, also at the high end of our guidance.", "We bolstered our liquidity by 1.4 billion through increased revolving credit facilities. Our balance sheet is in good health, with net debt to EBITDA of 5.7 times, fixed charge coverage at exceptional 4.6 times and net debt to gross asset value of 38%.", "Meanwhile, cash flow from operations grew 5% in 2017 and the company's board of directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2018 of $0.79, representing a 2% year-over-year increase.", "On to the full year 2018 guidance for the company, the key components of our guidance are as follows. Income from continuing operations is estimated to range between $1.34 and $1.40 per fully diluted share.", "Normalized FFO per fully diluted share is forecast to range from $3.95 to $4.05. We expect our portfolio will grow same-store cash NOI by 0.5% to 2%, with same-store NOI growth at the midpoint as measured on a GAAP basis roughly 100 basis points lower than cash NOI.", "Finally, debt reduction is expected to further improve the company's net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA ratio to approximately 5.5 times by year end 2018. Substantially all of the change in year-over-year normalized FFO is explained by three drivers. First, despite our track record of accretive new acquisitions, our guidance assumes no material and announced acquisitions in 2018, as is our normal practice entering the year.", "Second, the impact of nearly 1 billion in late 2017 dispositions, together with a further 1.5 billion new 2018 dispositions with proceeds here marked for that reduction, drives approximately $0.10 of 2018 FFO reduction. Though dilutive to FFO this capital recycling activity reflects Ventas' capital allocation excellence, namely, we sold 700 million of sniffed assets in late 2017 at a highly attractive 7% cash yield.", "We expect nearly 850 million in repayments in 2018 on loans extended by Ventas that created significant value for our shareholders. Most notably an expected early prepayment of the 700 million, 9% loan to Ardent that funded the successful LHP acquisition. The disposition guidance also assumes the sale in 2018 of a share of the senior housing assets transition to ESL, creating a new strategic operating platform and attracting a new institutional capital partner.", "The third driver of FFO change year-over-year arises from aggressively managing our balance sheet. In addition to debt reduction from disposition proceeds, we expect to proactively refinance debt in 2018 with longer duration fixed rate debt to both extend our maturity profile and reduce refinancing risk. Together with LIBOR increases, these refinancing actions are expected to reduce FFO per share by $0.07.", "Moving on to other important elements of our 2018 guidance, we expect to accelerate our investment in future growth via approximately 425 million in development and redevelopment funding. Notably, in new grounds of developments associated with UPenn, WashU and Brown. 2018 guidance includes fees and payments from tenants generating an incremental $0.04 of positive FFO in 2018, most notably arising from the announced Kindred sale to TPG, Welsh, Carson and Humana.", "No equity is included in guidance and therefore the 2018 outlook assumes approximately 360 million weighted average fully diluted shares. To close, the Ventas team is pleased with our performance in 2017 and strongly committed to sustaining our long track record of excellence in 2018 and beyond.", "With that I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Yes, good morning Debbie. So the model of questions from my end, the short portfolio, I understand what you are saying about supply having an impact and things of that nature. But, could you talk a little bit about, is part of it also more difficult year-over-year comps from Canada that did really well last year, that's slowing this year. And, I guess some of us are just a bit surprised about the big magnitude of the decline in '18 versus '17.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thanks Tayo, I'm going to turn that to Rob for answer.", "Robert Probst", "Sure Tayo, within the guidance it's very clear with the two drivers are year-over-year, it's full of suppliers as outlined. If you look at the market level clearly that's most pronounced particularly the supply in the US. We expect Canada would continue to perform well in '18, clearly driven by a rage given the high occupancy. But, if this is really been a movie that's been on what we saw over the last year, we've been very consistent and accurate on the forecast. You saw that happening in the fourth quarter on the heels of a new supply, so it's really continuing that trend line.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay, that's helpful. And then secondly, in regards to your guidance versus the street, I think one of the things I've almost had difficulty modeling was that the Armcrops [ph] and the whole transition mode towards UB a minority owner and a JV versus having full ownership. Could you just give us a little bit more detail around again the overall size of the transaction, may be some pricing data? Anything that's going to kind of help us to model that a little bit better versus the limited data we had going into the quarter?", "Debra Cafaro", "Tayo, this is Debbie and congratulations on your forecasting, you get a prize for that. The - what I would say about the transaction is, you know we are very happy that we have successfully completed the transition of the asset and our investment in the operating business at ESL and we did that in January successfully. We kind of separated, you have to think about the impacts in a couple of buckets and I think on the NOI side for the period of time that we own, you know obviously we'll have 100% of NOI from the asset. And, we expect that NOI to have operational upside over time, so excited about that. And, then we've treated the joint venture essentially as in the disposition bucket when we talk about the billion and a half of expected dispositions that would be the pro-radar share of what we would be potentially partnering with the global institution on capital source on. And, receiving proceeds from that, and so, we would expect that to add an attractive evaluation obviously, and the amount and the evaluation of the asset while we expect to be positive will be refined as we get closer to completion of that transaction, which we would expect should be done maybe a year.", "Tayo Okusanya", "But, just to clarify, that 1.5 billion you have in recycling in your 2018 numbers is all across the entire thing?", "Debra Cafaro", "No, no, that's what I was saying is you know if you assume evaluation, pick a number caller one, then if we were joint venturing such that an institutional capital partner was buying say, 33% of the portfolio, then the disposition proceeds would include 0.33 of that. So, that's how it's being counted and hopefully that provides clarity for modeling.", "Robert Probst", "I think that 1.5 billion has 350 million of loaner payments and then the balance is property asset dispositions including ESL that we described.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Got it, that's helpful. The last one for me if you don't mind, the 200 in gain on sales that you had in 2017, does that come back to interest or some type of special dividend? Can you kind of re-invest those gains into acquisitions, you just going to talk about that kind of extra liquidity that you generated?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah, I mean we had over 700 million of gain since 2017, and, I would say we have been able to redeploy those proceeds into a combination of redevelopment and development projects as we talked about, debt reduction and of course some of that does come to our shareholders by virtue of our dividend. So, that's how those proceeds have been utilized.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay, helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Michael Carroll", "Yeah, Deb yesterday I touched on your comments regarding the investment market till date. What is the Ventas's strategy and are you likely to become the fed line to the near term until market price is adjusted with the higher interest rates that we've seen?", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi, good morning, so again, in our experience kind of working through market changes like the one that we are currently going through, I would say that we are very confident in our ability to be good capital allocators. That, I think then on the buying and the self-side demonstrated over the last couple of years, we continue to be active and seeking value creating investments as and when we find them and our priorities clearly are to continue to invest behind trophy development and redevelopment projects that would be added in to earnings in the coming years. And, we continue to try to support our customers and find other opportunities that will create value for investors. So, there may be, as we've seen in the past a lag between the change in the public market environment and private market evaluation and we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they arrive.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, and then just last question real quick, can you provide some additional color on your growth plans with Ardent and what was the main issue trying to transition that debt position on the LHP portfolio to equity ownership position?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, we've already said that we thought that the LHP loan that is the $700 million plus loan, that we made to fund our Ardent acquisition of a high quality hospital company LHP, and again we feel very, very good about all the hospital investments that we have made. And, we said, when we made it, that they are two good outcomes, one is that we would get paid back on the loan, which will make it an excellent investment. And, the other might be that they get converted into an equity position. Right now, our expectation is that it would be repaid in 2018 and we think that's a very positive outcome. And, again overtime, we really we believe in Ardent and we know, that they are operating high quality asset and overtime we hope to convert some of that into equity ownership. So, we are in a perfectly hedged position and we are supporting their growth and I think making good investment.", "Michael Carroll", "That's great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Schmidt Ross [ph] from Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, can you hear me? Okay thanks. I just wanted to ask you - you noted that the net lease on senior housing, net lease coverage came down to about 1.2 times, for the third quarter. And, given that fundamentals worth continuing to be challenging in that space, are you confident that the portfolio different to decline to under one times coverage and it's too soon to talk about, potential rent reductions, just how are you thinking about that coverage going forward?", "Debra Cafaro", "Hi, Schmidt. Overtime, again when you have to triple net lease assets, you would expect EBITDA to vary as running creases and you go through operating cycles on assets. As we see here today, we are comfortable with the performance which again is expected as we've talked before and our current expectations are that we'll continue to have all of our material rent paid in 2018, and feel good about that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, and then I just wanted to ask you too, just looks like the percent of MOB's is rolling in 2018, went up a little bit sequentially from what you achieved in the third quarter and I just wonder what was driving that?", "Robert Probst", "You are correct Schmidt, it is up, you'll recall '17 was already at elevated levels, '18 we are seeing more of the same, and we've added some assets in that pool, so pools are changing but at the end of the day, the team has done a great job in retaining tenants. I mentioned we had over 80% tenant retention and that's great. We hope to have the same going into '18, but these two years in particular has been at elevated levels.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Alright thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible] from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, thanks for the time. Good morning. Just on the idea guys I was hoping you could talk to just as a whole what you are expecting for expense growth, are you talking a little bit about the labor strategy equation and what the guys questions, any color on G&A?", "Robert Probst", "Total OpEx which you know is 60% of that is really labor driven, the rest remaining 4% labor increases, very much in line with what we saw in '17, which itself records reflecting some of the pressure we see on the tight labor market. We expect to see some offset with non-labor expenses, managing those down and also again flexing labor in '18. Albeit there is some moderation of that as we think about the active development. These are the flexing labor in 18 and so, though there's an offset, it's not a full offset and that's inherent in the guidance.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And, G&A sorry?", "Robert Probst", "In total OpEx, the total OpEx line. G&A for?", "Unidentified Analyst", "The corporate.", "Robert Probst", "Look we've always been very lean and efficient and there's no change there. We had some modest increases in cost just really driven by compensation, inflation etcetera. But, no significant headcount changes, no significant moves, very much controlled as always.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and then just going back to Schmidt's question on the triple-net coverage, with the decline quarter-over-quarter yearlong one times EBITDA. You've got to get exposures Holiday in Brookdale and Holiday's had a tough goal at Brookdale as well. You've got some expirations coming in '19. Could you give us any sense on kind of what the game plan is and we just wanted to re-innovate that there is no assumed rent pay in the '18 timings?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes happy to confirm that last statement that as we sit here today we are comfortable with were things stand, and have assumed contractual rent payments through 2018. And, clearly we are in a part of the cycle, we are operating retail store are feeling a little bit of the heat. I would say that we've been in lease renewal situations many times before as you've seen with Kindred and other operators and we will continue to handle those obviously in the best possible way. And, I think you can count on us for that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay great. And, just one more question about - the $0.04 you alluded to as fees is that being included in the same store triple-net guidance for '18?", "Robert Probst", "No, it's not Von; it's not associated with the lease.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our question comes from Nick [indiscernible] from UBS. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks, hi everyone. About senior housing operating segment can you talk a little bit about how much the flu impact hits same-store NOI growth, I assume it's some level on occupancy, but maybe it's a tough question ask - answer, but just trying to get a feel for what - we didn't have a bad flu season what would be the occupancy assumption?", "Robert Probst", "It's a really good question Nick, and very hard to quantify, despite many people trying to do so. It clearly does affect occupancy; we talked about accelerated move outs, and difficulty in move in just because we can't sell. And, that's been the occupancy impact, a number I can share with you is, we do track each of those particularly track, how many days are closed for selling to new potential residence year-on-year. And, that number has gone up by 250% year-on-year in terms of base closed for selling. Ultimately what that translates to in terms of occupancy, hard to say. But, as we've seen flu in the past, does not appear to happen is, it's not a timing issue, it doesn't rebound. You've altered your occupancy where that kind of carries forward throughout the year, so, hard to put a number on, but, clearly an impact.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, that's helpful. And, then just going to the same store guidance here, you said in a lease out you're GAAP seems like growth is 100 basis points lower than cash, mostly due to the office segment. And, so I am just wondering what that is, is that just lot of free rent burning off? It seems like a big difference if office is 25% of the same circle?", "Robert Probst", "We've talked about this before and given the 100 basis points as a rule of sum, and it is notably a straight line being the big difference, where the straight line rents farther, so we don't see that escalation which we view in the cash number. What's notable here, we want to highlight is the life science business, which is now an important part of the overall same store, has significant straight lining, so, that really is the new news if you like. But, the 100 basis point difference has been really consistent.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, just one last one for me. Going back to, inside the 5.5 debt to EBITDA target by year end, and you have a lot of dispositions and a lot of debt payoffs assumed. But, looks like you still have some capacity to do acquisitions and hit your 5.5 debt of EBITDA target, so, can you maybe just walk us through the leverage mass and let us spell it, if there is actually any buying capacity that you have for acquisitions which are not assuming guidance, and where you can still get to that 5.5 debt EBITDA, thanks?", "Robert Probst", "Certainly in the 5.5 looks like the assumptions we've given you and obviously we the ratio depends on both the EBITDA and the indebtness and that combination gives us 5.5. Clearly there is opportunity for investment, though we had 57 year end 2017. We've always been very comfortable in 5 to 6 and therefore the ability to use the balance sheet to go after acquisition or investment opportunities is clearly there. And the drive power and financial flexibility for us to do so, is an important reason why we are raising the proceeds to be lower. But, the math tells you it's 5.5 as assumed.", "Debra Cafaro", "And, make sure you are counting obviously the funding of our lease East Trophy development project that we are working on that you provide the EBITDA in the later years, but, not in the current one, for they do use capital in the current environment.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks everyone.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.", "Rich Anderson", "Thanks, good morning. So if I could just get back to Brookdale for a moment and I think you know, trusting you to handle it and you know you have good track record in handling difficult situations. I'm curious, when you have 650 million of asset sales, inclusive of the joint venture, so some sub side of that, plus 2019 expirations in your triple net portfolio coming. To what degree is the 2018 plan on Brookdale asset sales addressing leases, or already they are coming to a 19 a combination of both you have. Do you have weaning towards one way or the other to address the Brookdale situation?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, thanks for the question and the confidence. Again, I think we are very comfortable with where we are right now. We have good assets, we have good agreements, we have good experience to come up with optimal outcomes for our Ventas shareholders and our tenement operating partners and we continue to use that tool kit really with everyone to make sure that we are coming up with these optimal outcomes that can create positive results for the tenants and also protecting base interest of our Ventas shareholders.", "Rich Anderson", "So, but doing it before '19 probably makes sense, is that a fair statement?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, it's not a science, and so that's the experience part where really there are optimal ways and times to take actions and you know our job is to advance and protect the interest of the shareholders while obviously, we have an interest in Brookdale's continued success as well. So, we are on it.", "Rich Anderson", "Fair enough, okay. I got you. And the last question is, you're paying down debt strategy is reminiscent of three great recession time period when you were pretty early to kind of hunker down on your balance sheet. I also think and we also think that this sector needs some price discovery to create maybe some type of care house, may be you get that with your ESL joint venture to some degree. But, perhaps some other combinations, to what degree are you kind of reinforcing your balance sheet with an eye towards some of the major dislocation of stock price performance in your group today? Do you think, may be not you, but do you think M&A in some form of fashion is a necessary component to the ultimate long term success of the healthcare REITs?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yeah, that's a big question and I'm going to take on a part of it. But, you know, yes you were right about price discovery, I think that we had said and in turn and have proven out in many respects the very keen institutional interest in our asset types in our operators and part again that's because of the demographic demand in the business. But, we are in this changing price environment that relates to a whole health factors including changing rate environment. So, we are pleased with kind of how we've positioned the company so far, we like the idea that we have a 1.5 billion coming in the door expected in 2015, to enhance that right factor and financial strength and flexibility. And, what I want to share is that we wouldn't tend to use those resources in the best way we can to create value for our shareholders. And, it's probably too early to say what those best moves are, but the key thing is to be in the position to have a lot of options and a lot of firepower, and that's where we are. And, that's we are happy about.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, sounds great, thanks Debby.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.", "Michael Knott", "Hi everyone. Just one question as you think about the construction of the portfolio, when you compare and contrast the SHOP guidance rate for '18 versus the continued stability and strength of the triple net portfolio. Does it make it all re-think, what's the right size of the SHOP portfolio within the overall Ventas asset base?", "Debra Cafaro", "Right great question. I mean we have always prided ourselves on being extremely disciplined about portfolio diversification, which we look at in terms of asset type, business moral and operator, among other things. And, I think we have capped to that discipline and investors I think sometimes want us to go more forward one way or another. But, we think our portfolio construction has been very deliberate and I think our mix is actually quite good. Obviously, we have our out of fiscal nursing business, which is I would argue the most significantly challenged as a class in our business. We think the senior housing as I said - we have a high quality SHOP portfolio, that's about 29% of our NOI. And, that is a good percentage I would say as you get benefits, but you clearly go through some sick locality as we work our way through this supply demand finding miss-match. And, then you have the great office and triple net portfolio, about two ferrets of the company right now. And that office portfolio is growing and it's lower kind of wage type business. And, at the end of the day this portfolio construction is really an important priority for us and it is served our shareholders well overtime. And, we believe it's continuing to do so.", "Michael Knott", "Okay, and then just on the, your response to the question a second ago about having the optimal firepower to take advantage of future opportunities perhaps. Just wanted to ask about the 5.5 times, that EBITDA is that the right leverage level, is that what you are thinking sort of the lowest that you will get to. And also, it sounded like the recent moves in the equity market did sort of pause you to become a bit more conservative and the capital allocation philosophy and view the balance sheet if I understand [indiscernible] but you certainly sound that part of that is getting the team like you are pretty conservative in 2017 on the capital allocation front? Thanks.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good, right I mean I think you are reading it. We have as I said, we have anticipated in peers for current market and business conditions. We forget about where we are, we continue to evaluate balance sheet and capital allocation and gain portfolio diversification but follow the principles that are long standing ones that we followed for a long time, which is basically five to six times on the balance sheet and kind of strict rules around our portfolio mix. And so, '18 is exactly as you say a continuation of that, and I think the value of that approach is manifest.", "Michael Knott", "Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Michael.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "John Kim", "Thanks good morning. You've mentioned in your prepared remarks that you think flu may have a 200 basis points impact to your SHOP occupancy this year along with new supply. Do you think this is emblematic of the industry and do you think that the triple net tenants are also forecasting this piece of the coin?", "Robert Probst", "Just to clarify John, there are two key drivers on the guidance on occupancy, one is flu, the second is the supply impact. Those together are driving we estimate 200 basis points of occupancy decline year-on-year. So, it's the key note of impact as opposed to an individual impact within that. Clearly within the industry data if you look at it, occupancy pressures throughout the industry, you see that in neck, no difference. I think what you need to SHOP portfolio has been the pricing power in ways we've been achieving and that's what I said is really fueling the bottom-line, but occupancy seems to be in line within these interns.", "John Kim", "Your [indiscernible] declined a little bit sequentially and I'm just wondering if the industry is more aggressive on buying ultimately and lowering rates, if you are going to be positive?", "Robert Probst", "You right to say, we did see some erosion in the fourth quarter and indeed as we think about the guidance for '18, I mentioned for the year overall was 4% roughly in '17, we are expecting 3% in '18 on the annual growth. The driver of that is I've got the releasing spread it is, in select markets where there is new competition, we are expecting pressure, and that's what drives that differential.", "John Kim", "And then, second question is on how to leverage, I think it's been a couple of quarters since you know that you were transitioning from MOB business and I'm wondering if you have an update replacement?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, he is sitting here with a big smile and that's a good question. So we continue our MOB CEO search and expect to be successful at it and Todd is at the helm and performing all his duties and we expect to have a successful transition of those duties in the course of the beginning of this year.", "John Kim", "Do you think the person will have public MOB background?", "Debra Cafaro", "Great question, I think we are looking at a wonderful slate of very attractive candidate with varied backgrounds. We have prioritized someone who is expert in the healthcare business and has all of Todd's other good qualities and so we will be happy to share more as the search concludes.", "John Kim", "Alright thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Jordan Sadler", "Good morning. I just wanted to clarify on the Ardent repayment, you mentioned the East Texas Medical, would you have interest in participating there, is there an opportunity for Ventas?", "Debra Cafaro", "I do want to talk about that. So, when we acquired an interest in Ardent West EGI several years ago, clearly cheated up as a really outstanding hospital operator, great assets, great market share and poised to be a consolidator. And, that is definitely happening as we jute up on the board, there's recent opportunity for Ardent to acquire East Texas Medical Centre West University at Texas. This term is a really exciting one and highlights Ardent stability to be a consolidator. I would say that overtime we certainly may have an opportunity to partner on the real estate. The current plan is to acquire the assets and integrate them and we are very supportive of that. Ardent will be more than double the size of when we first started, and be very, very successful.", "And so we are well positioned overtime to, as we talked about with the LHP asset our recent acquisition and [indiscernible] and then the East Texas Medical, real estate, to become an owner there have. It's a process, yes, particularly with the fact that many of these hospitals have really valuable academic medical center and not so profit system, partnerships and relationships. And so, that is wonderful for the performance of the asset, it's wonderful for market share and pricing and for Ardent it is a process. So, over time as we saw with some of the assets we originally acquired to transition those into successful real estate ownership.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay and then in terms of your Ventas, you're going on 20 years of, I don't mean to point it out, but, you've got a pretty compelling run here and I'm not asking you about your planning for the future and a way in terms of your tenure. But, I'm curious you watched the ten year goal from probably close to 6% when you started lows in the 1% range and it seems as if the tenure has bottomed potentially and I know the market is quite worth a number of times here. But, it looks like it's heading higher, I see you selling assets here and I'm curious as you look may be, a few years out with a potential for higher rates, how should Ventas be positioned, balance sheet and asset wise? What makes the most sense to you right now?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well I think we are very well positioned right now and what continually gets me excited about coming to work every day is the team that's here. The tremendous company that we've built and while we have done so much over those 20 years as you know, 20 years of 23%, 24% compound annual return, 20 years of growth from a couple of hundred million and equity GAAP. 20 years from 100% Kindred to 6% Kindred, what's exciting is there is so much more to do. Our sector I believe is still in the early stages of a private and public transition. I think it is still under owned in public end, and we continue to see tremendous opportunities in the space and are excited about the demographic demand that we have in our space, that isn't shared by many other real estate spaces and some of the very exciting opportunities that we see ahead.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay, thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you, Jordan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Chad Vanacore from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Chad Vanacore", "Hey good morning everyone. So just thinking of the Ardent transaction rate including $59 delivery payment, in kempt timing on that? Is that sort of midyear or what you are expecting that?", "Robert Probst", "Midyear is a good assumption, yes.", "Chad Vanacore", "Okay and then just on that my backed example of math would suggest that, the transactions and dispositions that you've laid out will get you probably down to leverage in the low 5s because you are saying is yearend we should expect mid 5. In that leverage assumption are there acquisitions and recycling of assets that's assumed in there?", "Robert Probst", "No again, we are at 5-5 with those assumptions. A couple of things to know, the 1.5 billion is at a 8% blended yield on average, right being used to pay down debt in the range of 4%, 4.5% and we are also at the same time investing $425 million in development and redevelopment spending which is not yielding immediate NOI, that's future investment for future growth. So at the end of all that, it's 5 more times.", "Chad Vanacore", "Okay, got it and then just thinking about the Brookdale portfolio. Could you give us an idea what coverage is today and can we assume that operating results on that portfolio actually more trend to what you've laid out on your SHOP portfolio? And then if it's not then what's different?", "Debra Cafaro", "Okay so, as we've said in the past in terms of our triple-net coverage's, Brookdale's very consistent with the coverage's that we have in the entire portfolio. And in terms of specific trend in that business as we always are careful to do with our public operating partners would encourage you to talk to them about their specific operating results. But, within our portfolio, very consistent with the triple net senior housing reported coverage's.", "Chad Vanacore", "Alright, then just one last one for me, when you are thinking about this JV in the [indiscernible] portfolio, can you give us an idea of why the strategic partnership with the new capital partner there?", "Debra Cafaro", "Yes, I mean we think there are lots of strategic and financial benefits to doing it, we like to diversify our capital forces. We think it would be great to have a recognized global institutional partner there and we are - we believe there's upside in the portfolio, that is valuable and that it's a great opportunity for us to continue to recycle capital and continue building out for example our trophy life science portfolio and ramp up the development pipeline and fund activities like that. So we think it's an excellent opportunity all the way round.", "Chad Vanacore", "Alright, thanks for taking the questions.", "Debra Cafaro", "My pleasure.", "Operator", "Thank you. The question comes from Paul Puryear from Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, this is actually Jonathan, he's on - but good morning thanks for the time. So going back to the LHP Ardent loan, why are they prepaying and how do they plan to fund. It seems to me they wouldn't be able to get cheaper debt in the current environment relative to your guess. So I'm just trying to understand why the prepaying and where that money will come from.", "Debra Cafaro", "Because Ardent has done well and because it acquired LHP, it acquired another asset and is on track as we've mentioned to acquire East Texas Medical Center. I think in general the idea would be to refinance a more streamlined capital structure for the entire company and it really is a mark of the company's success that we believe it will be able to do so. And that's our expectation and that they will use those proceeds to repay our loan and we would redeploy the proceeds as discussed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, fair enough. And then one more, I know you put out a press release following the Kindred news in December supporting the deal, but they put out a slide deck this month that doesn't suggest any slowdown in the headwinds facing the post-acute space. Do you see any risk from Kindred now being owned by private equity in terms of them being more aggressive and looking at cost savings, potentially including rent payments?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, that's a really interesting one because as I said I - as we look across the landscape here, whether it's Florida that's getting new equity funding from ETI to continued its stand or Atria, who's getting equity capital, I would say Kindred is in the same situation. We think it's a real positive that experienced healthcare investors like TPG and Welsh, Carson are putting fresh equity and a significant amount of it into the LTAC and IRF and rehab business with Kindred our leading operator and there will be a substantially, frankly de-levered balance sheet in that situation and as I mentioned we think that the LTAC particularly with its recent news out of Washington on the extended spell would in fact have positive operating trajectory in 2018. So we think the partnership with Kindred and the new private equity firms can create opportunities for us. We have done business with Welsh, Carson before and we really look forward to continuing to work with them and hope there will be opportunities for us together to do more.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, that's great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our question comes from Daniel Bornstein from Capital One. Your line is open.", "Daniel Bornstein", "Good morning.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning, Dan.", "Daniel Bornstein", "Hi, are there other opportunities to joint venture and say other asset classes for hospice senior housing for you such as medical office or life science? I haven't really heard you talk about that, but there seems like there should be opportunities there as well?", "Debra Cafaro", "Absolutely, I'm glad that you pointed that out. Again, we have a valuable diversified portfolio. We have with Todd, scaled MOB business and in doing so created billions of dollars of value. Assets have grown seven times since we first came together, obviously a very attractive asset class to institutional capital and we're doing the same thing with the University based life science, that is investing early with the winning platform, putting capital behind it and creating value and overtime it's a great option to have and certainly there's great interest in out high quality office portfolio from institutional capital for possible joint ventures.", "Daniel Bornstein", "Okay and then in regards to the de-risking, de-leveraging of the business, I think that's the right strategy at this point and commend you on that. At the same time you're trading at about 10% discount to net asset value. What was there - was there a soft process in terms of buybacks versus de-risking, it almost implies that you think there's going to be very good opportunities going forward on the acquisition side at some point, if you don't buyback your stock at this point.", "Debra Cafaro", "Great, another great question again. We think about - what we're doing is we are harvesting process and proceeds from successful investments, our immediate gear marking is for those proceeds to de-lever and improve financial strength, which gives us additional dry powder and then as the environment clarifies, obviously we believe that we will be really sound capital allocators and whether and how we would chose to use that dry powder. And there is many, many ways for us to that and you've sited some of them and we would expect to allocate that dry powder if at all to value creating investments which can include a wide range of possibilities including our own equity.", "Daniel Bornstein", "Okay, okay. I know it's already late in the call, but just one quick question on the timing - how you think about the occupancy loss and the minus 1 to minus 4 NOI? Do you think that the operational business is going to get better in the second half of '18 versus one half, I know there's normal seasonality, but how are you thinking about the kind of the trophy in senior housing at this point?", "Debra Cafaro", "Well, we appreciate the questions and we want to make sure to give everyone their due time today, so I'm going to ask Bob to address that last one.", "Robert Probst", "We really expect the quarters to look quite similar year-on-year. We don't see a wild variation, I mentioned the flu impact and how that tends to continue kind of drop down occupancy and carry forward through the year, so that will therefore affect all the quarters, but beyond that I don't see anything that's driving any unique changes quarter-to-quarter beyond normal seasonality.", "Daniel Bornstein", "Okay, I appreciate. Thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our question comes from Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Todd Stender", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for staying on.", "Debra Cafaro", "Good morning.", "Todd Stender", "Back to the Canadian discussion, it's a market - it remains a bright spot for you guys in senior housing, but when you look at the price point of Canadian rents versus US rents even in your lowest bucket. Is affordability part of the key, I mean is that something that's going to support occupancy and is there an opportunity here in the US to play in that lower segment something in the 3 maybe $3,500 a month range?", "Robert Probst", "Yeah, I'll comment on the Canadian pricing first, which is - it's more of an IO market for us than the overall portfolio, so on a relative basis, it looks lower but it's really based on the equity. And we believe we have placed strong pricing power by the way in Canada. I mentioned that is what gives us confidence in 2018 and continue to grow the bottom line in Canada on that price and we are at plus 90% occupancy there, so that gives us the opportunity to so do.", "Todd Stender", "Great, thank you.", "Debra Cafaro", "Thank you. Okay, so I'm glad that you all joined in this morning and want to say, how much we all sincerely appreciate your time, your interest in our call and our comments and in your interest in support of our company.
