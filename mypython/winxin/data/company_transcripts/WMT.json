(NYSE:WMT) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call May 18, 2017  7:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Steve Schmitt - VP, Investor Relations", "Doug McMillon - President and CEO", "Brett Biggs - EVP and CFO", "Analysts", "Steve Schmitt", "Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Walmart\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results. This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is May 18, 2017.", "On today's call, you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO and Brett Biggs, CFO.", "This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking information provided by that Act. A cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements is at the end of this call.", "As a reminder, our earnings materials include the press release, transcript and accompanying slide presentation, which are intended to be used together. All of this information, along with our fiscal 2018 earnings release dates, store counts, square footage, interactive earnings site and other materials are available on the Investors\u2019 portion of our corporate Web site stock.walmart.com. For our U.S. comp sales reporting in fiscal 2018, we utilize a 52-week calendar. Our Q1 reporting period ran from Saturday, January 28, 2017 through Friday, April 28, 2017.", "Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you of a few upcoming dates. Our Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting will be held Friday, June 2 on the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville. This meeting starts at 8 A.M. Central Time and is also available for viewing via webcast through our Web site, stock.walmart.com or via Walmart\u2019s Investor Relations app. We will release second quarter earnings on Thursday, August 17. Also, please save the date for our Investment Community Meeting, which will be held in Northwest Arkansas on October 9 and 10.", "Now, I'd like to turn it over to Walmart\u2019s CEO, Doug McMillon.", "Doug McMillon", "Good morning, everyone. As you may have seen this morning, we delivered a solid first quarter and we\u2019re encouraged with our start to the year. From my view, I\u2019d say that Walmart U.S. highlights were the 1.5% growth in comp traffic, comp store inventory being down over 7%, improved expense performance in our stores versus last year and the acceleration of e-commerce GMV growth to 69%.There were some other highlights outside the Walmart U.S. business that we\u2019ll touch on later.", "Inside the Company, we can see that we\u2019re moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers, but we can also see plenty of room to improve. We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we\u2019re capable of, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.", "I\u2019m really encouraged by how our store and club associates are embracing change. We\u2019re creating new solutions to help us run the business better in addition to creating a better experience for the customer in stores and online.", "Let me give you a few examples. A few weeks ago while visiting stores in Oklahoma City I saw first-hand how the combination of some new in-store apps and mobile handhelds are improving our in-store processes and making life easier for associates. A grocery department manager in one store showed us how she now ensures side counter modular accuracy and in-stock with a new app we\u2019ve developed for our mobile handhelds. With this new app, the time to complete her work has now been reduced, improving her productivity and giving her more time to interact with customers. I saw it again last week in Omaha, Nebraska.", "I saw another example in Canada in April. There, we\u2019ve an improved process at store level that is reducing inventory levels in the back room in a meaningful way. Our team is building better tools, our associates are embracing them and the results are improving. This is important because our key to winning starts with how we work inside the Company. We\u2019re transforming to become more of a digital enterprise. The change is starting to be visible to our customers as they use online grocery, Walmart Pay, Scan & Go at Sam\u2019s Club and our Walmart app to skip the line when using our pharmacies and financial services in our U.S. stores. Online grocery also continues to perform well and we\u2019re on track to scale the offering to more stores this year in several countries, including the U.S. We\u2019re taking steps to save customers time as well as money.", "Brett\u2019s going to take you through the financials, but before he does, I\u2019ll talk briefly about each area. Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. Comp store sales grew 1.4% and comp store traffic improved 1.5%. We got off to a slower start than expected, due in part to delayed federal tax refund checks, but saw sales strengthen throughout the quarter.", "We also continued to manage the business well from an inventory and availability standpoint. I recently attended the grand opening of our 100th training academy in Edmond, Oklahoma. I met associates there who were new to Walmart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools.", "I\u2019m proud that we have lifelong learners at Walmart and I\u2019m excited about the training we\u2019re providing. We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academies this year. Remember, 75% of our Walmart U.S. store management teams started as hourly associates, so it\u2019s critical we provide effective training for our associates as they take on more responsibility in our Company.", "Overall, the store business is getting stronger and I\u2019m thankful to Greg Foran and the team for a thoughtful plan and the energy they\u2019re investing to lead the improvement. Greg, Marc Lore and the team continue to partner closely to serve our customers and figure out how to invent a seamless shopping experience for customers across our apps, sites and stores. They are plowing new territory and I\u2019m excited about what\u2019s to come.", "In U.S. e-commerce, we like the traction and we\u2019re working hard to make even more improvements. Walmart.com launched two new initiatives in the quarter. First, we made the change to shipping terms at the beginning of the quarter. Customers don\u2019t have to pay a membership fee to get two-day shipping on millions of items.", "Second, we recently began offering customers pick-up discounts on non-store items. Our stores are located within 10 miles of nearly 90% of the U.S. population, so this is convenient for many of our customers, and also saves them money when they order online and pick it up during their visit to our stores. Walmart.com now has 50 million first and third-party items to choose from compared to 10 million at this time last year, so our assortment continues to ramp.", "We also made a few small, but strategic e-commerce acquisitions to further improve our assortment, while gaining critical category expertise in higher margin categories like shoes and apparel. The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. So overall, we\u2019re making progress in providing the seamless shopping experience our customer\u2019s desire and we will keep moving along this journey.", "Staying in the U.S., let\u2019s talk about Sam\u2019s Club. John Furner and team have hit the ground running. They\u2019re focused on members, merchandise and our associates. They achieved comp sales growth of 1.6% in the quarter led by 1.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased 21%.", "I\u2019m excited about how we\u2019re ramping up our private brand offering with improved quality and compelling new items. We\u2019ve streamlined 20 private brands into one and will be introducing 300 new items this year that are branded Member\u2019s Mark. The team at Sam\u2019s Club is also taking important steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members.", "Outside the U.S., Dave Cheesewright and the team continued to deliver solid results. Overall, constant-currency sales growth of less than 1% was negatively impacted by a couple of timing and divestiture related issues that Brett will discuss, but our underlying business continues to perform well.", "At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was nearly 4% this year and 12% on a two-year stack. In April, I visited our businesses in China and Japan. China continues to be on fast-forward as it relates to all things digital including e-commerce. Operationally, our stores continue to improve and Sam\u2019s Clubs are doing well.", "Working with JD.com and New Dada, China\u2019s largest local on-demand logistics and grocery O \u2013 to \u2013 O, short for online to offline, delivery platform, we now offer one-hour delivery service from 80 stores. This is an improvement from the two-hour service we launched last year. We can see the benefits of omni-channel retail even more clearly in China than any other country where we operate.", "Given the urban density and automobile traffic challenges, stores serve the triple purpose of in-store shopping, pickup and delivery most effectively. I saw some similarities in Japan where stores are serving more than one purpose. In both markets, we\u2019re piloting the use of stores as shipping locations and we\u2019re learning what works best from a financial point of view in different types of store trade areas given how customer densities and travel distance can vary.", "Moving on to Canada, our business continues to perform well, delivering 12 consecutive quarters of positive comp sales. We\u2019ve made some progress in the U.K. and the team is executing their plan. We are navigating our way back to a position of strength in that highly competitive market. When normalizing comp sales for the later Easter and Leap Day, we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket.", "For the overall segment, International had another solid, predictable quarter. The team has done a nice job of growing profit faster than sales as they simultaneously shift our positioning in terms of store formats, on line grocery and e-commerce.", "In conclusion, we\u2019re encouraged with our start to the year. We have a clear strategy we\u2019re executing against. We\u2019re uniquely positioned to deliver value through both our physical and digital assets. We have momentum across the business. We\u2019re making progress and we know we\u2019re on the right track as we work to become the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders. We look forward to seeing many of you next month at our Annual Shareholders\u2019 meeting here in northwest Arkansas. Thanks for being interested in our business.", "Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Brett.", "Brett Biggs", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As I\u2019ve been saying over the past few quarters, this an exciting time to be at Walmart, and we are delivering solid results. In the U.S., important initiatives are underway both to accelerate growth in e-commerce and drive traffic to our stores. Most of our key international markets continue to perform well, and top-line performance at Sam\u2019s Club remains solid.", "On today\u2019s call I\u2019m going to cover our consolidated results from the first quarter, talk about e-commerce in the U.S. and then provide details on our operating segments. We will discuss the consolidated results in the context of our financial framework of strong, efficient growth, operating discipline, and strategic capital allocation.", "Let\u2019s start with our consolidated results. EPS was $1, which is at the top end of our guidance of $0.90 to $1 and 2% higher than last year. This marks the first quarterly EPS increase in more than two years on an underlying basis. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 2.5% to $118.8 billion as we saw solid top-line performance across the business.", "Walmart U.S. continued its momentum with comps of 1.4%, while Sam\u2019s Club posted comp sales, without fuel, of 1.6%. In Walmart International, 7 of our 11 markets reported positive comps, even as the timing of Easter and last year\u2019s Leap Day negatively impacted results.", "The U.S. e-commerce GMV growth accelerated significantly, up approximately 69%. Through the lens of strong, efficient growth, I\u2019m pleased with the results. Gross profit margin increased 1 basis point during the quarter. The rate for Walmart U.S. was flat, while Walmart International was up slightly.", "In regard to operating discipline, while we didn\u2019t leverage expenses on a consolidated level primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology, I\u2019m pleased that we leveraged in our U.S. stores. We\u2019re making progress towards our objective of slightly leveraging expenses on a consolidated basis for the year.", "We continued to generate strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter, $5.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Cash flow was down year-on-year primarily due to an increase in incentive payments, as well as a comparison against significant working capital improvements last year.", "As we strategically allocate capital, our first priority is to invest in improving and growing the business. In the quarter, we completed remodels of 95 stores globally, and in the U.S. we continued to expand our online grocery service to include nearly 670 locations.", "We also added a limited number of new stores, and made two relatively small acquisitions in the e-commerce space, Moosejaw and ModCloth, to expand our online selection and improve our category expertise in important areas like apparel and outdoor gear. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.", "Before I get to our operating segments, I\u2019ll talk about Walmart U.S. e-commerce. As a reminder, the results include all web-initiated transactions including those through Walmart.com such as ship to home, ship to store, pick up today and online grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.", "Year-over-year growth in GMV was approximately 69%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com. This is extraordinary growth, and we\u2019re pleased with the traction we\u2019re generating across our e-commerce offerings.", "We\u2019ve recently introduced free 2-day shipping with a basket size of $35 or more on select items, and launched a new service called Pickup Discount, where customers can order non-store products online and receive a discount for picking these items up in our stores. This is a service that\u2019s convenient for customers and saves them money.", "Let\u2019s now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. You will recall in our fourth quarter comments that the first quarter started out slower than anticipated from a sales standpoint, due in part to the delayed issuance of federal income tax refund checks.", "As anticipated, our sales strengthened as the quarter progressed, delivering comp sales growth of 1.4%, led by an increase in customer traffic of 1.5%. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. On a two-year stacked basis, comp traffic is up 3%. Average ticket declined slightly primarily due to lower sales of higher ticket items at the beginning of the quarter, as well as continued price investment.", "Additionally, the grocery business continued to improve with food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in more than three years, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food, excluding price investments. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment.", "We were really pleased with our results for the Easter holiday period, as both food and general merchandise performed well. Gross margin rate was flat in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise and the acceleration of post-holiday markdowns taken in the fourth quarter benefited the margin rate, but this was offset by investments in price and the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business.", "Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 14 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn\u2019t leverage expenses for the overall segment, I\u2019m pleased that we leveraged in the stores.", "Operating income increased 0.9%, which is the first increase in more than three years. The team continues to do a fantastic job managing inventory. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 7.3%, while in-stock levels remained high. We\u2019re pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to Walmart International. The International business continues to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered a solid start to the year. As I mentioned earlier, International performance was negatively impacted by one less operating day this year due to Leap Day last year, as well as the later timing of Easter this year.", "Before we get into the results, let me discuss the financial impact, beginning in the first quarter, from strategic decisions we made previously to divest two businesses, Yihaodian in China and Suburbia in Mexico.", "In the second quarter of last year, as part of the announced alliance with JD.com, we divested our e-commerce business in China, Yihaodian, except for the first-party piece of that business. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year we began to wind down the first-party business, with only a small amount of sales remaining at the end of the first quarter of this 10 year. This created a sales headwind versus last year of $385 million in the quarter and we expect a similar impact in each of the next couple of quarters until we lap the unwinding of the business.", "Additionally, last month, Walmex announced it completed the sale of its apparel format, Suburbia. The gain from the sale of this business will be recorded in the second quarter of this year, and as a result, we expect a net benefit to EPS of approximately $0.05 in the quarter.", "Beginning in the second quarter, and continuing throughout the remainder of this year, International\u2019s results will be negatively impacted by the operating profit lost due to the sale of the business. We expect a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.01 for the third and fourth quarters. We also expect a full year impact to sales of approximately $600 million. We\u2019ll continue to detail the impacts of these transactions as we go through the year.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to the overall international results. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 0.8%, and excluding Yihaodian, net sales increased 2.2%. Reported net sales declined 3.5%, impacted by a $1.2 billion currency headwind. From a profitability standpoint, first quarter operating income increased 9% on a constant currency basis and declined 0.1% on a reported basis.", "During the quarter, a benefit to operating income of approximately $47 million from a land sale was recorded in one of our markets. Excluding this item, operating income would have increased 5% on a constant currency basis.", "Let\u2019s now turn to some brief highlights of key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our four major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.", "Let\u2019s begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 5.2% and comp sales growth was 3.7%. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased over 13% on a two-year stacked basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service.", "In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 1.5%. During the quarter, we reduced inventory levels even as sales increased, and according to Nielsen we continued to gain market share in key traffic driving categories like food and consumables & health and wellness. Continued planned investments in price and in-store efficiency initiatives are being supported by progress with our cost analytics program.", "In China, net sales increased 0.7% and comp sales decreased 1.3%. In addition to the impact of one less day in the quarter due to Leap Day last year, sales were impacted by our strategic decision to reduce low margin bulk sales.", "During the quarter, we continued to expand our e-commerce offering by entering new cities through our crowd-sourced delivery partnership with New Dada and now offer one-hour delivery from 80 stores. We also launched new product categories such as produce and frozen items on our Sam\u2019s Club flagship store on the JD.com platform.", "Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 0.9%, while comp sales declined 2.8%. When normalizing for Leap Day last year and a later Easter this year, we continued to see sequential improvement in the underlying business, including customer traffic and ticket. We\u2019re confident we\u2019re on the right track. So, overall, our international strategy continues to produce consistent results, and we are pleased with the solid start to the year.", "Let\u2019s turn to Sam\u2019s Club. At Sam\u2019s Club, comp sales, without fuel, increased 1.6% as traffic grew by 1.1%. We had good results across many of our categories, and comps have been positive for five consecutive quarters. We\u2019re also pleased with our digital growth as Club Pickup increased nearly 30%.", "The team at Sam\u2019s is taking steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. The initiatives underway at Sam\u2019s are designed to grow membership and sales, and we know it all starts with member experience. We\u2019ll deliver for them through our efforts to lead in digital and provide unmatched value on great merchandise. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales, without fuel, to increase between 1% and 1.5%.", "With that, let\u2019s discuss total company EPS guidance. We feel good about the momentum across the business and expect progress to continue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect EPS, excluding the gain from the sale of Suburbia, to be between $1 and $1.08.", "In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the important work you do every day. As a Company, we\u2019re moving with speed and executing against the strategy we\u2019ve outlined, and it\u2019s all happening through the lens of our financial framework. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Shareholders\u2019 meeting in a few weeks.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "This call includes certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the Safe Harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Such forward-looking statements relate to management\u2019s guidance and forecasts as to, and expectations for, Walmart\u2019s earnings per share for the three months ending July 31, 2017, comparable store and club sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club segments, excluding fuel, for the thirteen week period ending July 28, 2017, the net earnings per share benefit of the sale of Suburbia business in the three months ending July 31, 2017, the financial impact of the Suburbia and Yihaodian divestitures in the year ending January 31,2018, levering expenses for the year ending January 31, 2018, the level of future organic growth, and new product offerings at Sam\u2019s Club.

Thanks for joining us today. The date of this call is February 19, 2015.", "This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way. [Operator Instructions] This call will contain statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that act.", "Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call. Before we get under way, we apologize for the delay in this morning\u2019s release. We normally release our earnings at 6:00 AM Central Time, or 7:00 AM Eastern. However, because we wanted to share some exciting news about our U.S. associates with them first, we delayed the release until now. So, this morning, we have several pieces of news to share with you.", "First, we have details on the fourth quarter and the full year results for fiscal year 2015. Second, as we normally do, we provide guidance for the full year and the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Third as I mentioned, we\u2019re announcing a new wage structure for hourly associates in Walmart U.S. stores and Sam\u2019s Clubs.

Traditional Neighborhood Markets are grocery stores that average 42,000 square feet. The smaller Neighborhood Markets, range in size from 12,000 to 16,000 square feet, and are still part of a test concept and not included in comp sales.", "As a reminder, for fiscal 2015 which ended January 31, 2015, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. In Q4 we reported a 13-week comp versus a 14-week comp period reported last year. Our Q4 reporting period began on November 1, 2014 and ran through January 30, 2015. Consistent with industry practice, we did not adjust the reported fiscal 2015 comps. Comps were based upon 13-week and 52-week periods, respectively, compared with 14-week and 53-week periods that we reported in fiscal 2014.", "We posted a week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the investors\u2019 portion of our website. Now recall that last fiscal year\u2019s earnings per share were impacted by $0.26 of discrete items. This year, as you\u2019ll note in our earnings release and on this call, earnings per share were also impacted also by $0.08 of discrete item. Additional information regarding underlying EPS and other terms used in today\u2019s release including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, are available on our website.", "Let\u2019s get on with today\u2019s call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover key results, an analysis of our successes and challenges, and the news about our wage structure changes and training programs. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will provide context for the financial details not included in the accompanying slide presentation. Then we\u2019ll cover the three operating segments, Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club; Neil Ashe, president and CEO of Global eCommerce, is joining the call this quarter to provide an analysis of how we did for the year, along with insights on our strategic investments for fiscal year 2016; and, Charles Holley, Walmart CFO, will wrap up with an analysis of fiscal year 2015 and guidance for fiscal year 2016.", "Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to share some exciting news with you today. Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks Carol, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Walmart U.S. delivered better than expected comp sales. Sam\u2019s Club had its best performance of the year, and Walmart International had solid sales and profitability. The dedication of our associates around the world to serve customers was evident again in this busy fourth quarter.", "Now clearly, our sales benefitted from customers having more spending power due to lower gas prices in most of our large markets. In addition, product inflation and more favorable weather were a tailwind to U.S. comp sales. But, like many other global companies, we faced significant headwinds from currency exchange fluctuations. So, I\u2019m pleased that we delivered fiscal year revenue of nearly $486 billion, but we\u2019re not satisfied.", "We have work to do to grow the business. We know what customers want from a shopping experience and we\u2019re investing strategically to exceed their expectations. Our priority is to run great stores, clubs and e-commerce everywhere we operate. And we\u2019ll continue integrating our stores with our e-commerce and mobile commerce business.", "One of our most important priorities this year is improving the customer experience. Today, we announced a bold new initiative on pay and training to invest in our U.S. store and club hourly associates. For several months, our leadership teams have been developing and testing new ideas to reward associates for their service to our customers and give them clearer pathways for opportunity. We\u2019re pursuing a comprehensive approach to our hiring, training, compensation, scheduling programs and store management structure that is sustainable over the long term.", "Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam\u2019s Clubs will receive pay raises in the first half of the current fiscal year. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today\u2019s federal minimum wage, or $9 per hour, in April.", "The following year, by February 1, 2016, current associates will earn at least $10 per hour. We\u2019re also realigning our store operational structure to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors. Associates will have more ownership over their schedules. In addition, we\u2019ll provide them with more resources and training to enable merit-based career advancement and higher levels of pay.", "Of course, for a number of years, associates have had the opportunity for competitive health-care and 401(k) benefits, as well as access to bonus incentive opportunities, discounts, and educational programs. These programs will continue to be available to current and future associates.", "We\u2019re also launching an innovative program for future associates that will allow them to join Walmart at $9 per hour or more, receive skills-based training for six months, and then be guaranteed at least $10 per hour upon successful completion of that program. Sam Walton used to say that, our people make the difference. I share the same philosophy. Overall, these are strategic investments in our people to reignite the sense of ownership they have in our stores.", "As a result, we firmly believe that our customers will benefit from a better store experience, which can drive higher sales and returns for our shareholders over time. Walmart has represented a ladder of opportunity since we started the business and we want to make sure that\u2019s the case going forward everywhere we operate, including here in the United States. Globally, we have ongoing efforts in place to review our associates\u2019 compensation on a yearly basis in each of our markets.", "For example, in China, we recently launched the compensation structure for stores and clubs; and in this year, we are launching a new compensation structure for our distribution center associates to improve the overall competitiveness of our practices. Later this year, Walmart Mexico will launch training programs to give the associates more ownership and accountability, so they can react faster to customers\u2019 needs.", "Included in today\u2019s announcement, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation also committed to $100 million over five years to help increase the economic mobility for entry level workers by focusing on initiatives to better train and advance workers in the retail and other service industries throughout the United States.", "As we look at our business through the lens of the customer, our enterprise strategy is helping us define where our additional investments are focused. While we\u2019re concentrating on running a good business today, we\u2019re also clear on how we should position it for the future. Value matters to everyone, regardless of household income level, and digital access creates even more price transparency. Being the low price leader has been a part of our customer proposition and it will continue to be a priority in the future.", "We\u2019re also evaluating our assortment and our approach to service, both in stores and online, to be relevant for today\u2019s customer. And, we\u2019re testing various access points to provide convenience and allow customers to shop on their terms. This past quarter, we initiated a number of work streams that will deliver on these key initiatives. I\u2019m excited about what we\u2019ll accomplish over this next year as we drive our enterprise strategy.", "Now, let\u2019s review Walmart\u2019s financial results in more detail. Walmart U.S. improved its sales and operating income trends each consecutive quarter during fiscal 2015. Fourth quarter comp sales were the strongest in more than two years, with positive traffic for the first time in nine quarters. Our Neighborhood Markets have continued to deliver strong comps. Our emphasis remains on the quality of the stores that we open, not the quantity.", "I\u2019m pleased with the strategy that Greg and his team are executing to raise the standard of customer experience in the U.S. business. They\u2019re taking steps to enhance store operations on various fronts, including inventory management, check-out, and in-stock. For the holidays, Walmart U.S. implemented a Checkout Promise to keep more registers open during peak periods, and customer response has been positive enough that this has continued into the first quarter.", "I\u2019m encouraged by the focus of the leadership team, and I look forward to seeing more progress in our stores this year toward a better experience for our customers.", "Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales and operating income growth this year. Dave and his team have done a good job weathering a tough macro environment. Canada\u2019s sales gained momentum in the back half. In China, we made progress in store operations and in e-commerce. We continue to earn customers\u2019 trust with our commitments to food safety. There\u2019s so much potential for this market and we\u2019re taking the right steps to solidify a foundation for long-term growth.", "The UK market remains very competitive, and Asda is committed to its \u00a35 billion five-year investment to lower prices for customers. We\u2019re making progress in Mexico. There\u2019s still work to do in Brazil.", "Sam\u2019s Club had a solid year, with membership income up over 10%. Comp sales, without fuel, continued to improve throughout the year. And, operating income, with fuel, grew at a greater rate than sales. Roz and the team made good progress on the ongoing merchandise transformation, embedding new, on-trend and exciting merchandise into the clubs and online. Members are responding by driving sales in these categories.", "Members are also pleased with the new, innovative services that were launched this year to increase the value of a Sam\u2019s Club membership. You\u2019ll hear more from Neil shortly about the strides that we\u2019re making in our e-commerce customer experience, assortment, and supply chain. We\u2019re leveraging technology to strengthen our e-commerce and mobile capabilities, and integrating these digital assets with our more than 11,000 stores globally.", "Overall e-commerce sales grew approximately 22% in fiscal year 2015; solid, but not quite as strong as we wanted. We\u2019re striving to balance sales growth and profitability. We\u2019re being thoughtful with our investments, ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to build this business for the long term. I\u2019m excited about the possibilities that are in front of us.", "One of the headlines in e-commerce is the tremendous growth from mobile devices. In fact, nearly 70% of walmart.com traffic in the U.S. came via mobile during the recent holiday period. Customers who previously shopped using their laptops are now using their phones and tablets. And this isn\u2019t just a U.S. trend, for example, traffic from the mobile app in Brazil nearly tripled on the Black Friday holiday. Around the world, we\u2019re well-positioned to create a strong mobile experience for customers this year and beyond.", "As I reflect back on my first year as CEO, I\u2019m proud of the accomplishments of our associates and leadership team. It\u2019s been a period of change for the 2.2 million associates that make up the Walmart team, but it\u2019s been inspiring to see our associates rally around our company\u2019s purpose. Last week, more than 5,000 members of our U.S. store leadership gathered for our annual year beginning meeting. I heard directly from our store managers how we could help them run better stores. And, similar meetings are occurring around the world.", "Regardless of our responsibility, we\u2019re in this together. Each of us has a role to play in making our customers\u2019 shopping experience a great one. Our secret to success continues to be that we\u2019re all working together. We made a lot of progress on bringing strategic clarity and in reinvigorating our commitment to run better businesses today. Retail is changing so quickly that we must move with greater urgency to stay out in front. I like the passion that I\u2019m seeing from our leadership team as they work together to shape and deliver our enterprise strategy.", "We\u2019re thinking differently about retail, and about the world. This drives our approach to global responsibility in areas like environmental sustainability, women\u2019s economic empowerment and offering healthy food choices. It\u2019s important work and it matters to our customers and shareholders. We remain steadfast in our commitment to compliance, ethics and doing the right thing.", "I\u2019m pleased with the technology enhancements we\u2019ve made to strengthen these organizations. As I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I\u2019m proud of what we accomplished this past year, but I\u2019m more excited about what lies ahead. The deliberate strategic choices that we\u2019re making around investments in our associates and e-commerce capabilities will improve the customer experience. And, we believe that shareholders will also benefit from these investments in the future. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire. Claire?", "Claire Babineaux-Fontenot", "Thanks, Doug. Today, I\u2019ll highlight some items in the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. Before I begin, let me remind you that last year, the company\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart EPS were negatively impacted by certain discrete items totaling $0.26.", "The company\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 EPS were negatively impacted by discrete items totaling $0.08. A wage and hour litigation matter previously disclosed resulted in a charge of $0.05 per share, and store closures in Japan resulted in a charge of $0.03 per share. A reconciliation of company\u2019s underlying EPS is included in our earnings press release issued prior to the call. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, underlying EPS was $1.61, compared to last year\u2019s underlying EPS of $1.60. Reported EPS was $1.53, compared to last year\u2019s EPS of $1.34.", "As you can see on Slide 2, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $131.6 billion. Consolidated net sales increased $1.9 billion or 1.4%, and membership and other income declined 0.5%. Recall that during the fourth quarter of last year, membership and other income was positively impacted by a $24 million gain from the sale of certain U.S. real estate assets.", "Total revenue for the year grew to $485.7 billion, as consolidated net sales increased $9.2 billion, or 1.9%, and membership and other income grew 6.3%. Consolidated operating expenses increased 0.5% for the quarter, and 2.3% for the full year. It is important to remember that operating expenses were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and for the full year by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Additionally, FCPA and compliance related costs were $36 million in the fourth quarter, comprised of $26 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $10 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.", "For the full year, FCPA and compliance related costs were $173 million, comprised of $121 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $52 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, total FCPA and compliance related costs were $282 million.", "The company\u2019s consolidated operating income increased 8.2% during the fourth quarter. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Fiscal year 2015 operating income increased 1%. Net interest expense increased 5.8% for the quarter and 6% for the year. The increase for each period was primarily driven by a higher weighted average interest rate on net borrowings.", "From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 0.6%. Later in today\u2019s call, you\u2019ll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 85.1%, which compares to 83.4% last year, due primarily to the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important and we are seeing progress as the company continues to focus on this priority.", "We ended the year with capital expenditures of $12.2 billion, slightly below our range of $12.5 billion to $13 billion. For the year, the company added approximately 33 million retail square feet through 511 net new expanded and relocated units. This was in line with the updated guidance we shared in October.", "Finally, let\u2019s address returns. ROI for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2015 was 16.9%, relatively flat compared to 17% for the prior comparable period. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations. For the full year, the company returned $7.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And, we ended the year with free cash flow of $16.4 billion, compared to $10.1 billion last year.", "Now, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg?", "Greg Foran", "Thank you, Claire. When I joined the Walmart U.S. team six months ago, we laid out specific objectives for the second half of fiscal 2015. We knew we needed to become better store managers, to fix some of the basics in our stores.", "We spent the last several months focusing on core fundamentals such as inventory, merchandise returns, shrink, markdowns and wage management. By focusing on these urgent agenda items and using the tailwinds we\u2019ve seen from an improving economy, we drove positive momentum in our business. We achieved what we set out to do in the short-term, but we\u2019re not satisfied and recognize that we have more work to do to accomplish our longer term goals.", "Before discussing our results, I want to provide more detail on the exciting announcement we made this morning regarding associate pay and store structure.", "As Doug mentioned, we believe our people make the difference and we\u2019re committed to this philosophy. At Walmart, we already provide an opportunity for jobs to become careers in retail. We want to continue to improve that opportunity and to provide it to more associates. The changes we are making are based on our core principles and will make Walmart a better place to work and shop.", "First, we believe associates equally value their hourly rate and hours worked. We\u2019re happy to announce improvements to both aspects of associates\u2019 earnings opportunity. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today\u2019s federal minimum wage or $9 per hour in April. And current associates will earn $10 per hour or higher by next February.", "Additionally, we are piloting a scheduling system that will create stability for associates who want predictable hours and the flexibility for those who prefer to select additional shifts to meet customers\u2019 needs each week. Starting in 2016, we will be one of the first retailers to offer some associates fixed hours each week.", "Next, we are realigning our store operational structure, adding back department managers to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors to help improve communication, direction and recognition. And finally, we are making new commitments to train associates. They will engage in interactive learning programs to build skills, demonstrate proficiency and be rewarded for their efforts through pay raises and promotions into areas of greater responsibility. We will also offer opportunities to pursue further education, including a high school diploma or GED program, access to language training, and free or low cost college credits to reduce the time and cost of a college education.", "I want to say thank you to all our 1.2 million Walmart U.S. associates. Together, we\u2019re a part of something bigger than ourselves and bigger than our company. What we do at Walmart extends beyond our stores to our own communities and across this country. I\u2019m thankful to be a part of this organization.", "Now, let\u2019s move to this quarter\u2019s performance. Net sales grew $3.1 billion or 4.1% versus last year. For the 13-week period ended January 30, comparable store sales were up 1.5%, which exceeded our guidance. This represents an approximate 100 basis point improvement over Q3 and was largely driven by a 1.4% improvement in traffic. This quarter marks the first positive traffic comp since Q3 of fiscal year 2013, as customers saw increased purchasing power from lower gas prices.", "We also lapped the SNAP reductions and unfavorable weather seen last year. E-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp performance. During the six week holiday season, we experienced overall comp sales growth. We saw increased traffic to the store, aided by our broadcast and digital Holiday Hub marketing campaign. Strong sales of seasonal merchandise and toys, along with key brands and gifts in apparel and home, offset industry declines in entertainment.", "Customers also continued to refine how they prepared for the holidays, shopping earlier in November for holiday deals, and looking for last-minute gift ideas all the way through Christmas Eve. We were ready when and where our customers needed us, completing almost 1 billion total transactions over the holiday season, including our largest online day ever on Cyber Monday.", "Looking across the entire fourth quarter, our growth in comp sales was attributable to several key areas of the business. First, we remained pleased by our apparel and home businesses, which brought value to the customers through strong national brands, consistent quality across price points, and relevant products at the right time of the season.", "Second, our health and wellness business, including optical, remained strong, with growth in script counts from higher penetration in Medicare and Medicaid plans, branded drug inflation, and a strengthening over-the-counter business. Third, while our grocery performance was assisted primarily by inflation and lapping last year\u2019s SNAP reductions, we also saw progress from urgent agenda items, including a focus on adding days of freshness in produce.", "We still have a long way to go to improve our fresh business and remain focused on this goal. And finally, we saw strong performance from our Neighborhood Market format. While all formats experienced positive sales comps, our traditional Neighborhood Markets continue to outperform Walmart supercenters and discount stores, providing customers with the products and services they desire at locations that are convenient to them. Our traditional Neighborhood Markets delivered approximately 7.7% comp for the quarter.", "Yet, while we saw positive momentum in these categories, we remained challenged in others. Specifically, declines in our entertainment business persisted, as we faced industry contraction and deflation across many categories. Lapping last year\u2019s gaming console releases, along with fewer video game titles available for new consoles, and shifts from physical to digital media in movies and books, drove high single-digit negative comps in this area.", "Additionally, although we launched wireless installment plans in November, we\u2019re still ramping up this service as we reacquaint customers with our ability to serve them in this category. Finally, softness in electronics also impacted our online business particularly in the Ship to Home channel.", "In e-commerce, we remained thoughtful about growth, striving to produce sustainable results through digital and physical access. Our focus on serving customers led to strong performance in Pick Up Today and Ship from Store capabilities, particularly during the holiday season. However, we recognize the significant opportunity we have to grow this area of our business, as customers continue to reshape their shopping behaviors.", "Now, for the remainder of our financial results. In the fourth quarter, gross profit rate was relatively flat. Operating expenses increased 5.6%, driven primarily by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year. Additionally, we intensified our focus on improving customer experience in our stores. While these actions increased costs, we believe it was the right decision for the customer. In fact, our Checkout Promise program drove customer experience satisfaction scores to their highest level during the holiday season. Due to the success of this program, we are implementing it more broadly in fiscal 2016. Overall, operating income declined approximately 60 basis points for the quarter.", "Inventory growth moderated from prior quarters, growing 3.9% and less than the rate of sales in Q4. This growth was primarily related to the significant number of new store openings in the quarter. In fact, we opened 178 stores in this quarter alone, including 10 Supercenters and 168 traditional and small-format Neighborhood Markets.", "Comp store inventory improved in this quarter, driven by strong a holiday sell-through, and better aligned seasonal markdowns in apparel. Inventory management is a key element to customer experience, and whilst we have room for improvement, we are also making progress to better manage working capital.", "Now, let me cover our full-year financial performance. For the year, net sales increased 3.1%, or $8.6 billion to $288 billion. Comp sales improved 0.5% for the 52-week period ended January 30, while operating income declined 2.1% to $21.3 billion. Gross profit improved 2.6% for the year, with a 12 basis point decline in gross profit rate. This was primarily driven by price investments in meat and preferred Medicare prescription plans.", "Expenses were up 4.3%, deleveraging 24 basis points for the year, and driven primarily by increased healthcare costs from higher enrollment rates and medical cost inflation. Expenses were further deleveraged by the initial ramp up of 17 new medical Care Clinics, increased utility expenses from cold weather early in the year, and higher rates throughout the year, and declining rates in recyclable materials, such as cardboard. Recall that we get a financial benefit from recycledmaterials.", "Moving to real estate, we opened 353 net new stores, including relocations and expansions, and added almost 21 million retail square feet. A year ago we started to accelerate our Neighborhood Market format. This fiscal year, we opened 165 traditional format Neighborhood Markets and 68 smaller Neighborhood Markets. By continuing to drive this format, we are able to offer customers easy and convenient access to fresh foods, pharmacy, and services at Walmart\u2019s everyday low price guarantee.", "Supercenters remain the driver of our sales and growth in retail square footage. Customers continue to rely heavily on this format for their broader shopping needs. This year, we opened an additional 119 supercenters, including conversions and relocations. In FY16, we expect to open approximately 60 to 70 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we\u2019ll open an estimated 180 to 200 Neighborhood Markets, including 10 to 15 smaller-format locations, as we complete our openings of this test program.", "We\u2019ll continue to monitor the progress of these test locations before making any further commitments to this format. We expect to add approximately 15 to 16 million retail square feet this year. Digital access is important to our customers now more than ever. They expect a seamless interaction, whether it\u2019s in the store or online. We see many opportunities at Walmart to evolve with the customer in their digital and physical experiences.", "For example, this year we developed a collaborative approach to the holiday season in toys with our store and walmart.com teams working closely together to ensure our customers had the same experience with Walmart no matter where or when they shopped. We\u2019ve been investing in expanding capabilities to allow customers to shop on their own terms and are moving sensibly towards this integration of digital and physical. This includes offering customers a variety of ways to interact with our brand, including picking up their walmart.com orders at their local store, providing reminders and refill capabilities through our pharmacy app, and our latest test concept, Walmart Grocery.", "This year, we expanded grocery delivery and pickup tests to include the entire Denver market and launched Walmart Grocery Pickup here in Northwest Arkansas this past October. And just last week, we announced the expansion of Walmart Grocery online to select locations in the Phoenix, Arizona, and Huntsville, Alabama markets. We have an advantage at Walmart, by combining our store and distribution network with our e-commerce capabilities to allow customers to interact with our brand in the ways that are most convenient for them, whether it\u2019s in a store, online, or on our mobile app, we are focused on providing the best solutions for customers.", "The upcoming fiscal year will be a time of change and further improvement to the business. Our focus on inventory management, instock levels, and customer service is just the beginning. Recently, we made changes within our management team. These changes have allowed me to get closer to our merchandising teams, and the new leadership brings with them fresh ideas and an invigorating spirit. We\u2019ve also just wrapped up our year-beginning meeting, which is a time to gather our store managers, to thank them for their hard work in the prior year and to discuss the focus areas for the upcoming year.", "The meeting was energizing, and our store managers left excited for a fresh start to become better store managers, focusing on item merchandising, and providing great service to the customer. We\u2019ll continue on the path towards hiring 100,000 veterans by 2018. We set this goal just under two years ago and we are proud to say that we\u2019ve already hired almost 80,000 veterans through this program.", "Furthermore, over 6,000 have been promoted to roles of greater responsibility since joining the Walmart team. But fiscal 2016 will not be without its challenges. Our bottom line will continue to be pressured primarily from the significant investments in associates that I covered earlier. In addition, we will see impact from the changing mix within merchandise categories, store formats, and retail channels, and the investments in digital and physical integration. While we expect to offset some of these headwinds by executing and delivering on our urgent agenda items and other initiatives, we know these investments are necessary to position ourselves to meet the rapidly changing needs of the customer.", "We may see risk to import merchandise flows related to the upcoming spring and Easter seasons due to ongoing port congestion. We\u2019ll continue to take the appropriate steps using our diversified supply chain network to reduce the impact for our customers. In the first quarter, we expect a continuation of lower gas prices to provide a tailwind to our business. This could be somewhat offset by a shorter selling season, with Easter coming earlier than last year, as well as potential impact from port congestion. For the 13-week period ending May 1, we anticipate a comp sales increase of 1% to 2%. Last year\u2019s 13-week comp ended May 2, 2014 was down 8 basis points.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?", "David Cheesewright", "Thank you, Greg. I\u2019m pleased with our performance in International, as we\u2019ve remained committed to the strategic priorities I outlined a year ago. We\u2019ve been able to produce solid results and operating income growth, despite operating in a very challenging, competitive retail environment. As one of our key priorities, we continue to accelerate our eCommerce business by offering multiple ways for our customers to shop, whether in stores, online, pickup or mobile, we aim to give our customers the ability to shop in whichever way they want.", "We\u2019ve also made progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China, and have experienced success in improving our overall price perception, as well as the quality of our fresh offering. We also continue to make progress on our commitment of actively managing our existing portfolio. You\u2019ve seen us make strategic decisions such as closing underperforming stores and divesting non-core parts of our business in order to strengthen our foundation. Our markets remain focused on key strategic priorities, and I\u2019m optimistic about our position going into the New Year.", "Now for our financial results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis. However, with the U.S. dollar at historic highs, we faced significant currency headwinds of $2.6 billion, resulting in a 3.9% sales decline on a reported basis. Of our five largest countries, Mexico, Canada, and Brazil delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. Comps declined in both the UK and China due primarily to food deflation and intense competition in the UK, and government austerity measures and deflation in key categories in China. Comp sales growth was strong in all other markets as well.", "As Claire mentioned, there were certain discrete items disclosed in the previous year, which have a significant impact on our year-over-year operating income comparison. For financial year ending 2015, our fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by Japan store closure costs of $148 million. Overall, operating income increased 79.6% on a constant currency basis and 66.4% on a reported basis. Excluding the previous and current years discrete items, we grew operating income on a constant currency basis by 14.2%.", "For the full year, sales grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis, while the strong U.S. dollar resulted in a full-year sales decline of 0.3% on a reported basis, reflecting over a $5 billion currency impact. Full-year operating income grew 24.1% on a constant currency basis and 19.8% on a reported basis. Excluding the items mentioned above, operating income grew 9.3% on a constant currency basis, outpacing full-year sales growth. We made progress in reducing inventory levels during the quarter and dropped the growth rate over 250 basis points versus the previous quarter to a 4.6% growth on a constant currency basis. We had positive momentum on inventory management heading into the New Year.", "Now, let\u2019s discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, results are inclusive of ecommerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details. The UK market remained very competitive during the quarter with grocery inflation falling to a record low of negative 0.9% over the 12 weeks ended January 4, according to Kantar.", "Total market growth of 0.6% was a slight improvement over the previous quarter, boosted by Christmas sales and increased discretionary spending from lower fuel prices. However, overall market trends remain relatively weak. According to Kantar, Asda, along with the other big grocers, lost share to hard discounters for the quarter. UK sales declined 1.7% and comp sales declined 2.5%, excluding fuel.", "Several competitors held a Black Friday event for the first time and others continued intense vouchering, which led to increased competition versus a year ago. Asda online sales remained strong, while George Home continued to register double-digit growth. Despite the top line pressures, Asda was able to grow income ahead of sales.", "Now turning to Canada, which had a very solid fourth quarter performance. Sales grew 4.1%, with comp sales increasing 1.8%, marking this the third consecutive quarter of positive comps. Price investments and increased consumer spending contributed to improved trends in sales. We reported strong comp sales in food, health and wellness and consumables. While general merchandise and apparel sales improved versus prior quarter results, they were still below the rate of growth in the market.", "Our fresh business also continues to accelerate, resulting in the highest comp sales for the year in quarter four. Canada had a strong holiday season overall with the online business up 38.5%. Walmart Canada grew 43 basis points of market share in food, consumables, and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12-week period ending January 24. Canada completed a restructuring in the quarter to simplify home office operations. This, along with continued investments in ecommerce and pricing resulted in a decline in operating income. Overall, we are pleased with the positive sales trend we\u2019ve seen in our Canadian operations, and we expect the momentum to continue.", "Next we\u2019ll discuss Walmex, which released their quarterly results on February 17. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP; thus some numbers will differ. Consolidated Walmex sales grew 3.4%, with positive comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Walmex leveraged expenses for the quarter and grew operating income faster than sales.", "Mexico sales increased 3%, and the comp sales were up 0.1% for the quarter. According to ANTAD, the entire market experienced slower comp growth in the fourth quarter of 0.7% in self-service. Walmart Mexico comps, excluding Sam\u2019s Club exceeded the market by 80 basis points. Performance was especially strong in our small format, Bodega Aurrera Express, which outperformed the market by 750 basis points. Sam\u2019s Club growth lagged the market by approximately 330 basis points. However, we are encouraged by the improving top line trends at Sam\u2019s, as December comp sales were the strongest of the year. Sam\u2019s Club remains a focus area and we will continue to accelerate initiatives to improve the business.", "Next, let\u2019s talk about Brazil. Brazil continued sales momentum in Q4, growing net sales and comp sales by 3.1%. Holiday sales were driven by strong performances in both food and consumables. Strategic and targeted pricing resulted in margin favorability for the quarter. Management also continued to drive labor productivity and control expenses. While we are seeing some positive results, there is still work to be done in our turnaround plan.", "Moving to China. Ongoing headwinds from government austerity measures, reduction in gift card sales, and continued deflation in key categories continue to pose challenges in the market. Walmart China\u2019s Q4 net sales declined 0.7% and comp sales declined 2.3%, partially due to Chinese New Year falling nearly three weeks later than last year.", "We increased market share in the hypermarket category for the eighth consecutive quarter according to Nielsen for the period ended December 31. We expect market headwinds to continue in the New Year, but we are confident that we will continue to accelerate growth in this important Over the year, China has made great progress in strengthening the core business. Our portfolio is now more focused and stronger with the opening of 24 new hypermarket stores and one additional Sam\u2019s Club, in addition to completing the store closure program announced last year.", "The distribution center expansion project and the centralization of deliveries to DCs were finalized within the quarter, resulting in a distribution network for fresh that provides coverage for all of our stores in China for the first time. These initiatives drive efficiency, reduce costs, and shorten the lead time to get products on the shelf. Having control over our own distribution network allows us to better monitor the quality and the safety of our products. Additionally, the We Operate for Less and the We Buy for Less programs in China have saved over $150 million over the course of the year.", "Finally, let\u2019s discuss ecommerce performance across the globe. We remain focused on innovating and providing solutions for our customers seeking convenience. This quarter we\u2019ve made even more progress, and I\u2019m very excited about the impact we\u2019ve made in online retail.", "In Japan, we automated the order picking process to fulfill Seiyu.com grocery orders more efficiently and sustainably. We\u2019re testing new offerings, such as Grab \u2018N Go lockers in Canada. In India, we are continuing the rollout of an online offering to business-to-business members and expect to reach all members by the end of next year.", "Yihaodian, our ecommerce business in China benefited from investments in the supply chain and promotional events. Traffic increased more than 40% and average ticket improved as well. The fourth quarter was highlighted by a successful Singles Day promotion in November, generating strong sales and traffic growth aided by an increase in orders from mobile devices.", "In Brazil, ecommerce sales growth was strong again this quarter, driven by strong sales in large appliances and wireless, where low cost smartphones helped drive sales growth of more than double the same period last year. Promotions fueled sales growth with the Black Friday and 72-hour events delivering strong comp sales. Traffic via our mobile app nearly tripled on Black Friday. Looking ahead, we will continue to innovate and execute our strategic plan.", "I\u2019m amazed by how similar our customers\u2019 needs are around the world, value, assortment, and convenience are paramount. We will remain focused on saving our customers money by expanding our private label offering, improving product sourcing, and driving cost out of our operations, so that we can invest it back into price. We know convenience means different things to customers at different times. It could mean shopping online, home grocery delivery, a one-stop shop experience or a drive-through pickup, and we are innovating to provide customers more shopping options than ever.", "No matter the shopper preference, Walmart will continue to strive to be the destination of choice. Our objectives for this year will continue to build upon a foundation that\u2019s been established. In financial year ending 2016, we are committed to; actively managing the existing portfolio, driving comp sales, accelerating ecommerce, delivering market priorities, including establishing a platform for sustainable growth in China, moving forward with the turnaround efforts in Brazil and reenergizing the business in Mexico, and lastly strengthening enablers, which means being the lowest cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust.", "Let me close by thanking our nearly 800,000 international associates around the world for delivering a strong performance in financial year ending 2015. As I reflect on the past year, I\u2019m humbled by what our team has accomplished and their relentless focus on saving customers money. I look forward to updating you on our results in the coming months.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz?", "Rosalind Brewer", "Thanks, Dave. I would like to start by echoing our excitement at Sam\u2019s Club, regarding the company\u2019s announcement today, to boost the starting wage for our full-time and part-time hourly associates. We believe we provide our associates with an excellent opportunity to pursue careers in retail, because our business model at Sam\u2019s Club differs from Walmart stores, beginning in the first-half of the fiscal year, we will offer a starting hourly wage of $9.50, which is above the federal minimum wage, unless there is a higher state-mandated minimum wage.", "This will ensure all Sam\u2019s Club hourly associates are paid above the federal minimum wage. We believe this investment in our associates will help us attract, retain, and develop top-notch talent, and will allow us to continue to deliver outstanding, award-winning service to our members.", "Now on to Q4. I want to thank our Sam\u2019s Club associates for delivering the best performance of the year this quarter, providing momentum going into fiscal 2016. Over the last four quarters, we saw meaningful acceleration culminating in a comp sales increase without fuel of 2% for the 13-week period ended January 30.", "Strong holiday execution combined with our strategic investments in member value, merchandise relevance, and the integration of digital and physical, boosted our performance. Our investments in membership value initiatives enabled us to grow membership income by over 8% this quarter. Our Plus penetration is at historic highs, as Plus members are seeing the benefits from our Cash Rewards program. Across the club, all members are seeing the benefits of Instant Savings and the 5/3/1 MasterCard.", "We will anniversary the introduction of Plus Cash Rewards and the 5/3/1 MasterCard in June 2015, so we expect these programs to continue driving membership income moving forward. Sam\u2019s net sales, including fuel were $14.9 billion, up 1.3% over last year. This was impacted by the approximately 25% decline in fuel prices with gallons sold up approximately 8%.", "Our gross profit rate increased 23 basis points due to higher margin on fuel. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 50 basis points. Operating income increased 29.1% to $510 million, which includes $41 million increase in fuel profit. Our 500-plus fuel stations provided value to members through competitive pricing, and the 5/3/1 MasterCard holders benefit from an additional 5% off all gas purchases. Given the volatility in fuel prices, the remainder of this discussion will exclude fuel.", "Additionally, for comparisons, please recall that last year we had certain items impacting our results, which included; a $39 million charge to gross profit due to an adjustment to our product warranty liabilities, a $59 million charge to operating expenses for a new in-club staffing restructuring and the closure of one club, a $24 million gain in other income for the sale of two real estate properties.", "In Q4, net sales grew 3.7% and we delivered comp sales of 2%, driven by traffic growth of 1.5% and ticket of 0.5%. The Savings Member continues to drive traffic. We have lapped last year\u2019s SNAP reductions and benefitted from favorable weather this quarter. Retail inflation across the club has moderated slightly since the previous quarter. Our gross profit declined 32 basis points versus last year due to the planned impact of Plus Cash Rewards and pressure from merchandise mix, which were offset by last year\u2019s product warranty charge.", "Without the comparative benefit of the product warranty charge last year, gross profit declined 61 basis points. As discussed previously, the rollout of Plus Cash Rewards will pressure gross profit in the first-half of fiscal year 2016. Operating expenses were well managed in the quarter and we leveraged 82 basis points. Even without the comparative benefit of last year\u2019s discrete items, we leveraged expenses. We had disciplined expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the club staffing model earlier this year.", "Membership and other income grew by 1.4% compared to last year, which factors in the real estate gain. Without the $24 million real estate gain last year, membership and other income was up 8.7%. Operating income was up 19.4% to $456 million. Without the comparative benefit of last year\u2019s items, our operating income was flat to last year. We are still very happy with our overall performance for the quarter, given the significant investments in membership value initiatives, such as Plus Cash Rewards. And with good expense management and improvements in membership income, we believe we have great momentum for fiscal 2016.", "I also want to highlight the team\u2019s efforts around working capital. We reduced total inventory by 3.5%, while simultaneously growing our fleet by 16 clubs during the year. Moreover, I\u2019m confident in the quality of our inventory for this year. At Sam\u2019s Club, relevant merchandise is a critical component in member engagement, and we continue to improve performance across the box. Our merchants are pushing hard to introduce newness and capture consumer trends, while providing the price leadership and assortment that Sam\u2019s Club is known for.", "Sales of our fresh food business grew positive low single-digits this quarter. Performance was led by meat due to inflation and a strong value proposition. A challenged area was produce, where weather created supply issues. Dry grocery and beverage delivered a positive low single-digit comp with highlights in newness and healthy-for-you items. We doubled the organic portfolio since the previous quarter and members are responding positively to new, healthy beverage options.", "Let\u2019s continue with health and wellness, which posted a positive mid-single-digit comp. Sam\u2019s Club is a destination for our members\u2019 healthcare needs and we see that clearly in our pharmacy comps, which drove the category due to both script growth and branded prescription inflation. Our OTC business, especially our healthy assortment of nutrition bars and protein also did well.", "We\u2019ve seen an uptick in our consumables business, which posted a positive low single digit comp. This is an area where members consistently see value through our private brand offerings, improved pack sizes, and Instant Savings. For example, members love the quality of our private brand Member\u2019s Mark Paper products. The disposable tabletop category continues to perform well, and we have introduced newness to improve the laundry and home care business.", "Home and apparel delivered a positive low single-digit comp. Our exciting assortment of toys was a highlight, drawing members into the club over the holidays. Apparel continues to show strength, driven by menswear and children\u2019s clothing. Our underperforming category continues to be technology and entertainment, which posted a negative mid-single-digit comp. This is an improvement versus last quarter, as a result of introducing the latest Ultra Hi-Def and 4K TV technologies, a strong value proposition on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and an expanded wearables assortment. However, we need to make larger, faster strides. This year, our merchants are rebalancing the portfolio, which involves reallocating resources towards higher growth, higher excitement categories.", "Ancillary improved to a positive low single-digit comp, driven by growth in tobacco. We saw improved convenience store traffic trends, as we executed strategic pricing initiatives and benefitted from shifts in the competitive landscape.", "Moving to e-commerce, this quarter, SamsClub.com was integral in supporting our in-club holiday events, becoming a Cyber Week destination and offering online-only promotions that drew members from our physical clubs to our digital platforms. Dot-com delivered double-digit comps in both direct-to-home and Club Pickup, contributing approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp.", "We\u2019ve rebranded Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull to Club Pickup and enhanced the service to appeal to both Savings and Business members. Members have responded well to the re-launch of Club Pickup in all clubs, and we\u2019ve seen accelerated performance compared to the previous quarter. The improvements we\u2019ve made to our mobile and desktop platforms, along with enhancements in messaging, have boosted conversion rates across all platforms.", "This concludes our discussion on fourth quarter results. Let\u2019s continue with the financial results for the full year, where we\u2019ve seen meaningful, sustainable acceleration every quarter. With fuel, net sales were $58 billion, up 1.5% over last year. With fuel profit of $122 million, operating income for the year grew 7.2% to $2 billion.", "Net sales, excluding fuel, were $51.6 billion, up 2.1%. For the 52-week period ending January 30, 2015, comp sales increased 50 basis points, driven by traffic. While our investments in Cash Rewards for Plus members led to a gross profit rate decline of 38 basis points, we managed expenses well and leveraged 24 basis points. Membership income increased 10.3%, driving operating income of $1.9 billion, a 2% increase over last year.", "Fiscal 2016 is well under way and Sam\u2019s Club is innovating the member experience through merchandise relevance and digital/physical integration. These two priorities are the key to membership engagement. I am confident that our strategic investments will not only differentiate us from our competitors, but, more importantly, continue enhancing our members\u2019 trust and loyalty.", "Merchandise relevance is a critical enabler. Our goal is to ensure that members are surprised and delighted by relevant merchandise every time they come into the club or visit our website in every category across the country. Combined with price leadership and newness, merchandise relevance will keep our members coming back for more.", "Our Fiscal 2016 investment strategy reflects the importance of offering a seamless digital/physical club experience for members. I recently was at the grand opening of our new e-commerce facility in San Bruno, California where Jamie Iannone, who leads SamsClub.com, has invested in expanding his team of engineers and scientists. I am optimistic about our growth opportunities in both the digital and the physical. And that\u2019s why we plan to open 9 to 12 new and relocated clubs, and remodel between 55 and 60 clubs this year, while simultaneously investing in innovation at SamsClub.com. Knowing that our most engaged members want to shop with us both in our clubs and online, we will ensure a seamless set of access points for members.", "I am proud of how we finished out the year. For the 13- week period from January 31 through May 1, we expect comp sales to increase between 1% and 2%.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Neil for the e-commerce update. Neil?", "Neil Ashe", "Thanks, Roz. Q4 was an important quarter for us, not just because it is the biggest quarter of the fiscal year, but because our key investments started to play a major role in the business. Most notably, our global technology platform Pangaea, and our U.S. fulfillment network stood up under the holiday volumes of U.S. customers. At the same time, we saw good sales in markets around the world.", "For the full year and for Q4, we outgrew the e-commerce market globally. Overall, Walmart grew e-commerce sales by 22%, benefitted by a 25% increase in gross merchandise value, or GMV for the year. In Q4, we grew sales 18%, on GMV growth of 20%. An increase in third-party marketplace volumes in the U.S., Brazil and in China contributed to the growth in GMV.", "Greg, Dave, and Roz talked about the e-commerce successes in the quarter, but it\u2019s worth recapping. In the U.S., we had record sales on Cyber Monday and Cyber Week and more than 1.5 billion page views over the five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. Samsclub.com had strong double-digit comps on Thanksgiving and on Black Friday. On Singles Day in China on November 11, Yihaodian\u2019s GMV growth was in the high double digits, and on December 21, we surpassed traffic from Singles Day.", "In the UK, ASDA continued to make Click and Collect easier for customers in stores and with new pick up points at petrol stations, tube stations and other locations. We now have Click and Collect in all ASDA stores. In Brazil, we saw our strongest sales quarter, with high double-digit sales growth.", "What excites me most is the progress we\u2019ve made in building out our ability to serve customers across digital and physical. We\u2019re investing in four areas; our global technology platform, our next generation fulfillment network, our talent, and on integrating digital and physical.", "Starting with our global technology platform, I refer to this as the operating system for commerce, because it is the foundation for serving customers digitally, enables the integration of digital and physical commerce. Building and deploying a new platform is one of the most challenging projects for an e-commerce business, particularly at our scale. We launched most key elements of our site and mobile shopping experience on the new platform before holiday on walmart.com in the U.S.", "Despite all of our testing, with the sheer complexity of a complete platform rebuild, there is nothing like the real thing on the busiest day of the year, Cyber Monday. Pangaea hummed along all day, serving our customers at record volume. While we were glued our screens watching performance, a mom in Dallas was glued to her screen on walmart.com crossing items off of her holiday shopping list. She was most likely shopping on a tablet, and she was browsing pages about 30% faster, thanks to Pangaea. She was seeing a personalized shopping experience with a lot more recommendations for items that her kids might like.", "Hers was among a record number of orders. It was the first major test of our next generation fulfillment network, which combined our first large scale center in Texas with our existing fulfillment centers, distribution centers and stores, to ship a record number of walmart.com orders. Our team in Texas shipped twice as many orders as last year. She was able to get more things from us even faster.", "Starting in the second quarter, we have four more of these large-scale fulfillment centers coming online. While there will be some ramp-up time, they will significantly expand our fulfillment capacity and efficiency in the coming years.", "We\u2019ve talked about the importance of investing in talent and the fact that we are building a technology company inside the world\u2019s largest retailer. In the past year, we have been able to build up our team to the critical mass needed to be that technology company. And we did it in a very selective way, bringing in some of the best talent in Silicon Valley through organic hiring and targeted acquisitions.", "We also built a great team in Silicon Valley to serve Sam\u2019s Club across digital and physical. We\u2019ll be continuing to hire the best people, adding to the core team we\u2019ve built to deliver on our priorities. When we were together at the analyst meeting in October, I talked through the story of a family in Denver who can rely on Walmart to make their lives easier by being everywhere they need us to be. Echoing Greg, I\u2019m really proud of how we brought together the digital and physical customer experience during the holidays.", "In the U.S., we created a series of moments that engaged customers with us both online and in stores, starting with online deals Thanksgiving morning, leading to the Black Friday store events and through the new evening edition on Cyber Monday for people who worked during the day.", "Mobile continued to be a big investment and area of high growth, nearly 70% of our walmart.com traffic during the holidays was from mobile devices. Those people used the app in a lot of ways to do their shopping online, to find a store, or to use the new store search tool we added late last year. This search tool allows customers to find product details and the aisle location of a specific item. Sam\u2019s also offered a significantly enhanced shopping experience through its app and mobile web site.", "In addition to Walmart, we\u2019ve focused on Sam\u2019s digital and physical integration with its Club Pickup experience, and it paid off, as we saw nearly 30% growth in Club Pickup during holiday. We\u2019re also continuing to create a stronger relationship with new and existing customers with grocery pickup and delivery. We\u2019ve continued to see great feedback from customers on our tests in San Jose and Denver, and last week we started serving customers in Phoenix, Arizona and Huntsville, Alabama.", "To sum up, last year was a building year and that will continue this year. We ended up investing an incremental $0.08 per share during fiscal year 2015, which was over our forecast of $0.05 to $0.07, as we continued to invest in fulfillment and other areas to serve our customers. As I mentioned, we saw global sales grow by 22%, benefitted by a 25% increase in GMV for the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2016 will continue to be a building year, and we expect sales to grow worldwide in the mid-20s.", "In fiscal year 2016, we expect to invest incrementally between $0.06 and $0.09 per share for e-commerce initiatives. Our investments will continue to significantly enhance the customer experience and drive greater efficiency. This will include the continued rollout of our U.S. site based on Pangaea, which will make checkout faster and easier for our customers. It is also serving as the backbone to an integrated experience across online, stores and mobile. It will empower new ways to serve customers through mobile. That platform will also allow us to further expand our online assortment. We\u2019ll do that though a thoughtful balance of our own merchandise and marketplace sellers. We expect to double our assortment this year to well over 10 million SKUs.", "We\u2019ll also continue fulfilling our promise to deliver orders to customers when and where they want them. Our next generation fulfillment network combines new large-scale fulfillment centers that combined with our DCs and stores, all connected by Walmart\u2019s transportation network. Our data scientists have built algorithms that dictate the assortment that needs to be placed in our different nodes, and to dictate from which node we ship an order.", "Four new fulfillment centers will come online starting in the second quarter. When fully operational, these centers along with our other nodes will position us to serve the vast majority of the U.S. population fast and at a low cost. We\u2019re working closely with Greg\u2019s team to deliver a seamless experience for customers who use our stores to pick up or return orders. And, we\u2019re working with Roz\u2019s team to continue enhancing Sam\u2019s Club Pickup and making reordering fast and simple.", "Sam\u2019s will also make signing up easier and make membership even more valuable with services and by helping members discover new products. Sam\u2019s will have the ability to leverage Walmart\u2019s investment in e-commerce. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue to invest in the major markets for ecommerce, most notably Brazil, China and the UK. And, we\u2019ll continue to expand our relationship with customers through online grocery pickup and delivery.", "All of these achievements from this quarter significantly improved our ability to serve customers however they want to shop with us. And many of our investments from last year will roll out this year. We have significant opportunities ahead, and I feel great about the progress we\u2019ve made on our priorities, including our global technology platform, talent, next generation fulfillment network and the integration of digital and physical. We are delivering Walmart where you are, whether you shop online, through mobile or in stores. No matter how you shop, we\u2019re helping you save money and live better.", "Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Charles. Charles?", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Neil. I\u2019ll wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some thoughts on the company\u2019s performance. For the year, we delivered $486 billion in revenue. E-commerce sales grew approximately 22% to more than $12 billion. We delivered fourth quarter underlying earnings per share of $1.61 and reported earnings per share of $1.53. Recall that our underlying earnings per share reflects the performance of our business without the impact of discrete items.", "Now, as a reminder, our fourth quarter guidance of $1.46 to $1.56 included the discrete item of the Japan restructure, which was approximately $0.03 per share. Walmart U.S. generated a very solid 1.5% comp in the fourth quarter. Although the strong U.S. dollar caused a negative impact of over $5 billion on revenue, Walmart International delivered very good sales growth of nearly 4% on a constant currency basis for the year. And, Sam\u2019s Club continued to drive membership income again this year, with growth of over 10%.", "Now, on the other hand, as I just mentioned, currency negatively impacted revenue by more than $5 billion. Although not as high as we anticipated, healthcare expenses were a headwind for Walmart U.S. during the year. And our reported earnings per share were negatively impacted by $0.08, due to the discrete items that Claire mentioned earlier.", "Before turning our attention to guidance for the first quarter and for fiscal year 2016, I would like to remind you that our outlook for the future is based on the enterprise strategy we discussed at our October investor conference. Our clear focus on driving sales through price, assortment, access and experience will continue to guide the investments we make to better serve our customers. Our guidance today assumes several important factors, including the economic conditions in several of our largest markets and currency exchange rates remaining at current levels.", "In October, we forecasted a 2% to 4% net sales increase for this new fiscal year. However, as a result of where currency rates are today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $10 billion on net sales. Our new forecast for fiscal year 2016 net sales growth is between 1% and 2%. Our capital expenditure guidance of $11.6 billion to $12.9 billion, and our total net retail square footage growth of 26 million to 30 million square feet remain unchanged. Also in October, we shared that our capital expenditure range reflects that we will grow through a smaller number of large supercenters in the U.S. And as previously announced we are dedicating capital related to our digital and e-commerce businesses of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.", "In fiscal 2016, we expect our FCPA-related expenses to range between $160 million and $180 million. Recall that these are included in our corporate and support expenses. Our incremental investment in our Global eCommerce business in fiscal 2015 was approximately $0.08 per share, above the $0.05 to $0.07 per share we shared with you in November. We plan to step up our incremental investment again in fiscal 2016 for our e-commerce activities around the world. This investment is expected to range between $0.06 and $0.09 per share over fiscal 2015.", "As I indicated at the October investor conference, the heaviest investment in e-commerce will come over the next 18 to 24 months, as we further integrate the shopping experience, appealing to our customer\u2019s desire for convenience, access, and assortment. We then expect to see operating losses start to moderate at the end of that period. We continue to seek the right balance between sales growth and profitability for ecommerce.", "Doug shared the news about our people initiatives within our U.S. businesses, including a wage restructuring and training opportunities to help associates earn higher pay and advance their careers. These strategic investments, which will cost approximately $1 billion this year, are designed to ultimately benefit our customers and our businesses through a better store and club experience. However, they will impact our earnings per share this fiscal year. In the first quarter, we expect these investments to negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.02. The full year earnings per share impact is expected to be approximately $0.20. In addition to the impact from these two significant investments, operating income, like sales, will also be pressured by currency exchange rates.", "Our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2016 estimated tax rate ranging between 32% and 34%. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items, and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. As we have seen in the past, we expect our first quarter tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be the highest of the four quarters.", "Taking all of this into account, we expect first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.10. This compares to $1.10 last year. We expect full year earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. This compares to reported earnings per share of $4.99 in fiscal 2015, which included the discrete items we\u2019ve discussed.", "Now, before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I would like to address a few additional items. After growth organically or by acquisition, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.92 to $1.96 per share for fiscal 2016, to be paid out quarterly.

Wal-Mart will continue to provide additional information on the Company's sales on retail Thursday, which corresponds with the reporting of most other retailers.", "Let me set up today's call a bit. As always, we will provide opening comments on the quarter and the overall performance of our business.

We will also cover some of your key questions within our call.", "Let me now turn it over to Lee Scott, our President and CEO.", "Lee Scott", "Thank you, Carol. Hello, everyone. Today, I can tell you that although we are pleased to have reported record sales and earnings for the third quarter, sales in the United States were softer than we had hoped. As we discussed at the analyst meeting, we remain committed to balancing returns and growth. We are also pleased that we have seen improvements in gross margin in all three segments of our business.", "Thankfully, we made it through the third quarter without a major hurricane, but the lingering effects of the positive sales we have had across the Southeast and Southwest relating to hurricane recovery efforts last year led to difficult comparisons through this fiscal year. These comparisons will continue into our next fiscal year as well.", "Let's look at the key results. Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were more than $83 billion, an increase of 12% over the third quarter of the last fiscal year. Income from continuing operations was almost $2.6 billion, an increase of more than 7%. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.62. Our earnings this year were favorably impacted by approximately $0.01 per share for property insurance-related gains.", "Now let's look ahead. We have some real opportunities in the fourth quarter. This season, no one will doubt Wal-Mart's leadership on price and value. We are implementing our most aggressive pricing strategy ever across core categories such as toys and electronics for this holiday season. I hope that some of you picked up one of those $398 laptops we had in our stores a week ago.", "We also have great values for your home and entertaining at Sam\u2019s Club. John Menzer will share with you details about the fourth-quarter advertising program for the Wal-Mart Stores in the United States.", "This year, you will hear the word \u201cChristmas\u201d from us too. Last year, our customers told us they appreciate the word holiday, but they would like it even more if we said \u201cChristmas\u201d also. Wal-Mart has produced a Christmas-specific television ad that just broke this past weekend. Also Wal-Mart will feature a series of television advertisements with a key charitable partner, the Salvation Army, that will focus on Christmas. You will hear Christmas carols in our stores and you will see Christmas on signage, gift cards and merchandise.", "Our associates are also helping us celebrate with everyone. You will hear Happy Holidays, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa, Feliz Navidad and of course, Merry Christmas. With almost 84% of Americans shopping at our stores, we are very focused on ensuring not only the best prices, but also customer relevancy throughout our stores and the communities that we serve.", "I continue to be excited about the $4 generic prescription drug program. We are now in 27 states and plan to add even more states very soon. Our goal is to offer this program to customers at every Wal-Mart, Sam\u2019s Club and Neighborhood Market. It is about saving money for our customers and driving traffic for our total box. It is also about building relationships with state and local governments because they like this program too.", "This month, we are opening 21 stores in the United States just in time for holiday shopping. We continue to create jobs, advance careers and enhance communities across this country. Let me share two recent examples: two new SuperCenters in the Atlanta Metro area attracted more than 4,500 applicants for more than 600 total new positions. 4,200 people applied for 465 jobs at the new SuperCenter in Edinburgh, Texas, near the Texas/Mexico border.", "You heard me say that it is our goal to ensure that Wal-Mart is out in front. We are committed to making sure that Wal-Mart stays out in front by improving the customer experience and by delivering value for our customers around this world.", "We are pleased to see continued strength in the continuing operations of our international segment. I see a bright future for international where Mike Duke and his team are strengthening their focus on markets where we can have the greatest impact on Wal-Mart's growth and return on investment strategy.", "For example, new units in Mexico are performing very well. We have just opened three SuperCenters in Canada and now are able to give true one-stop shopping experiences to our Canadian customers. During the quarter, we completed the disposition of our operations in South Korea and in Germany. Additionally, let me point out that Raj Jain, as the President of Emerging Markets, has joined the company and will play an active role in overseeing the company's business developments in India.", "Before I close, let me recap our capital expenditure objectives that were announced last month at the analyst meeting. You can get more details from our press release. First of all, capital expenditures for the next fiscal year will grow at a significantly lower rate than spending grew in the current fiscal year.", "Secondly, we will add over 60 million square feet of new retail space in over 600 new locations this next year. Square footage growth for the next fiscal year will be slightly less than in prior years. Our more rigorous real estate prioritization process enables us to drive higher returns by focusing on locations that make the most efficient use of capital.", "Our long-term goal is to continue to have our capital expenditures grow at a rate equal to, or less than, the sales growth. I feel good about the priorities that we have in place for meeting our capital expenditure objectives.", "On an unrelated subject, a number of people have had the question about the recently completed elections in the United States and the fact that both Houses in Congress have changed party control. They wonder what impact this might have on Wal-Mart. You know that Wal-Mart has, for a long period of time, been a bipartisan company. We work with both parties on the things that are of interest to our customers and to us as a business. An example -- I think the best example -- is our $4 generic drug program. We have found support for this program across all parties and those are the kinds of things where Wal-Mart can make a difference for our customers, and help with one of the major issues facing this country.", "But it goes beyond that, if you think about the key challenges facing the country and the things that Wal-Mart is trying to do in taking a leadership position in areas such as job creation, environmental sustainability, community relations and of course, Wal-Mart's historic long-term support of our troops who are in harm's way, we believe that through an ongoing outreach program that we will be able to work with both parties and continue to play the role that we play; which remember, is taking care of our customers and taking care of associates and being a contributing member of society.", "In closing, I am happy with the leadership position we are taking going into the Christmas and the holiday season, not just in the U.S., but around this world. Now I would like to turn it over to Tom to recap the numbers.", "Tom Schoewe", "Lee, thank you very much and thank all of you for joining us here this morning. I will get into a little more detail on the company performance, but let's get started at the highest level to recap a little of what Lee has already said about the third quarter. First, total sales for the corporation were up 12%. In addition, U.S. comp store sales were up 1.5% in the quarter. Net income from continuing operations increased 7.1%. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.62. Earnings were, as Lee indicated, favorably impacted by a $56 million after-tax property insurance recovery and that included certain historical claims from named windstorms. These gains are reported as reductions in operating expenses. Of the $56 million benefit, $52 million of that relates to the Wal-Mart store segment and the remaining $4 million relates to Sam\u2019s Club.", "As a reminder, earnings per share in last year's third quarter included three items netting to an unfavorable after-tax impact of $80 million, or roughly $0.02 a share:", "John Menzer will cover Wal-Mart U.S. results. However, at this point, let me point out that operating income for Wal-Mart U.S. was up 13 basis points as a percentage of sales. However, if we remove all the noise in the numbers -- the property insurance recoveries, etc. -- in the current year and from last year -- the litigation settlement and the product warranty adjustments -- the Wal-Mart segment operating income as a percentage of sales would have actually decreased by 14 basis points for the quarter.", "Looking at the details. Consolidated gross margin was up 52 basis points for the third quarter. This increase occurred despite various pressures, which include transportation costs. Moving onto expenses, the consolidated operating expense percentage for the quarter was up 71 basis points over the same period last year. Turning now to inventory, consolidated inventories were up 6.2% against a year-to-date sales increase of 12%. We continue to make progress in inventory management, which obviously benefits a return on investment. Other income was up more than 15% for the third quarter. We continue to see increases in a couple of areas. First, membership fee income improved in the quarter as expected. Second, the continuing progress we are making in financial services are really paying off.", "Let me shift gears and chat about interest expense. Net interest expense was up more than 21% for the quarter, or 4 basis points as a percentage of sales. As expected, interest expense continues to be up because of the debt that we incurred from last year's fourth quarter acquisitions and obviously, from higher interest rates. Interest expense will continue to be a headwind this year, but our progress with inventory management has helped to offset some of that increase.", "Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 33.7%. Recall last quarter, we expected the tax rate to be at the high end of the 34% to 35% range without the renewal of the work opportunity tax credit legislation. Our rate in the quarter was actually lower than expected and is primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters outside of the United States, which allowed the release of the associated tax reserve. We are expecting the annual tax rate to be approximately 34%.", "As a reminder, factors which may impact our annual rate include things like changes in our assessment of certain tax matters, the renewal of the work opportunity tax credit legislation, and the mix of international versus domestic income.", "Payables as a percentage of inventories for the corporation were 76% and that is up from 68% last year. This improvement continues as a result of our inventory progress and is complemented by our international acquisitions. Our historical metric for monitoring leverage, and that would be debt to total capitalization, was 41.4% at the end of the quarter. That compares favorably to 43.2% at this same time last year. As I discussed at the analyst meeting last month, we will be moving to a cash flow ratio within the next quarter.", "Finally, as Lee mentioned earlier, we completed the dispositions of our operations in South Korea and in Germany during the third quarter. In our income statement, we have reflected the results of operations of South Korea and Germany as discontinued, both in the current and prior periods. Additionally, the loss on the disposition of Germany and the gain on the sale of South Korea are also reflected in discontinued operations.", "Let me get into some more details. The sale of our business in South Korea generated a pre-tax gain of $103 million, which was recognized right here in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. The sale of Wal-Mart Germany generated a pre-tax loss of $918 million; $863 million of that loss was recorded in the second quarter, and $55 million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. A net tax benefit of $63 million was recorded as a result of these two divestitures. In the event that there are additional impacts associated with either divestiture, these results will be reported in the future quarters on the discontinued operations line. Finally, the third quarter net loss from operations from these two businesses -- that would be South Korea and Germany -- was $58 million. Since South Korea and Germany are now considered discontinued operations, results of the international segment's operation now exclude these two countries from the current and prior periods. This allows for better apples-to-apples comparisons.", "With that, I would now like to turn it over to John Menzer to chat about our Wal-Mart U.S. operations.", "John Menzer", "Thanks, Tom. I will now cover the numbers first and then discuss some of the business strategies behind them. At the Wal-Mart division, operating income increased 9.9% on a sales increase of 7.8% for the third quarter. Tom explained the detail behind the operating income earlier in the call. Comp store sales in the Wal-Mart segment were up 1.5% for the quarter. Comp sales were driven by an increase in the average ticket in the quarter, while customer traffic declined slightly. We felt the negative impact on comp sales from last year's hurricane recovery sales. Stores that were not impacted by the 2005 hurricanes had a comp sales increase of more than 2% for the quarter.", "Our key grocery and consumer business was strong during the quarter and SuperCenter food sales grew by more than 12% for the third quarter. SuperCenter food comp sales were above the overall segment comp store sales growth rate. Although sales were below our expectations for the quarter, we did continue to advance our business by focusing on customer relevancy, market segmentation and improving both labor productivity and gross margin. While our initiatives in these areas are still in the very early stages, we are happy with the results to date.", "Gross margin increased by 43 basis points in the quarter. Even with the impact of last year's warranty adjustment, gross margin still increased. Our initial margin on general merchandise showed a solid improvement over last year's third quarter and our inventory management program produced an improvement in markdowns as well. The strong initial margin is related to an improved merchandising mix as we become more relevant to the customer with our merchandise offerings. We have seen improvement in our initial margin every quarter since the fourth quarter of last year.", "Total expenses as a percentage of sales were up 32 basis points when compared to last year. Similar to the first half of the year, we experienced higher maintenance costs related to our store remodel program and also higher utility costs. Despite soft sales performance, we achieved solid improvement in labor productivity. Wal-Mart has delivered labor productivity gains every quarter for the past two years. In addition, operating store wages were down as a percent of sales when compared to the same quarter last year. As mentioned earlier, we did have a favorable adjustment of property insurance recoveries. This reduced our expenses by approximately 14 basis points.", "Other income as a percent of sales for the quarter was essentially flat, when compared to last year. This is impressive given the benefit recorded in other income for the Visa/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement in the third quarter of last year. This is primarily due to the continued strong performance in our financial services area.", "We continue to have strong inventory productivity and are well ahead of our goal of growing inventory at or less than half the rate of our sales increase. At the end of the quarter, inventory in the overall Wal-Mart segment was up slightly more than 2%, while our sales increased 7.8% for the third quarter.", "We had a challenging third quarter. Last year's hurricanes made for a very difficult sales comparison and our remodel and special projects program created a higher level of customer inconvenience than we had anticipated. Beyond these two concerns, our women's apparel business, particularly our more fashion forward women's apparel, was not what we would have liked. These challenges were the primary impact on our sales in the third quarter. But even in this environment, we are pleased with both our margin increase and labor productivity improvement.", "Let me provide a little more direction on where we are heading with women's apparel as we move into fourth quarter. We told you at the analyst meeting that we expanded Metro 7 beyond what now appears to be the right segmentation. Metro 7 is still just a small part of our overall women's apparel offerings. Metro 7 does really work in about 800 or 900 stores; ones that are more urban in profile. It has been a year since we launched Metro 7 and we now have a one-year anniversary event, with extra special values hitting our stores just in time for the holidays.", "Lee spoke about our strong price leadership strategy. This is Wal-Mart's cornerstone. We will be relentless in establishing price leadership throughout the fourth quarter. Our holiday advertising campaign will remind the consumer about great prices and values they will find in our stores and online. Wal-Mart's biggest-ever 2006 Christmas campaign is built around the theme \"Be Bright\". We will offer excellent value and goodwill through multi-channel outreach. We're delivering this consistent message through our in-store signage, TV, radio advertising, circulars and also WalMart.com.", "You'll continue to see Wal-Mart roll back prices in just about every category in the store. Shoppers will find not only great selection on brands like Faded Glory, but also rollbacks on core basics and apparel, from cargo pants to flannel shirts. Intimate apparel also has rollbacks and we are seeing great movement in this category. Other strengths so far in November are in menswear, outerwear and basic sleepwear. In women's, we are seeing positive comps in hosiery and costume jewelry. We just announced rollbacks on nearly 50 small appliances and in domestics, including bedding sets and comforters. Customers will see great values on names like GE, Hoover and Sharp.", "If you saw our circular that dropped the first weekend in November, you saw that we are not waiting until the day after Thanksgiving to have blitz prices on hot items at Wal-Mart. We had excellent sell-through on our $398 laptop computer. Interesting, many units were sold immediately when the ad broke. We saw strong sales between midnight and 1 a.m.", "More importantly, we are leveraging our conversion rates on our extended product care warranty plans, electronic accessories and our credit card offerings. Our price leadership is evident with our $4 generic prescription offering in pharmacy. This program continues to exceed our expectations. In the Florida pilot, pharmacy sales grew at more than twice the rate of our initial sales projections. The 26 states launched since Florida continue to exceed our expectations. We believe that pharmacy sales will continue to improve as we add on more states.", "This week, we will finally wrap up our last bit of remodeling and special projects for the calendar year. Our timetable calls for no remodeling work or special projects to be done during the Christmas season. Remodeling will pick up again in January of next year and will continue well into next fiscal year. Please remember though, while we have seen some negative impact on sales during construction, we also have seen an increase in comps after the remodel is finished.", "Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we are up against a strong November last year and continuing hurricane recovery. These events make our comparisons very difficult for the fourth quarter. However, we are excited about the upcoming Christmas season and we feel we have the right merchandise and right customer service plans in place to meet the needs of our customers.", "So in closing, we are ready for the fourth quarter. We have reinforced the selection, quality and value that Wal-Mart is known for.", "So I wish all of you a very Merry Christmas and encourage you to shop early at a Wal-Mart store near you; and of course, online also.", "Carol Schumacher", "Thanks, John, for that update on U.S. stores. You really covered a lot of ground. So before we move on, a lot of people have noted to us that gas prices have moderated and yet our comps are still low. What is your take on why sales have been off?", "John Menzer", "Carol, that's a great question. We really underestimated the positive impact of hurricane sales last year. Sales are impacted this year certainly in the Southeast. We are also seeing impacts in markets such as Dallas and Houston, Texas. There are other economic factors in place such as higher interest rates, but gas prices still remain the number one concern among our customers, according to our monthly market research.", "Carol Schumacher", "John, what are you seeing in the Wal-Mart side of the business that leaves you feeling upbeat given the company's flat November guidance for the U.S.?", "John Menzer", "Well, regarding sales, we have a strong marketing plan for these holidays. We'll have more circulars this holiday season in November and December than last year. We also had a strong November last year, but we tailed off in the month of December and so we have a more balanced advertising program this year, between the two months.", "As you have seen, we also moved our pricing early to show price leadership in toys and electronics. In toys, our margins were hurt slightly; but some were planned, some will provide markdown savings so that overall, our profit in the category will be near or at plan. Sales have been down slightly possibly to the impact in our layaway shift. But we are seeing benefits in these items and we are seeing huge sales increases in these toy areas.", "In the electronics area, our sales are at or near plan. We are seeing a big growth in our new categories such as flat panel TVs, MP3 players, laptops and cell phones. But this is tempered with declines in our more mature categories such as music, DVD players and telephones. Flat panel TVs are running a triple-digit comp increase.", "Regarding margins, we have a broader merchandise price mix focus this year; an example is as we talked about in electronics. Also, we have very strong merchandise offerings this season, so we are really excited about the season coming up.", "Carol Schumacher", "Thanks, John. Now let's turn to international.", "Charles Holley", "As Tom noted, the disposition of our operations in South Korea and Germany were completed during the quarter, and are considered to be discontinued operations. This means the results of those operations for these countries are excluded from the following discussion and figures for international.", "International sales from continuing operations for the third quarter were $19.2 billion; that is a 33.7% increase over the prior year. This sales increase includes the impact of our acquisition in Southern Brazil and the consolidation of Seiyu in Wal-Mart Central America. Sales from these entities contributed 18.6 percentage points of the increase in international sales. Our strongest sales performances in the quarter came from Mexico, Brazil, China and Argentina. The third quarter impact of currency evaluation on sales was a benefit of $488 million, driven primarily by a strengthening in the British pound, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, partially offset by a weakening of the Mexican peso.", "Operating income for the third quarter was ahead of plan at $997 million. That is up 18.1% over the prior year. Operating income growth lagged sales growth, primarily due to the dilutive impact of the recent acquisitions, which only added 3.3 percentage points to the growth in the international operating income.", "Gross margin was up slightly versus the third quarter of last year, largely as a result of the acquisitions and improvements in Canada and Mexico. Operating expenses were up as a percentage of sales, primarily as a result of the acquisitions. The operating expense increase more than offset the improvement in margin, leading to operating income that was down slightly as a percentage of sales. There was a $25 million positive impact from currency on the third quarter operating income.", "Now let's discuss highlights by country. Wal-Mart Mexico had a great quarter, continuing positive trends from recent quarters. Operating income in Mexico grew faster than sales when compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Total sales for the quarter were up 16.8% in real terms, adjusted for inflation. The real comp store sales increase during the quarter was 5.3%.", "We continue to see very consistent growth among all formats in Mexico. The main driver of the sales increase continues to be customer count with a 16.3% total increase during the quarter. Average ticket was up as well. Operating expenses in Mexico grew 15% in real terms, reflecting leverage of the sales increase. This leverage was driven mainly by associate productivity. Our expansion program in Mexico added 39 units during the quarter. We are pleased to note that as we continue to add units in Mexico, our returns continue to increase. In fact since 1999, each and every quarter we have seen returns increase versus the previous year.", "Now let's turn to the United Kingdom. We are encouraged to see continued improvement in the UK. With each month, we have seen stronger comps and we're pleased to say that in the third quarter, ASDA achieved plans for both sales and operating income. The improved operating income performance in the quarter reflects both improved gross margins and successful cost reduction programs. We are particularly proud of the way the UK team recognized opportunities for improvement at the start of the year and built action plans around these. Those plans are now delivering positive results. There is more to come and we are encouraged about the fourth quarter.", "Total sales were up in the high single-digits. Comp store sales continue to improve and were up in the low single-digits, with a positive trend in both traffic and ticket. Compared to the third quarter last year, an additional 1 million customers have started shopping at ASDA, which is a reflection of the improvements in pricing, assortment and customer experience. Many of the initiatives put into place earlier in the year contributed to the recovery, including new George home ranges, new pet and baby departments and new fresh food ranges. The result has been increased market share over the last 12 weeks.", "During the quarter, ASDA relaunched its premium extra special food range and doubled the number of SKUs to almost 800. In addition, there was a threefold increase in the number of organic SKUs to 900. In the third quarter, ASDA opened seven new stores, including four SuperStores, one SuperCenter, one ASDA Living and one George store. This brings the total to 14 new stores so far this year, with a further eight to open in the last quarter.", "In Canada, total sales in Canadian dollars increased in the mid single-digits for the third quarter, while comp sales grew in the low single-digits. Operating income grew faster than sales for the third quarter. Canadian sales were strongest in ladies wear, food, housewares and appliances, pets and infants. Following our openings of the three SuperCenters in Canada, we have seen strong customer response in terms of both traffic and ticket.", "Brazil comps were in the upper single-digits for the third quarter. Our total country operations in Brazil were ahead of plan in sales and operating income. We are pleased with the performance of our two recent acquisitions in the Northeast and the South, both of which are growing sales above our initial expectations and delivering financial results ahead of plan. Argentina continues to deliver a strong performance with comps in real terms up in the low double-digits for the third quarter.", "Puerto Rico sales were up in the mid single-digits for the third quarter as a result of store expansion activities. Comp sales were slightly below last year, impacted by a trend of lower consumption. As we saw in the first half of the year, Puerto Rico is experiencing an economic downturn. This downturn, coupled with a government expense reduction program and the pending initiation of a sales tax continues to present a challenge for our operations in Puerto Rico. Third quarter operating income was short of plan and lower than the prior period.", "Wal-Mart Central America continues to deliver positive results. This recent acquisition delivered third quarter sales growth in the low double-digits over the same period last year. Sales and operating income were ahead of plan for the third quarter.", "Turning now to Asia. China's comps grew in the mid double-digits for the third quarter. While sales were slightly below plan for the quarter, our bottom line was ahead of plan. We continue to see progress in Japan. Third quarter comp sales remain positive, continuing the trend from the first and second quarters. Seiyu's gross margin percentage in the third quarter remained flat to last year, while expenses continue to track below plan. Operating income was below plan, due to a slight shortfall in sales and retail price investment in targeted categories.", "Now I will turn it back over to Tom to discuss our Sam\u2019s Club segment results and our outlook for the rest of the year.", "Tom Schoewe", "Charles, thanks a lot. This was a challenging quarter for Sam\u2019s Club. Overall, sales grew by 1.9%, due in part to difficult comparisons resulting from last year's hurricane recovery buying and also due to a decline in fuel sales. Approximately two-thirds of Sam\u2019s Clubs in the U.S. own and operate fuel stations.", "For the first nine months of this year, Sam\u2019s Club increased overall sales by 4.5%. Excluding fuel, comp sales at Sam\u2019s Club increased 1.8% during the quarter and 2.8% for the first nine months. Fuel sales impacted the Sam\u2019s Club and total U.S. comparable store sales figures for the quarter ending October 31, 2006 by a negative 1.8 percentage points and a negative 0.3% respectively. Including the impact of fuel sales, the Sam\u2019s Club comp store sales figures for the quarter ended October 31, 2006 would have been flat. For the nine months ended October 31, fuel sales actually had no impact on the comp store sales figures at Sam\u2019s.", "Sam\u2019s Club continued its trend of growing operating income faster than sales. This is the fifth quarter in a row that Sam\u2019s has grown operating income faster than sales. Operating income increased 4.1% for the quarter and 6.7% for the nine months. Operating income growth was the result of higher membership revenues and expanded gross margins, which more than offset an increase in operating expenses. The property insurance recoveries added 1.8 percentage points to the operating income at Sam\u2019s Club.", "Unlike previous quarters, Sam\u2019s Club inventory levels grew at a higher rate than sales. The increase was primarily due to inventory buildups in October of electronics and of seasonal inventories to support our holiday catalog. The catalog was mailed out the first week of November. That would be a week later than last year. Our expectation is that comp sales will improve during the fourth quarter, as Sam\u2019s Club focuses on serving both Business and Advantage members during this important holiday selling season.", "During the quarter, we added seven new clubs and relocated or expanded five clubs. We now operate 574 clubs in the U.S.", "Now let's transition from Sam\u2019s back to the consolidated corporate results and discuss our expectations for the rest of the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect U.S. comp store sales to increase in the range of 1% to 2%. This guidance reflects our previous November forecast. We expect earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter to be between $0.88 and $0.92 per share. That results in a full year forecast for EPS from continuing operations of $2.85 to $2.89 per share.", "With that, I would like to thank you for listening in this morning. Carol and Pauline will be available for questions and as always, have just a great day.", "Question-and-Answer  Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Schoewe - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ", " Charles Holley - Executive Vice President and Treasurer ", " Eduardo Castro-Wright - President and Chief Executive Officer, Wal-Mart Stores", "This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and is intended solely for use of Wal-Mart shareholders. It should not be reproduced in any way.", "This call will contain statements that Wal-Mart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and intended to enjoy the protection of Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the use of the word or phrases: expect, invest, may impact, opening, plan, will be, will continue, will enhance, will have, will reflect, and will take or a variation on one of those words or phrases in those statements, or by the use of words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, descriptions of our objectives, plans, goals, targets, or expectations are forward-looking statements.", "These statements discuss, among other things, our anticipated U.S. comparable store sales for the current fiscal quarter and our anticipated earnings per share from continuing operations for the current fiscal quarter and for fiscal year 2008; our anticipated tax rate for fiscal year 2008; potential quarterly volatility in that tax rate and the factors that may impact that tax rate; our planned completion of the full rollout of our new associate scheduling system to all U.S. stores; our expectations for electronic product selection and presentation in supercenters and discount stores in the U.S.; our expectations regarding pressure on margins in our U.S. stores as a result of markdowns and higher inventory in soft lines; our expectation for merchandise mix during the second half of the year in our U.S. stores; our expectations regarding sales in certain categories in our U.S. stores; our expectations relating to inventory management in our U.S. stores; our expectation regarding steps to address issues relating to our gross margins in our U.S. stores; our expectations regarding the opening of stores in ASDA regional food distribution hubs during the fiscal year 2008; the expectations as to the availability of access to ASDA's online home grocery shopping in fiscal 2008; our expectations for the rate of growth of our capital expenditures in fiscal 2008; and our anticipated expansions of supercenters in Canada and investments in our Canadian supply chain infrastructure; our expectations for comparable store sales of Seiyu Ltd. for the current year and the anticipation and expectations of Wal-Mart and its management as to future occurrences and trends.", "These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors domestically and internationally including the cost of goods, competitive pressures, inflation, consumer spending patterns and debt levels, currency exchange fluctuations, trade restrictions, changes in tariff and freight rate, fluctuations in the cost of gasoline, diesel fuel and other energy, transportation, utilities, labor and healthcare, accident costs, casualty and other insurance costs, interest rate fluctuations, capital market conditions, geopolitical conditions, weather conditions, storm-related damage to our facility, regulatory matters, and other risks.", "We discuss certain of these matters more fully in our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and the information on this call should be read in conjunction with that annual report on Form 10-K, and together with our other filings including current reports on Form 8-K we have made with the SEC through the date of this call.", "We urge you to consider all of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements we make on this call.

That measure and our return on investment as discussed in this call may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available for review on the Investor Relations portion of our corporate website at www.walmartstores.com/investors.", "Carol Schumacher ", "Welcome to the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. first quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2008. This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations. The replays of this call and related materials about this quarter are available on our website.", "Here is our agenda for today's call. First up Lee Scott, Wal-Mart Stores President and CEO who will provide comments on the company's overall performance; Tom Schoewe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will get behind our financial results; Eduardo Castro-Wright, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wal-Mart Stores Division, will update results and direction for the U.S. operations; Charles Holley, Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, will review the results of SAM'S CLUB and International; and, Tom will close with guidance for the second quarter of this fiscal year.", "The store count and square footage updates through the first quarter are available on our website, www.walmartstores.com/investors. Also on the website you will find a new document explaining how we calculate ROI, or return on investment, as well as an update on our new metric used to monitor leverage, cash flow from operations to average debt. Tom will cover ROI later on the call.", "Before we get started, I would like to let you know about a change to our internal management reporting that impacts the company's segment reporting. As you know, the company has three operating segments -- Wal-Mart Stores division, International, and SAM'S CLUB -- and measures the profit of its segments as segment operating income. As Tom noted during the fourth quarter fiscal 2007 earnings call, there are certain operating income items that have not been included historically in the operating income of the three operating segments.", "We typically refer to these items as corporate overhead, but many of you do know this as our other segment. These other operating income items primarily consist of expenses for overhead functions such as legal and finance which are managed at the corporate level and are not included in the three operating segments. Since our segment reporting follows our internal management reporting, this other segment has also historically included unusual or infrequent income and expenses that are accounted for at the corporate level, rather than within the operating segments.", "At the beginning of this fiscal year FY 2008 we revised the criteria used to measure the profit of our operating segments. The result of the new measurement criteria is to now include within each operating segment certain direct operating income items that had previously been accounted for at the corporate level and included in the other segment. As a result, all prior year measurements of segment profits have been restated for comparative purposes. This methodology is consistent with certain changes we've made to our internal management reporting.", "As you know, FASB Interpretation Number 48, Accounting For Uncertain Tax Positions, better known as FIN-48 became effective this quarter. In connection with our implementation of FIN-48, we have reported a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of $160 million, representing additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as measured under this new standard.", "Now let's get onto the news on Wal-Mart's first quarter of fiscal 2008.", "Lee Scott ", "Thank you, Carol and welcome, everyone. Our start to fiscal 2008 resulted in net sales of almost $85.4 billion, an increase of more than 8% for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Net income from continuing operations rose more than 6% from the prior year. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were $0.68 per share, up from $0.64 per share for last year's first quarter.", "These are again record sales and earnings, but they were not where we would have expected to be, nor where we believe they should be. We increased sales and earnings per share from continuing operations and we kept expenses in check, which Tom will cover in more detail on this call. Quite honestly, we're not satisfied with our overall performance.", "Let me touch now on each of our operating segments. International, which is now 23% of our total sales, had a great quarter. This remains our fastest-growing operations segment and is led by Vice Chairman Mike Duke. Sales were up 18.5% over last year and we are pleased with how the most recent acquisitions continue to be integrated into the Wal-Mart culture of delivering great value. Many of you may not be aware of the rising prices and heightened inflation concerns in Mexico. Our management team at WalMex clearly looks to the long-term when they launched an extensive rollback campaign on basic products like tortillas and produce intended to counteract inflation concerns. Charles will discuss later how this did have some slight impact on international's gross margin. But the end result was increased customer loyalty and a strengthening of our price leadership position in the Mexican market. ", " In the UK, the ASDA management team put in place last year an aggressive strategic business plan to broaden the appeal of its brand in local communities. Charles will provide more context for how ASDA has accelerated comparable store sales and traffic, but let me highlight one fact: since mid 2005, ASDA's tracking system shows that ASDA has gained approximately 1.5 million new customers, of which approximately half were in comp stores.", "Turning to SAM'S CLUB, the clubs continue to be very focused on delivering ways that members can save, whether it is the convenience store owner or a mother with five children. We are pleased that under Doug McMillan's leadership, SAM's again grew profits faster than sales. They've now done this for the past seven quarters.", "Wal-Mart U.S. experienced a tremendous amount of change during this past year. We're in the second year of an ambitious three-year strategic plan that Eduardo Castro-Wright, President and CEO for Wal-Mart Stores Division, is leading to improve our business. While some points in the plan have not delivered the results yet that we would like to see, the core of that plan, improving our customer service and improving returns, is critical to continued success for our company.", "Our core U.S. grocery business continues to do very well. Food and consumables are leading the way for our Wal-Mart supercenters. The $4 generic prescription program performed better than we had expected in delivering double-digit comps for our pharmacy at both Wal-Mart and SAM'S CLUB.", "We know well the challenges in the United States. The top three concerns among discount store shoppers are all economics. Number 1 is money or income, number 2 is the cost of living and number 3, gas prices. Obviously saving money is important to our customers. You will see us be more committed than ever to price leadership.", "Further, Wal-Mart U.S. is committed to winning back the gains we made last year in inventory management. To do that, we also must make sure that we have the right merchandise in stock, whether it is apparel or deodorant, for the customers in every community that we serve. We must deliver value regardless of weather and energy prices and our associates must be there when our customers are shopping.", "We have some challenges for the rest of this fiscal year, but I am confident in the ability of the leadership team of this company to meet those head on and deliver better results. I look forward to seeing many of you at our shareholders meeting in Northwest Arkansas on June 1 and hearing your thoughts and questions about our business.", "Tom will cover more details about the financial results.", " Thomas Schoewe ", "Lee, thank you very much. We appreciate you for joining us to hear more news about Wal-Mart's first quarter of fiscal 2008. Let's get started at the highest level. To recap a little of what Lee has already said about the first quarter, total sales for the company were up 8.3%. In addition, U.S. comp store sales were 0.6% in the first quarter. Income from continuing operations increased 6.2%. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.68 and while the impact on consolidated net income was insignificant, operating income within the segments was impacted by two special items, one favorable and one unfavorable. All of the numbers I'll talk about right now are before tax.", "First, the favorable item. We recorded a federal excise tax refund with interest of approximately $97 million related to prior sales of prepaid phone cards at both Wal-Mart stores and SAM'S CLUB. This favorably impacted operating income by $85 million; $46 million for the Wal-Mart segment and $39 million for the SAM'S CLUB segment, and interest by $12 million.", "Now the unfavorable item. During the quarter we recorded a charge of approximately $83 million as a result of certain litigation. This charge is reported as additional operating expense, of which approximately $73 million is charged to the Wal-Mart Stores segment and remaining $10 million to SAM'S CLUB.", "Before Eduardo Castro-Wright covers the details about the Wal-Mart U.S. results, let me touch on some of the key financial metrics from our consolidated financial statement, things like gross margin, expenses, inventory, membership and other income, and finally, net interest expense.", "First, consolidated gross margin was down 8 basis points for the first quarter, primarily due to the U.S. stores. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up approximately 7 basis points over last year, but essentially flat to last year, excluding the charge for certain litigation. The fact that we kept SG&A expenses in check is positive given the challenges associated with leveraging a weak sales performance here in the United States.", "Inventory management did not meet our expectations for the first quarter. Consolidated inventories were up 10.3% against the year-to-date sales increase of 8.3%. The soft sales environment negatively impacted our inventory performance during the first quarter. We continue to be focused on our internal goal of growing inventory at half the rate of the sales increase.", "We continue to have a good report on membership and other income, up approximately 22% for the first quarter over last year. Among the highlights in this category:", "First, SAM'S CLUB membership fee income improved again during the first quarter.", "Second, financial services had a stellar performance with continued growth on all fronts. The basic money services led by money transfers, bill payments and check cashing all posted above plan growth. Our financial services operation serves more than 2 million customers each week.", "Last, recycling income. The company's sustainability efforts are clearly paying off.", "Interest expense was up 6.5%. If we remove the interest component of the excise tax gain, net interest expense would have grown by an additional 3.3 percentage points. This is actually pretty good performance considering the headwind with our higher inventory levels and the associated debt levels.", "Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.4%. The tax rate for fiscal year 2008 is forecasted to be between 34% and 35%, although we expect to see some quarterly volatility. Factors which may impact our annual rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax matters and the mix of international versus domestic income.", "Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 78%, and that is slightly down when compared to the 79% we reported last year. Debt to total capitalization was 41.3% at the end of the first quarter this fiscal year. This is slightly below the 41.9% rate at the same time last year.", "During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $1 billion of our stock, which represented about 20 million shares. Under our current $10 billion share repurchase program, we still have the authority to repurchase approximately $3.3 billion of additional stock.", "As you know, we are focused on driving returns across our operating segment and the company. Our return on investment, or ROI, is calculated both with and without the acquisitions of Seiyu in Japan; CARHCO, now referred to as Wal-Mart Central America; Sonae, now referred to as Southern Brazil; and recently the TrustMart operations in China. ROI from continuing operations for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2007 is 19.5% and compares to 20.5% that we reported in the same period last year.ROI without the impact of the acquisitions I just mentioned is 20.4% for the 12 months ended April 30, 2007. This compares to 21% last year. The calculation and explanation of the ROI metric is posted on our website at www.walmartstores.com/investors.", "Last, let's review capital spending. Our cash-flow statement reflects payments for property, plant and equipment of approximately $3.2 billion during the first quarter. Our actual spending shows a decrease of approximately 2% from last year. Our forecast for capital spending for fiscal year 2008 continues to be at or less than our square footage growth. Simply, we expect CapEx growth to be lower than our sales growth. Our current real estate review process ensures that we apply stringent guidelines for returns on future projects.", "With that, I would like to now turn it over to Eduardo Castro-Wright, who will share with us what's going on in Wal-Mart U.S.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright ", "Thanks, Tom. I have three agenda items to cover. First, the progress report on our three-year roadmap to improve growth and return on investment; second, a discussion on sales; and last, some brief financial details for this first quarter for the Wal-Mart Stores U.S. Division.", "Let me update you on our roadmap to improve Wal-Mart Stores U.S. Organizationally we made some major changes within the senior management team as we named several executives to new key management roles.", "Joe Simon, now Chief Operating Officer of Wal-Mart Stores; John Fleming, Chief Merchandising Officer; Stephen Quinn, Chief Marketing Officer; Pat Curran, Executive Vice President of People; Raul Vazquez, President and CEO of Walmart.com; and Michael Fong, Chief Financial Officer of the Wal-Mart Stores. While this senior leadership team has great depth and is focused on improving the customer experience, everyone is in a new role.", "We had a number of initiatives in the first quarter to help us deliver improvements. Let me touch on this. During the first quarter we continued to see increases in labor productivity. We are already seeing the benefits of having implemented the new front-end scheduling system throughout the chain. Our goal is to ensure that we match our associates' schedules to customer traffic. We plan to finish the full rollout of the new scheduling system to all departments in all U.S. stores by the end of the year.", "Let me point out that our research validates significant improvements in our customers' experience because of the scheduling system. We have surveys from more than 700 stores that look at the rate of matching scheduling to customer traffic. When we match cashier staffing to customer traffic, 85% or more of the time these stores comped 2X better in March and April than stores that did not.", "For example, the region covering Metropolitan New York continues to show improving customer satisfaction scores with shopping experience showing an 8.5% improvement this year over last year, and a 15% improvement in low price perception year over year. In addition, our work toward improving the customer experience includes significant progress in the development of new merchandising systems. These are designed to facilitate application of the new space optimization and modular planning tools. Why are these important? Because these tools, along with the continued work on our customer segmentation research, allows us to improve the way we merchandise our stores community by community.", "Last week you heard about our April comparable store sales performance. You can see weather negatively impacted comps in many of our categories. We were very disappointed with our soft performance in the quarter with comps that were about flat. Comps continue to be pressured by softer traffic.", "Having said that, there are some positives. Of our six business categories, half performed at or above plan in the first quarter. Groceries driven by food, health and wellness driven by pharmacy, and entertainment. However, the strength in these categories was not enough to offset the soft performance in apparel and home during the first quarter and the impact of weather on hard lines. Home and apparel were impacted by colder weather as most of the retail industry experienced.", "Supercenter food sales grew by more than 13.4% in the first quarter of the year and supercenter food comp sales were in the mid single-digits. The Neighborhood Markets, part of our Wal-Mart segment, had strong sales performance this quarter and also had comparable store sales figures in the mid single-digits. We continue to be pleased with Neighborhood Markets.", "Our pharmacy area continues to see benefits from the $4 generic prescription program. Comps in the prescription area continue to run in the mid-teens.", "Also, we are pleased with the results we're seeing from the completed electronics special projects. We're seeing improved sales performance in the completed stores of between 50 and 150 basis points. Just yesterday, Wal-Mart announced that many of the best-known and new electronic brands will be available in U.S. stores this week. The change includes new products with great value prices. Some of the brands will be carried for the first time by Wal-Mart. The new brands are Samsung, Skype, Visio, and Philips. The selection will be larger for the most popular digital, communications and home entertainment items. New signage and pictures will enhance the presentation of these brands. Wal-Mart also stepped up its training for associates serving in the electronics department.", "We are currently testing a new version of our home pilot in 10 markets. I am optimistic about this trial because initial customer reaction is very positive; however, it is too early to know what the impact will be on comparable store sales. As previously indicated, our businesses in home and apparel, our higher margin categories, have been underperforming. This did add pressure to our gross margins during the first quarter. We will continue to see pressure on margins because of markdowns and higher inventory in our soft lines. We hope to see improvements in this area by the back-to-school season. The season really kicks off for our customers in July.", "In the meantime, we're ready for spring and summer with core items like T-shirts and jeans, merchandise mix for the second half of this year will reflect the preferences of our broad customer base community by community. This month we already are seeing the same kind of lift in the hard lines area that we saw with more favorable weather at the end of March. I believe we will continue to see a pickup in demand for things like lawn and garden products, sporting goods, and seasonal merchandise.", "As you can see, we have a lot going on. However, we still have to translate the activities and new processes into a three-year roadmap to improve financial performance.", "So let's recap the financial results for the first quarter for Wal-Mart Stores. Let's start with operating income, which was up 1.8% on a 5.6% sales increase for the first quarter. The benefit from the refund of the excise tax was offset by the charge for certain litigation. The net impact of these two items was a reduction in operating income of approximately 5 basis points as a percent of sales.", "Gross margin in the Wal-Mart segment decreased by 12 basis points during the first quarter. We saw pressure on gross margins during the quarter from increased markdowns, higher inventory, and higher shrinkage. We are concerned about shrinkage and are investigating the cause and are taking steps to correct it.", "Our initial margins on general merchandise increased from last year's first quarter and markdowns as a percent of sales were up only slightly from the same quarter last year. Due to the sales shortfall and in spite of labor productivity gains, we were not able to leverage our cost structure. Total expense as percentage of sales rose 29 basis points when compared to the first quarter last year. Also, this had a negative impact on our ability to grow inventory at [half the rate] of sales. Inventory in the Wal-Mart segment increased by 9% on a 5.6% sales increase for the first quarter.", "I am hopeful that this gives you a best view of the short-term initiatives that we faced and that our three-year roadmap provides you with confidence that we have a solid plan to improve sales and returns.", "Charles will now report on SAM'S CLUB and International.", " Charles Holley ", "Thanks, Eduardo. I'll start with some of the recent developments of SAM'S CLUB as well as share more on the club's performance. Overall sales for SAM'S grew by 5.6% during the quarter to $10.3 billion. First-quarter comp club sales, excluding fuel operations, increased by 4.7% over the prior year quarter. Membership fees have fully cycled the $5 increase that took effect in January 2006. Membership revenue in the first quarter was on plan and grew at a faster pace than top line sales volume. We continue to focus on building membership, both business and advantage at all of our clubs.", "SAM'S CLUB also leveraged expenses during the first quarter. The club operations team did a good job of keeping costs down with a particular focus on non payroll-related expenses. This in turn allowed us to lower gross margin rates slightly and pass further savings on to our members.", "SAM'S is not without challenges and the management team is working hard to improve performance in some key areas. One of those is inventory management which is not currently at the standards we expect. With continued focus, we anticipate that inventory turns will improve as the year progresses.", "SAM'S CLUB grew profits faster than sales, continuing the trend of the last seven quarters. Operating income for the quarter was $363 million, a 19.8% increase over the prior year quarter. Factoring out the net positive benefit of special items that Tom previously discussed -- the excise tax refund and litigation charge -- profits still grew faster than sales at 10.6%.", "Now let's move to International. International sales from continuing operations for the first quarter were $19.6 billion and represented 23% of total company sales. That is an 18.5% increase over the prior year. Our strongest sales performances in the quarter came from Mexico, United Kingdom, Brazil, China, and Argentina. The first quarter impact of currency valuation on sales was a benefit of $622 million driven primarily by strengthening in the British pound, partially offset by a weakening of the Mexican peso.", "Operating income for the first quarter was ahead of plan at $903 million. That is up 19.3% over the prior year. Gross margin was down slightly versus the first quarter of last year, largely as a result of a rollback pricing campaign in Mexico that Lee mentioned earlier in the call. Mexico's campaign was partially offset by gross margin improvement in the UK.", "Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were slightly down from the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Other income as a percentage of sales increased in the first quarter largely because of real estate development activities at ASDA. The slight decline in gross margin was offset by the other income increase, leading to operating income as a percentage of sales that was up slightly from the first quarter of last year. There was an insignificant impact from currency on the first quarter operating income.", "Now let's discuss highlights by country. We are excited about the strong start to fiscal 2008 at our ASDA operations. The UK team has delivered increasing results over the previous 12 months. For the quarter, sales were up in the low double-digits, driven primarily by traffic. Let me reiterate what Lee said earlier. Since mid-2005, ASDA's tracking system shows that ASDA has attracted around 1.5 million new customers, of which approximately half were in comp stores.", "Comp sales continue to strengthen with mid single-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter during which comp sales had accelerated. Food, general merchandise, and George apparel all had improved comp performances for the quarter. Operating income was ahead of plan and grew faster than sales, reflecting an ongoing cost reduction program including initiatives to reduce energy consumption.", "The acceleration in comp sales and traffic is an outcome of a strategic business plan that was designed to broaden the appeal of the ASDA brand through three horizons.", "First, improved execution in all phases of customer service;", "Second, differentiation with competitors;", "Finally, development of new channels and formats.", "The first horizon involved ASDA improving core business metrics. We are pleased to note in stock improvement and an almost 30% reduction in customers needing to queue at the checkout. On pricing, ASDA is consistently the price leader in the UK as reported by a number of independent surveys such as the Grocer Magazine survey. Further, ASDA has launched a more aggressive closing and general merchandise pricing strategy under the banner of Why Pay More?", "The second horizon was focused on differentiation. Food service and George departments are being remodeled and private-label product development continues aggressively on schedule, particularly in the areas of increased consumer interests such as healthy, organic and premium food ranges. A refocused marketing program is reinforcing ASDA's points of difference and building on ASDA's reputation as a commonsense retailer. ASDA is also leading the way in local sourcing, working with more than 3,000 local vendors, shipping through ten award-winning regional food distribution hubs with another five opening this year.", "The final horizon is around future growth platforms. Upgrading the ASDA.com proposition has included the launch of online furniture and electronics offerings with encouraging results and the extension of the grocery home shopping service. By the end of this year, every ASDA customer will have access to our online grocery home shopping service. In addition, we remain excited about the performance of ASDA Living with two new stores opening this quarter.", "We're delighted that the progress ASDA has made in improving the customer proposition has translated into market share gains. For the 12 weeks ending March 25th, ASDA recorded its highest ever market share at 11.9% according to the latest TNS Data, and has been the fastest-growing major food retailer within the UK for each of the last four months.", "Now let's turn to Wal-Mart Mexico. Wal-Mart Mexico had another great quarter, continuing positive trends from recent quarters. After inflation, first-quarter operating income in Mexico grew faster than sales when compared to the first quarter of last year. This occurred despite expenses related to the bank operation and the cost of a coupon program with the Mexico City government. Total sales for the quarter were up 14.1% in real terms, adjusted for inflation. The real comp store sales increase during the quarter was 5.9%. We continue to see very consistent growth among all formats in Mexico.", "The main driver of the sales increase continues to be customer count, with a 15% total increase during in the quarter. Average ticket was down slightly due to a large rollback campaign on basic products. Our management team in Mexico clearly looks to the long term, approaching this rollback campaign as an investment that will result in increased customer loyalty and a strengthening our price position in the Mexican market.", "The first quarter operating expenses in Mexico grew 12% in real terms, reflecting leverage of the sales increase. This leverage was driven mainly by associate productivity. As has been the case for some time, we are pleased to note that as we continue to add units in Mexico, our returns continue to increase.", "In Canada, total sales in Canadian dollars increased in the mid single-digits for the first quarter while comp sales grew in the low single-digits. Sales were adversely affected by the late arrival of spring this season and a slower than anticipated sell through of seasonal merchandise. Canadian sales were strongest in food, consumables, automotive and vision.", "As previously mentioned, we continue to see positive results in our new Canadian supercenters both in terms of customer traffic and ticket, and are pleased with how the Canadian customer continues to embrace this concept. We will continue to expand the number of supercenters both through new and expanded stores as well as invest in the supply chain infrastructure to support this growth throughout the upcoming year.", "Brazil comps were in the upper single-digits for the quarter. Our total country operations in Brazil were ahead of plan in sales and operating income. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our two recent acquisitions in the Northeast and the South, both of which are growing sales above our initial expectations and delivering financial results ahead of plan.", "Argentina continues to deliver a strong performance with comps in real terms up in the high teens for the quarter. In February, we launched a new store format in Argentina named Changomas. This format is similar to a Mexican bodega and provides the customers a place to buy everything a family needs at the best price and with better proximity than hypermarkets. This format is focused on an underserved customer segment which represents 70% of the country's population. Following its opening, the first Changomas store has delivered an excellent performance with sales well above initial plans.", "First quarter sales in Puerto Rico were up slightly over last year while operating income was ahead of plan. Comp sales were slightly below last year, impacted by a continuing trend of lower consumption. Wal-Mart Central America continues to deliver positive results. Sales in real terms in the region grew in the low double digits over the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Real comps were positive in the low single-digits. Operating income in Central America was ahead of plan for the first quarter.", "Turning now to Asia, in Japan we continue to be pleased with the performance of our remodeled stores. We completed an additional seven remodels during the quarter against a full year plan of 70. The first quarter operating income was essentially flat to plan while comp sales were a negative 0.7%. However, Seiyu's forecast for comps for the full year is a positive 1.7%. Gross margin was flat to last year.", "Wal-Mart China's comps grew in the mid double-digits for the first quarter during which we also opened ten new stores. Sales were only slightly off plan due to temporary delays in store openings. We are excited about our recent investment in 101 TrustMart stores which operate in 34 cities throughout China. This investment is an important step in bringing additional scale to our China retail operations.", "Now Tom will update our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2008.", "Thomas Schoewe ", "Thanks, Charles. For the second quarter, we expect a comparable store sales increase for the U.S. to be between 1% and 2%. We expect earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter to come in between $0.75 and $0.79 per share. As always, we will be available to answer your questions.

This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores Incorporated and intended solely for the use of Wal-Mart shareholders. It should not be reproduced in any way.", "This call will contain statements that Wal-Mart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that act. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the use of the words or phrases could be, estimate, expect, expected, forecast and will continue in those statements. Similarly, descriptions or objectives, plans, goals, targets or expectations are forward-looking statements.", "These statements discuss, among other things, our anticipated U.S. comparable store sales for the current fiscal quarter and our anticipated earnings per share from continuing operations for the current fiscal quarter and for fiscal year 2008; our anticipated tax rate for fiscal year 2008 and potential quarterly volatility in that tax rate; our expectations for continuation of trends in back-to-school buying; our expectations for moderation of shrink in future periods; our expectations for the opening of facilities in India; our expectations for the opening of additional supercenters in Canada and investment and supply chain infrastructure in Canada; and the anticipation and expectations of Wal-Mart and its management as to future occurrences and trends.", "These forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties and other factors domestically and internationally including the cost of goods, competitive pressures, inflation, consumer spending patterns and debt levels, currency exchange fluctuations, trade restrictions, changes in tariff and freight rates; fluctuations in the cost of gasoline, diesel fuel and other energy; transportation, utilities, labor and healthcare; accident costs, casualty and other insurance costs; interest rate fluctuations, capital market conditions; geo-political conditions; weather conditions; storm-related damage to our facilities; regulatory matters and other risks.", "We discuss certain of these matters more fully in our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and the information on this call should be read in conjunction with that annual report on Form 10-K and together with all our other filings including current report on Form 8-K we\u2019ve made with the SEC through the date of this call.", "We urge you to consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements we make in this call.

That measure, our return on investment and our cash flow coverage ratio as discussed in this call, may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are available for review on the investor relations portion of our corporate website at www.WalMartStores.com/Investors.", "Carol Schumacher", "Welcome to the Wal-Mart Stores second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2008. This is Carol Schumacher in the Investor Relations department. The replays of this call and rebated materials about the quarter are available on our website.", "Here\u2019s the agenda for today\u2019s call. Lee Scott will kick it off with a look at the overall company and thoughts for the second half of the year, Tom Schoewe has the details on consolidated financial results. Eduardo Castro-Wright will update you on the progress and plans for our U.S. business; and Charles Holley has the international and SAM\u2019s CLUB review for the quarter. Tom will come back and close with our guidance for third quarter comps, as well as an update on our earnings per share guidance for the third quarter and the year.", "As a reminder, the store counts and square footage updates through the second quarter are available on our website, walmartstores.com/investors. We also have posted on the site an update to the return on investment and return on assets schedule which reflects our performance through the second quarter. And, there is a new investment community communications policy which details how we handle discussions about everything from guidance to details on our business. One key point I\u2019d like to reiterate, we provide an update to earnings guidance after the second month of the quarter when we\u2019re doing our sales releases.", "Thanks and let\u2019s move onto the results.", "Lee Scott", "Welcome to the Wal-Mart Stores Incorporated report on the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. Although there are always some successes to talk about in our business, overall this quarter was challenging. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were $0.76 per share up from $0.72 per share for last year\u2019s second quarter. Tom Schoewe will discuss the non-recurring benefit we received from adjustments recorded in Q2.", "We generated approximately $92 billion in total company sales in the second quarter. Although some people will report that we\u2019ve had record sales and earnings, our underlying operating performance, excluding those one-time items, was not what we expected of ourselves. In the Wal-Mart US segment, we certainly have made improvements in some areas of the store, most notably grocery, pharmacy and entertainment. Having said that, merchandising overall is still not where it needs to be. The US team is working hard to improve this. At the same time, US consumers continue to be under difficult pressure economically.", "The top concerns among our customers are economic -- money and finances, the increase in the cost of living and gas prices. It is no secret that many customers are running out of money towards the end of the month. The pay check cycle is in fact more pronounced now then it ever has been. In the midst of these challenges, our customers are seeing the value and low prices that they would expect from Wal-Mart.", "I assured you earlier this year that Wal-Mart would be the undisputed price leader. We have increased the amount of rollbacks more than 20% this year in our US stores. We have also continued to strengthen our product offering with more name brands on our shelves.", "At SAM\u2019S CLUB, we are pleased with the ongoing improvement in serving our members, particularly the small business owner. SAM\u2019S once again grew profits faster than sales.", "Among our international operations, Argentina, Brazil and China turned in the strongest performances for the quarter and just last week we announced our joint venture with Bharti in India. We also are seeing in other countries in which we operate, trends similar to those being seen in the United States as consumers are pushed by higher fuel prices, higher interest rates including those on mortgages, utility costs and generally more financial pressure. All of this is resulting in softness in sales in countries like Mexico and Canada.", "As a company, we\u2019ve been through challenging times before. We understand the dynamics of our customer and what is necessary to give us greater momentum going into the second half of the year. Our management teams are focused on three primary areas: first, great merchandising for all of our customers so they have a choice of quality products and low prices.", "Second, store execution at the highest standards. Our customers must leave the store happy because they find merchandise at low prices in stock and the checkout experience is easy and fast.", "Third, strong inventory management. We will continue to strive to report inventory growth that is half the rate of our sales growth. We are taking other steps to ensure we\u2019re on track to perform in this tough environment. As the economy slowed down this past quarter in Mexico, Wal-Mex, for example, implemented an aggressive cost reduction program that embraced every area of its operations, excluding those directly related to customer service.", "All three operating segments have a strong management team in place and they each continue to strengthen the team with additional talent. All three teams also have a clear, focused strategy moving forward. In addition, we are following through on the plan we announced in June at our shareholders\u2019 meeting to strengthen our capital efficiency program. We are executing the reduction in number of our US supercenter openings and we are committed to growth in our international operating segment, entering a market like India strategically in a way that creates and adds value. Our founder, Sam Walton, once said: you can\u2019t just keep doing what works one time. Everything around you is changing. To succeed, stay out in front of change. We are committed to making the changes we need to improve our performance in the second half of the fiscal year.", "One thing that isn\u2019t changing is our mission: Delivering low prices on great products to consumers who want to save money so they can live better. It is more relevant than ever before. We will, of course, continue to improve how we go about delivering this promise each and every day. I look forward to seeing many of you at our analyst meeting this coming October.", "Thomas Schoewe", "Lee, thank you very much, and thank you for your interest in Wal-Mart and for joining us here today. As Lee stated, the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was challenging. That being said, let\u2019s look at some of the highlights. First, total net sales for the company were up 8.8%. In addition, US comp store sales were 1.9% in the second quarter. That\u2019s above the 0.6% we reported in the first quarter of this fiscal year and above the 1.7% we reported last year in the second quarter.", "Income from continuing operations increased 4.1%. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.76 per share for the second quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were impacted by three items, providing a net benefit of $171 million after tax, or $0.04 per share. These included: first, accruals for general liability and workers compensation claims were reduced by $196 million; that\u2019s after tax; second, recognition of $41 million in after-tax gains from the sale of certain real estate properties; and finally, charges of $66 million after tax for legal and other contingencies.", "Let me take a moment to further discuss what\u2019s going on with our general liability and workers compensation accruals. Our accruals for general liability and workers compensation claims are influenced by many things, including historical claims experience which includes both frequency and severity, as well as many other actuarial assumptions. In calculating the liability, we periodically analyze our historical trends that includes loss development and apply appropriate loss development factors to the incurred cost associated with the claim.", "The good news is that during the last few years we have made a significant impact on how we managed claims so our loss experience has actually improved. As a result, the actuarially determined ultimate loss estimates primarily for fiscal years 2004 through 2007 claims were reduced this quarter. The reduction in ultimate loss estimates resulted from improved claims handling experience which impacts loss development factors and other actuarial assumptions.", "Before we get into the details of each of our three operating segments, let\u2019s look at the consolidated financial performance. Consolidated gross margin was down 33 basis points for the second quarter, primarily due to the Wal-Mart US segment. Price leadership initiatives, markdowns, inventory shrinkage and product mix all contributed to the reduction in gross margin.", "Now let\u2019s cover expenses. The consolidated operating expense percentage as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was essentially flat with the same period last year. As I just covered, there was the benefit of some of the items I discussed earlier. As a result, only SAM\u2019S CLUB actually leveraged expenses.", "Other income continues to increase, up 12.8% from Q2 last year. In addition to SAM\u2019S CLUB membership, other income categories include tenant leases, recycling income and financial services. Other income as a percentage of sales for Wal-Mart US operating segment increased by 6 basis points when compared to the same quarter in the prior year. This reflects increased recycling income and the benefits of financial services.", "In our financial services area, recall that we announced the roll-out of the Wal-Mart money centers in June. We plan to open approximately 1,000 of these centers by the end of 2008 to deliver money transfers, payroll check cashing, product care warranties and the Wal-Mart MoneyCard.", "Consolidated inventories were up 6.5% against a year-to-date sales increase of 8.6%. Let\u2019s compare those numbers to what happened in the first quarter of this year. Sales in the first quarter grew by 8.3% in the first quarter and inventory actually grew by 10.3%. What you can see is that we\u2019re making progress in inventory management. However, we did not meet our own objective of growing inventory at half of the rate of sales growth. We remain committed to improving inventory management between now and the end of the fiscal year.", "Return on investment from continuing operations for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2007 is 19.3% and compares to 20.2% reported in the same period last year. ROI without the impact of the acquisitions of Trust-Mart in China, CARHCO in Central America, Sonae in Brazil, and Seiyu in Japan was 20.2% for the 12 months ended July 31, 2007, essentially flat for the prior year.", "Net interest expense was $406 million, up 3.3% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%. That\u2019s down 43 basis points from the comparable quarter last year. We continue to expect the tax rate for fiscal 2008 to remain between 34% and 35%, although there could be some quarterly volatility.", "For the quarter, our cash from operations to average debt was approximately 38.6% and debt to total capitalization was 40.8% at the end of the second quarter of this fiscal year. This is below the 41.8% rate at the same time last year, despite year-to-date share repurchase activity. In fact, during the second quarter our board of directors approved a $15 billion share repurchase program replacing the $3.3 billion remaining on the prior $10 billion program. In this quarter we repurchased approximately $1.5 billion of our stock which represented about 31.7 million shares. We have approximately $13.6 billion remaining of the new $15 billion authorization approved by the board of directors in early June.", "Finally, let\u2019s review capital spending. Our cash flow statement reflects payments for property, plant and equipment of approximately $7 billion during the first six months of this year, an increase of 2.3% over the same period last year. This is on track with our revised $15.5 billion estimate for total capital expenditures that I discussed at the June shareholder meeting.", "With that, I\u2019d now like to turn things over to Eduardo Castro-Wright who will share with us what\u2019s going on in Wal-Mart US.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright", "Thanks, Tom. As Lee mentioned earlier, the operating performance of Wal-Mart US was not up to our expectations. Operating income at the Wal-Mart Stores division increased 3.8% on a sales increase of 6.5% for the second quarter. Wal-Mart US comparable sales figures for the second quarter was 1.2%, driven by sales in grocery, pharmacy and entertainment. While we\u2019re not happy with this quarter\u2019s results, the running rate of our comps has improved and in fact, more than doubled in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter of this year.", "Pricing leadership is paying off nicely with market share gains in grocery, pharmacy and electronics. Supercenter food sales grew by more than 14% in the second quarter of this year and food comp sales were in the mid single-digits. Our pharmacy area continued to be above plan in sales with strength in all geographic areas. Electronics overall continued to perform above plan and above last year. In fact, we\u2019ve noticed a number of analysts who have cited Wal-Mart\u2019s gain in market share. We have seen the investment made in remodels of the Electronics department and our focus on great brands by Hewlett-Packard , Apple, Sony pay off as the consumer views Wal-Mart as a destination for electronics. Wal-Mart\u2019s focus on providing top brands is yielding results. For example, we\u2019re very pleased with the response we\u2019re seeing to the sale of Dell personal computers in our stores. We started carrying a Dell laptop in Wal-Mart stores last week.", "Consumers today are pressed by a number of factors. Higher energy, higher gas prices and higher interest rates are all stretching their paychecks. Families with school-aged children are expected to spend more than $500 this year on back-to-school products. Our price campaign is designed to make a difference for families by saving them money where it counts most: on items like backpacks, pencils and socks. We\u2019re encouraged by the response we\u2019re seeing in back-to-school in August. 14 states have tax-free days during the start of this month. In addition, several states have delayed some school openings and we expect the trend we have seen with other seasons to continue. People are buying closer to the event.", "As reported by other retailers, we\u2019re experiencing similar trends in soft sales of home products driven by the slow down in housing. In addition, Wal-Mart\u2019s softness in the home and apparel categories has been compounded by the difficulties we have had this past year and have shared with you. The result is that home and apparel remain soft through the second quarter. We\u2019re starting to see some improvement in certain home categories this month and we are pleased so far with the sales results and customer response to the test of the New Home that we are piloting in several markets.", "We continue to see pressure in all areas of apparel and continue to take pricing actions needed to sell through our inventory. We\u2019re seeing some positive trends in sleepwear and men\u2019s sports apparel. In the children\u2019s areas, licensed apparel is picking up momentum and as I mentioned earlier on, we do expect our kid\u2019s apparel categories to rebound this month.", "As expected, our price leadership position and markdown activity has pressured gross margins. Wal-Mart US gross margins as a percentage of sales is down by 50 basis points from the same quarter last year. This is driven by several factors. First, our price leadership position which I have already covered. Second, merchandise mix. Because of sales strength in entertainment and grocery, our sales mix is putting more pressure gross profit. The shortfall in higher margin apparel and home categories has contributed to the decline in gross margins, as has the higher level of markdown activity to clean up inventory. Third, higher shrink. Shrink is higher than this time last year. We have put in place programs to address the shrink increase at the store level, expect moderation in future periods.", "Inventory for Wal-Mart US increased 4.8% at the end of second quarter against the sales increase of 6.5%. While this is not yet meeting the goal of growing inventory at half the rate of sales, it is significantly better than the 9% increase we experienced at the end of the first quarter of this fiscal year. Excluding the adjustments Tom covered earlier, total expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter were up approximately 19 basis points when compared to last year\u2019s second quarter.", "We experienced higher group insurance costs, higher maintenance costs related to our store remodel program and slightly higher utility costs. While expenses are growing at a slower rate than inflation, we will continue to focus on expense control in the second half of the year.", "Labor productivity continued to contribute to lower wage costs and this partially helped to offset expense pressure. As we have discussed, the scheduling system that is rolling out throughout all U.S. stores allows us to serve Wal-Mart customers better by matching schedules to customer shopping patterns.", "It is important to reiterate what we said earlier. Our US management team is strong and the organization is focused on continuing the transformation plan that we shared with you 18 months ago. We are confident that this will lead to improved sales growth and returns.", "Let me pass the microphone to Charles.", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Eduardo. Before we get to international second quarter results, let\u2019s briefly discuss India. Many of you heard our announcement last week of a joint venture with Bharti Enterprises. Under the joint venture we will operate business-to-business wholesale, cash and carry stores and operate a back-end supply chain management business. The first wholesale cash and carry facility is targeted to open by the end of next year with ten to 15 facilities expected to open during the next seven years. This is the first country Wal-Mart has entered organically in ten years. We will initially target tier 2 and 3 cities in Northern India where our business to business customers, retailers like Bharti and others, as well as restaurants, hotels and other businesses are currently served by a fragmented and inefficient distribution system. We expect this business customer to respond well to our product offerings.", "Now let\u2019s discuss international second quarter performance. International net sales from continuing operations for the second quarter were $21.6 billion. That\u2019s a 15.7% increase over the prior year. Our strongest sales performances in the quarter came from Brazil, China and Argentina. In a continuation of its first quarter performance ASDA in the United Kingdom delivered very positive sales results for the second quarter. The second quarter impact of currency valuation on sales generated a benefit of $1 billion, driven primarily by strengthening in the British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, partially offset by a weakening Japanese yen.", "Segment operating income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $1 billion. Gross margin for the segment was up slightly versus the second quarter of last year, largely as a result of improvements in the United Kingdom and Brazil.", "Operating expenses as a percentage of segment sales were up for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, largely due to the impact of the Trust- Mart acquisition and an increase in Brazil partially offset by savings in Mexico.", "Operating income grew slower than segment sales for the second quarter primarily because of sales pressures in Mexico, the Trust-Mart acquisition and India development activity. The second quarter impact of currency valuation on operating income was a ", " benefit of $45 million.", "Now let\u2019s discuss highlights by country. In the United Kingdom, ASDA has consistently outperformed the market this year. In an increasingly competitive environment the ASDA price leadership strategy has resulted in steady market share gain. Financially, this was a solid quarter with ASDA outperforming sales plans. Growth continues to be driven by strong traffic increases through comp stores and new openings. According to the T&S industry data, market share increased 0.2 percentage points year-on-year to 11.7% in the 12 weeks to July 15.", "Comp sales were up in the mid single-digits despite much tougher prior year comparables in very poor seasonal weather. Consumer spending recently has been impacted by rising interest rates, leading to more challenging market conditions and slowing growth, but despite this, ASDA is gaining market share. The progress on customer numbers and market share gain has been steady over the last 18 months and demonstrates the success of the ASDA strategy, which is even more relevant given the more value-oriented consumer.", "Customer reaction has been most positive in the following areas: ASDA has strengthened its price position with the biggest campaign ever on rollbacks across all product categories. ASDA has already been recognized as the price leader for the last ten consecutive years. Simplifying store assortment and in-store process has led to improvements in customer service, in stock and merchandising which gives range, clarity and shows value to the customer.", "Four new stores have been opened during the second quarter, including the first eco store in Shaw Oldham which opened last week and includes a number of global sustainability initiatives which should mean a 15% lower carbon footprint. In May, ASDA opened its largest ever distribution center in Doncaster, which is dedicated to general merchandise across the UK. The new DC is performing well and delivering benefits to in stock and productivity. Further progress is being made towards the goal of national coverage of home shopping for ASDA customers with order volumes up 40% so far this year.", "Now let\u2019s turn to Wal-Mart Mexico. The second quarter was a challenging one at Wal-Mart Mexico. A combination of factors impacted second quarter sales there. First, Wal-Mex was impacted by tough year-over-year comparison versus fiscal 2007 due to the comparison against last year\u2019s World Cup and the closing of the country\u2019s presidential election.", "Second, the Mexican economy is experiencing slowing growth and softening customer demand. This is driven largely by trends and money transfers into Mexico which have undergone a significant deceleration in growth from near 30% in fiscal 2007 to only 4% year to date in fiscal 2008. Wal-Mex\u2019s second quarter sales in real terms increased 8.6% versus fiscal 2007. After inflation, comp sales increased 0.9%. Although we have seen good growth in customer count there has been a decrease in the average ticket. Formats where consumer spending is more discretionary, like Suburbia and Bits Restaurant were the most affected. Likewise, we\u2019ve seen positive growth in food and consumables while the more discretionary departments such as clothing and electronics have shown slower growth.", "The softening economic environment in Mexico gave our management an opportunity to challenge themselves and improve on what we do well: being the everyday low-cost operator. During the second quarter Wal-Mex initiated an aggressive cost reduction program leading to expenses that grew slightly slower than sales. This is despite the impact of expenses from the start-up of Wal-Mex\u2019s banking operations. We are proud of our Mexican management team and their efforts in this regard. We are equally proud that despite macro economic concerns in Mexico, returns have continued to increase over fiscal 2007 levels.", "In Canada, total sales in Canadian dollars increased in the mid single-digits for the second quarter while comp sales grew in the low single-digits. Sales continued to be adversely affected by the unfavorable weather conditions affecting our seasonal merchandise. Sales were strongest in the food and electronics categories during the second quarter. The Canadian supercenters continued to perform well both in terms of customer count as well as average ticket. We will continue to expand the number of supercenters both through new and expanded stores as well as invest in the supply chain infrastructure to support this growth throughout the upcoming year. In August we opened our eighth Canadian supercenter. Several other supercenter projects are underway with phased openings during the balance of the year.", "Brazil sales were well ahead of plan in the second quarter and comps in real terms were in the low double-digits. Sales there have been driven by an improved price position, recovery of consumer purchasing power and global sourcing growth through a higher level of direct imports. Our bottom-line in Brazil was also ahead of plan for the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our total Brazilian operations, including the acquisitions in the northeast and the south.", "Argentina continues to deliver a strong performance with the sales well ahead of plan and comps in real terms up in the high teens for the quarter. Operating income in Argentina was also ahead of plan in the second quarter. Our new store format in Argentina, Chingomas, has continued its excellent performance with sales well above initial plans.", "Second quarter sales in Puerto Rico were up slightly over last year while operating income was slightly behind plan. Comp sales were slightly positive despite the continuing trend of lower consumption on the island. Wal-Mart Central America continues to deliver positive results. Sales in the region grew in the mid single-digits over the second quarter of fiscal 2007 while comps were in the low single-digits. Operating income there was ahead of plan for the second quarter.", "Turning now to Asia, in Japan we had seen increased customer traffic in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Comp sales though were slightly down for fiscal 2007 due to the weak performance in seasonal apparel and home. Seiyu\u2019s gross margin was slightly below plan as a result of the price investment program geared towards price leadership and increasing traffic. Second quarter operating income was below plan.", "Wal-Mart China comps grew in the mid double-digits for the second quarter during which we also opened one new store. Sales were only slightly off plan, partially due to temporary delays in store openings. We are excited about the steadily improving post-acquisition comp sales performance at the Trust-Mart group of companies.", "Now I\u2019ll cover SAM\u2019S CLUB. We continue to be encouraged with the performance and momentum of SAM\u2019S CLUB. Overall, net sales for SAM\u2019S grew about 8.6% to $11.4 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The segment\u2019s second quarter comp sales excluding fuel operations increased by 5.9% over the prior-year quarter. Fuel contributed 0.6% to comp sales. About 70% of our CLUBs now have fuel stations. We were in a slightly inflationary environment for fuel for the major of the quarter. Other categories that experienced inflationary impact included dairy and tobacco.", "SAM\u2019S continues to appeal most broadly to our business members. Consistent with trends from prior months, membership performance was strongest with small business owners. SAM\u2019S CLUB was once again able to leverage operating expenses during the second quarter even excluding the division share of the benefit from the three items Tom previously mentioned.", "Also contributing to our operating income and growth was an increase in gross margin, most notably from fuel sales. SAM\u2019S CLUB again grew profits faster than sales. Segment operating income was $447 million, that\u2019s an 11.2% increase over the prior year quarter. Inventory increased 4.4% over the same period last year, essentially meeting the company\u2019s goal of increasing inventory at less then half the increased sales.", "As the month of August gets underway, the CLUBs are completing transition from summer outdoor goods to a furniture gallery and back to college in many markets. September marks the next key seasonal transition time for the CLUB with the introduction of fall and Halloween merchandise.", "Let me turn it back to Tom for the update on our guidance for the third quarter for fiscal 2008.", "Thomas Schoewe", "Thanks, Charles. For the third quarter we expect a comp store sales increase for our US operations of between 1% and 3%. We expect earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter to come in between $0.62 and $0.65 per share.", "Now let\u2019s chat about full year earnings guidance. At the beginning of the fiscal year, our guidance for the year was $3.15 to $3.23 a share. Our current forecast for fiscal 2008 is $3.05 per share to $3.13 per share. This revision reflects our need to improve underlying operating performance coupled with the macro economic pressure we feel in many of our major markets including the United States, Mexico and Canada.", "We\u2019d like to thank you for your interest in Wal-Mart and have just a great day.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations. The replays of this call and related materials about the quarter are available on our website.", "Here\u2019s the agenda for today\u2019s call. Lee Scott will start with a review of the company\u2019s business and thoughts about the fourth quarter.  Tom Schoewe will cover the financial results for the company.  Eduardo Castro-Wright will talk about where things are with the Wal-Mart US business, followed by Charles Holley with details on Wal-Mart International and results country by country.  Doug McMillon has some results about SAMS CLUB and Tom will close us out with guidance for the fourth quarter.", "As of today, you can find on our website the unit counts and square footage summaries by quarter from the fiscal year 2005 through the second quarter of the current year fiscal 2008.  These updates are available specifically at www.walmartstores.com/investor under the financial information subject line on the left column.  Moving forward we will post these quarterly updates on the day that the 10-Q is filed, so the data for Q3 of fiscal year 2008 will be available when our Q is filed in late November.  We also have posted on the site an update to the return on investment and return on assets schedule which reflects our performance through the third quarter.  Now let\u2019s get on with the results.", "Lee Scott", "Thank you Carol, and welcome everyone, thank you for joining us to hear more about Wal-Mart\u2019s third quarter results.  We appreciate your interest in our business.  Three weeks ago at our analysts and investor meeting I said that as a company Wal-Mart is a growing business with a strong balance sheet and a very loyal customer base.  We are realistic about the environment that we are operating in and competing in, both in the United States and globally.  During the past few months we prepared for a more challenging, tougher macro economic environment and we believe we are well positioned to win in this environment.  Before I talk about the expectations for the Christmas season and the fourth quarter, let me focus on our results for the third quarter.", "Our results for the third quarter reflect the improved performance of our US operations.  Both Wal-Mart stores US and SAMS CLUB\u2019S increased profits faster than sales.  Wal-Mart International posted a solid quarter as well.  Earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were $.70 per share, up from $.62 per share for last year\u2019s third quarter.  A lot of the credit for our results goes to the Wal-Mart US stores, who had improvements in inventory and expense control.  Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 were almost $91 billion, that\u2019s an increase of 8.8% over the third quarter of the last fiscal year.", "You know its interesting Tom Schoewe, but if you look at the plans for the fourth quarter of Wal-Mart Stores Incorporated, we would expect to do at least $100 billion.  Our first $100 billion quarter is certainly a record for Wal-Mart.  It is interesting too; that what drives that is the Wal-Mart low cost, low price model that allows us to continue to be more and more relevant to our customers.  Times are a little tougher than they were a year ago and consumers are particularly appreciative that they can count on Wal-Mart to save them money, and that matters not just in the US, but around the world.", "Wal-Mart US continues to have three very strong businesses:  Grocery, Health and Wellness and Entertainment.   In our hard lines business, seasonal categories like Halloween showed continued strength.  With the way our stores merchandised and marketed Halloween, it is no surprise that Halloween sales did very well in every department.  With the focus from Eduardo Castor-Wright and his team, we see improving trends in both home and apparel.  In fact, I believe we will continue to see improvements in both of these categories.", "I assure you that the Wal-Mart US team continues to be focused on improving comp store sales.  You will hear more about Wal-Mart US results from Eduardo, but let me highlight just two areas.  First, operating income for Wal-Mart  US was up 11.1% on a sales increase of 6.4%.  Second, the team made significant improvement on inventory and in fact surpassed the goal of growing inventory at half the rate of sales, but I will not steal any more of Eduardo\u2019s thunder and he will discuss that later.", "SAM\u2019S CLUB continues to drive increased traffic and tickets as well as growing profits faster than sales.  And, like Wal-Mart, SAM\u2019S CLUB really managed the inventory well which leaves them at a great position for this fourth quarter.", "Internationally we will continue to invest in markets that will deliver both long term growth and solid returns for the company.  We believe that full ownership of Seiyu will provide us the flexibility and the freedom to operate that company most effectively and profitably.  And, in a fragmented market, we believe that Japan continues to hold much opportunity.", "This next week, we will be celebrating the opening of our 3,000th store outside of the United States.  This is a significant achievement for our company and our associates around the world.", "At the analyst meeting you heard the details about our capital expenditure program.  We just finished our real estate review process for both the United States and international.  Our capital efficiency model enhances our ability to approve the projects that will deliver the strongest returns.  The combination of increased profits and flat capital expenditures will increase the company\u2019s free cash flow over time.", "The fourth quarter is well under way and Christmas is just around the corner.  In every one of our locations we are offering incredible value and we are focused on the customer.  So, whether it is Christmas, Hanukkah or Three Kings Day, our customers around the world can count on Wal-Mart to save money this season so that they can live better.", "I remain very encouraged about our business, about the work that our associates are doing and our performance for the fourth quarter.  Let me close with sincere wishes to you for a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.  On behalf of almost 2 million associates at Wal-Mart stores around the world, have a great Christmas, a happy and a health new year.", "Now, Tom, I guess you are going to share the details.", "Tom Schoewe", "Lee thanks a lot.  Now, let me just dive into the details of our third quarter results.  Total net sales for the company were up 8.8%.  US comp store sales were up 1.5% in the third quarter, that\u2019s inside the guidance we provided you at the beginning of the quarter.  As Lee just mentioned, earnings per share from continuing operations were $.70 per share, up from $.62 per share we reported in the third quarter last year.  Earnings per share were impacted positively by $.01 per share from a $46.5 million after tax gain on the sale of certain real estate properties.", "During the third quarter operating income increased 11.4% on a sales increase of 8.8%.  Gross margin improvement and tight expense control contributed to this improvement.  Consolidated gross margin was 23.75%, that\u2019s up eight basis points from the third quarter last year.  As a percentage of sales, consolidated operating expenses for the third quarter were essentially flat to last year.", "Inventory is really a great story.  Recall, that during last fiscal year we met our goal of growing inventory at half of the rate of our sales growth each and every quarter.  After we fell short of this goal in the first two quarters of this fiscal year we committed to reach that goal by the end of this fiscal year.  I am pleased to say that through the efforts of our US operations, both Wal-Mart and SAM\u2019S here in the United   States, we reached our goal by the end of the third quarter.", "Consolidated inventories, and that includes international, increased 2.7% for the third quarter against a year to date sales increase of 8.6%.  We are seeing improvement in home office operating expenses; in fact, our corporate overhead costs as a percentage of sales were down versus the third quarter of last year.", "Our other income remained a strong story in Q3.  In addition to SAM\u2019S CLUB membership revenue, other income includes tenant lease income, the gain on real estate that I mentioned earlier, financial services and recycling income.  We see continued strength in financial service products, these include money transfers, payroll check cashing and product care warranties.", "Before I move beyond operating income, there is one thing I\u2019d ask you to remember.  Last year our earnings per share from the third quarter was favorably impacted by a $56 million after tax gain in property insurance recoveries.", "Now let\u2019s chat about interest expense, our tax rate and our debt levels.  Interest expense was up 8.3% for the third quarter but was flat to last year as a percentage of sales.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.5%; we continue to expect the tax rate for the full fiscal year here in 2008 to be between 34-35%, although there could be some volatility from quarter to quarter.  Factors which may impact our rate include changes in our assessment of certain income tax matters and the mix of international versus domestic income.  For the quarter our ratio of cash flow from operations to average debt was approximately 36% and debt to total capitalization was 42.9% at the end of the third quarter.  This is above the 41.4% rate at the end of the same quarter last year that leads to a discussion of share repurchase.  You may recall that we provided an update on share repurchase at our analyst meeting just a couple of weeks ago.  Today I can tell you that during the third quarter we purchased more than 63 million shares or approximately $2.8 billion.  Year to date we have repurchased almost 115 million shares and in dollar terms that\u2019s approximately $5.3 billion.", "Our capital expenditures through the third quarter are down versus last year.  Year to date we have spent $10.9 billion versus last years year to date total at $11.4 billion, that\u2019s a reduction of 4.6%.  This progress is consistent with what we told you at the analyst meeting.", "Return on investment from continuing operations for the trialing 12 months that ended October 31, 2007, is 19.1% and compares to 19.9% that we reported at the same period last year. ROY without the impact of the recent acquisitions of Trust Mart in China, Carhco in Central America and Sonae in Brazil and Seiyu in Japan would be 20.0% for the 12 months ended October  31, 2007, and 20.3% for the 12 months ended October 31, 2006, respectively.", "With that, let me turn it over to Eduardo Castro-Wright to chat about Wal-Mart  US.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright", "As we covered earlier the story of Wal-Mart stores US is one of a business that is improving.  We closed the third quarter with clean inventory in solid operating income.", "Let me get into some of the financial highlights and then I will update you on our business going into the fourth quarter.", "At the Wal-Mart US division, operating income increased 11.1% to more than $4 billion on a sales increase of 6.4%.  Comparable store sales in the Wal-Mart segment were up 1% for the quarter.  Comp sales were driven by an increase in average ticket while customer traffic declined.  Our three strong businesses:  Grocery, Health and Wellness and Entertainment represent two thirds of total Wal-Mart US business.  Grocery alone is more than 40% of that total, in fact, our grocery business including pharmacy was strong throughout the quarter and Super Center food sales grew by more than 13%.  Super  Center food comps were 5.3% and pharmacy comps were 8% during the quarter.", "During the third quarter we further increased the price spread between us and three of our largest grocery competitors with a spread ranging from 14-28%.  There is no doubt we win on price, which our customers certainly can appreciate.", "We continue to see inflation in some food departments such as dairy.  Wal-Mart\u2019s inflation rate is approximately 100 basis points lower than what the overall grocery industry is reporting.  Our total prescription share was up 40 basis points for the quarter.  We are about to anniversary the full scale roll out of the $4 generic prescription program next week.  This program is great for our customers.  Prescriptions in October were up 40% year over year.", "We had a very solid Halloween season with comp sales over 5%.  Our success came because we had an integrated cohesive merchandising presentation in our stores for Halloween, just as we did for back to school.", "Electronics will continue to be strong for us this Christmas in such items as televisions, GPS units, digital cameras, video games and computers.  Sales of flat panel TVs are up 110% in the third quarter over last year and laptop computers are up more than 80%.  Like others in the industry we are seeing a slow down in sales of music and DVDs.", "During the third quarter we absolutely surpassed our goal of growing inventory at half the rate of sales.  Inventory on October 31, was down from last year by 1.3% on a sales increase of 6.4%.  In addition to strong inventory management at the store level we have made several improvements in the supply chain and distribution processes that have contributed to the success.", "Gross margin was essentially flat with the third quarter last year.  We delivered high initial margins and fewer mark downs offset by higher strength.", "You will recall that during the analyst meeting we discussed several initiatives in home and apparel.  We already are seeing double digits sales increases in our express for less program in our 10-10-10 apparel program, ten items, ten colors, under ten dollars.  In home, we are driving price leadership and strengthening our brands.  We have made a lot of progress during this year in developing our new home pad which has been tested in 15 markets.  We are seeing good results and we plan to roll out this layout to most stores next fiscal year.", "As we discussed at the analyst meeting, we will continue to invest in our remodel and special projects program.  During the past two years we have seen that remodeled stores and special projects have outperformed control stores by 100-300 basis points.", "Store wages as a percentage of sales were down for the quarter, as were accident costs expense and advertising.  Overall expenses as a percentage of sales were down 9 basis points this quarter.  Sales per labor hour increased by more than 4% for the third quarter.  This is in line with the past two quarters of this fiscal year.  We will continue to roll out the scheduling system into all departments in all stores.  It is also not a surprise that productivity improvements are part of the reason we are seeing improvements in customer service.", "In the current economic environment it is even more important for Wal-Mart  US to be focused on price leadership and superior customer service.  Our operational plan builds on a cycle of continued improvement, showed that 56% of our stores improved in this key customer metric versus the previous month.", "Before I close, I must share the news about our newest Wal-Mart  Super Center that opened last week in Highland Village, Texas.  This store, which is 203,000 square feet, has many, many merchandising initiatives, new category adjacencies and a major commitment to fresh. There is a pastry shop, an open hearth bakery and a circular deli department featuring many meal solutions.  Navigation and sight lines were a priority for us in this design and it is very easy for customers to move around the departments.  Our goal is to keep clean aisles and an uncluttered look throughout the store.  There are several stores within a store departments covering electronics, toys, shoes, and pets.  The electronics department truly allows us to showcase today\u2019s technology.  I could go on for much longer but I need to pass the microphone to Charles to cover Wal-Mart International.  In the mean time, I invite you to experience Highland  Village for yourself.  One thing you will surely find when you visit is our emphasis on low prices in a friendly efficient and enjoyable environment.", "Charles Holley", "Thanks Eduardo.  Before we get into International third quarter results, let\u2019s briefly discuss Japan.  Our recent announcement of a tender offer for the remaining outstanding shares of Seiyu prompted a number of questions at the recent analyst meeting.  As Lee noted there are many clear reasons why Japan is important to our future.  Seiyu is an important part of the company\u2019s overall strategy for the larger Asian market.  Full ownership of Seiyu will allow our management team to focus on the primary business and provide the greatest possible access to all of Wal-Mart\u2019s global resources.  You\u2019ll hear about Seiyu's results a bit later.", "First, let\u2019s discuss international third quarter performance.  International net sales from continuing operations for the third quarter were $22.4 billion, that\u2019s a 16.9% increase over the prior year.  The impact of currency valuation on sales generated a benefit of $1.1 billion, driven primarily by strengthening in the British Pound, Canadian Dollar and the Brazilian Real.  Our strongest underlying sales performances in the quarter came from China, Brazil and Argentina.  Continuing its first half performance Asda and United Kingdom delivered very positive sales results in the third quarter.", "Segment operating income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $1.1 billion.  Gross margin for the segment was up approximately 30 basis points versus the third quarter of last year, largely as a result of improvements in Brazil.  Operating expenses as a percentage of segment sales were up from the third quarter of fiscal 2007.  Higher expenses in several countries were partially offset by an improvement in Mexico.  In addition, accruals to certain legal matters affected operating expenses.", "Operating income grew slower than segment sales for the third quarter.  Mark downs on summer season merchandise at Asda contributed to the slower growth in operating income.  The third quarter impact to currency valuation on operating income was a benefit of $55 million.", "Now, let\u2019s discuss highlights by country.  In the United Kingdom sales have tracked ahead of the market, outperforming in every single month so far this year.  This is notable given a more difficult retail environment and unusually wet weather conditions at the start of the quarter.  Consumer confidence in the UK continues to be fragile with rising mortgage rates starting to impact consumer spending.", "Comp sales were up in the low single digits and total sales was up in the mid single digits.  Sales growth was impacted by market conditions and tougher comparables but market shares still increased by 30 basis points year on year to 11.8% in the 12 weeks to October 7.  This growth is primarily driven by traffic increases through comp stores and new openings, as does operating income when slightly above plan but below last year.  The company continues to focus on price leadership and recently announced roll backs of another 2,500 items.", "During this quarter, Asda opened eight new stores with a total of over 300,000 square feet of new space and initial sales have been ahead of plan.  Four of these stores were Asda living, a format that continues to perform well.  The asda.com business continues to develop with a roll out of grocery home shopping to a further 16 stores and the trial of the new proposition of Asda direct.  This trial enables us to sell an extended assortment in a way that gives the customer maximum choice of order and delivery options.  Toys and electronics can be ordered on the web, at an in store kiosk or on the phone and then delivered to your home or collected from one of the trial stores.", "Now let\u2019s turn to Mexico.  As we saw in the second quarter, the third quarter was a challenging one for Wal-Mart Mexico.  Third quarter sales continue to be impacted by tough year over year comparisons and the slowing growth in consumer demand present in the overall economy.  I am proud to say, through, that our Mexican management team continues to prove it can react to the soft economic environment with fast and focused initiatives geared toward price leadership, effective execution during the holidays, assortment and layout.", "The efforts of Wal-Mex management led to a third quarter gain in new customers both overall and in comp stores.  Operating income then increased faster than sales.  Wal-Mex\u2019s third quarter sales in real terms increased 7.6% versus fiscal 2007.  After removing inflation, comp sales in real terms increased .7%.  The third quarter sales increase was driven by an 11% increase in customer count, partially offset by 3% decrease in average ticket.  All self service formats; Super Centers, SAM\u2019S CLUB, Bodegas and Super Ramas had positive real comps for the quarter.  We continue to see the formats where consumer spending is more discretionary, suburbia and the VIPS restaurants are the most affected by weak consumer demand.", "Gross margin for the third quarter increased over the same quarter last year driven by better management of perishables and groceries and improvements in seasonal merchandise, apparel and toys.  Despite the impact of initiating our banking operations in Mexico, expenses as a percentage of sales declined from the third quarter of fiscal 2007 because of the cost reduction program initiated in the second quarter.  The combination of these two factors led to operating income that grew faster than sales for the third quarter fiscal 2008.", "In Canada, total sales increased in the high single digits for the third quarter while comp sales grew in the low single digits.  Our sales performance was strongest in August and September.  Sales in October were adversely affected by unseasonably warm weather conditions which unfavorably impacted apparel sales.  Additionally, an increase in gas prices and an exceptionally strong Canadian Dollar had negative impacts on sales towards the end of the quarter.  Sales were strongest in the food and electronics categories during the third quarter and were also positively impacted during our anniversary sale in September and the Halloween seasonal program in October.", "During the third quarter we opened 10 new Super Centers, two new Greenfield locations and eight expansions, bringing our total number of Super Centers to 17.  These new openings included the first Super Centers in Alberta, where there are now five Super Centers.  Our real estate openings for the rest of the year will be in line with the initial plans.  We expect to have 31 Super Centers open by the end of fiscal 2008.  We continue to be very encouraged by the customer reaction to the introduction of Super Center format to Canada, with very positive increases in customer count and average ticket.  We continue to bring lower prices to the marketplace as we expand the number of stores and are seeing increased promotional pricing from the competition as they attempt to respond.  The initial seven Super Centers are delivering sales and profitability in line with our original plans.", "In the third quarter our segment income increase was in the low single digits.  Gross margin was down because of three factors:  a higher mix of food within Super Centers, lower margins in October due to softness in apparel and shoe sales, and finally a high proportion of lower margin electronics.", "Expenses grew faster than sales in our new Super  Center business primarily due to pre opening costs and depreciation.  In addition to support the accelerating growth of Super Centers in Canada, investments in home office head count and store training added costs year on year.  As we enter the fourth quarter, Wal-Mart  Canada is embarking on increased number of roll backs using the strength of the Canadian Dollar to enable us to lower prices for customers.  We are stepping out ahead of the industry and lowering prices on certain items.  In fact, we reduced prices on magazines, books and cards to bring retail prices in line with US Dollar prices.", "Moving now from North to South America, let\u2019s start with Brazil.  Without the impact of currency fluctuations, Brazil sales grew 17% when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2007.  Comps in real terms were in the upper single digits for the third quarter of fiscal 2008.  Sales in Brazil continue to be driven by an improved price position, recovery of consumer purchasing power and localized assortment by segment, customer and region.  Operating income in Brazil was above planned for the quarter.  We continue to be pleased with the performance of our total Brazilian operations, including the acquisitions in the Northeast and South.", "Argentina continues to deliver a strong performance with sales well ahead of planned, including comps in real terms in the high teens.  Operating income in Argentina was in line with planned in the third quarter.  Our new format in Argentina, Changomas has continued excellent performance with sales well above initial plans.  Additionally, in Argentina, we are pleased to announce that we have purchased three stores from Ashan.  This acquisition will compliment our current operations and build our market share in the strategic Buenos   Aires market.", "Argentina and Brazil are great examples of our management teams leveraging our global knowledge and experience.  Patterned after experiments in Mexico, both Argentina and Brazil are successfully introducing new formats that are tailored to the low income customer.", "Third quarter sales in Puerto Rico were up from last year and ahead of plan.  Operating income was ahead of last year but slightly under plan.  As we saw in the second quarter, comp sales were slightly positive despite the continuing trend of lower consumption on the island.", "Before the impact of currency fluctuations, third quarter sales at Wal-Mart Central  America grew 17% over the same quarter last year.  Third quarter comps were in the low single digits.  Operating income was ahead of last year but slightly behind plan and because of lower gross margins due to competitive pricing and inventory optimization initiatives.", "Turning now to Asia.  During the last two months of the third quarter, we were encouraged by positive comp sales in Japan in both food and general merchandise categories.  This was driven by increased customer traffic.  Apparel sales declined compared to the prior year quarter due in part to unseasonably warm temperatures.  Gross margins came under pressure due to shifts and category sales mix and continued investments in strategic categories to establish price leadership.  Expenses were leveraged and ended the quarter below planned but not sufficiently to offset the gross margin shortfall, resulting in operating income that was below planned.", "Wal-Mart China comps were extremely strong for the third quarter, during which we opened six new stores.  Sales were up for the same quarter last year by 45%.  Third quarter operating income was ahead of planned in the same quarter last year.  We continue to be excited about the comp sales performance at Trust-Mart.", "Now on to SAM\u2019S CLUB, Doug.", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks Charles.  I\u2019m pleased to join you today to share what is happening at SAM\u2019S CLUB as we head into the holiday season.  Overall, sales for SAM\u2019S grew by 6.1% to $10.8 billion during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Third quarter comp sales, excluding the contribution of fuel, increased by 3.9% over the prior year.  Fuel had a negative impact of .1% on comp sales.  As a reminder, around 70% of our clubs now have fuel stations.", "Over the quarter we went from a slightly deflationary environment for fuel in August to inflation in excess of 25% by the end of October.  We also continue to see inflation above 20% in the dairy category during the quarter.  As it relates to sales, fresh food and dry grocery were strong throughout the quarter.  The extended warm weather at the end of the quarter helped drive our juice and water businesses.  Electronics and in particular video games also contributed to our growth.", "While we believe that some of our members are waiting and hoping for further price declines in TVs, many of our top selling items in our holiday catalog were televisions and we believe this will be a strong Christmas for LCD televisions in particular.", "Apparel and home were below planned for the quarter.  We\u2019ve got room to improve on those areas beyond any external pressures.  On the other hand, we were pleased with our seasonal hard lines business and Halloween decorations and in candy.", "Geographically our operational performance was strongest in the Central  US; the Southeast was our weakest area.", "I\u2019d like to talk about membership for a minute.  As we mentioned previously, membership income is behind this years plan.  Our biggest concern is new sign ups and over time those new sign ups affect renewals.  After all, today\u2019s new member is tomorrow\u2019s renewal.  We are making some changes in this area to ensure it gets the focus it needs.  In July, we named Mike Turner, Vice President of Membership.  Mike is a SAM\u2019S CLUB veteran; he most recently served as our regional Vice President for our Western Region.  Mike brings extensive club operations experience to the job and will drive the execution we need in this area.  In addition, we recently announced that Cindy Davis has joined SAM\u2019S CLUB as Senior Vice President of Membership and Marketing.  Cindy comes to us from Rap Collins where she was most recently the President for Global Development and Communications.  Cindy brings a wealth of marketing experience to SAM\u2019S CLUB and we are excited to have her in this role.  Mike Turner will report to Cindy for membership and we will name a VP of marketing that will also report to Cindy.", "With these leadership changes we are looking at how we can make our memberships more attractive and more relevant to more potential members.  We are looking for the new team, Cindy and Mike, to drive both innovation and execution for us in the membership area.", "Moving on to operating expenses, we leveraged expenses during the quarter.  Gross margin was down four basis points close to flat with last year.  For the quarter, SAM\u2019S CLUB again grew profits faster than sales, operating income was $362 million a 6.2% increase over the prior year quarter.  Overall we are pleased with our inventory position going into the holidays.  Our team has had a strong focus this year maximizing efficiency of how we flow merchandize into the clubs.", "Before I wrap up I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the season in front of us.  On November 1, the day after Halloween, all clubs transitioned to their holiday look.  They went from orange and black to red and green overnight.  The clubs did a great job with the change over.  The SAM\u2019S CLUB holiday gifts catalog was delivered to many of our members during the same week and they found those items featured in the clubs.  The catalog included unique once of a lifetime packages like a space shuttle launch viewing and had an electric car with it and a trip to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.  Both of those items were sold to members in the first few hours they were available and in some cases the first few minutes.  These packages generate excitement for our members and are an excellent way to publicize the great values available to SAM\u2019S CLUB members.", "We are also doing more to integrate samsclub.com into our overall marketing strategy.  An example is our sneak-a-peak program which gives members a chance to sign up with a text message to receive early e-mail notice of some of the items we will be offering in the clubs the day after Thanksgiving.", "In summery, we believe we are well positioned to serve our members with their food, gift and decoration needs throughout the season.  Tom will wrap it up now.", "Tom Schoewe", "Thanks Doug.  For the fourth quarter we expect US comps to be between flat and a 2% increase.  The company expects earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter to be between $.99 and $1.03 per share resulting in a full year forecast for earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.13 to $3.17 per share.  This guidance includes an anticipated restructuring charge for Seiyu of approximately $40 million after tax in the fourth quarter.", "Thank you for your interest in Wal-Mart and as Lee said, have a great holiday!", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Second, thanks for your patience during the past quarter while the IR team was short a director. [Mike Beckstead] will join our team next week as Director of Investor Relations. He brings to Wal-Mart a background in accounting and investor relations as well as experience in the grocery area of retail.", "This call is a bit longer than what we normally do so get ready. There\u2019s just a lot more detail. With that let\u2019s begin.", "H. Lee Scott", "Welcome everyone, thank you for joining us and for your interest in our company. Before I get started let me apologize a little for my voice. I am suffering from the flu I believe it is. I am taking my $4 antibiotics from Wal-Mart so I feel like I\u2019m going to be on the mend. Let me get started. I am happy to report that Wal-Mart Stores Incorporated had another record quarter and fiscal year.", "Let me begin with our record sales. Total net sales for fiscal 2008 reach $375 billion an 8.6% increase for our company. We added approximately $30 billion in sales which is more than many retailers generate in total sales over the course of an entire year. Said another way, $30 billion would be the equivalent of a fortune 75 business. For the fourth quarter we topped $100 billion in sales. The first time in history that a global retailer has reached this milestone in sales in a single quarter.", "Earnings also were strong. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.02 per share up from $0.95 per share last year. In addition, we delivered a record return to our shareholders this year through more than $11 billion in share repurchases and dividends. These record results came about because all of our operations around the world were ready for the holiday. In fact, the plans that our teams put in place earlier this year delivered for our customers and for our shareholders.", "Tom Schoewe will share more details on the numbers but clearly our underlying operational performance exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. I want to say how proud I am of the more than two million Wal-Mart associates around the world who executed our plan in such a way that allowed our company to make significant progress in an economy that got more difficult as the year progressed.", "We knew our customers would be stretched during the holidays and we made sure that they knew they could count on Wal-Mart for low prices. The combination of price leadership with improved store operations made the difference for Wal-Mart US this year. We had excellent results in grocery, health and wellness and electronics. The focus on key items early in the season and throughout the holidays was strategically planned.", "Big investments on items like digital photo frames paid off in important categories. Our associates delivered on the plan called Operational Excellence. Across the country Wal-Mart customers experienced stores that were cleaner, better in stock and had quicker and friendlier check out experiences. Wal-Mart US truly executed on its \u201cSave Money Live Better\u201d message.", "Wal-Mart International continues to optimize its assets and leverage opportunities across the countries. You are going to hear from Mike Duke today that we can enhance our global leverages within the total Wal-Mart business. The collaboration among the operating segments will make Wal-Mart even stronger as we move forward. SAM\u2019s Club closed the year well with profits growing faster than sales for the year. The team continues to drive operating income through comp sales, expense management and in club operational execution.", "In the Wal-Mart US business we have moderated our capital expenditure for the next three years and slowed down our square footage growth. We are investing more in existing stores through remodels and resets. This strategy changed how we operate our company. I can assure you that the discussions in our real estate meetings are very detailed and thorough to make sure that we generate the best possible returns.", "The savings in capital along with our strong financial position should enable us to continue to provide superior returns to our shareholders. Wal-Mart also continued to take on tough challenges that can make a difference in the world. Last month I built on my 21st century leadership speech and we spoke to our US managers about creating the Wal-Mart of the future. In addition to the work we already have underway we are focusing on three fronts:", "Driving more efficiency and affordability into the US HealthCare system", "Helping our customers and suppliers us less energy", "Ensuring that we are sourcing products in a way that is ethical and environmentally responsible.", "Our company is well positioned from a management standpoint, both in our capacity to manage our core business and to improve our business model in a complex world. We have the right structure for Wal-Mart\u2019s business and the operating segments. Our support groups are led by extraordinarily talented people. Around the world we will continue to execute on the plan that served us so well this past year, price leadership, well managed inventory and operational excellence.", "We do have high expectations. We also know there are areas where we need to continue to improve. No one has a crystal ball to look into the economic future. We know the economy will be a critical factor this year. Some customers were a little more cautious in their spending in January and that was reflected in our US comp sales numbers for that period. That is why we will continue to be diligent in improving our business in every way and at every turn.", "I was optimistic about the holidays, the fourth quarter and our ability to compete as a global retailer and to thrive in this economy. Looking at the results we are sharing with you today I would say my optimism was and continues to be well founded. I\u2019m excited about this fiscal year and I\u2019m also excited about the next five to ten years. When you invest in Wal-Mart you are investing in a company and a model that will be even more relevant in the future.", "We are growing a global company, strong in both our domestic market and international markets. We are committed to grow with the customers and in markets that will make the biggest difference in the next five to ten years. Throughout all of this we will continue to cement our price leadership position in retail. We are delivering on Sam Walton\u2019s vision to give the world an opportunity to see what its like to save and have a better life for all.", "Let me turn things over to Tom.", "Tom Schoewe", "Let\u2019s get right into the details of our fourth quarter and the full fiscal year for 2008. Total net sales for the company for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were up 8.3% to $106.3 billion. Included in these results is a total US comp of 1.7%, that\u2019s without fuel. That\u2019s within the range we provided you for the quarter. Operating income was up 7% with income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increasing 4.0%.", "Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in this quarter were $1.02 a share that\u2019s an increase of 7.4% over the same quarter last year. Our diluted earnings per share results included net charges of approximately $0.02 per share for certain items. Let\u2019s get behind those numbers. Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was impacted negatively by a total of $0.03 per share which included two items; first approximately $70 million in after tax expenses related to dropped US real estate projects.", "As Lee shared with you and as we discussed at our October Analyst and Investor Meeting we are committed to capital efficiency. This $70 million in after tax expenses represents the amount by which we exceeded the dropped project expense in Q4 and the full fiscal year in 2007. Second, an approximately $32 million after tax restructuring charge for the head count reduction at Seiyu. You\u2019ll recall that we gave you a heads up on this item at the end of our last quarter.", "On the positive side these charges were offset partially by a $0.01 per share credit due to the recognition of $38 million in after tax gains from the sale of certain real estate projects. Finally recall that last fiscal year, that would be Q4 of fiscal 2007, we had a benefit of $0.02 related to the resolution of certain tax items and the renewal of the work opportunity tax credit. What does all this mean? In summary, we had a net after tax charge for the three items in the fourth quarter of this year of $0.02 per share and an after tax gain of $0.02 per share in the quarter last year. Taking into account these items I think you\u2019ll agree, we had a strong underlying operating performance for the quarter.", "Now for the details of full fiscal year 2008. Net sales were $374.5 billion that\u2019s an 8.6% increase over last fiscal year. Operating income was up 7.3% with income from continuing operations up 5.8%. Diluted earnings per share, once again from continuing operations for the full fiscal year, were $3.16 which is an 8.2% increase over last fiscal year. Let me remind you that this is within our original guidance that we provided last year at this time. It\u2019s near the top of the range we provided at the end of the third quarter.", "Total US comp store sales for the fiscal year were 1.4% without fuel and 1.6% with fuel. Wal-Mart US reported a 1.0% increase and SAM\u2019s Club a 4.2% increase. Again, both of these comps are without fuel. Let\u2019s move on to the rest of the details. Consolidate gross margin was up 51 basis points for the fourth quarter with increases reported by each operating segment. Consolidated inventories were up approximately 4.4% against a fiscal year sales increase of 8.6% year over year for fiscal 2008. We are really pleased that total US inventory increased less than 1% on the sales increase of approximately 6%. Kudos especially to the significant progress that Wal-Mart Stores US made this fiscal year and the continued strong inventory focus of our SAM\u2019s Club team.", "Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 86.3% at the end of fiscal year 2008 which is up slightly from the 84.6% we reported last fiscal year. This improvement continues as a result of our inventory management progress primarily in our US operations. Other income was up 17.3% for the fourth quarter and up 16.8% for the year. Good news continues in financial services here in the United States. Eduardo will provide a little more perspective on financial services here in just a moment.", "Recall that other income also includes club membership fees, tenant lease income and recycling income. Other income for the fourth quarter and for the full year also includes gains of $57 million and $188 million respectively related to the sale of certain real estate properties. Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter were up 68 basis points over the same period last year. As expected, we did see increases in maintenance and repair expense due to our accelerated efforts to update the US Wal-Mart stores through remodeling as well as higher advertising expense for Q4 versus Q3.", "On a fiscal year basis consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up 22 basis points. Corporate overhead expenses were up approximately 9% for the fourth quarter. As we noted at our October Analyst meeting in fiscal 2008 we began investing in three long term transformation projects designed to enhance our information systems. These cover:", "Merchandising", "Finance and", "Human Resources", "These costs drove a large part of the increase in overhead expenses in Q4 and will continue to do so in fiscal 2009. Now let\u2019s cover the details on interest expense, our tax rate and our debt levels.", "Net interest expense was up 56.8% for the fourth quarter over last year. The increase in interest expense was impacted by an increase in debt in the current fiscal year. We\u2019ll have more on share repurchase in just a moment. Certain prior year credits related to both international and interest on tax accruals. Speaking of tax, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 33.8% bringing in our rate for the full fiscal year at 34.2%. We expect our tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be within the rage of 34% to 35%.", "At our Analyst meeting in October we explained that our capital efficiency model is something that we initiated in the fall of 2006 was in high gear. It\u2019s applicable to every single real estate project we review both here in the United States and in our International operations. This past October we forecasted that we would end fiscal year 2008 with total company capital expenditures some where between $14.7 and $15.4 billion. I\u2019m very pleased to report that we ended the year with total capex of $14.9 billion. That\u2019s a 4.7% reduction from the $15.7 billion we reported last fiscal year.", "As a reminder, we projected a range of $13.5 to $15.2 billion in capital expenditures for the company for fiscal 2009. Let me be clear, we are not moving dollars from the United States to fund International growth. US capex is projected to be down between approximately $1.4 billion and $2 billion for fiscal 2009 when compared to 2008. This would more than offset the $500 million projected increase in International in fiscal 2009 when compared to 2008.", "For the fourth quarter our ratio of cash from operations to average debt was approximately 39%. Debt to total capitalization was 40.9% at the end of the fourth quarter. This is above the 38.8% rate at the end of the same quarter last year. This obviously leads to a discussion of share repurchase. In the fourth quarter we repurchased more than 50.9 million shares for approximately $2.4 billion. Year to date we repurchased approximately 166 million shares and in dollar terms that approximately $7.7 billion.", "During fiscal 2008 we returned more than $11 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. Return on investment from continuing operations for the trailing 12 months that ended January 31, 2008 is 19.5% and compares to 19.9% that we reported at the same period last year. Let me point out that we are making strides towards the goal of flattening ROI. Three years ago ROI declined on a consolidated basis 110 basis points. Last year the decline narrowed to 60 basis points. Now at the close of fiscal 2008 that gap is down to 40 basis points. Clearly our emphasis on capital efficiency is paying off.", "I\u2019ll wrap up with a discussion about free cash flow. Recall that in October we laid out for you our goal to improve free cash flow. The capital efficiency model doesn\u2019t stand on its own. We continue to be focused on a very integrated strategic plan to drive sales, profitable growth all at very good returns that yield improved free cash flow. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities right off the cash flow statement less capex. The company generated $5.4 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2008 and that compares to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2007. This represents a 25% increase year over year.", "With that let me turn things over to Eduardo Castro-Wright and he\u2019ll share what\u2019s going on at Wal-Mart US.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright", "With a strong fourth quarter Wal-Mart Stores US closed fiscal year 2008 on a high note. Let me start with an overview and then we will get more into the details. We had solid performance for the quarter driven by seasonal events including Thanksgiving, the holidays and game time. Wal-Mart outperformed key competitors in the mass merchant grocery and many specialty channels. Our inventory was clean throughout the quarter and we are very well positioned for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We follow through aggressively on our save money live better promise and we greatly improved customer experience.", "Now let\u2019s look at some of the specific numbers for Wal-Mart Stores in the United States. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $67.4 billion up 5% over the same period last year. For a total year net sales were up 5.8% at Wal-Mart Stores US driven by strength in grocery, health and wellness and electronics. Operating profit grew faster than sales for the quarter and was up 5.3% over the same period last year and up 5.4% year over year for the full fiscal year.", "As Tom pointed out earlier the Wal-Mart US operating profit for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year was negatively impacted by charges related to a greater than expected number of real estate projects that have been cancelled or postponed. These projects were dropped as a result of our emphasis on capital efficiency and its requirement for projects to meet more stringent return on investment criteria. Let me provide a little more context on this before I continue with our results.", "Throughout the year we took opportunities to re-review our real estate projects using the new capital efficiency model. This was designed to take the numerous approved projects in our pipeline and prioritize them. Therefore, we postponed or cancelled many projects which resulted in increased operating expense. We feel these actions will go a long way to improve returns in the future. In other words, short term pain for long term gain. These actions enhance our ability to moderate our future capital growth.", "Gross margin dollars increased 7.6% for the fourth quarter and 6% for fiscal year 2008. Despite slightly higher strength gross margin as a percentage of sales was up 62 basis points for the fourth quarter year over year and up slightly for the full year versus last year. Initial margins across most businesses showed increasing strength throughout the year. We also saw pressure from increased transportation costs which impact our cost of sales and gross margin.", "In 2007 on highway diesel prices increased by $0.25 per gallon. This cost increase did negatively impact transportation costs by direct fuel costs and fuel surcharges. We do expect fuel costs to be a potential headwind for fiscal year 2009 if they continue to rise beyond our projections. That being said, our logistics team has instituted other expense saving projects to help keep overall projected costs more in line with the fiscal year just ended.", "We are proud of our year over year inventory performance which grew at 0.7% versus a sales increase of 5.8%. We certainly surpassed our goal of growing inventory at less than half the rate of sales growth. This achievement was due largely to a very strong performance during second half of the year as well as improvements made in merchandise flow processes and systems. A Wal-Mart Stores comp of 1.6% for the fourth quarter was within our quarterly guidance. Comp sales were driven by a 3.4% increase in average ticket.", "Customer traffic continued to decline but at a reduced rate during the fourth quarter compared to earlier in the fiscal year. In other words, our traffic trends are improving. We have more people going through our stores than any other retailer and this provides a significant growth opportunity for us. I would like to point out that while many of our competitors have negative comps for the January period if we convert Wal-Mart\u2019s comp to many competitors calendar for the periods our comp would have been a solid 3%. Further, non-impacted comp stores sales improved each consecutive quarter during the fiscal year. Let me remind you that non-impacted stores are those not influenced by new store openings.", "Segment operating expenses as a percentage of sales were on plan for the quarter up 70 basis points year over year. Some of this increase in operating expenses was due to the dropped real estate projects and due to maintenance related to our remodel program. We also saw increases in advertising investment to support introduction of our new Save Money Live Better campaign. For fiscal year 2008 operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up 21 basis points over the prior year reflecting the same factors outlined for the fourth quarter.", "Our labor productivity rates continue to increase an in fact are up almost 12% over the previous quarter of fiscal 2008. We plan to complete the roll out of the scheduling system in all departments in all stores during the first half of fiscal year 2009. Where are we on our strategy moving forward? Our priority is to further establish our \u201cSave Money Live Better\u201d platform. We are very committed to this vision and we are engaged in ensuring that the clarity of our merchandise offerings back this price leadership message.", "With a more challenging economy and inflation still rising in some categories customers have the confidence they can count on Wal-Mart to save them money on great brands and on every day needs. We are confident that our customers see how relevant this message is in their lives we will capture more than our fair share of retail sales. During the quarter we saw continued inflation in core food categories including dairy, meat and bread and this is something we are monitoring on a daily basis. We believe however the rate of inflation passed along in our stores is less than our competitors in the grocery category saving customers money and building loyalty. We can do this because of our operating efficiencies.", "The entertainment category continues to see inflation especially in flat panel TV\u2019s. We have dedicated additional square footage to our entertainment selling space this past year. Our entertainment area is clearly the destination for our customers. We will continue to drive new brands and new technology in this area.", "Health and wellness continues to grow in importance. We have redesigned many of our pharmacies to be more customer friendly. The ability of our pharmacy assistance and the commitments our associates enable us to drive top line sales and control costs as we continue to fill more and more prescriptions. Customers appreciate the access and affordability of our over the counter offerings. With our size and presence we have the ability to be first to market on drugs and move from prescription to over the counter. Additionally our private label Equate is well respected and offers higher margins.", "Our apparel business is improving; the expansion of our New York based operations is already proving successful. Performance of our private brands is getting better as we offer key items for $10 or less in very label. Early spring sales are very promising as a leading indicator of this core part of our business for the first half of the year. To bring our customers top brands we are adding known brands to our offerings. These include Garanimals already available in baby and kids. Ocean Pacific or OP coming in the spring across all of our apparel and LEI the denim brand for back to school in juniors and girls.", "We are experiencing significant growth over last year in locations where we have clarified our offering. On project example is our Express for Less program where we expanded the amount of space devoted to the Hannah Montana Collection. Wal-Mart is selling the majority of all Hannah Montana merchandise in the marketplace. Last, in apparel we are investing in growth businesses which include athletic wear, athletic shoes and licensed merchandise.", "In the Home area we are working hard on improvements, you will hear more from us on this category later in the first quarter.", "We continue to see strength in financial services including money transfers, check cashing and bill payment. We saved our customers almost $330 million this fiscal year which is well above the $250 million savings in fiscal year \u201907. Our Wal-Mart money centers were expanded to more than 430 stores this past year. They continue to achieve better comps and create a great experience for our customers who depend on our basic money services to help them live better lives.", "We saw in the second half of the year much better integration of our operations, merchandising and marketing programs and communicating with our customers. Wal-Mart\u2019s advertising in the fourth quarter kicked into high gear with our central message \u201cSave Money Live Better\u201d. Effort also was allocated to our site to store service and we are very pleased with the customer response to this offering.", "Let me remind you that this was the first holiday period with site to store availability in all Wal-Mart US stores. You saw the same theme process work for us with theme time around Super Bowl and Valentine\u2019s Day. You will see much more of this integrated communication process come to life during the year.", "Internally we continue to drive operational efficiency; we are undertaking the second phase of our operational excellence initiative in the stores. As I told you in the third quarter call this is a cycle of continued improvement and the operators from the divisional precedence to the market teams work on these improvements every day. Since the roll out of the front end programs customer check out gradings continue to improve quarter over quarter all year. We survey almost two million customers each quarter and they are noticing improvement. All five of our measured in store customer service metrics hit new highs in the fourth quarter. Including those on faster, friendlier and cleaner stores.", "With increased capital for remodeling projects we are increasing the number of stores on this program during the next three years. There will be various levels of remodels from the light touch to a full remodel to ensure that we deliver a relevant customer experience for each market. For example, the home pad remodel completed during the third quarter has shown great promise and we will roll this out to additional stores this coming year. Our goal is to see improved sales in the home category by the second half of fiscal 2009.", "We also have seen our associate engagement scores at their highest level in years. It is due to many of the operational initiatives underway in our stores. Remember that engaged associates take better care of customers. The groundwork in all these areas that we have laid during the past two years enabled us to have a strong fourth quarter and put us in a solid position for the start of fiscal 2009. More importantly we feel we are ready for an economic environment that we believe will be challenging and volatile at times.", "We are the advocate for the customer and we are confident that our message \u201cSave Money Live Better\u201d is reinforcing the trust of our broad customer base and also inviting new customers to shop at Wal-Mart. We feel good about the start of the fiscal year, we are well positioned with our \u201cSave Money Live Better\u201d platform, we have assembled a very capable and committed team and we are executing the strategies to deliver solid results for the first quarter and for the year.", "Now I will turn the microphone over to Mike Duke.", "Mike Duke", "It has been another very good year for Wal-Mart International performance. I\u2019m pleased with our results and even more enthusiastic about the future prospects for our business. Let me start today with an update on our International strategy and then I\u2019ll cover a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter and the year.", "Our strategic direction has remained consistent during the past two years in terms of optimizing our assets and using the leverage we have as a part of the Wal-Mart family. This year we have further enhanced our strategic direction with a third initiative, winning in each market. Our strategy is now based on:", "Portfolio optimization", "Global leverage", "Winning in each market", "First, we are focused on portfolio optimization; this strategy is about creating shareholder value in existing as well as potential markets through specific country objectives. Capital expenditure efficiency and resource allocation a major strength of our International business is the portfolio of markets, mature markets producing significant cash flow as well as emerging markets producing outstanding growth both current and future.", "Second, since we operate in many markets around the world we can enhance global leverage within Wal-Mart International and total Wal-Mart. In this area I am especially proud of how the International markets are leveraging global procurement with a significant increase this past year in purchasing. We also are leveraging technology and systems at an accelerating pace. Our learning from multiple store formats has been an outstanding point of leverage as well. Much of our International growth is now coming from smaller more capital efficient store formats because we have leveraged our learning\u2019s.", "One initiative I am really excited about is developing relationships with our key global suppliers to drive volume based EDLC through a formal consistent process. Our initial discussions with key suppliers regarding this process have been extremely positive. I\u2019m happy that we\u2019re having these conversations in conjunction with Eduardo Castro-Wright and other Wal-Mart US counterparts.", "Third, this year we added developing a specific plan for winning in each market. Winning in each market means that we either must be a leading retailer in a market or we develop a strategy which gets us to the path to leadership. If we can\u2019t see a winning path in a given market then we would have exited that market. I am pleased that we are currently winning in the majority of markets we are in and in the other markets we see a path to winning.", "Let\u2019s move to the specifics of Wal-Mart International\u2019s fourth quarter performance. International net sales from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $27.0 billion that\u2019s an 18.8% increase over the prior year. The impact of currency valuation on sales generated a benefit of $1.7 billion driven primarily by continued strengthening in the British Pound, Canadian Dollar and the Brazilian Real. Our strongest underlying sales performance in the quarter came from China, Brazil and Argentina. ASDA in United Kingdom continued with very positive sales results in the fourth quarter.", "Wal-Mart Canada delivered its strongest quarterly sales increase in the year during the fourth quarter. For the full year Wal-Mart International sales were $90.6 billion. As a stand along business Wal-Mart International would be one of the largest, fastest growing and most successful global retailers. Segment operating income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion. Gross margin for the segment was up versus the fourth quarter of last year largely as a result of improvements in Brazil and Canada.", "Operating expenses as a percentage of segment sales were up from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 this included approximately $32 million of after tax restructuring charges to better align Seiyu\u2019s infrastructure and store level impairment charges at Seiyu. Excluding these items and the affect of property sales gains in fiscal 2007 operating income would have grown consistently with segment net sales. The fourth quarter impact of currency valuation on operating income was a benefit of $106 million.", "Now let\u2019s look at operating highlights by country. During the year ASDA was a winner in the UK, being the fastest growing of the big four retailers. In fact, ASDA achieved above market average growth every single month this year. ASDA has now added almost two million customers and 50 basis points of market share since the start of fiscal 2007. For the year comp sales excluding the positive impact from fuel were up in the mid single digits with total sales increasing in the high single digits.", "ASDA beat its fiscal 2008 business plan in sales and operating income by executing against its strategic plan. ASDA had a successful Christmas and fourth quarter. We are especially pleased given that it was against the toughest quarter in fiscal 2007. Fourth quarter operating income was at the same level as last year due to property sale gains in the fourth quarter fiscal 2007 and higher associate incentives in the current year.", "The higher incentives recorded in the fourth quarter reflect ASDA\u2019s stronger full year performance. The UK is a mature market but there is still opportunity for ASDA expansion. We are adding new locations as well as more ASDA living stores a format that is very successful for us. We are also increasing the web based grocery home shopping business and we expect 95% coverage of the market by the end of the year.", "With the UK consumer under pressure ASDA has started fiscal 2009 by emphasizing price with its position endorsed by independent web based price checker www.mysupermarket.co.uk. Sales in January were encouraging with comp growth again in the mid single digits.", "Wal-Mart is the largest and most successful retailer operating in Latin America and we see significant growth ahead. Let\u2019s start with Mexico. Sales there continue to be affected by the broader macro economic environment. Additionally, our Mexican business was up against a tough year over year comparison in the fourth quarter. Despite the soft economy our management team in Mexico is reacting to the changing business environment and gaining customers.", "Total sales for the quarter were up 6.7% in real terms. Real comp sales in Mexico were up 0.3% in the fourth quarter the sales increase for the quarter was driven by strong 13.7% surge in customer count. However, the slowing economy caused our average ticked to decrease 6.1% during the quarter. All of our self service formats in Mexico continue to deliver positive real comps. However, there remains pressure on our restaurant and our apparel business, the VIPS and the Suburbia formats. As we have seen throughout the year lower consumer discretionary spending is impacting these two formats.", "Gross margin for the quarter increased over fiscal 2007 despite an unfavorable mix shift away from the higher margin goods at Suburbia and VIPS. All self service formats increased their margin. Expenses increased slightly as a percentage of Wal-Mex sales because of start up expense for Bank of Wal-Mart and the overall sales pressures. Operating income in Mexico remained relatively flat as a percentage of fourth quarter net sales.", "Let\u2019s move on to Brazil. Without the impact of currency fluctuations Brazil sales grew 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Comps in real terms continue to be in the upper single digits for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and continue to be ahead of our key competitors. We consistently gained market share throughout fiscal 2008. Operating income in Brazil was above plan for the quarter and the full year.", "Brazil operations including the acquisitions in the Northeast and the South keep improving and delivering results ahead of plan. For fiscal year 2009 Brazil is expanding low income consumer formats with more than 60% of new stores concentrated on our soft discount format Todo Dia and the cash and carry format Maxxi. Brazil continues to be a great example of our global leverage. Our Brazilian business has seen margin improvements from our global procurement operation.", "In addition, costs and productivity improvements continue year over year due to operational improvements learned from other markets such as the fast lane and the front end initiatives described in the October Analyst meetings. These initiatives not only improve productivity but also improve customer services.", "Argentina continues to exceed our plans and last years performance with real comps in the high teens. Operating income in Argentina was above plan in the fourth quarter. Our new format in Argentina Changomas has continued its excellent performance with sales well above initial plans. Additionally, we have successfully converted the three recently purchased Auchan stores into Wal-Mart Supercenters. The stores are exceeding our expectations in terms of sales an operating income.", "With this acquisition the company has become the fourth largest player in the Argentina retail market. Another great example of global leverage, the new formats introduced in Argentina and Brazil tailored to the low income customer were patterned after experiments in Mexico. As a region we hope to see even more examples of idea sharing relevant to the local customer in the years to come.", "Before the impact of currency fluctuations and inflation fourth quarter sales at Wal-Mart Central America grew in the high single digits over the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter comps were in the low single digits, operating income was ahead of the same quarter in fiscal 2007.", "Let\u2019s move back to North America before going to Asia. In Canada total sales increased in the high single digits for the fourth quarter while comp sales grew in the low single digits. Sales in November and December were the strongest. Sales in November were favorably affected by cold weather after an unseasonably warm October. December was favorably affected by the significant increase in the opening of many Wal-Mart 24 hour stores throughout the holiday season. During the quarter the Canadian customer was very sensitive to prices given the strong Canadian Dollar.", "More aggressive roll backs helped to deliver stronger sales. In addition, we ensured that prices for books, magazines and cards typically priced in both US Dollars and Canadian Dollars were sold to the customer at the lower US Dollar price and made a number of price moves on electronics and media to bring prices in line with Wal-Mart US prices. This was extremely well received and we expect to see strong market share gains.", "Sales were strongest in electronics categories during the fourth quarter with solid growth in apparel, shoes, pharmacy and tire and lube express as well. We continue to be encouraged by the customer reaction to the introduction of the Supercenter format in Canada as we see very positive increases in customer count and average ticket. The first seven Supercenters have all been open for at least a year and have delivered sales and profits ahead of our original plans.", "In the fourth quarter the Wal-Mart Canada segment income increase was in the low double digits. Gross margin was up because of three factors; a good mix of seasonal and apparel merchandise sales, stronger margins on direct imports and aggressive roll backs. Wal-Mart Canada\u2019s expenses grew slightly slower than sales due to good cost control and fixed cost leverage underlying expenses in the discount stores were well below sales growth but this was partly offset by the start up costs of Supercenters and pre-opening expenses, wages and fixed rent.", "As we said in the October Analysts meeting both Canada and Mexico has ROI\u2019s well north of the company average. This is proof of the strength of our management team and the relevancy of our customer proposition. Fourth quarter sales in operating income in Puerto Rico were up from last year and ahead of plan. Sales performance was strong despite the continuing trend of economic recession and lower consumption on the Island.", "Rounding out the globe our operations in Asia. We saw strong 2007 sales growth at Wal-Mart China where comps were driven primarily by average ticket and grew in the high double digits in the fourth quarter. At the analyst meeting we told you that China comp sales were significantly outpacing Carrefour as of the first half. We are happy to say this trend continued for the full year. As for the fourth quarter the 12 new stores we opened contributed to the total sales growth more than twice that of Carrefour and almost three times the rate of market growth.", "Strong comp sales throughout the year, in addition to the deliver of our new store opening program led to total fiscal 2008 sales growth in China that was well in excess of two times the rate of the market. Trust-Mart finished the year with solid sales increases in the fourth quarter.", "In Japan we concluded our tender offer in December and now own 96% of the Seiyu business. We expect to acquire the remaining shares by second quarter of fiscal 2009 at which time Seiyu will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Wal-Mart and will no longer trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In our discussion of Seiyu at the October Analyst meeting we explained how we intend to win in developed markets like the UK, Canada and also Japan.", "Taking Japan private not only reaffirmed our commitment to win in this market but has allowed us the flexibility to make necessary investments for turn around. As I mentioned earlier during the fourth quarter Seiyu instituted a home office restructuring which contributed to the growth of expenses as a percentage of sales. This restructuring program is a good example of making investments today that will pay off in future efficiencies.", "At the Analyst meeting we also discussed the Seiyu store and assortment of remodels. Initiatives on productivity and investments in price for key categories. As a result of all of these efforts food comp sales were positive in the fourth quarter. General merchandise categories where EDLP price investment has taken place are significantly outperforming. However, apparel comp sales were down during the quarter continuing an overall market trends.", "Although sales were below planned, the Seiyu team continued its focus on cost savings and productivity and leveraged expenses for both the quarter and the year. This will be a key in continuing our progress toward offering our customers every day low prices across all formats and merchandise categories. The Japanese retail market is a major strategic importance to Wal-Mart and our goal is to achieve long term success and growth there.", "Overall we are seeing encouraging evidence that efforts to improve our cost base and reinvest in price where it matters will pay off in Japan. This is a fragmented market where developing cost and price leadership will allow us to gain share and win in Japan. I\u2019d like to recognize what a strong management team we have throughout Wal-Mart International. As I close I\u2019d like to reiterate that we are well positioned to tackle the challenges ahead and deliver on the strategic plan I laid out earlier in the call.", "Now on to SAM\u2019s Club.", "Charles Holley", "Sales for SAM\u2019s Club grew by 6.3% for the fourth quarter and by 6.7% for the fiscal year. The US Clubs ended the year with a record $44.4 billion in sales. Excluding fuel comp sales at SAM\u2019s Club increased by 2.5% during the quarter and 4.2% for the fiscal 2008. As others in the industry are reporting SAM\u2019s did see fuel inflation during the year. For the quarter ended January 31, 2008, fuel sales positively impacted SAM\u2019s Club comparable sales figures by 248 basis points.", "During the fourth quarter the average price per gallon was $2.90 versus $2.07 a year ago. For the full year fuel sales had a positive impact of 67 basis points on comp sales at SAM\u2019s Club. Approximately 72% of the 591 US SAM\u2019s Clubs now have fuel stations. Strong categories during the quarter included fresh and dry grocery as well as video games and electronics. Home furnishing related items were soft across the quarter.", "Operating income increased 2.5% for the fourth quarter over last year. This increase was impacted negatively by a year over year increase in real estate expenses. This was due to certain credits to SAM\u2019s Club share of total US real estate expenses in the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 9.3% for the fiscal year. As a reminder SAM\u2019s Club reported a benefit for a federal excise tax refund in the first quarter of this fiscal year.", "Operating income for both the quarter and the year benefited from expanded gross margins. Fourth quarter membership income continued to be below plan. From an expense perspective SAM\u2019s Club leveraged operating expenses for the full year but fell short of that target in the fourth quarter. Inventory for the quarter and the year was a success story for SAM\u2019s Club as were in stock levels. Inventory was nearly flat at the end of the quarter allowing the Club to finish the fiscal year with clean inventories in positioning SAM\u2019s Club wealth for fiscal 2009.", "SAM\u2019s Club celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Back in 1983 when Sam Walton opened the first Club in Midwest City, Oklahoma, he had a vision of helping lower costs for small businesses. A vision that has carried forward to this day. Already this fiscal year SAM\u2019s Club has a strong focus on driving membership acquisition and retention by demonstrating the value of a SAM\u2019s Club membership to both prospective and existing members.", "As we enter what appears likely to be a period of economic uncertainty we believe the substantial savings and value that SAM\u2019s Club offers to its business and advantage members for both products and services is a very compelling story. Tom will close with our guidance for fiscal 2009.", "Tom Schoewe", "In today\u2019s call we shared a lot of news about the company and our strategic priorities for this fiscal year.  I certainly agree with Lee\u2019s excitement about fiscal 2009. A couple of take away\u2019s, there\u2019s no doubt that we are focused on price leadership, inventory management and operational excellence. These will continue to help drive our results this fiscal year.", "For the first quarter we expect US comp store sales to increase in the range of flat to 2%. This is based on the current trends we are seeing in the business as well as the challenging economic environment we are facing right now. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter to be between $0.70 and $0.74 per share. For fiscal year 2009 we forecast diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $3.30 and $3.43 per share.", "Thank you for your interest in Wal-Mart, have a great day.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

These statements discuss among other things our anticipated US comparable store sales for the current fiscal quarter and our anticipated earnings per share for the current fiscal quarter, our anticipated tax rate for the fiscal year 2009 and the factors that may impact that tax rate, our expectation that high transportation costs will be an expense headwind for the remainder of the year, our forecast for our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009.", "Our expectation that the long term projects to enhance our information systems for merchandising, finance ,and human resources will continue to be an expense headwind for the rest of fiscal year 2009, our expectations that there will be challenging macroeconomic environment in which we will operate for the remainder of the year, our expectation that higher fuel costs will be an expense headwind for our Wal-Mart Stores US segment for the remainder of the year, our expectation for the time necessary to fully implement new technology resources across the entire store in our Wal-Mart Stores US segment.", "Our expectation that the home category in our Wal-Mart  stores US segment will continue to be pressured by weakness in the housing market, our expectation that with help from the weather the apparel category and our seasonal business in our Wal-Mart Stores US segment should kick into high gear, our expectation that the United Kingdom will remain a challenging economy in retail market for the rest of the year, our expectation that the acquisition and retention of members will remain a focus of our Sam's Club segment throughout fiscal year 2009, and the anticipation and expectations of Wal-Mart and its management as to future occurrences and trends.", "These forward looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors domestically and internationally including the cost of goods, competitive pressures, general economic conditions, consumer credit availability, inflation, consumer spending patterns and debt levels, currency exchange fluctuations, trade restrictions, changes in tariff and freight rates, fluctuations in the cost of gasoline, diesel fuel and other energy, transportation, utilities, labor and health care, accident costs, casualty and other insurance costs, interest rate fluctuations, capital market conditions, geopolitical conditions and events, weather conditions, storm related damage to our facilities, regulatory matters and other risks.", "We discuss certain of these matters more fully in our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and the information on this call should be read in conjunction with that annual report on Form 10-K and together with all our other filings including current reports on Form 8-K we have made with the SEC through the date of this call.", "We urge you to consider all these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating the forward looking statements we make in this call.

First Quarter Earnings Call for Fiscal Year 2009. This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations. The replay of this call and related materials about the quarter are available on our website.", "Here is the agenda for today's call. Lee Scott, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. President and CEO will provide comments about the company's overall performance and perspective about the global economy. Tom Schoewe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will add further detail regarding our financial results. Eduardo Castro-Wright, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wal-Mart US will provide the update on our US stores business and the details of results for the quarter.", "Mike Duke, Vice Chairman for Wal-Mart International will have an update on the strategy for International and results including more details on the results of some of our larger countries. Charles Holley, Executive Vice President Finance and Treasurer, will review the results of Sam's Club and Tom will come back and close with guidance for the second quarter of this fiscal year.", "As a reminder, we consolidate and report on our business the following ways. First, comparable store sales and our monthly sales releases are reported on the retail calendar 4-5-4 basis for the US operations. Comparable store sales, as we report today, and in all earnings releases are on a calendar basis. Countries in Wal-Mart International are on a calendar basis and sales are pegged to local currencies.", "Canada and Puerto Rico report on the same calendar as the United States operations which means that our first quarter runs from February 1st through April 30th. All other countries in Wal-Mart International report on the regular calendar basis meaning the first quarter news we are reporting today represents results from January 1 through March 31.", "This year, the first quarter includes the benefit of one extra day, February 29th, due to 2008 being a Leap Year. In addition, the store counts and square footage updates through the first quarter are available on our website, www.WalMartStores.com/investors. We also have the detail on our metrics on return on investment, return on assets, cash flow to average debt, and free cash flow posted there under reconciliation and financial measures.", "Now let's get onto the news about Wal-Mart's first quarter of fiscal 2009.", "H. Lee Scott", "First, let me apologize for my voice that it is allergy season in Arkansas. It may cause me to sound less excited than I am about our results this quarter. I want to start thanking our more than two million Wal-Mart associates around the world for their dedication to our mission, saving people money so they can live better.", "We continue to deliver against the business model that Sam Walton started, selling branded merchandise for less. Our business model is even more relevant today given the current economic pressures. Customers everywhere are concerned about the rising energy costs, food inflation, home values and a number of other factors tied to the global economy. Wal-Mart customers value our price leadership more than ever, especially as they try to stretch their money further.", "As I travel around the world, it is gratifying to see how Wal-Mart continues to help people save money. With more than 7,300 locations, we are having a significant impact on the quality of life of millions of customers and Sam's Club members. So how did we do for the quarter? We are very pleased with the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We're off to a solid start. We again delivered record sales and earnings for our shareholders.", "First quarter net sales totaled more than $94 billion, an increase of 10.2% for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. from the prior fiscal year's first quarter. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.76 per share, up from $0.68 per share for last year's first quarter. Net income rose about 7% from the prior year. As always Tom Schoewe will cover additional details on the numbers.", "One thing that our customers appreciate everywhere is that Wal-Mart is the undisputed price leader. We have been very clear in communicating our commitment to price leadership and we are pleased to see the analysts and the media reporting on it. The result of our pricing strategy, the quality of our merchandise, and the strong operational execution have been solid around the world.", "This was validated by the comparable stores sales figures and the 9.8% sales increase for the company in April that we just reported this last Thursday. Our US business has solid momentum. The team under Eduardo Castro-Wright is fully aligned to deliver against its mission Save Money, Live Better. Two years ago, the team embarked on a plan to improve the business. The integration of operations, merchandising, marketing, and communications is very evident. Sales are up; inventories are down significantly contributing to better profits.", "Customers are telling us how much more they enjoy shopping at our Wal-Mart Stores. In fact, the hard work of our US associates has paid off through our bonus program. We recently announced that the company shared almost $1.2 billion with our hourly associates in Wal-Mart US and Sam's Club through our profit sharing and other benefit programs. We believe in rewarding our associates who make a difference for our customers and our shareholders.", "I'm enthusiastic about the role of our International business and how important it is to our future growth. Wal-Mart International, under Mike Duke is well positioned to deliver increases in profits and return on investment. Our teams are leveraging global practices and processes to benefit the growth of international. We have multiple formats in our 14 markets all of which served the customers very well.", "What drive sales in these markets is the local approach.", "Let's take the Changomas format for example. This new store in Argentina designed to serve the low income grocery customer is modeled after the very successful Bodega format in Mexico. In Canada, our Supercenter expansion program incorporates some of the best ideas from the United States and our other countries to strengthen our retail presence across the country.", "I know there's a lot of interest in our move to take Seiyu private. We're even more convinced now that it's the right direction for the long term. We have tested EDLP, everyday low price, in two regions in Japan. The customers have responded to it very positively. Now I would remind you that our turnaround plan is a long term plan. The commitment to Wal-Mart Japan is the kind of commitment the company made in the past in markets like Canada and Mexico that have paid off over time.", "Value is as important as it has ever been to our small businesses and consumers right now. Just as our customers are concerned about high gas prices, small businesses are under pressure as well. The success that Sam's Club has in serving small businesses and individuals and their families is highlighted by the very fact that they celebrated their 25th anniversary this year. Doug McMillon and his team are working hard to expand the membership franchise by attracting and retaining even more Club members.", "All of this is good news. However, there are still uncertainties about the rest of the year. As I said during the call recapping the fourth quarter of last year, the economy is playing a critical factor in 2008. While there is potential for short term impact from the stimulus checks in the United States, it is currently difficult to quantify what impact this money could have on Wal-Mart's sales.", "That being said, I remain optimistic about the rest of this year. Customers are focusing on food and daily use items. They want to be able to celebrate events like Mother's Day and Father's Day at home with a barbecue grill or some video games. Beyond the day to day management of our business, Wal-Mart is also committed to continuing our contributions to society.", "When I meet with legislators, civic leaders or other business executives, they are interested in our company and how we are helping our customers during these tough economic times but they also want to hear more about the progress we are making on areas such as sustainability. They're excited about the $4 prescription drug program and the impact it is having on reducing healthcare costs for so many people. In fact, I hope that you saw the news recently about the expansion of our prescription program.", "Our customers and our elected leaders appreciate that Wal-Mart is stepping up to be part of the solution on important issues. I look forward to seeing many of you at our shareholders meeting in Northwest Arkansas on June 6th. Tom Schoewe will now cover more details about the financial results.", "Tom Schoewe", "We would also like to thank you for joining us to hear more news about Wal-Mart's start to fiscal 2009. As Lee said, we had a strong quarter. Total net sales for the company were $94.1 billion. That's up 10.2%. In addition, US comp store sales were 2.9% and that is without fuel in the first quarter. That is above the range of flat to 2% that we had forecasted for the quarter. More important, the 2.9% comp for this quarter is the strongest quarterly comparable store sales performance for the US business in eight quarters.", "Operating income was up 9.5% with income before taxes and minority interest for the first quarter increasing 8%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.76 that's up from $0.68 per share in the first quarter of last year. Just a quick reminder about two items we booked last year that influenced the year to year comparisons, one favorable and one unfavorable.", "The Wal-Mart Stores and Sam's Club segments operating income included the favorable impact of an excise tax refund on prior phone card sales, $46 million for Wal-Mart and $39 million for Sam's.", "Second, we recorded a charge of approximately $73 million for Wal-Mart and $10 million for Sam's because of accruals for legal and other contingencies.", "Now let's look at our consolidated results. Consolidated gross margin was up 11 basis points for the first quarter due primarily to the stronger performance of the Wal-Mart US business. Higher transportation costs will remain a potential headwind for the rest of the year. Inventory management continues to be a great story. Recall that this is one of our five financial metrics that support our focus on driving free cash flow. Our goal is for inventory to increase at half of the rate of our sales growth.", "Consolidated inventories were up only 1% against a year to date sales increase of 10.2%. Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 81.7% at the end of the first quarter which is up from the 78.3% we reported last year. Other income was up 15.4% for the first quarter over last year. Recall that other income includes Sam's Club membership revenue, tenant lease income, financial services, recycling income, and the gain on certain real estate transactions. Financial services had another strong performance. I will leave that discussion to Eduardo Castro-Wright.", "Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up approximately 21 basis points over last year due to higher utility costs, coupled with higher repairs and maintenance. Corporate expenses were up approximately 20% from the first quarter of fiscal 2008 due primarily to our investment in \"transformation programs\".", "Recall that during the fourth quarter call we explained our long term transformation projects to enhance the information systems for merchandising, finance, and human resources. These will continue to be a headwind for the rest of this fiscal year and for several years to come. Without the transformation projects, the corporate operating area would be up by only 3%.", "Now we'll detail the status on interest expense, our tax rate, and our debt levels. Interest expense was up 27% over last year's first quarter due to higher debt levels resulting from increased share repurchase activity during the past few quarters. Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.7%. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be between 34% and 35%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuation. Factors which may affect our rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of international to domestic income.", "Debt to total capitalization was 43.2% at the end of the first quarter of this fiscal year above the 41.3% rate at the same time last year. Our cash flow from operations to average debt was approximately 40%. We reported continued progress with our capital efficiency model. Our cash flow statement reflects payments for capital spending or CapEx, of approximately $2.4 billion during the first quarter. This represents a decrease of approximately 22% from last year. Our forecast for capital spending for fiscal 2009 continues to be between $13.5 billion and $15.2 billion.", "ROI from continuing operations for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2008 is 19% and compares to 19.5% that we reported in the same period last year. Some portion of this decline resulted from the increase in cash balances at the quarter end. Subsequent to the quarter end much of that debt was paid down.", "During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.3 billion of our stock which represented approximately 25.4 million shares. Under our current $15 billion share repurchase facility, we still have the authority to repurchase approximately $7 billion of additional shares. Earlier I mentioned one of our five key financial metrics that support our focus on driving free cash flow. That was meeting our goal of growing inventories at or less than half the rate of the sales growth. We have a good story there.", "Let me wrap up with some feedback on the rest of the report card. We achieved one other goal, payables growing faster than inventories. We continue to be in the plus side here. Now five quarters in row. We do have some \"opportunities\" in other areas; growing operating income greater than sales. I'm encouraged by the progress we are making especially in a tougher economic environment. The next is growing operating income greater than the increase in costs for property, plant, and equipment.", "While we continued to see progress in our operating results, capital spending continues to place pressure on the denominator. We have consistently forecasted that this improvement will take some time. Last, corporate expenses growing less than our sales growth. As I mentioned earlier, we have a multiyear commitment to improving our systems for merchandising, finance, and the people division, this will continue to be a headwind for a while. Without the investment in these projects, the corporate operating area would have grown far less than sales.", "Finally, you might ask, where are we on free cash flow? We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. The company generated free cash flow of $1.3 billion in Q1 this fiscal year. At the end of the first quarter last year, we had a free cash flow deficit of $1.3 billion due mainly to our higher consolidated inventory position. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Eduardo Castro-Wright who will share the fine results in our Wal-Mart US business.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright", "Let me outline what I will cover today. First, we will start with comparable store sales performance. This is the second consecutive quarter where comparable store sales performance outpaced the market across key business units. We did well against mass discounters, against largest national grocery chains, drugstore chains, and consumer electronics retailers. We also saw improved performance in apparel relative to other leading retailers.", "Second, our price leadership position. We continued to expand price caps across the entire store. Third, we have a very good inventory story. Our lean inventory position has helped drive gross margin and enhance profitability. Very importantly, it provides the flexibility to continue to drive price leadership at the time when consumers are very price conscious. Last, our customer service scores are the highest level ever. We are faster at the checkout, our associates are friendlier and our stores are cleaner.", "Why are our results strong? We are executing very well against our plan and Wal-Mart US is very well positioned to serve the needs of customers today. Our entire team is completely aligned behind our mission. We save people money so that they can live better. I'm not only pleased with the results we have delivered for the first quarter but I am cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year. The macroeconomic environment will continue to be challenging but our business is very well positioned to compete in this environment.", "Let's start with our results for the first quarter. Total net sales for Wal-Mart US for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $59.1 billion, up 6.6% from the prior year. Comparable store sales for Wal-Mart US were 2.7% for the quarter. This is the best comp performance for Wal-Mart US in eight quarters. This comp was driven for the first time in a very long time by positive traffic as well as by a 2.4% increase in average ticket.", "Gross margin dollars increased 7.7% for the first quarter, faster than the rate of sales. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was up 27 basis points driven by the results of our leaner, more efficient inventory management processes. We continue to see progress in inventory performance. We are more than $1 billion below our plan for inventory for the first quarter of the fiscal year and experienced a decrease in inventory from last year of more than 2% on sales growth of 6.6%.", "Leaner inventories led to reduced shrink, a reduction in markdowns, and higher productivity. Shrink was down eight basis points versus last year. Markdowns were down more than 30 basis points for the quarter on a year over year basis. Operating profit grew faster than sales and was up 9.6% over the same period last year. Total expenses as a percentage of sales were flat with our plan this quarter up 23 basis points year over year. This is a good result given the pressure we have in a number of areas.", "As expected, higher fuel costs are driving significant increases in utilities, transportation, and commodities. We have put many initiatives in place to help lessen the pressure from increased transportation costs. However, we do expect higher fuel costs to be a headwind for the remainder of this year. When all is said and done, these higher expense pressures were offset by improvements in productivity at our stores and our distribution centers.", "One of the largest expense increases in the first quarter that accounts for most of the year over year variance is related to increases in bonuses for store associates linked to improved business performance. Bonuses are paid on a quarterly basis and I'm happy to see that expense line grow. We are very focused on improving our store productivity. We've introduced a lot of technology in the supply chain in the front end which allows us to deploy resources better across the entire store.", "This may take more than a year to fully implement but we are starting to realize the benefits of matching associate schedules more closely with customer traffic patterns. We continue to strengthen our efforts on improving the most important customer service metrics. Every month we survey between 500,000 and one million customers in our stores. This is one of the most robust, reliable customer surveys you will find anywhere in the industry. Customer experience scores were at their highest level since we started the survey.", "Our stores continue to improve. For example in our West division, the number of stores scoring in the bottom quartile on our fast, friendly and clean attributes decreased by one third from a year ago. Our grocery, our health and wellness, and our entertainment businesses are very strong while apparel is already recovering and it's being driven by the very successful introduction late last year of our express for less initiative and our emphasis on price points of $10 or less.", "The home business will continue to be pressured by the weakness in the housing market. The hard lines category has continued to be challenged by unfavorable weather. However, a major component of that business is seasonal events and I'm pleased to report that we performed well during Valentine\u2019s, Easter and this past weekend for Mother's Day.", "Consumers are making choices. We know that credit as a form of payment at Wal-Mart has been declining since the third quarter last fiscal year. Customers are faced with the results of a tougher economy, higher gas prices, food inflation and the increase in the overall cost of living. The paycheck cycle is more pronounced as things get tighter for customers toward the end of the month.", "Customers meet their basic needs first and then they become more discriminating. Wal-Mart is there to help and the results are reflected in the market share gains we have seen in categories like electronics. Customers do shop for things they want, not just what they need. They are making room for entertainment products especially as they stay home more often.", "We continue to see inflation in food and consumables. Energy is a major contributor to this. Therefore, price matters even more than it did last year. That is why we continue to look for innovative ways to provide savings for our customers. Our recent advertising circular featured new $10 meal solutions which offer alternatives to more expensive meals eaten outside the home.", "In store end caps also will support this concept and just recently Wal-Mart launched Phase three of the prescription program which included a $10 price point for a 90-day prescription, additional women's health medicines and new $4 over the counter medicines.", "In the first quarter, financial services continued its strong growth trend with product income showing significant double digit growth over the last year. A large portion of the increase came from four products, check cashing, money transfers, product warranties, and the Wal-Mart money card. Growth is being further supported by the addition of close to 270 Wal-Mart money centers this year bringing the total to 460.", "The combination of our integrated improvements in merchandising, operations, marketing, and brand communication all add to the overall positive story for the first quarter. We launched several new television ads that further reinforce our Save Money Live Better position. Before I close, let me recap our highlights for the first quarter.", "We are winning in four of our six business units representing over 75% of total sales. We are making progress in apparel and with help from the weather; this business unit and our seasonal business should kick into high gear. Our customer traffic is positive for the first time in a very long time. Our investment in price has helped increase the gap with key competitors. Inventory management and operating efficiencies have helped drive the price leadership position and drop some of the profit to the bottom line.", "Expenses are on plan and slightly ahead of last year. Our inventory will continue to run very lean. The benefits in shrink, markdowns and productivity can be expected to continue. We've now begun the second quarter. We know the foundation laid during the past couple of years put us in a good position for the current environment and for the future. Our underlying business is solid.", "As I said in our April sales release on Thursday, it is still difficult to accurately forecast what impact the stimulus checks will have on US consumer spending. However, we are cautiously optimistic about the immediate future and believe we are very well positioned when the economy turns around. Now I will turn it over to Mike for Wal-Mart International.", "Mike Duke", "We have closed the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 with strong results reflecting our strategic focus and future growth prospects in Wal-Mart International. Let me start today by briefly discussing recent developments in Brazil, India, and Russia. These highlight one of our three key strategies, portfolio optimization which means that we place our capital where it will have the highest long term returns. We are very pleased that we are starting to see some of our long run investments pay off.", "Many analysts and investors recently returned from a trip to our Brazil operations where we discussed Wal-Mart's opportunities in that market. Brazil is a large opportunity for us due to population and GDP growth, positive sales trends, and EBIT improvements in our acquisitions. Brazil also is a great example of an emerging market in our portfolio that is starting to hit its stride in market leadership and growth potential.", "In India, we've now opened our first distribution center to support Bharti's direct to consumer retail operations as our franchisee. Bharti opened three small stores in April. We are pleased with the start up of our business in India and we are confident that there is significant untapped demand from modern retail there. We look forward to further supporting our partner and franchisee, Bharti, in their growth plans for this emerging market.", "Over the last quarter, we've taken active steps to begin our exploration of opportunities in Russia and in neighboring markets in Eastern Europe. Our research indicates that this area provides many opportunities for Wal-Mart to create value by serving the emerging middle class and bringing to those markets our best practices in the supply chain and operational efficiency.", "Now let's move to the specifics of Wal-Mart International's first quarter performance. International net sales for the first quarter were $23.9 billion, that\u2019s a 22% increase over the prior year. The impact of currency valuation on sales generated a benefit of $1.3 billion driven by strengthening across most currencies notably the Canadian Dollar and the Brazilian Real.", "Our strongest underlying sales performance in the quarter came from China, including Trust-Mart and Brazil with a solid performance in Canada. Wal-Mex and ASDA also delivered healthy sales despite tough economic conditions in those countries. Also contributing to the sales increase was the timing of the Trust-Mart acquisition last February.", "Segment operating income for the first quarter was $1.0 billion up 15.6%. Gross margin for the segment was down slightly versus the first quarter last year largely because of price investment in Japan and a mix shift in favor of fuel in the UK. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment sales were flat to the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Contributing to this were strong underlying improvements in the United Kingdom, Japan and Mexico offset by accruals for certain legal matters.", "Operating income grew slower than sales because of the timing of property sales at Gazeley, our property development business in the UK, and the accruals for legal matters. The first quarter impact of currency valuation on operating income was a benefit of $46 million.", "Now onto the larger countries results. ASDA has continued to win in the United Kingdom delivering a strong first quarter with 30 basis points of market share growth despite a challenging economic environment. Excluding the positive impact from fuel, sales growth was in the high single digits; comp sales grew 6.4% and were impacted by Easter and a leap day. Excluding the benefit of these events, comp sales grew 5% driven equally by traffic and ticket.", "In food, the fastest growing areas reflect in store activity particularly around seasonal events and include wine, flowers, and confectionary. Despite the challenges of the market, Extra Special, ASDA's premium brand is the fastest growing private label, up over 30% year on year. This is a reflection of improvement in product assortment and quality. Sales of SmartPrice, ASDA's opening price point private label brands are also growing strongly.", "In general merchandise, the fastest growing departments were mobile phones where ASDA is gaining market share and computer and video games. George performed ahead of the market supported by strong children's clothing performance and the launch of two new brands, targeted at the classic core customer, Boston Crew and Moda.", "Operating income at ASDA was impacted by a charge for the closure of 12 George High Street stores and the timing of Gazeley property sales. Excluding these items, ASDA operating income grew marginally faster than sales. Although we expect the UK to remain a challenging economy and retail market during the rest of the year, ASDA believes that its strong pricing agenda backed by a cost reduction program leaves it well positioned to continue to gain market share there.", "In Mexico, the economic downturn continued to impact sales in the first quarter and our business there faced a tough year over year comparison. However, our management team views this as an opportunity to differentiate, to become more relevant to the consumer and to continue building customer trust and loyalty.", "Total sales at Wal-Mex for the first quarter were up 14.4% while comp sales grew 8% in nominal terms. The sales increase was driven by a 14.4% increase in customer count. Although average ticket remains a concern, our management team is focused on achieving its goals without relying on significant increase in ticket. This demonstrates very well their flexibility and ability to anticipate customer needs and limited resources. Wal-Mex exemplifies Wal-Mart's commitment to saving people money so they can live better.", "Continuing prior quarter's trends, self service formats in Mexico had increases in customer count while our higher margin apparel and restaurant formats had declines. This led to a gross margin that was flat to last year. Successful cost control measures allowed Wal-Mex operating income to grow faster than sales. This result is despite expenses from the start up of our bank in Mexico.", "In Canada, total sales grew 9.9% for the first quarter while comp sales increased by 4%. In Canada, we continue to grow market share at an accelerated pace, sales were strongest in electronics on the strength of gaming and computers while the core pantry and our Supercenter expansion program drove food growth. Comp sales benefited from Leap Year by 0.7 percentage points. Seasonal business in Canada performed well.", "We opened our first Supercenter in British Columbia in April bringing the total to 32 stores since our launch. In the first quarter, Canada's gross margin and operating income increased faster than sales due in part to foreign currency gain on imports. Canada is maintaining expenses as a percentage of sales despite the pressure brought by higher fuel costs.", "Total sales for Brazil in real terms are up 14.5% with the strongest performance in our low income formats Todo Dia and Maxxi. Increases in both traffic and average ticket helped to deliver this outstanding performance. Comps sales in Brazil were also very strong at 9.2% in real terms outperforming our key competitors. Best of all, we have maintained gross margin year over year while investing in price leadership and taking markdowns to reduce inventory.", "Expenses as a percentage of sales have decreased year over year due to leveraging fixed costs. Without the impact of currency, operating income has grown significantly since the first quarter of last year. Comp sales in Japan grew 1.6% in the first quarter, the first positive comp figure in five quarters. Comps were driven by 1.9% increase in customer traffic triggered by investments intended to establish price leadership.", "Gross margin has declined slightly because of these efforts. Our improvements in productivity for both stores and home office including our fourth quarter restructuring resulted in expenses being down more than 100 basis points. These savings allow us to make the price investments that are key to our strategy. Our first quarter operating loss was slight and essentially flat to the first-quarter last year.", "Comp sales in our traditional Wal-Mart China businesses, Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and Sam's Clubs increased 22.7% for the first quarter, during which three new Supercenters opened. Aggressive advertising promotions have enhanced Wal-Mart's price leadership image and improved our communication with customers. This and other expense saving efforts led to operating income in the traditional businesses that increased faster than sales.", "At Wal-Mart China's Trust-Mart business, comp sales grew 18.8% driven by strong customer traffic and average ticket from our tab promotions. Food inflation impacted sales at our China businesses. Now I'll turn the microphone over to Charles for the update on Sam's Clubs.", "Charles Holley", "For the first quarter, Sam's Club's sales were $11.1 billion. That's an increase of 7.6%. Comparable club sales, excluding all fuel sales increased by 3.6%. Both traffic and ticket without fuel increased in comparable Clubs for the quarter. Strong categories during the quarter included dry grocery and consumables. From a general merchandise perspective, Sam's Club had strengths in video games, office supplies and residential furniture.", "Furniture was positively impacted by product quality improvements and a new approach to presentation in the Clubs. Electronics drove mid single digit comps but we have seen a relative softening of television sales. House wares and apparel were soft throughout the quarter. Spring and summer seasonal sales have been mixed with softer sales in outdoor furniture offset in part by stronger performance in the grills and gardening categories.", "The gross margin rate was down due to the $39 million excise tax refund recorded in the prior year quarter. Membership income continues to be behind plan in dollars. Acquisition and retention will remain a focus at Sam's Club throughout the year, especially as Sam's Club has now fully cycled the impact of the January 2006 membership fee increase on a deferred revenue recognition basis.", "Programs such as invoice comparisons for small business prospects during National Small Business Week and the 25th Anniversary Celebration which highlighted values for Advantage members, have shown initial success in driving new member acquisition and bringing existing Sam's Club members to the Club for additional visits.", "During the first quarter, the average retail price per gallon of gasoline was $3.14 versus $2.45 a year ago. The combination of the price differential and increased gallons sold had a positive impact of 290 basis points to Sam's Club's comparable Club sales for the quarter. The growth in the low margin fuel business negatively impacted gross margin mix for the quarter. Certain foods and consumable items notably dairy, grains, and paper products, experienced inflationary pressure in the quarter.", "Operating expenses grew at a slower rate than sales due to lower real estate expenses in the current quarter and the $10 million legal accrual recorded in the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 4.3% to $386 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. As mentioned earlier, in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year, Sam's Club's operating income included a favorable impact of $39 million related to an excise tax refund and a charge of $10 million related to accruals for legal and other contingencies.", "Sam's Club's inventory management remains strong with inventory levels at the end of the quarter down 1% versus the same period in the prior year. Similar to Wal-Mart, Sam's Club is cashing economic stimulus checks free for its members. Although the impact of the stimulus checks is difficult to predict, we believe the Sam's Club format with its compelling value is well positioned in the current economic environment to serve both small business and individuals and their families. Now I will turn it back over to Tom for the update on guidance.", "Tom Schoewe", "For the second quarter, we expect US comp store sales to increase in the range of flat to 2%. As we said on sales day, that would be last Thursday, it's currently difficult to quantify the impact on US sales that the stimulus checks may have. We expect earnings per share for the second quarter to be between $0.78 and $0.81 per share.", "Before we sign off, an important reminder. Last year's second quarter results included a benefit of approximately $0.04 per share from the net impact of a reduction of general liability and workers' compensation claim accruals, gains from the sale of certain real estate properties, and charges for legal and other contingencies. To arrive at apples to apples operating comparisons, these items must be considered.", "That\u2019s it for today and we\u2019d like to thank all of you for your interest in Wal-Mart.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(Operator Instructions)", "This call will contain statements that Wal-Mart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as amended and intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that act.", "These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the use of the words or phrases anticipate, expect, forecast, will continue and will remain, or a variation of one of those words or phrases in those statements, or by the use of words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, descriptions of our objectives, plans, goals, targets or expectations are forward-looking statements.", "These statements discuss, among other things, our anticipated U.S. comparable store sales for the current fiscal quarter and our anticipated earnings per share for the current fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2009 as a whole, our anticipated tax rate for fiscal year 2009 and the factors that may impact that tax rate, our expectation that high transportation costs will be an expense headwind for the remainder of the year, our forecast for our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009, our expectation that the long-term projects to enhance our information systems for merchandising, finance and human resources will continue to be an expense headwind for the rest of fiscal year 2009 and beyond, our anticipation that we will record in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 a gain on our sale of Gazeley, our expectation for customer response to new offerings in the home category, our expectation for momentum to grow in backtoschool sales during August, our anticipation that our Sam\u2019s Club segment will experience pricing pressures in the coming months, and our expectation that the next two quarters will be challenging for our Sam\u2019s Club segment from a membership renewal dollar perspective, and the anticipation and expectations of Wal-Mart and its management as to future occurrences and trends.", "These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors domestically and internationally, including geopolitical events and conditions, the cost of goods, competitive pressures, general economic conditions, consumer credit availability, inflation, consumer spending patterns and debt levels, currency exchange fluctuations, trade restrictions, changes in tariff and freight rates, fluctuations in the costs of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other energy, transportation, utilities, labor and health care, accident costs, casualty and other insurance costs, interest rate fluctuations, capital market conditions, weather conditions, damage to our facilities resulting from natural disasters, regulatory matters and other risks.", "We discuss certain of these matters more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and the information on this call should be read in conjunction with that annual report on Form 10-K, together with all our other filings, including current reports on Form 8-K that we have made with the SEC through the date of this call.", "We urge you to consider all of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements we make in this call.

That measure, our return on investment, free cash flow and cash flow from operations to average debt as discussed in this call may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available for review on the Investor Relations portion of our corporate website at www.WalMartStores.com/investors.", "Carol Schumacher", "Welcome to the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2009. Thanks for joining us today. This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations. I\u2019d like to remind you that a replay of this call and related materials about the quarter are available on our website.", "So here\u2019s the agenda for today. Lee Scott, President and CEO, will provide comments on the company\u2019s overall performance and perspective about the economy. Tom Schoewe, our CFO, will, of course, cover the detailed financial results. Eduardo Castro-Wright, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S., will get into the details on that operating segment. And Charles Holley, EVP Finance and Treasurer, will cover things for Wal-Mart International. Doug McMillon, President and CEO for Sam\u2019s Club, will describe all the things going on for our U.S. based-Clubs.", "And Tom will come back and finish up the call with guidance both for third quarter comps as well as third quarter EPS and some thoughts about our guidance for the full fiscal year.", "Detailed store counts and square footage updates through the second quarter of this fiscal year are available on our website.", "Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. added 73 units worldwide this quarter. We also have on our website metrics on return on investment, return on assets, cash flow to average debt and free cash flow.", "We have one reminder. In observance of the fact that Yom Kippur falls on October 9th this year, we have moved the day for reporting our September four-week sales from Thursday, October 9th to Wednesday, October 8th, and we will report, as usual, before the market opens.", "I\u2019ll now turn it over to Lee. Lee?", "Lee Scott", "Thank you, Carol, and welcome everyone. We appreciate your interest in the company and in the work that our associates are doing to serve customers in so many markets around the world. In fact, I just have returned from China, where I had the great opportunity to visit a Sam\u2019s Club in Beijing and a Trust-Mart, both of which are doing very well and both looked very good.", "Well, today we have a great story to tell for this year\u2019s second quarter. We continue to deliver on our mission \u2013 saving people money so they can live better. In today\u2019s press release you\u2019ll see that the second quarter\u2019s net sales were approximately $101.6 billion, an increase of 10.4% for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. from the prior year. Each operating segment contributed to the quarter\u2019s record sales. In fact, it\u2019s the second time we hit the $100 billion mark in a quarter. So this is a significant achievement for our company.", "And I hope you noticed our headline, that we are raising our full year earnings guidance because of the underlying strength of our operations. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were $0.86 per share, up from $0.75 per share for last year\u2019s second quarter. This is about a 14.7% increase over this quarter last year, which benefited $0.04 per share from three specific items. I will let Tom Schoewe get into the details on these numbers shortly.", "However, before I talk about the economy, let me cover some highlights of our results. Our inventory management continues to be a great story, driven by strong performance again from Wal-Mart U.S. as well as some of our Wal-Mart international operations including Mexico, Brazil and the United Kingdom. And we continue to gain market share. In the U.S. we are gaining market share in each of the six merchandise units. We\u2019re also increasing share in many markets within Wal-Mart International.", "Our company continues to manage cash flow in a way that will give us the opportunity to participate in things that will benefit Wal-Mart long term. Most importantly, the combination of our solid operating performance coupled with strong capital efficiency allowed the company to report free cash flow through the first six months of almost $5 billion.", "As I travel, there are two types of questions I get. First, general questions about the economy and second, questions about inflation. What we see, as do many around the world, is a global economy that is difficult. It started in North America and then spread to Europe. The economic difficulties are now showing up in some of the developing countries as well. How these effects are impacting our customers is something that Wal-Mart monitors on a daily basis.", "Wal-Mart\u2019s customer is reflective of society in general. While some of them live paycheck to paycheck, our customers represent a broad income segment and they are all challenged today. When energy and oil prices go up - on top of inflation and health care and core food items  there\u2019s a great deal of pressure on the customer.", "The Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s Club associates are focused every day on carrying out Sam Walton\u2019s vision to improve the lives of everyday people by making everyday things more affordable. We had started to see that our customer was being pressured back in 2006 and 2007. At that time we decided to reduce capital expenditures and invest more in price, and today we are glad that we made those decisions.", "Recently, some of our country presidents talked about customers in their markets. They see their customers looking for ways to save money. People are eating more sandwiches in Puerto Rico and relying more on private label products in the U.K. Customers in many areas are buying cheaper cuts of meat for dinner, and, similar to the United States, people in other countries are eliminating vacations and entertaining more at home.", "Our customer in Mexico, whose paycheck is being stretched, still wants a top quality branded TV. It may take just a little longer to be able to make the purchase. The common thread is that they can rely on Wal-Mart to deliver products at the lowest price.", "Here\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing regarding inflation. While commodity prices have decreased recently, food inflation continues to be a factor in our markets. Certainly energy costs are increasing the cost of raw materials and transportation. Labor costs are rising in some markets as well. Suppliers are experiencing cost increases and are passing them along to retailers. We continue to be diligent that any price increase is justified. We continue to leverage our global purchasing capability to keep cost increases down as much as possible.", "Mike Duke's team at Wal-Mart International continues to do a great job balancing inflation, cost pressures, and our commitment to improving return on investment. And his team also takes learnings from one country and insures that they are shared across the organization. Beyond price, our customers expect us to be relevant to them.", "Our Wal-Mart U.S. team, under Eduardo Castro-Wright, has been increasingly successful in also making our store relevant to shoppers across the store. If you want to save money, you\u2019re going to be able to go from department to department and find us relevant to your needs. Our WalMart team is improving the level of consistency in every area of the business.", "I know that Eduardo will talk about the progress that our associates have made in these areas, as well as the overall results of Wal-Mart U.S. business, but I want to recognize the U.S. team for its contributions in managing inventory because it helps us keep so many of our costs down. Our U.S. stores are better merchandised and better in-stock. The presentation is better, and the customer service continues to improve every day because our productivity is better.", "The economy is tougher also for small businesses. Food inflation is eating into the profits in restaurants and convenience stores. Our Sam\u2019s Club members, both Business and Advantage, appreciate what Doug McMillon and his team are doing to keep prices low and to insure that the members realize the value and the benefits of a Sam\u2019s Club membership. I know that later on Doug will talk about the challenges that Sam\u2019s Club is facing. We are confident that the Club channel is particularly relevant in an economy like the one we face today.", "The success of Wal-Mart\u2019s business model is built on saving people money so they can live better. The strategy of Wal-Mart as a corporate citizen rests on our continued improvements in providing opportunities for our associates in diversity, in leadership of sustainability, and improved responsible sourcing, and we are committed to making progress in these areas.", "WalMart now employs about 2.1 million associates around the world. We continue to offer career opportunities to people in every one of our markets. It is gratifying that so many people line up for a job at Wal-Mart when we announce openings. They see the opportunity that we bring to their future.", "As I\u2019ve talked about before, we recently launched a groundbreaking initiative in China to build the supply chain of the future. Our goal is to drive sustainable business practices, energy efficiency, and innovation throughout Wal-Mart and the global supply chain.", "On October 22nd in Beijing, Wal-Mart will host a sustainability summit which will bring together our leading suppliers, non-governmental organizations or NGOs, and entrepreneurs. Our objective at this meeting is to discuss with our suppliers our expectations for improving and launching further Wal-Mart sustainability initiatives. I will be able to share more about this meeting when I see you at the analyst and investor meeting in late October.", "Now let me turn the microphone over to Tom Schoewe for all the numbers and more.", "Tom Schoewe", "Lee, before I dive into the details, there\u2019s something that we all need to keep in mind. Our results in the second quarter of last year included $0.04 per share of net benefits that we did not repeat this year. To understand how well our underlying businesses are performing, I\u2019ve asked Eduardo Castro-Wright and Doug McMillon to review their results both with and without these net credits. The key takeaway is that our underlying operating results are far stronger than our reported results would indicate. Now let me get into the results.", "Total net sales for the company were approximately $101.6 billion. That\u2019s up 10.4%. In addition, U.S. comp store sales were a positive 4.5%, and that\u2019s without fuel in the second quarter. It\u2019s clear that the improvements that we\u2019ve made in the business, along with the sales generated by the economic stimulus checks, contributed to our U.S. businesses outperforming our comp guidance for the quarter. Operating income was up 9.7%, with income from continuing operations before taxes and minority interest for the second quarter increasing 9.5%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.86. That\u2019s up from the $0.75 a share that we reported in the second quarter of last year.", "As I mentioned before, last year\u2019s second quarter results included a net benefit of approximately $0.04 per share from accruals for general liability and workers compensation claims, which were reduced by $196 million - and that\u2019s after tax - and $41 million in after-tax gains from the sale of certain real estate properties. These benefits were offset by $66 million of after-tax charges for legal and other contingencies.", "The company closed the sale of Gazeley Limited Group, a commercial property subsidiary of ASDA in the United Kingdom, this July. The results of Gazeley\u2019s operations have been presented in today\u2019s Q2 press release as discontinued operations for all periods. We anticipate recording a gain from the sale of Gazeley in the upcoming third quarter of fiscal 2009.", "In addition, discontinued operations for the current quarter includes a $63 million gain which resulted from the resolution of a tax contingency related to the McLane Company. Also in a prior year second quarter, the company reported a charge of $153 million related to the disposition of our German operations.", "Now let\u2019s look at our consolidated results. Consolidated gross margin was up 32 basis points for the second quarter, due primarily to the improvements Wal-Mart U.S. made in inventory management and merchandising flow. Inventory is one of our five financial metrics that support our efforts to improve free cash flow. Our goal is for inventory to increase at half of the rate of our sales growth. Consolidated inventories were up 3.5% against a year-to-date sales increase of 10.4%, a good performance again driven primarily by Wal-Mart U.S.", "Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 84.6% at the end of the second quarter, which is up 3.6% from last year.", "Membership and other income were up approximately 6% for the second quarter over last year. Recall that last year at this time other income also included the gains from the sale of the real estate I mentioned earlier. Other income includes Sam\u2019s Club membership revenue, tenant lease income, financial services and recycling income. Doug will comment on our efforts to improve membership income later in the call.", "Financial services had another very strong performance, and Eduardo will provide more detail on that operation in just a moment. I don\u2019t want to steal his thunder.", "Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up approximately 31 basis points over last year, largely due to higher bonus payments for store and field associates and the favorable adjustments to general liability and worker\u2019s compensation claim accruals recorded in the prior year that we mentioned earlier.", "Expenses in our \"Other\" segment were up approximately 23% from the second quarter of fiscal 2008, again due primarily to our investment in transformation programs. Investments in information systems for merchandising, finance and human resources will continue to be a headwind for the rest of this fiscal year and several years to come.", "And now let\u2019s cover the status of our interest expense, tax rate and debt levels. Net interest expense was up 12.9% over last year\u2019s second quarter due to higher debt levels to fund increased share repurchase over the last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.2%. We continue to expect the tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be between 34% and 35%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuation. Factors which may impact our rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax matters and the mix of international to domestic income.", "Debt to total capitalization was 40.0% at the end of the second quarter of this fiscal year. This is slightly reduced from the 40.9% we reported at the same time last year.", "Our cash flow from operations to average debt was approximately 44%.", "Now let me shift gears for just a minute and report some really important news. Lee talked about our very solid operating management coupled with strong capital efficiency. Recall that we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less Capex. The combination of these two factors - improved operations and capital efficiency - allowed us today to report that the company ended the first six months with free cash flow of $4.9 billion. This compares to a cash flow deficit last year of $773 million \u2013 incredible progress.", "Furthermore, return on investment from continuing operations for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2008 is 19.3%, which is flat - that\u2019s right, flat - to the 19.3% we reported at the same time last year. We consider this a very significant achievement. The focus on improving the operating metrics is paying off and is reflected in our ROI progress.", "A deeper dive into our cash flow statement reflects payments for capital spending, or Capex, of approximately $5 billion for the first half of fiscal 2009, down from approximately $7 billion in the same period last year. As I said midJune, we are forecasting capital spending for fiscal 2009 to be between $13 and $14 billion. This is down from our original projection of $13.5 to $15.2 billion for the total year.", "During the second quarter we repurchased approximately $845 million of our stock, which represented approximately 14.7 million shares. Under our current $15 billion share repurchase facility, we have spent approximately $8.7 billion.", "Let me close with an update to our quarterly report card on financial metrics. We\u2019re in the positive column on three of our five metrics. Those include growing inventory at or less than half of the rate of sales; secondly, growing payables faster than inventories; and finally, growing operating income greater than the increase in costs for property, plant and equipment.", "While operating income did not grow as rapidly as sales, I\u2019d like to remind you that if we exclude the net benefit recorded last year in the second quarter, we would have exceeded this goal by a significant margin.", "Finally, we would like to see our corporate expenses grow slower than sales. As I mentioned earlier, we have a multi-year commitment to improving our systems for merchandising, finance and the people area. These initiatives will represent a headwind for a while.", "And now we\u2019ll move on to the discussion of our three operating segments. Eduardo, I think you\u2019re up first.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright", "Thanks Tom.", "I\u2019m very pleased with the Wal-Mart U.S. team\u2019s performance. Total net sales for Wal-Mart U.S. for second quarter of fiscal 2009 were $64 billion, up 8.5% from the prior year. In May, I shared with you that our 2.7% comparable store sales figure for the first quarter was the best comp performance for Wal-Mart U.S. in eight quarters. Well, I\u2019m proud to say that we delivered even better comp performance this quarter. Wal-Mart U.S. delivered a 4.6% comp for the second quarter. Year-to-date, our U.S. stores have comparable store sales of 3.7%. This compares to a 0.6% comp figure at this time last year.", "While the stimulus checks contributed to store sales growth during the second quarter, we believe that the underlying strength of our business, reflected by our clear price leadership position, operational improvements, and stronger merchandise quality and presentation, were also important factors in our results. We\u2019re seeing the investment made in our three year strategic plan to strengthen our business pay off. Our stores have positive traffic and ticket for the quarter, as well as year-to-date. The fastest traffic growth was in our metropolitan markets, while we continue to see increases in ticket in some of our rural markets as customers consolidate their trips to save money on gas.", "Wal-Mart\u2019s one stop shopping proposition is becoming more important than ever. It is clear that customers are voting with their wallet as our price leadership position continues to ensure customer loyalty and drive new customers to Wal-Mart.", "Our associates are making a big difference in the customer experience in our stores. Survey scores reflecting friendlier associates, faster check-out times, and cleaner stores were at record levels since we started measuring them 18 months ago. These results reflect the changes that Bill Simon, our Chief Operating Officer, has been driving in our stores.", "Operating profit grew faster than sales and was up 10.8% over the same period last year. You should note, however, that on an apples-to-apples basis, operating profit grew more than twice the rate of sales in this quarter once you factor in the $265 million adjustment in operating profit in the prior year related to real estate gains, reduction of general liability and workers compensation claim accruals, and legal expenses.", "We opened 29 stores during the second quarter, which brings our year-to-date total to 82 new stores. I\u2019m very pleased at the overall sales performance of our new stores. Both new construction and relocations or expansions has improved on a year-to-date basis over the last year.", "Merchandise flow improvements continue to drive our solid inventory performance and are having a significant impact on sales growth and lower mark-ups. These initiatives are allowing us to have a more precise seasonal transition, which has resulted in less clearance and has made our merchandise presentation more relevant to customers. For example, we are replacing clearance merchandise we had last year with new [inaudible] merchandise that hit our stores in August this year.", "For the second quarter of the fiscal year, inventory was below plan, growing only by 0.4% on sales growth of 8.5%.", "Gross profit increased 11% for the second quarter, 250 basis points faster than the rate of sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was up 58 basis points.", "Our operators made significant improvements in reducing shrink by 18 basis points. Mark downs were down by 32 basis points for the quarter.", "With fuel costs more than 60% over last year, our logistics efficiency has become an even greater competitive advantage for our business. The benefits of our efficient logistic infrastructure are even more important now as we work to minimize the impact of increases in fuel costs through a number of initiatives. We\u2019re shipping more while driving fewer miles, but getting more on each trailer. We\u2019re improving packaging to reduce overload transportation costs. And our logistics team also continues to improve miles per gallon rates through more efficient engines, driver training, and the use of auxiliary power units.", "Expenses, net of the impact discussed earlier, grew only slightly. This increase was entirely a result of our decision to increase bonuses for improved business performance for store and field associates. Bonuses are paid on a quarterly basis, and I continue to be happy to see us rewarding our associates.", "Sales per labor hour continued to improve this quarter over last year through diligent planning and execution on scheduling. We\u2019re following through with a rollout of the scheduling system in all departments throughout U.S. stores. As a result, we saw wages grow at a slower rate than sales.", "Now let me cover more detail about our individual merchandise units. You know that inflation, particularly in food, has affected consumer discretionary purchases and has been a factor, both positive and negative, for all retailers. As we said, we\u2019re steadfast in our commitment to price leadership while maintaining margins. Cost increases in meat, produce, dairy and bakery continue to contribute to inflation in food, and overall food inflation is running in the mid single digit percent level. We have increased the number of rollbacks substantially in grocery to mitigate these price increases.", "Grocery maintained its solid performance for food and consumables. Customers are spending more time looking for ways to stretch their dollars. We continue to emphasize our value. Our Simple Mealtime Ideas campaign, which started in mid-July, is featuring products that can be used to prepare a meal for a family of four for under $10.00. And one of our new TV commercials features the value of the Take-n-Bake pizza.", "On the other hand, inflation within general merchandise has been less pronounced and deflation has continued in electronics. Our entertainment business also continues to exceed plan. We have seen strong sales throughout the quarter in computers, flat panel TVs, video games and digital audio.", "In our health and wellness unit, our pharmacy prescription business has sustained high single-digit comparable stores sales growth. The $4 and $10 prescription programs continue to drive pharmacy traffic. The $10, 90day prescription offering resulted in high double-digit fill rate increases. The program also contributed to substantial increases in pharmacy customer experience and faster checkout scores. The $4 or less price on more than 1,000 over-the-counter products also is generating strong customer response.", "Our back-to-school eye care campaign is driving increases in our optical business. In July, at the start of the important back-to-school season, Wal-Mart\u2019s apparel comparable store sales outperformed other large retailers and many specialty retailers. The introduction of L.e.i. jeans in our Juniors and Girls department has exceeded expectations, and this line is now exclusive to Wal-Mart. Our strong price impression and improved merchandise quality are driving increased traffic within apparel.", "Even with the challenging economy, we are pleased to see that our investments in Home are paying off with improved performance. We have revised the layout of the departments and adjacencies for ease of shopping. We have improved merchandise quality in assortment and have sharpened prices. Our back-to-college campaign is driving sales in all categories within Home, including furniture, small appliances, housewares and bedding.", "The status of the housing market continues to impact sales in the do-it-yourself categories within hard lines. But I\u2019m pleased that our sporting goods business and our seasonal categories in hard lines are improving and delivered positive comparable store sales figures in the quarter. Our Game Time campaign begins this week as customers look to get ready for the football season. And Wal-Mart\u2019s integrated Do the Math and Save campaign for back-to-school has positioned us clearly as the price leader for all school supplies. As with other seasons, we do believe that customers are shopping closer to the holiday and we expect momentum to increase in the coming weeks.", "Our site-to-store service continues to drive traffic to both our Wal-Mart.com site and to our stores. Comparable store sales and overload sales dollars for the dot com business unit are strong, with double-digit increases over last year. Sales are very good in furniture, baby departments and entertainment categories.", "In the second quarter, Wal-Mart Financial Services realized strong double digit growth, driven primarily by check cashing, money transfers, and the Wal-Mart Money Card businesses. We also offered customers free economic stimulus check cashing, which served to introduce customers to our portfolio of money services. Between May and July, Wal-Mart cashed in our stores for free almost $2.9 million of the stimulus checks.", "You probably have seen that we have made significant improvements in our marketing and in-store communications. Two years of work on our brand culminated in the updating of the Wal-Mart U.S. brand image, with a recent introduction of the new Wal-Mart logo. If you haven\u2019t seen it, it\u2019s available on our website. The tag line, Save Money, Live Better, brings even more focus on our price leadership and is completely integrated into the new branding campaign. Customers have responded well, and they will continue to see it even more integrated into our stores during the second half of the year.", "Television and circular support during second quarter were up significantly over last year, with the focus on food and consumables across the businesses around key seasonal shopping locations, including Mother\u2019s Day, Memorial Day, Father\u2019s Day, American summer, July the 4th, and back-to-school.", "So let me recap some of our highlights for the second quarter. Wal-Mart U.S. had strong sales with 4.6% comparable store sales in the second quarter. Gross margin improved, driven by solid inventory management. We continued to edit our assortments and have increased our price leadership position. We continue to show improvement in our customer experience metrics - fast, friendly and clean.", "So, what next? Well, we remain cautiously optimistic as we enter the second half of the year. As Lee commented earlier, the economy remains challenging, which can contribute to volatility in sales on a week-toweek basis. Consumers are counting on Wal-Mart for the lowest prices, and we remain committed to our mission to save people money so they can live better. As a business, we remain focused on investing capital prudently, reducing inventory, leveraging expenses, improving productivity, and driving sales growth.", "Now I will turn it over to Charles for Wal-Mart International.", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Eduardo.", "As Tom noted earlier, in July we closed the sale of Gazeley Limited, our commercial property development business in the United Kingdom. As mentioned earlier, this is now a discontinued operation. This divestiture is another example of portfolio optimization, one of three key strategies for our international business.", "With the backdrop of a challenging global economic environment, we are also continuing to focus on price leadership to drive value to our customers. Leveraging best practices around the world, we continue to fine-tune our product offerings and price points to meet our customers' needs. This has enabled all of our markets to grow sales faster than the overall growth of their markets, evidence of the success of our strategy of winning in every market.", "International net sales for the second quarter were approximately $25.3 billion. That is a 16.9% increase over the prior year. The impact of currency valuation on sales generated a benefit of $1.1 billion, driven by strength across most currencies, notably the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real.", "Our strongest underlying sales performances in the quarter came from China, including Trust-Mart, as well as Brazil. Canada, the United Kingdom, and Mexico also continued to deliver healthy sales despite tough economic conditions. Segment operating income for the second quarter was $1.2 billion, up 16.5%.", "Gross margin for the segment was down slightly versus the second quarter last year, largely for two reasons - first, our stores in Japan are shifting more to the every day low pricing strategy, and second, an increased contribution of fuel in the U.K. These decreases in gross margin were partially offset by improvements in Brazil and China.", "Excluding the impact of currency, operating expenses as a percentage of segment sales were down from the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Contributing to this were strong improvements in Brazil, Japan, China and the United Kingdom. Without the impact of currency valuation, operating income grew slightly faster than sales. The second quarter impact of currency valuation on operating income was a net benefit of $41 million.", "Now let\u2019s move on to the results of our larger countries. As far as the U.K., this has been another successful quarter for ASDA. According to the industry TNS data, ASDA is gaining market share at the fastest rate in many years. In addition, ASDA surpassed its plans for both sales and operating income in spite of the slowing economy. ASDA\u2019s growth in the quarter was driven by both customer traffic and ticket. The traffic gains reflect ASDA\u2019s strong price and value focus, as well as the broader appeal of our stores in the U.K. ASDA has continued to improve merchandise quality and assortment to attract a wider customer base, with more than 25% of all new customers in the AB demographic income segment.", "Comparable store sales, excluding fuel, increased 5.5%. Adjusting for the timing of Easter, which was not in the second quarter this year but was last year, the underlying comp growth was 6%, up from 5% in the first quarter this year. Total sales, excluding fuel, increased in the high single digits, and were in the low double digits including fuel. ASDA\u2019s market share rose by 60 basis points to 12.3% in the 12 weeks ending July 13th, as TNS reported.", "Food sales in the U.K. were strong, driven mainly by customer traffic, volume growth, and some inflation. Fastest growing areas were core grocery and fresh food. In general merchandise, the strongest performances came in computer games and baby products. Apparel sales were up versus last year, with market share rising to 3.4% according to TNS. Sales of recently launched apparel brands MODA and Boston Crew have exceeded expectations and back-to-school merchandise is selling well.", "Performance was strong across ASDA\u2019s product assortment. Sales of ASDA\u2019s private labels, Smart Price and Extra Special, were up more than 20% from this quarter last year. ASDA is appealing to both the traditional value- oriented shopper and to premium shoppers who are looking for value without compromising on quality.", "During the second quarter, ASDA won the award from the grocer trade publication for being the lowest-priced supermarket in the U.K. for the 11th straight year. In addition, ASDA also won the awards for customer service and product availability, reflecting the focus placed on retailing basics over the last two years, particularly in check-out lines and in-stock.", "We are very pleased with ASDA's second quarter expense performance, as total expenses increased at a slower rate than sales despite rising transportation and energy costs. In this tough economy, ASDA is well positioned to continue offering value to customers.", "And now on to Mexico. Our customers in Mexico continue to be challenged by a weak economy, and Walmex continues working to provide customers with the best possible prices. In the difficult economic times facing the Mexican consumer, it is more essential than ever to help our customers save money so they can live better. There are several ways we are doing this in Mexico.", "We continue to reinforce our price differential, which is at its strongest level in years. We also are expanding rapidly, and have opened twice as many stores this year as we did last year during the same period. In addition, we continue to search for new, meaningful ways to communicate and identify with our customers, including special campaigns such as celebrating the 50th anniversary of Bodega Aurrera with events focused on thanking customers for their loyalty.", "Second quarter sales increased 12.2% and comparable store sales increased 5.9%, both in nominal terms. These were driven by customer traffic, which increased 12.2% in the second quarter. The traffic increase is more than was observed in the second quarters of the two previous years. This is especially notable because of the current uncertain economic environment in Mexico. Self-service formats, Bodega Aurrera, and Superama delivered the best sales performance of all of the Walmex formats.", "Gross margin in the second quarter was strong and continued to improve due to solid improvements in inventory management, efficiencies in distribution and shrinkage reductions. This is despite price investment and the underperformance of our apparel format, Suburbia, and VIPS restaurants.", "One of the highlights of the quarter was inventory management. Inventory grew at 1.6%, a fraction of Walmex's increase in sales.", "Operating income grew slower than the rate of sales due to several factors - costs from store expansion program in Mexico, which resulted in double the number of stores built in the second quarter of this year, and the development of our banking operations in Mexico as well as the closure of certain VIPS restaurants and pressure on utility expenses.", "Now moving north to Canada, highlighting this quarter was the grand opening of Wal-Mart Canada's 300th store, a supercenter in Ontario. During the second quarter, Canada opened four supercenters, bringing the total now open to 36. We continue to gain overall market share because of our expanded food business.", "At Wal-Mart Canada, second quarter net sales improved by 9.5% while comp sales grew slightly over 3%. The electronics category, led by gaming and computers, grew significantly in the second quarter, as did food, both through the supercenter expansion program and strong pantry sales at discount stores.", "Operating income in Canada increased faster than sales, driven by a combination of higher sales volume, improved margins, favorable exchange rate movements and the sale of certain real estate properties.", "In South America, Brazil had healthy sales growth of 16.6%. Comp sales in real terms were also strong as 6.8% for the quarter and 7.9% year-to-date. These outstanding results were driven by an increase in traffic as well as sales at our low-price formats Todo Dia and Maxi.", "Operating income in Brazil was up as a percentage of sales largely due to Brazil's continued effort to leverage fixed costs. This is especially significant considering that 20 new stores have been opened since the second quarter of last year. In addition, we are pleased with the sales performance of our specialty categories, particularly pharmacy.", "And now leaving the Americas and turning to Asia, as you are aware, in April, following the successful tender offer, Seiyu was delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is now wholly owned by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. During the second quarter, food sales in Japan grew 2.1% and overall customer traffic was up 1.6%, driven by our price investments.", "However, general merchandise and apparel sales were impacted by the planned elimination of the [Yu Tai] promotional program. This program provided a discount in select categories to certain credit card holders, and was eliminated as part of Seiyu's shift to the everyday low price strategy. Although overall comp sales for the quarter were down 0.3%, year-to-date comp sales were up 0.6%.", "Our strategic pricing initiatives, geared toward establishing price leadership, are moving forward as planned. As we shift to EDLP in Japan, we are focused on communicating with our customers to ensure they understand our commitment to low prices. Customers' response to EDLP thus far has been positive, as evidenced by increasing traffic in stores and departments where it has been implemented. The shift to EDLP means we are accelerating our EDLC initiatives. As a result, store expenses as a percentage of sales have decreased. Improvements have been made in labor productivity, logistics efficiency, and administrative costs.", "Seiyu had a profitable second quarter, but income was down slightly from last year primarily due to sales and margin pressures previously mentioned.", "Lastly, let's discuss China. Sales at Wal-Mart China increased 32.2% over the second quarter of last year. Comparable store sales were also strong at 15.9% in the second quarter. However, as Lee mentioned earlier, inflation is an increasing concern in the Chinese economy, with second quarter inflation at approximately 8%. Our second quarter comparable store sales performance was driven by an 18% increase in average ticket.", "Wal-Mart China's second quarter contribution to operating income improved significantly as compared to the prior year. Margin was up slightly due to a mix shift from food toward general merchandise. In addition, expenses decreased as a percentage of sales due to improved focus on utilities and store labor. Further, we are saving on the expense of shopping bags due to China's ban on providing free plastic shopping bags to customers.", "Also in China, our Trust-Mart business had comp sales growth of 13.2% in the second quarter due to increases in both average ticket and customer traffic. Trust-Mart's operating income increased faster than sales in part due to improved margin. This performance is notable considering we are also seeing a slight mix shift toward grocery. One Trust-Mart remains closed from the May earthquake.", "Now I'll turn it over to Doug to report on Sam's Club. Doug?", "Doug McMillon ", "Thank you, Charles. I'll cover the financial results and also spend some time talking about how the current environment, including inflation and fuel, is impacting the Sam's business. I'll also cover membership, where we're starting to see some encouraging results.", "As Tom noted, comparisons of Sam's Club's results for the second quarter of this year versus last year should take into consideration the impact of last year's reduction of general liability and workers compensation claims accruals, of which $21 million pre-tax was related to Sam's Club. This amount was partially offset in the same period last year by $5 million pre-tax in legal contingency accruals for Sam's Club.", "In the second quarter this year, Sam's Club sales grew by 8% to $12.3 billion. Comparable Club sales, excluding the gallon inflation effect of fuel, increased by 3.7%. Including fuel sales, the comparable Club sales number would be 7.2%, so fuel had a big impact on our results.", "Both traffic and ticket - again, with fuel - increased in comparable Clubs for the quarter as well as year-to-date. For the second quarter this year we were pleased to see traffic and ticket up for both Advantage and Business members. So, while we continue to see our strongest performance with small business, Sam's Club is clearly appealing to families and individuals for their personal needs as well.", "Consistent with industry results, strong sales categories for the quarter were concentrated in the food and consumables areas. General merchandise sales overall were relatively soft, but there were some bright spots in areas such as video games, LCD TVs, GPS units, digital cameras, mattresses, and grills and gardening. Softer categories for the quarter included housewares, jewelry and apparel, which is reflective of the overall retail market for those categories right now.", "The gross margin rate decreased 21 basis points for the quarter. The decrease was due entirely to the impact of fuel on our mix. During the second quarter, the average retail price per gallon of gasoline was $3.81 versus $2.91 for the same period last year. If you take fuel out of the margin rate calculation, then the rate would have been up versus the prior year.", "Let me talk about fuel and inflation and how they interplay with margin. We like selling fuel at our Clubs. We know that the great prices we provide on gasoline drive member loyalty in terms of renewal rates and inClub ticket. However, most months we do not make a lot of margin on fuel. We're selling significantly more fuel than a year ago in terms of gallons pumped and dollars per gallon, however, while top line fuel sales have increased dramatically, fuel profit on a dollar basis was basically flat for the quarter. So we see a large impact on gross margin percentages.", "In addition to fuel, inflationary pressures were significant in the quarter in areas like bakery and dry grocery, where flour, rice and other commodities reside. Consumable categories such as pet supplies and paper goods are also under pressure. We're actively managing price increase requests from suppliers and working with them to try to mitigate their impact as much as possible. Our members rely on us to give them the best prices, and we take that responsibility seriously. We are their buying agent. Despite recent improvements in some cloudy pricing, we anticipate continued pricing pressure in coming months.", "As it relates to membership income, we expect the next couple of quarters to be challenging from a renewal dollar perspective. Renewal rates continue to hold, but renewal dollars are pressured due to new signup performance from previous periods. Sales of our $100 Plus memberships have been a positive for us. We're seeing the impact of improved execution of membership, and I'm encouraged by the progress with new signups.", "Inventory levels for the second quarter were up about 4% versus the prior year. Most of the increase was deliberate, as we bought some product ahead of price increases and accelerated new and fresh fall apparel deliveries into the Clubs, which did result in stronger increases in July apparel sales. It is taking us longer to sell through patio sets than planned, but we're transitioning now and overall, I fell good about our inventory management.", "Expenses were up slightly as a percent of sales compared to last year. Again, the prior year's benefit from casualty adjustments impacts the math on this. As we move into the second half of the year, ensuring our expense structure's properly aligned to the evolving economic environment while maintaining or enhancing inClub member service will be a priority, especially given the pressure from fuel margins.", "I'm proud that our Clubs in the second quarter achieved a five-year high on member service scores, and we look to continue that performance.", "Other income, including membership, which we record on a deferred revenue recognition basis, increased nominally from the prior year.", "Operating income decreased 2.9% to $432 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. The decrease was driven by the prior year impacts I've already discussed. Even without those impacts, however, our income growth did not meet our goal of growing profits faster than sales.", "In a membership model, retaining or, better yet, building loyalty in a time when both small businesses and our Advantage members are under strain is a wise investment in our future. So while this quarter's profit performance would not reflect our longer-term objectives for Sam's Club and our business, I'm confident that we're managing the business in the right way for long-term success through merchandising our clubs with the items that members want now, through continuing to improve execution of our membership program, through managing expenses to meet today's economic realities, and continuing to enhance inClub member service.", "Now back to Tom for the earnings guidance. Tom?", "Tom Schoewe ", "Thanks, Doug.", "For the third quarter we expect U.S. comp store sales, excluding fuel, to increase in the range of 1% to 2%. As we said on sales day last Thursday, we believe our U.S. businesses are well positioned for the current economy. However, we still see sales volatility from week to week, especially around paycheck cycles.", "We expect earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter to be between $0.73 and $0.76 per share. At the beginning of this fiscal year we said that our guidance for the full year was between $3.30 and $3.43 per share. Today we are raising our current year forecast for fiscal year earnings per share from continuing operations to a new range of $3.43 to $3.50 per share.", "That's it for today.

This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations. The replay of this call and related materials about the quarter are available on our website.", "We\u2019ve changed the format for our call and beginning today each operating CEO will cover his business. Here\u2019s today\u2019s agenda. Lee Scott will provide opening comments on our business and the economy. Charles Holley will cover the detailed consolidated financial results for the company. Eduardo Castro-Wright will discuss the results for Wal-Mart US followed by Mike Duke on Wal-Mart International and the results of our largest countries. Doug McMillon is up next with Sam\u2019s Club followed by Tom Schoewe who will close our call with the status of our financial metrics and comment about the fourth quarter including guidance.", "The investor relations team is available for follow up on the third quarter today and with that let\u2019s get on with the results.", "Lee Scott", "It\u2019s really a pleasure to start by saying that we have solid sales and earnings for the third quarter despite economic difficulties and global currency fluctuations. This is good news on top of last weeks solid results on October US comp sales. These results are truly a credit to our more than 2 million associates around the world who are delivering for our customers and our members.", "Diluted earnings per share in quarter three were $0.77 which compares to $0.70 last year. This was clearly the result of improved operating performance coupled with capital efficiency. We also saw free cash flow improve year to date compared to the same time last year. Sales for this quarter were $97.6 billion a 7.5% increase over the same period last year. We\u2019ve strengthened our price leadership position and it is more established than ever with our customers. This will continue to drive our success.", "As we indicated at our analyst meeting about three weeks ago the Wal-Mart model works around the world. These results are further proof that customers appreciate how we are executing on our strategy to save them money so they can live better. I visit our US Wal-Mart stores almost every week and I can tell you they just feel better. The morale of our associates is better and their performance is reflected in the customer service they are delivering every day.", "In fact, a number of our customers have been telling me how much they appreciate the assistance that our associates are offering. Our focus on inventory management has delivered improved financial results since last year and from the customer standpoint the merchandise is presented in a more thoughtful and attractive way.", "The new three year plan that Eduardo now has in place for Wal-Mart US, I think he calls is Project Impact, will continue to have a positive impact on ROI. Improved returns will come by rebalancing new store growth with accelerated remodeling in the next couple of years. Many of the analysts and investors saw the results at store number one in Rogers, Arkansas, which is in fact our first store to go through this initiative. Since the remodeling, store one has had higher customer experience scores and higher sales.", "Despite the headwinds from currency our international performance is solid. As you\u2019ll hear from Mike today our everyday low price strategy allows us to perform well against competitors in this environment. We are committed to EDLP and EDLC in every market. Further, we will continue to invest in those international markets with superior growth opportunities that can deliver enhanced returns.", "I\u2019m particularly encouraged by the October sales results at Sam\u2019s Club. The membership programs that Doug and his team have initiated are increasing new sign ups. These initiatives and membership along with improvements in merchandising and marketing are very promising. At the analyst meeting you heard details about our capital expenditures program. The emphasis on capital efficiency is at the top of the list when our real estate committee meets to review projects. Both in the United States and in other markets we remain very focused on the most effective use of our capital dollars.", "Before you hear more about our detailed results let me comment on our sales and the economy. I was pleased with our US comp of 2.4% for the October period. Both Wal-Mart US and Sam\u2019s Club had good results with an increase in traffic. We believe that our price leadership position continues to resonate with customers and members across all demographics. Wal-Mart has momentum as we move into the fourth quarter.", "The stronger US dollar will start to have a negative impact on international segment and as Tom will share with you later it will likely affect us in the fourth quarter.", "On an entirely different subject, last week the United States elected Senator Barak Obama as our 44th President. In many ways it was an historic election, our first African American President and a record turnout of voters. I\u2019m excited about our nation coming together to address issues important to our customers and our associates. I said in June that Wal-Mart was looking forward to working with the new President and Congress regardless of party to find solutions to our challenges. We are even more committed to that today.", "President Elect Obama is already laying out long term steps that are designed to help the middle class including initiatives in energy, healthcare and economic growth. If the US can improve its healthcare system and its energy policy, if we can strengthen our economy and put more money in the pockets of our customers we will all benefit.", "We are aware of the challenges related to this economy though we are realistic about the holidays and our sales performance. Throughout the world we are well prepared at Wal-Mart. Our price leadership positions us well and will help our customers in all markets navigate through these difficult economic times. I\u2019m optimistic about the holidays for Wal-Mart and for the Wal-Mart customer. It is our time and we have momentum from the third quarter.", "While I know it\u2019s only November 13, let me close with sincere wishes for a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday everywhere it\u2019s celebrated. On behalf of our 2 million Wal-Mart associates around this world have a great Christmas and a Happy and Healthy New Year.", "Now Charles will give you the details on the financial results.", "Charles Holley", "Total net sales for the company were up 7.5% for the third quarter to approximately $97.6 billion. In addition, US comp stores sales were a positive 3% without fuel. Operating income was up 6.7% and income from continuing operations before taxes and minority interest increased 7.4% for the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.77, that\u2019s up from the $0.70 we reported in the third quarter last year. As a reminder earnings per share last year were impacted positively by $0.01 per share from a gain on the sale of certain real estate properties.", "Discontinued operations for the current quarter includes an after tax gain of $212 million from the sale of Gazeley Limited an ASDA Property Development subsidiary and a $107 million after tax charge related to the closure of 23 stores and the planned divestiture of other properties at Seiyu in Japan.", "Before we get into the additional detail let me comment on the significant exchange rate changes we have all seen during the past month. In our October sales release last week we called out the 14.8 percentage point impact that exchange rates had on Wal-Mart International\u2019s monthly sales results. For most of our International markets the impact of October foreign currency fluctuations will be reflected in our fourth quarter results of fiscal 2009. Since all countries except Canada and Puerto Rico are consolidated on a one month lag.", "Now let\u2019s get back to the consolidated results. Consolidated gross profit was up 34 basis points for the third quarter primarily due to a strong performance by the Wal-Mart US segment. Consolidated inventories were up only 2.2% when compared to October of last year and that\u2019s against a year to date sales increase of 9.4%. Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 76.2% at the end of the third quarter which is down 3.2% from last year.", "This is primarily related to the cut off of the quarter end between this year and last year for some of our larger international operations. Last year we benefited from when the quarter end occurred and when we made our payments. This year we did not experience this benefit.", "Membership and other income this quarter were down 3%. Recall last year other income included $71 million and pre-tax gains from the sale of certain real estate properties. Other income also includes Sam\u2019s Club membership revenue which is down slightly from the third quarter last year. It also includes tenant lease income, financial services, and recycling income.", "Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up 26 basis points over last year. This is due in part to expenses related to hurricane damage and recovery in the United States as well as an increase in corporate expenses and higher bonus accruals for store and field associates at Wal-Mart US.", "Corporate expenses were up approximately 17% from the third quarter of fiscal 2008 due primarily to the investments the company is making in transformation programs. These investments in our infrastructure, merchandising, finance and HR systems ensure that we create the value our customers, shareholders and associates expect and deserve.", "The merchandising systems upgrade includes space allocation, pricing tools and other business improvement systems to ensure we continue to capture value for our shareholders and to improve the customer experience in our stores. For the finance area we are involved in a major third party implementation to ensure that our systems are strategically integrated and flexible to support our growth. The HR improvements include upgrades and enhancements to people division infrastructure, management development and scheduling customization.", "Net interest expense was down slightly from last year\u2019s third quarter due primarily to lower short term rates. Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.9% which is up 38 basis points from this quarter last year. The recent fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which have affected the mix of income between domestic and international operations are the main driver of this increase. This situation may continue to be a factor for the remainder of the year but we continue to expect our tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be between 34% and 35%.", "Debt to total capitalization was 41.8% for the third quarter this year compared to 42.9% last year. Looking at our cash flow statement our capital spend for the nine months of this fiscal year is approximately $8.2 billion down from approximately $10.9 billion at this time last year. During the third quarter we repurchased approximately $1.3 billion of our stock which represents approximately 21.4 million shares.", "As we noted during the analyst meeting we stepped back on share repurchase in early October. We believe it is more prudent to take a pause while the financial markets settle down. Year to date we have purchased almost 61.5 million shares under our current $15 billion share repurchase authorization we have spent almost $10 billion to repurchase approximately 203.6 million shares.", "Now let\u2019s move to the discussion of our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Wal-Mart US.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright", "It\u2019s been a great quarter. I\u2019m pleased with the Wal-Mart US results. In this increasingly difficult environment our business strategy is delivering strong results. Our mission to help customers save money so they can live better couldn\u2019t be more relevant than it is today and it is positioning us quite well for the future.", "For the third quarter fiscal 2009 our comp store sales increased by a solid 2.7%. Year to date our Wal-Mart US stores have a 3.4% comp sales increase significantly higher than this time last year. Total net sales increased by 6.1% to $61.2 billion for the third quarter. As Lee pointed out our sales performance is indicative of the momentum driving Wal-Mart US with both our customers and our associates.", "Across every category in which we do business we continue to widen the performance cap between our stores and the competition. Clearly the momentum is driven by the significant progress we\u2019ve made building on the trust that American families have in the Wal-Mart brand and improvements we have made in how they experience our stores. I feel confident that the next three year plan we laid out at our recent analyst meeting will continue to drive this momentum.", "Operating income for Wal-Mart US are $4.3 billion grew faster than sales and increased 7.3% over the third quarter last year. This is especially impressive if you consider that our sales and profit were negatively impacted by unusual expenses of $176 million related to hurricanes Gustaf and Ike and also to increased incentive bonus accruals for store associates.", "As indicated before expenses increased 9% due to damage and recovery costs from the hurricanes as well as the increased accruals for performance bonuses to be paid to field associates to recognize better than planned performance across the majority of stores. Regarding the hurricane costs let me remind you that Wal-Mart is self insured for these kinds of events.", "Gross profit as a percent of sales increased by 71 basis points when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Our gross profit improvement is being driven by a favorable merchandise mix that reflects the application of our Win/Play/Show merchandising initiative and a significant improvement in inventory levels leading to lower markdowns and shrinkage. We expect these results to be sustained over time.", "Now that the scheduling system has been in place for the past 12 months and we\u2019re optimizing it even more we\u2019re realizing significant productivity gains as measured by sales per labor hour. Associate wages grew at a rate lower than sales for the quarter. What is gratifying is that the new scheduling systems have had a very positive effect on customer service. We believe that we can generate additional productivity improvements throughout next year as we continue to match staffing to customer traffic across the store.", "Both our customers and our associates are telling us we\u2019re improving in the areas that matter to them. Our customer satisfaction scores have improved this quarter and are running well above last year\u2019s scores. Customers are telling us we\u2019re consistently improving in our goal to run faster checkouts and trendier and cleaner stores.", "Our associates are also telling us that they are feeling good about the company. Our latest survey showed a 6 percentage point increase in engagement scores among all Wal-Mart US associates from last year to this year. Our more than 30,000 management associates had an 80% engagement score this past year which is I believe truly best in class.", "Inventory increased by 3.4% at the end of the quarter which is right at our goal of growing inventory at half the rate of sales increase. Our emphasis on merchandise flow improvements and cleaner inventory continues to contribute to a better customer experience and improved financial performance. Very importantly customers have told us that they like uncluttered stores.", "Now that we have covered the numbers let\u2019s look at some of the successes we have had in our business units. As I mentioned earlier our comp remains well ahead of most retail competitors. Traffic was flat for the quarter and average ticket increased to drive the comp. Given that many customers are feeling a strain on their budgets and reducing some of their discretionary spending our traffic driving initiatives and value framing campaign were very important in driving performance. I believe this is the best approach for this holiday season.", "Price leads all of our marketing programs. We have a number of commercials that show customers how they can save on everyday needs. We will continue to remind customers that the savings add up when you shop at Wal-Mart. This message will continue to be very important during the holidays.", "As John Fleming shared with you at the analyst meeting we have defined seasonal as a win category. Performance of seasonal events this past quarter was driven by outstanding store presentation and by our integrated communication program. This was evident in our success for Halloween. Our business came late but it did come. The product presentation and marketing came together to drive double digit sales growth in Halloween related merchandise. Not surprisingly our candy sales were particularly strong and our fresh grocery and apparel Halloween offerings drove strong comps.", "We have talked in the past about entertainment properties which is one of our growth categories. In the third quarter we continued to execute against this program and we monetize traffic by leveraging and exclusive entertainment property, AC/DC, to drive sales in other areas. Our stores merchandise the band\u2019s newest CD in our young men\u2019s apparel area along with video gaming systems. The result was great sales for both the music and apparel areas.", "Apparel continues to work for us especially in basics. On a comp basis our apparel business outperformed the market in the last three reported sales periods by a significant margin. We started the quarter with strong back to school sales led by denim and casual apparel and that momentum continued through Halloween.", "When it comes to our entertainment business consumers are being more cautious on discretionary spending in electronics. We\u2019re seeing healthy sales growth on new and innovative products like gaming, flat panel TVs and GPS units. The sales results of our early holiday season special values last weekend exceeded our expectations. You will see a number of entertainment products featured in our black Friday event.", "No place is priced more important to customer than in grocery. Wal-Mart US continues to make inroads in price leadership and the gap is widening as reflected by comparing our prices to published reports from independent sources. As a result Wal-Mart outperformed all major national chains on comp when compared with their published reports.", "Consistent with previous quarters overall food inflation remains in the mid single digits. Inflation in general merchandise is less significant running in the low single digits for both apparel and home. We are seeing deflation in the mid single digits in entertainment.", "The price leadership position we have defined so clearly in health and wellness continues to drive favorable comps. Both prescription and over the counter had comp increases during the quarter. New products and initiatives to expand Wal-Mart\u2019s online presence through our 1-800-Contacts venture drove excellent performance in our optical business.", "We also announced a very innovative direct to payer model that will cut waste from existing multi-layer drug distribution supply chain system and continue to make healthcare more affordable for American families. Our Win/Play/Show merchandising strategy has significantly improve the clarity of our offering and we have continued to add assortments across every department. The improvements we have seen in our home and hard lines business units reflect how well the strategy is being executed.", "For example, in something as mundane as weather stripping where we streamlined our offering and changed our presentation sales were up 80%. This clearly exemplifies the opportunities that we enjoy as we continue to add assortments across the entire store.", "We opened 20 stores during the quarter bringing our year to date total to 102 new stores. The overall sales performance of our new stores including both new construction, relocations or extensions has improved on a year to date basis over the performance of new stores opened last year.", "Project impact, which we presented at the analyst and investor meeting, will help drive our business for the next three years. It is first and foremost about saving customers money so they can live better, but it is also about the way we go to market by driving our Win/Play/Show strategy and it is very much about how customers experience the Wal-Mart brand in stores that have faster checkouts, friendlier associates, and cleaner stores.", "I will now finish the Wal-Mart US discussion with some thoughts about the Christmas season. I believe that we have a truly outstanding plan for the holidays. In this difficult environment Wal-Mart\u2019s Save Money. Live Better value proposition resonates with our customers and is the cornerstone of everything we do. Last week we launched operation Main Street a seven week rollback campaign during the holidays to help consumers save an additional $200 million over and above the great everyday low prices that they currently find in our stores.", "The savings include thousands of products across every department in the store. Operation Main Street also includes initiatives that lend a helping hand to community organization. These are difficult times but these are Wal-Mart times. I feel optimistic about the fourth quarter.", "Thanks and let me turn it over to Mike.", "Mike Duke", "Before we move to quarterly results let me comment on the global economy. We are all well aware of the impacts of the current economic crisis including recent currency fluctuations. You heard Charles discuss the impact of recent significant changes in currency exchange rates. In our business we plan and hold management accountable for their results on a local currency basis without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. With the exception of our total segment results this discussion of Wal-Mart International excludes the impact of currency.", "Now on to our third quarter results, it was a good third quarter for Wal-Mart International business. Our unique combination of everyday low prices and talented country leadership combined with our three pronged strategy, portfolio optimization, global leverage, and plans to win in each market positions us to perform well in this tough global economy.", "International net sales for the third quarter were approximately $24.9 billion. That is an 11.2% increase over the prior year. The impact of currency valuation on third quarter sales was negligible as strengthening of the Mexican peso; Brazilian real and Japanese yen were offset by appreciation of the US dollar against the British pound and the Canadian dollar.", "Our strongest underlying sales performances in the quarter came from China and Brazil. Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico also continued to deliver healthy sales increases despite tough economic conditions. Segment operating income for the third quarter was approximately $1.2 billion up 10.6% as was the case in the second quarter. Gross profit for the segment was down slightly versus the third quarter last year largely for two reasons. First our stores in Japan are shifting more to the everyday low pricing strategy and second, an increased contribution of fuel in the UK.", "Operating expenses as a percent of segment sales were down from the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Contributing to this were the strong improvements in Brazil and Japan. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the US dollar in the third quarter caused operating income to grow slower than sales. The third quarter impact of currency valuation on operating income was a negative $18 million.", "Now let\u2019s move to the results of the larger countries. As is always the case we discuss the results of operations of our countries without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in order to discuss their underlying local currency performance. In the United Kingdom ASDA had another successful quarter growing twice as fast as the UK market according to TNS. Sales growth continues to be driven by both increased customer traffic and higher ticket, with customers attracted by strong pricing and improved service and product assortment.", "This performance is notable given the slower economic growth in the UK and the all time low level of consumer confidence. ASDA delivered another quarter of strong sales with comp growth excluding fuel of 6.9%. Total sales increased in the high single digits excluding fuel and in the low double digits including fuel. According to TNS market share rose by 60 basis points year over year to 12.4% in the 12 weeks ended October 5th.", "Food sales remain strong driven by a combination of volume growth and some inflation. The strongest sales were in meat, chilled foods, rice, pasta and wine. ASDA\u2019s price advantage over competitors is now at its strongest over the last 12 months. In general merchandise ASDA has outperformed all major general merchandise retailers over this period with the strongest results in baby, music, videos and games.", "ASDA\u2019s operating income was ahead of plan and grew just below the level of sales growth excluding fuel. Expenses were lower as a percentage of sales despite significantly upward pressure in energy costs as ASDA continued to drive an EDLC agenda. The ASDA growth strategy combines good comp growth with new space and new channel development. ASDA has opened 15 new stores so far this year including four ASDA Living stores. An additional six stores are planned to open during the remainder of calendar 2008.", "ASDA\u2019s price leadership position combined with the lowest cost to operate in the UK leaves it well positioned to enhance ROI.", "Now on to the America\u2019s, in Mexico consumer confidence is at an all time low. In this economic environment though our management team at Wal-Mex invests and works with a long term vision. Wal-Mex cash generation and strong balance sheet allows management to continue strong investment in price, open new stores, remodel existing stores and expand distribution capabilities.", "Wal-Mex third quarter sales increased 10.2% while comparable store sales increased 3.7% both in nominal terms. These were driven by customer traffic which increased 4.8% at comparable stores in the third quarter. We are encouraged by this result. Gross margin improved in the third quarter continuing the performance from the second quarter. The third quarter increase came despite a drop in sales in our higher margin formats suburbia and VIPS and investments made to strengthen our pricing position.", "Gross margin improvement was driven by strong inventory management which reduced markdowns and lowered shrink. I am particularly proud of Wal-Mex\u2019s inventory management. Inventory levels in the third quarter were lower than the corresponding period last year. Operating income grew only 3.2% this was due to pressure from utility expense and the catch up of remodels that outweighed the gross margin increase.", "Wal-Mex management is focused on three key initiatives to drive sales in a tough market. Wal-Mex is increasing its price differential to the competition. In fact, as Wal-Mex exited the third quarter its stores achieved the largest price advantage in five years. They are also focused on improving the quality and the price of perishables. As a result sales volume is growing in the double digits.", "Lastly, they are focused on seasonal merchandise. Although back to school was below expectations the management team applied lessons from that season to holiday programs that allowed Wal-Mex to leverage global sourcing for holiday merchandise.", "Now moving north to Canada, at Wal-Mart Canada third quarter net sales improved by 9.4% while comp sales grew slightly more than 3%. Overall growth continues to be driven by the Super Center expansion program. Electronics and food were key drivers of comparable stores sales growth. Seasonal categories including apparel and shoes continue to show growth in tough economic times. Operating income in Canada grew 9%. Gross margin was pressured downward due to a shift in the mix of sales toward food and consumables.", "Ongoing cost efficiencies in logistics and in the stores resulted in expenses growing slower than sales. During the third quarter Wal-Mart Canada opened its latest Super Center in Westbank, British Columbia and converted discount stores in Milton and Oakville to Super Centers. This brings the total number of Canadian Wal-Mart Super Centers to 39.", "Now to South America, in Brazil our operations generated a healthy 17% sales increased with third quarter real comparable store sales of 4.8%. Comparable store sales were driven by a strong 8.1% increase in customer count. We are particularly proud that Super Centers and Maxxi delivered real comparable sales in the mid teens.", "Expenses as a percent of sales in Brazil declined from the third quarter of fiscal 2008 despite a headwind from expenses related to 10 new stores opened during the quarter. Third quarter operating income in Brazil grew faster than sales.", "Leaving the America\u2019s and turning to Asia, as Seiyu in Japan the third quarter was challenging. Traffic at our Seiyu stores continued to increase as a result of our price investment activities. However, food sales were down 2% due to sales declines in beverages, tobacco and chilled foods. General merchandise and apparel sales were impacted negatively by the economic slowdown and by the planned elimination of the [Yu Tai] promotional program as we move to the everyday low price strategy.", "Similar to the market in Japan which are generally running negative comps, third quarter comparable store sales at Seiyu were down 3.1%. Seiyu's strategic price investment initiatives geared toward establishing price leadership are moving forward. To support the everyday low price strategy, Seiyu is accelerating everyday low cost initiatives. As a result, expenses as a percent of sales significantly improved over the third quarter of fiscal 2008.", "This improvement was driven by increased labor productivity, improved logistics efficiency, and cost reductions in our home office. Japan's third quarter operating loss was in line with the third quarter of last year. Seiyu's year to date operating loss is slightly better than fiscal 2008.", "Now lastly let's discuss China, sales at Wal-Mart China increased 26.1% in the third quarter. Comparable store sales grew 11.9% driven primarily by average ticket and a solid performance at our Sam's Clubs in China. During the quarter, we opened seven new stores. Wal-Mart China's third quarter contribution to operating income was flat to last year. Margin and expenses were relatively flat to the third quarter of last year.", "Also in China at our Trust-Mart business, third quarter total and comparable store sales increased approximately 8%, driven by increases in customer count and average ticket. Trust-Mart's contribution to operating income increased from the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and gross margin came in at a similar level to last year.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Doug for the report on Sam's Club.", "Doug McMillon", "Let's take a few minutes to cover Sam's Clubs third quarter performance. This was quite a quarter in many different respects. The hurricanes, mortgage and credit pressure, fuel prices, and product inflation all affected our members and influenced Sam's Clubs business. As I cover our quarterly financial results, I will include a discussion of some of those impacts. I will also talk about membership and the two new club formats we\u2019re testing.", "For the quarter, Sam's Club sales grew by 7.4% over last year\u2019s period to $11.6 billion. Comparable club sales excluding the volume and inflation effect of fuel increased by 4.5%. Including fuel sales, the comp Club sales number was 6.7%. Operating income increased to approximately $365 million up 1.7% compared to the prior year and a solid improvement from the second quarter. We did not meet the objective of growing Sam's Clubs operating profit faster than sales for the quarter despite having benefited from falling fuel prices on the gross profit line.", "Our total sales growth was accelerated by the impact of higher fuel prices and gallons. In addition to the hurricane costs, like Wal-Mart US, we made a couple of inventory liquidation decisions in the quarter that would normally feel pretty small except when you're working with the razor thin margins of the warehouse club business and the membership income results also did not contribute to achieving our goal of growing operating income faster than sales this quarter.", "Last quarter I talked about how higher fuel prices and our usually low margin fuel business helped drive top line sales increases but pressured margins. As we know, the fuel business can change quickly and it changed a lot during the third quarter. Sam's fuel sales once again increased significantly in the third quarter due to a combination of higher prices than a year ago and a strong increase in gallons pumped.", "However, over the course of the third quarter, the price per gallon decreased dramatically and during the last week of October, prices were actually below where they were at the same time last year. That was quite a change from August, the first month of the quarter, when prices were up about 35% versus the prior year.", "In the warehouse club business, we generally make most of our fuel profit when prices are falling and we benefit from volatility. Therefore at the end of the third quarter, our fuel gross profit rate was well above the prior year. This factor contributed to the 12 basis point increase in Sam's overall gross profit rate for the quarter. Recall that just the opposite occurred in the second quarter.", "Both traffic and ticket again without fuel were up in comparable clubs for the quarter as well as year to date. For the third quarter in a row this year, traffic and ticket were up for both Advantage members and Business members. Advantage member traffic growth exceeded Business increases in the quarter, while Business ticket increases were ahead of those for our Advantage members. Serving both types of members well is the key to our success and so I'm pleased to see the continued growth with both segments.", "Food and consumable categories dominated Sam's comp sales growth for the quarter. Highlights included strong sales in grocery, fresh, pets, and baby care. Our members are clearly making choices today on how they spend and those choices are clearly weighted toward everyday necessities and away from more discretionary purchases. This is manifesting itself in continuing softer general merchandise sales including in fine jewelry, electronics, and house wares.", "Apparel, however, was a bright spot for the quarter as members responded to new fall items and I believe that weather helped apparel as well. Overall for Sam's, the discretionary business has become even more of an item driven business. Our members still want SmartPhones, GPS units, and energy saving items like solar, LED motion detector lights. We've got to think and act an item at a time in this environment. I might also add that we are hoping to see flat panel TV sales pick up even a little more given our current prices.", "During the quarter, we continued to have inflation in a number of categories in consumables, grocery, and fresh. Although with commodity price pressure moderating, we are excited to see some recent cost decreases. Inventory levels for the second quarter were up about 4.8% versus the prior year due to new club openings and forward buying ahead of price increases, which allowed us to maintain lower prices for our members longer than otherwise we would have been able to. Our Halloween inventories sold through well, improving on last year's performance.", "Expenses as a percent of sales were up slightly when compared to last year with higher utility expenses and hurricane related costs creating a profit pressure for the quarter. Other income including membership decreased slightly from the prior year. As anticipated, third quarter membership income which is recorded on a deferred revenue recognition basis was down slightly from the prior year.", "We continue to focus on execution related to this area, including demonstrating the value of membership to current and prospective members through innovations like the recently launched Member Benefits Summary. These statements allow members to see their savings versus traditional retail in key spending categories. The new summary replaced the former renewal notice that more or less looked like just another bill to our members.", "We are pleased with the results of our October savings challenge, which allowed members and prospective members in our clubs to view their savings versus traditional retail while they were at the club. In conjunction with the event, we offered a 10 week trial membership for $10. While that amount is slightly more per week than our traditional one year membership, it gave many individuals a great reason to try Sam's Club. We\u2019ll be focused on converting those 10 week members into traditional one year members when the introductory periods end in January.", "During the quarter we opened two new test clubs. The first located in Houston is a business center. For this concept, we eliminated categories like pharmacy, jewelry and apparel and expanded our business focused assortment and a copy and print center. New hybrid trucks provide delivery service, which gives us the ability to reach a larger radius of small businesses beyond the typical club trade areas.", "In addition to the business center, we also opened a smaller club prototype in Garden City, Kansas. I am excited about the potential this smaller format has to operate successfully in places where a larger club might not make sense. I am encouraged by the early results in Garden City.", "To wrap up, let me give you a brief look ahead. As we enter the holiday season, we expect our members will continue to focus on value and will be selective in their discretionary purchases. So, we are stepping up our communication about the substantial value that our clubs offer members and we will be leveraging our strengths in areas like fresh food. I feel good about the items we are bringing to the clubs for the holidays. Members will find value in basics and they will find some exciting offerings in general merchandise and fresh food.", "The weekend before Thanksgiving, we will hold their annual holiday taste of Sam's Club. It's a fun event that our members look forward to where we can display and sample everything you need to prepare a great holiday meal. I believe our members, despite the economy will find a way to have a good Christmas with their family and friends and we are going to help make that possible.", "On the Friday after Thanksgiving, we will hold a members only event with special merchandise at incredible values selected just for our members. We had a strong increase on that day last year, so we are preparing to top it and it should be a very exciting shopping day.", "That's it for Sam's Club and now I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.", "Tom Schoewe", "Before we get to earnings guidance, let's review our quarterly report card on our five Wal-Mart financial metrics. We\u2019re in the positive column on two of the five. Recall that these metrics are all on a consolidated basis. We continue to do well on inventory and again succeeded in growing inventory at less than half of the rate of our sales growth.", "Once again, operating income grew faster than property, plant, and equipment or PP&E. As Lee and Charles indicated, we remain committed to improved capital efficiency. This strategy results in a full year CapEx estimate of a maximum of $13 billion for fiscal 2009.", "While we have achieved our goal of growing payables faster than inventories for the past four quarters, we did not meet this goal for the most recent quarter. In Q3 operating income did not grow at the same pace as sales. However, we feel that the underlying operations did in fact meet the goal of growing operating income faster than sales when you consider the $71 million pretax gain on real estate from the third quarter of last year.", "Another factor that influenced the earnings increase is that corporate expenses increased faster than sales. Charles noted earlier that corporate expenses were up approximately 17% from the third quarter of fiscal 2008 due primarily to the investments the company is making in transformational systems programs. These investments should ensure that our infrastructure supports our planned growth and business requirements.", "Let me move to free cash flow which we define as cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. The combination of these two factors, that's improved operations and capital efficiency, allowed us to report that the company ended the first nine months with free cash flow of approximately $2 billion. This is an amazing improvement over this time last year when we actually had a deficit of $1.3 billion.", "Furthermore, return on investment from continuing operations for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2008 is 19.3% that's up approximately 10 basis points due to stronger operating performance coupled with our tighter capital efficiency. I am so proud of our progress here. At the end of the second quarter, we reported that ROI had flattened. To report an improvement this quarter is a very big deal. We have reversed a trend.", "Now let's chat about our guidance. Given our momentum especially in our Wal-Mart US business, we are comfortable with a fourth quarter comp guidance of between 1% and 3%. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter to be between $1.03 and $1.07. It is likely that the recent rapid changes in currency exchange rates we've seen will be detrimental to the comparisons of this year's fourth quarter performance when compared to the prior year.", "Assuming rates remain where they are today; foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter by approximately $0.06. While we have tightened and modestly reduced our guidance, the major change is in estimated foreign exchange rates and assumes that the underlying operating performance remains solid. Therefore, we now expect our full year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 to fall within a range of $3.42 to $3.46 per share.", "Before I close, let me summarize the key take aways for this call. First, the Wal-Mart model works around the world and is working now more than ever in a difficult environment and economy. We are saving people money so they can live better. Second, our management teams are strong and aligned and face it; we are simply running a better business. Finally, we recognize that the economy around the world will continue to be challenging and some fluctuations in foreign exchange are expected but still unknown.", "That said we are optimistic about our sales and operating performance for the holidays and the fourth quarter and our overall performance relative to the industry.", "That's it and thanks again for your interest in Wal-Mart.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

These statements discuss among other things our anticipated earnings per share for the US current fiscal quarter, our anticipated tax rate for the fiscal year 2010, the factors that may impact that tax rate, our expected capital expenditures in fiscal 2010, the anticipated comparable store sales for each of our Wal-Mart US and Sam\u2019s Club segments for the 13 week period ending July 31, 2009, as well as our expectations that or as to we will always emphasize our price leadership and role as an advocate for our customers and members.", "Our customers will appreciate our American Summer Program to kick off in May 2009. Additional sales events will occur in the quarter ending July 31, 2009. We will continue to build our brand, reduce costs, sharpen our merchandising and remodel stores and clubs. We will continue to employ our global leverage for the benefit of our customers and members. We will broaden and accelerate our efforts on issues important to customers, members, and associates. We will continue to contribute constructively to the process on a range of issues.", "The improvements made in merchandising, marketing and operations are sustainable. We will gain market share. Our investment in future capacity in the merchandising, financing, and human resources systems will build global capabilities, leverage our scale and optimize our investments in our company. Healthcare costs and labor productivity within our Wal-Mart US segment will grow faster then sales for the remainder of fiscal 2010. Wal-Mart US will see ongoing financial benefits from investments in systems and proprietary technology solutions we have developed.", "There will be continued moderation in food inflation that will be a challenge for our Wal-Mart US segment in the fiscal quarter ending July 31, 2009. Wal-Mart US comparable store sales in that fiscal quarter will face a headwind of cycling last year\u2019s stimulus checks. The impact of the stimulus checks on Wal-Mart US comparable store sales in that fiscal quarter.", "Our International segment we\u2019ll use our global leverage and responsible sourcing, quality, and sustainability. Our International segment will continue to build global talent and identify new ways to take advantage of our organizational knowledge and purchasing volume. Improvement in results in China as the global economy settles down.", "The results of the efforts of new officer of our Sam\u2019s Club segment. Sam\u2019s Club will be a member driven business driving member trust and loyalty through outstanding quality at an outstanding value. Continued pressure on discretionary items offered for sale at Sam\u2019s Clubs. Certain merchandise categories at our Sam\u2019s Clubs that were highly inflationary last year will experience a declining rate of inflation or even deflation over the next several fiscal quarters.", "Sam\u2019s Club will stay focused on driving efficiencies and controlling expenses and maximizing top line sales potential. Sam\u2019s Club will continue to be focused on where members are today and meeting their needs. We may have future upside opportunity in growing inventory less then half the rate of sales growth and improvement in operations and assortments will continue to help us provide value to customers and members, and the anticipation and expectations of Wal-Mart and its management as to future occurrences and trends.", "These forward looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors domestically and internationally including general economic conditions, including the current economic crisis and disruption in the financial markets, unemployment levels, consumer credit availability, levels of consumer disposable income, consumer spending patterns and debt level, inflation, the cost of goods we sell, labor costs, transportation costs, the cost of diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and electricity, the cost of healthcare benefit, accident costs, our casualty and other insurance costs, information security costs, the cost of construction materials, availability of acceptable building sites for new stores, clubs and other formats, competitive pressures, accident related costs, weather patterns, catastrophic events, storm and other damages to our stores and distribution centers, weather related closing of stores, availability and transport of goods from domestic and foreign suppliers, currency exchange fluctuations and volatility, trade restrictions, changes in tariff and freight rates, adoption of or changes in tax and other laws and regulations that affect our business, cost of compliance with laws and regulations, the outcome of legal proceedings to which we are a party, interest rate fluctuations, changes in employment legislation, and other capital market, economic, and geopolitical conditions and events including civil unrest and terrorist attacks.", "We discuss certain of these matters more fully in our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and the information on this call should be read in conjunction with that annual report on Form 10-K and together with all our other filings including current reports on Form 8-K we have made with the SEC through the date of this call.", "We urge you to consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating the forward looking statements we make in this call.

First Quarter Earnings Call for Fiscal Year 2010. This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thanks for joining us today. The replay of this call and related materials about the quarter are available on our website.", "Here\u2019s the lineup for today\u2019s call. Mike Duke, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. President and CEO will begin the call with comments on the company\u2019s overall performance. Charley Holley, Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer will cover the consolidated financial details for the quarter. Eduardo Castro-Wright, Vice Chairman Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will discuss the results for Wal-Mart US.", "Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International will cover our operations outside the United States with details on our countries with the largest revenues. Brian Cornell, new to our company as President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, will discuss that operating segment and Tom Schoewe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will close with a report card on our financial metrics as well as guidance for the second quarter.", "Before Mike kicks it off we want to share details about changes to our reporting practices. As announced last week, we will no longer report sales results on a monthly basis. Our company will now provide comp store sales guidance and results on a 13 week basis in our quarterly earnings releases like we\u2019re doing today. Instead of total US comp guidance, Wal-Mart US and Sam\u2019s Club each will provide separate guidance for the 13 week period. You will hear more about this from Eduardo and Brian.", "We will continue to provide comp store sales results on a fiscal calendar basis in our Form 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC. Our investor communications policy which is posted on our website has been updated to reflect these changes.", "During today\u2019s discussion please keep in mind that our first quarter last fiscal year, what we call, FY2009 included the benefit of one extra day, February 29th due to a leap year. This year\u2019s first quarter has 91 days versus 92 days last year so in essence one less selling day. Effective February 1, 2009, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard Number 160 \u201cNon-Controlling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d", "This standard requires some accounting changes and minor modifications to financial statement presentation for minority interests and subsidiaries. These changes are reflected in our first quarter financial statements we\u2019re releasing today.", "As a result during this call all references to income from continuing operations or earnings per share from continuing operations refer to income from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart or diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart respectively. Also, diluted net income per share from continuing operations refers to diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart.", "As a reminder, we consolidate and report our International business as follows. Canada and Puerto Rico report on the same calendar as our US operations which means that our first quarter runs from February 1st through April 30th. All other markets in Wal-Mart International report on the regular calendar basis meaning the first quarter news we are reporting today represents results from January 1st through March 31. Note that sales and other financial metrics are pegged to local currencies when referring to the specific international markets.", "Store counts, square footage updates and information on our financial metrics are available on our website www.WalMartStores.com/Investors under the reconciliation and financial measures. A full transcript of this call is posted approximately an hour after our call starts. Thanks for listening to our news about Wal-Mart\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2010.", "Mike Duke ", "We\u2019re pleased to report that fiscal year 2010 is off to a very good start. Even though this is the most challenging economy we\u2019ve faced in decades, certainly we feel good about the business. Wal-Mart continues to outperform the market. We\u2019re strengthening customer loyalty and attracting and retaining millions of customers. Our company is stronger then ever because we deliver price leadership and value and help our customers save money so they can live better.", "Our success this quarter is due to the dedication and contributions of our over two million hard working associates around the world. We appreciate each and every one of them. I\u2019m also proud of the depth and talent of our leadership team. They continue to make Wal-Mart a better company. We\u2019re also broadening and accelerating our efforts to drive positive change on issues that matter to customers and associates.", "First let\u2019s look at some of the key numbers. Diluted earnings per share were $0.77 at the top end of the range of guidance we provided. Total first quarter net sales were more than $93 billion which is down slightly from last year. However, this includes a negative impact from the valuation of many currencies against the US dollar. Without that impact net sales were over $98 billion.", "Last week we reported a total US comp for Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s Club without fuel of 3.7% for the first 13 weeks period of this year. I\u2019m pleased that this comp surpassed our own expectations. Wal-Mart continues to be in great financial position. We have a strong balance sheet and great access to capital markets. Charles will get into the details but I\u2019m also pleased with our free cash flow performance which continues to fund returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "In March we announced a 15% increase to our dividend at a time when many other companies were reducing their dividends. Like other companies we are dealing with very complex economic circumstances. We all hear the news about interest rates, currency exchange and unemployment and uncertainty about how long the recession might last. Our business overall is stable but our customers are still concerned about economic issues. For the Wal-Mart customers, until unemployment eases and confidence really returns we remain cautiously optimistic about the timetable for economic recovery.", "The stability in our business comes from the clear path Sam Walton established with our EDLP philosophy. It\u2019s more important than ever. We have unique insight into how our customers and members are weathering the economy. We know better than ever how to meet their needs and this is a tremendous competitive advantage. Consumers are turning to us in greater numbers. They know Wal-Mart is their advocate and that we can save them money so they can live better.", "They believe in our brand. Consumers are changing their thinking and their behavior. It\u2019s a virtue to be thrifty and they\u2019re proud to save money by shopping at Wal-Mart. Our regular customers are shopping us more often and for more items. We\u2019re attracting more new customers. We\u2019re running better stores and clubs.", "The business plans we have in place now are relevant for today and for the future when the economy recovers. We will always emphasize our price leadership and our role as advocates for customers and members. That\u2019s the core of our competitive advantage. With all this in mind let me cover some reasons why we\u2019re reporting such good results today.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright has said that the underlying business at Wal-Mart US remains strong. Wal-Mart delivered a 5.9% comp for the four weeks in April and a 3.6% comp for the first 13 weeks of the year. This is the strongest comp among major retailers and clearly exceeds expectations. The strength of these results comes from the truly integrated initiatives within Wal-Mart US.", "Never before have merchandising, operations and marketing been so aligned. Our associate engagement scores and productivity are up, inventory and prices are down. We have many new brands. Customers are delighted when they shop our stores.", "Like other retailers, Wal-Mart is cycling the stimulus checks which resulted in the higher sales comps in the second quarter last year, but, I\u2019m confident with the plans the team put together. Customers will appreciate the American Summer Program that kicks off this month and there will be additional events, such as back-to-school, this quarter.", "Doug McMillon has hit the ground running with a smooth and speedy transition as the head of Wal-Mart International. Frankly, I\u2019m glad to be sleeping in my own bed a little more now. I\u2019m pleased that in almost every country, we grew the top line faster than the market despite the strong dollar and a recession that is even deeper in some countries than it is in the United States.", "ASDA had a standout quarter, leading on price and gaining market share. I can\u2019t tell you how proud I am of our ASDA colleagues. In Mexico, the economy is a real challenge, but Wal-Mex continues to outperform its competition. In fact, in just about every market where we operate we\u2019re outperforming our competition. We\u2019ve assembled a great team at Sam\u2019s Club, and we\u2019re happy to have Brian Cornell as our new CEO of that business. The team there is renewing its focus on building and communicating the value of membership, and further improving product quality and freshness.", "We\u2019re investing capital prudently for efficient growth and world class information systems. Across the company we will continue to build our brand, reduce costs, sharpen our merchandising and remodel our stores and clubs, and we\u2019ll continue to employ our global leverage for the benefit of our customers and members. I\u2019ve also indicated that we will broaden and accelerate our efforts on issues that are important to our customers, members and associates.", "In my first quarter as CEO, I\u2019ve made a few trips to Washington, D.C. I\u2019ve had collaborative meetings with the administration and lawmakers on a range of issues including the economy, health care and sustainability. People see that we are contributing constructively to the process and that we will continue to do so.", "Just one more thing before I turn it over to Charles. Many of you\u2019ve asked if the success we\u2019ve had recently is just a result of the economic downturn and will it last once the economy recovers. As I said earlier, customers have changed their behavior and their mindset. They\u2019re proud to tell people that they shop at Wal-Mart. We believe the improvements we\u2019ve made in merchandising, marketing and operations in the US and around the world are sustainable. This is not a short term phenomenon.", "Customers will always be interested in saving money, and they will always appreciate the value of getting better value. Our brand stands for better value, no matter the country or the language. We have enduring brand strength because the trust we\u2019ve earned from our customers has never been stronger. As a result, we believe we\u2019ll continue to gain market share. We are optimistic about the long term, and realistic about the short term. Certainly, I feel good about what I\u2019m seeing at our retail operations all around the world.", "Now, I\u2019d ask Charles to provide you with a detailed review of our results.", "Charles Holley ", "Before I get into the details, let me remind everyone of a few things that affect our consolidated results. The D&S results are now included in our consolidated reporting. Carol mentioned the impact of the comparison to last year being a leap year, so we have one less day this fiscal year. You\u2019ll hear more about this from the operating segments. The Easter calendar shift also impacted the first quarter results within the International segment. Mike mentioned the impact of currency exchange rates and I\u2019ll talk more about this shortly.", "Fiscal year 2010 is off to a good start. Total net sales for the company decreased slightly, by 0.6% to $93.5 billion. However, without the $4.8 billion effect of currency exchange rates, net sales would have increased by 4.5% to approximately $98.3 billion. The total US comp, without fuel, reported on a 13 week basis was 3.7%.", "Operating income was down $100 million or approximately 1.9% with income from continuing operations before income taxes down 1.5%. Currency exchange translation had a negative impact of approximately $252 million to operating income. Also, there was one less day for the quarter versus last year due to the leap year.", "Income from continuing operations for the first quarter was flat with last fiscal year at approximately $3 billion. Diluted net income per share from continuing operations was $0.77. This is at the high end of the guidance range we provided you for the first quarter of the fiscal year. As a reminder, this included the negative impact from the currency translation of approximately $0.04 per share.", "Consolidated gross profit for the first quarter was up 59 basis points compared with the prior year, due primarily to improvements by Wal-Mart US and Sam\u2019s Club. In addition to better mix, Wal-Mart US continues to deliver strong inventory management and you\u2019ll hear more details on this from Eduardo.", "Speaking of inventory, on a consolidated basis, this was another excellent story, primarily due to the Wal-Mart US segment. Our consolidated inventory was down 3.2% when compared to the same period last year, and that\u2019s against a sales decrease of 0.6%. Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company was 83% at the end of the first quarter, which is up 1.3 percentage points from last year.", "As we mentioned with our February sales release, in connection with our finance transformation project, the company adjusted its classification of certain revenue and expense items for financial reporting purposes beginning February 1, 2009. These changes do not affect operating income or net income. Further, any changes in the classification of any revenue or expense items in our financial statements have been reflected in all prior periods presented.", "These changes primarily consisted of reclassifying certain other income items such as financial services income, from other income to net sales, and reporting discount fees paid on a customer\u2019s use of a consumer credit card as operating expenses. Previously, these credit card discount fees were netted against sales. With these changes, we have improved the consistency of our reporting with others in the industry.", "Going forward, membership and other income primarily includes membership revenue, tenant lease income and some other miscellaneous income categories. Where we have one time items, such as the gain from the sale of real estate properties, they will be included in other income as well. Membership and other income decreased 14% compared to the same period last year. Membership income was down slightly year over year, as were several other miscellaneous income categories.", "Let\u2019s move on to review expenses. Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up 53 basis points over this period last year. Contributing to this increase were higher group health care costs across the US businesses. The corporate segment, which we commonly refer to as corporate expenses, was up almost 17% primarily due to increased spending on transformation projects and other technology enhanced initiatives.", "During the fourth quarter call, we explained that the investments we are making for future capacity in the merchandising, finance, and human resources systems would continue to be up versus last year for all of this fiscal year. We are committed to these programs as they will build global capabilities, leverage our scale, and optimize our investments for the company. Transformation costs this quarter were up significantly, approximately 150% over the same period last year.", "Without investments in transformation projects, expenses for the corporate segment were up 9.3% almost entirely driven by expenses in our technology area, as we continue to drive technology enhanced initiatives. Non-technology home office expenses this quarter were flat to the same quarter last year.", "Net interest expense was down 5.8% versus the comparable quarter last year. Despite additional debt related to the acquisition of D&S in Chile, our total debt balances were down versus last year and contributed to lower interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.7%. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2010 to be between 34% and 35%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may impact our rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax matters and the mix of earnings among our US and International operations.", "During these challenging economic times, our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have good access to the credit markets. Our debt to total capitalization was 41.0% below the 43.2% we reported at the same time last year. It\u2019s important to note that according to Financial Accounting Standards Number 160, minority interest, now referred to as non-controlling interest, in our subsidiaries is now reported in the equity section of the company\u2019s balance sheet.", "Our methodology and management of debt to total capitalization has not changed. We continue to define total capitalization as debt, plus total shareholder\u2019s equity, which does not include the non-controlling interest.", "Mike highlighted one of our ongoing success stories earlier, continuing strong free cash flow generation. We are pleased to report that in the first quarter we generated free cash flow of $964 million. Now on face value, this is lower than the $1.3 billion we had at this time last year. However, when you consider the timing of payments of our US associate payroll on the last day of the quarter, and with one less day of operations versus leap year last year, our free cash flow is trending at or actually a little more than last year. This total also includes an increase in capital spending for the first quarter versus last year.", "Let\u2019s review how we\u2019re using the cash we generated. During this year\u2019s first quarter, our capital expenditures were in line with our plans. We continue to expect our CapEx for the full year to be between $12.5 and $13.5 billion. Second, as we mentioned in the fourth quarter earnings call in February, we decided it was time to restart our share repurchase program.", "I am pleased to report we committed more than $960 million to repurchase approximately 19.2 million shares during the first quarter. We have slightly more than $4 billion remaining from the $15 billion share repurchase plan authorized by the board in May of 2007. Third, during the quarter, we paid a little more than $1 billion in dividends, which reflects the 15% dividend increase our board approved in March.", "As Mike noted, we are proud of our financial position and the attention of our operating and corporate teams to strong financial management.", "Now let\u2019s move to the discussion of our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Wal-Mart US.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright ", "With the first quarter now behind us I\u2019m happy to report that Wal-Mart US is building on the momentum of last year\u2019s solid performance. We exceeded our expectations for top line growth. In spite of the leap year comparison, total net sales increased 3.8% to $61.2 billion. We feel very good about the way Wal-Mart is positioned today in the US marketplace. Consumers trust our brand and our save money, live better promise is more relevant today than ever before.", "Comparable store sales for the 13 week period of February through April grew 3.6% ahead of market expectations. There were three main drivers of our comp performance. First, traffic to our comp stores accelerated to levels we have not seen in several years. Clearly, declining gas prices compared to last year have had a role in driving traffic to our stores. But more important is the growing consumer need for value today.", "We find a large part of our growth is coming from new customers. In February, approximately 17% of our measurable growth in traffic came from new customers. Their average basket size is 40% higher than our average. We are committed to retaining these new customers through our new assortments and the way they experience the brand in our stores.", "Second, our focus on winning key seasonal events contributed to both increased transactions and conversion. For example, comp sales of Easter related merchandise grew 7.6% during the season and drove part of our 5.9% comp sales increase during the April four week period. Seasonal events will continue to be an important part of our growth strategy.", "Last, we believe each of our merchandising units is outperforming their respective competitors. The investments we have made in merchandising systems are starting to pay off. These enhancements, combined with our price leadership and the implementation of our win, play, show strategy are driving clarity of offering, leading to sustainable growth across multiple categories.", "Wal-Mart.com is also contributing to our growth and our Site to Store platform enables our customers to have seamless access to our brand through different channels. Our cumulative customer base to Site to Store has grown more than nine times over the last 12 months. I\u2019m happy to report our online business is growing faster than the leading competitor based on that competitor\u2019s latest quarterly release.", "Solid Wal-Mart US sales performance was complemented by a 52 basis point improvement in gross margin. The increase in gross margin was driven largely by a higher margin product mix, the result of improved sales performance in our more discretionary categories. Also benefiting gross margin was our ongoing progress in reducing inventory by flowing the right merchandise to the right stores at the right time.", "Inventory was reduced by 4.3% or slightly more than $1 billion on sales growth of 3.8%. The benefit of lower inventories touches many aspects of our operations including fewer markdowns, less shrink, lower store labor and logistics costs, and fewer accidents. Lower inventories also improve our customer\u2019s shopping experience and provide a better working environment for our associates because of cleaner stores.", "Operating income for the quarter was $4.5 billion and increased 3.3% over the first quarter last year. As a percent to sales, operating income was relatively flat with the same quarter last year, reflecting unplanned expenses, which I will cover shortly. Operating expenses increased 5.8% or 37 basis points as a percentage of sales year over year, due primarily to higher group health insurance expenses.", "Improvements to our health benefit plans resulted in different health care purchasing and usage habits by our associates. Partly because of our better health care programs, we have seen lower turnover which has led to increased store labor productivity. We expect health care costs, as well as labor productivity, to grow faster then sales for the remainder of the year.", "We continue to find ways to leverage our growth in the current economic environment and manage expenses effectively. Let me highlight one such example; advertising. Media costs have come down rapidly during the last year because of the more difficult economic environment. As a result, our marketing team reduced advertising costs by more than 20% through efficient media buying and by a precise focus on our message.", "The result is greater efficiency in delivering our message and increased exposure of our brand and our save money, live better value proposition. Our share of voice increased 67% in the first quarter compared to last year.", "Lower gas prices and lower inventories have led to lower logistics costs, and we have passed these savings along to customers through lower prices. Excluding the benefit of declining fuel costs, our cost per case shipped was reduced by 5.5%. We continue to sweat the assets of our distribution network to drive improvements in return on investment. In fact, we have not built a distribution center in more than two years and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.", "We continue to make improvements with respect to associate productivity. Wages grew only 2.9% for the quarter, compared to last year, well below the rate of sales growth. You\u2019ve been hearing about our investments in systems and this is where we\u2019re getting a payout now. We continue to roll out our staffing initiatives to additional areas of the store supported by our proprietary technology solutions developed over the last couple of years. We expect to see ongoing financial benefits from these initiatives into the future.", "In addition to this scheduling system, other customer oriented initiatives are improving overall customer experience in our stores. This was the sixth consecutive quarter our overall customer experience scores posted quarter over quarter improvements. Each of our fast, friendly, and clean scores improved compared to the previous quarter.", "Another metric we track monthly is our customer\u2019s perception about the value that Wal-Mart provides. Our price value score with a half million plus customers surveyed each month was the highest in April since we started these surveys. We find that each of these customer experience metrics correlates to future sales performance, so I\u2019m excited by the high marks our customers continue to give us.", "From our early read of the project impacts remodels and new stores, we are pleased with what we see. Sales are exceeding our expectations and outperforming the respective control groups. Customer experience scores in the converted stores are growing at twice the rate of those at control stores, and inventory improvements are five to six times higher in project impact stores.", "As part of our capital efficiency model, investment decisions are based on driving sales productivity and return on investment. That is why we continue to prioritize the allocation of capital for expansions, remodels, and other high return projects.", "Our save money, live better strategic framework continues to galvanize the organization by singularly defining what it is that we stand for, how we go to market, and our expectations for how our customers experience the brand. Indeed, our associates are aligned around our business framework now more than ever. We recently received the annual results of our field associate engagement surveys. Let me share with you some of these exciting results.", "Our field associate engagement scores for the current year improved to 69%, a 700 basis point improvement from last year\u2019s survey. In just two years alone our field engagement scores have improved by 28% which is just remarkable and speaks largely to the character and talent of the leadership we have in place in the field. Most importantly, I want to thank all associates who remain focused on providing a fast, friendly, and clean shopping experience for our customers each day.", "So, what should you expect moving forward? Short term, we are focused on the challenges in the second quarter. One such challenge will be continued moderations to the rate of food inflation. While we believe our grocery business continues to outperform leading competitors and is benefiting from increased distribution of government assistance programs, grocery comp sales are being modestly impacted by a slowdown in inflation.", "As consumers have more disposable income as a result of moderating food inflation, we have seen that customers are spending these savings in Wal-Mart on more discretionary categories. In addition to inflation, comp sales in the second quarter will also face the headwind of cycling last year\u2019s stimulus checks, which contributed to our higher sales comp for that quarter. We estimate the impact to this year\u2019s second quarter comp sales to be between 100 and 200 basis points.", "Despite these second quarter difficult comparisons we expect comp sales for the 13 week period ending July 31st to be between flat and 3%. Customer experience is at the center of everything our leadership team is focused on. We are making every effort to ensure that customers continue to believe that when the economy recovers, Wal-Mart continues to be the best alternative for them to shop across multiple categories.", "Longer term, our team is focused on three key areas:", "The rollout of the project impact program, which provides the framework and alignment for delivering better customer experience.", "Development of a more efficient store.", "Multi-channel integration which will allow our customers to shop their trusted Wal-Mart brand across a variety of channels.", "You will hear more about these strategies later in the year.", "Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Doug who will discuss our results in International.", "Doug McMillon ", "What a great time to be leading Wal-Mart International. In my first quarter as President and CEO, I\u2019ve visited almost every market where we operate and I\u2019ve been pleased to see our team\u2019s commitment to our customers, especially in these trying economic times. I want to take this opportunity to thank our country teams and our management for their focus and dedication.", "My most recent trip was to Shenzhen, China where we held our annual President\u2019s roundtable, an assembly of the Regional CEOs and country Presidents. During that roundtable, we had the opportunity to discuss both the short and long term aspects of our business. The consensus of our President\u2019s is that this global economy is pressuring our customers no matter where they are.", "Given this environment, it\u2019s clear that our immediate focus is to concentrate on three key areas:", "Increase productivity across the business to help us deliver on price.", "Create value for our customers.", "Communicate this value effectively.", "In times like these our EDLP message resonates even more with customers around the world. We are focused on these three areas so that we can, now more than ever, save our customers money so they can live better. We will use our global leverage in areas of responsible sourcing, quality and sustainability. We will continue to build our global talent and identify new ways to take advantage of our organizational knowledge and our purchasing volume.", "I would like to mention our recent acquisition in Chile. D&S has been part of Wal-Mart for one full quarter now. I am pleased that we took our ownership to almost 75% in the first quarter. Integration of D&S is coming along well, including alignment of merchandising and suppliers. I\u2019m also encouraged by the engagement of the newest additions to the Wal-Mart family, the associates at D&S.", "Before I move on to our first quarter results, let me first mention the currency impact and the effect of the calendar on our business. Currency fluctuations continued to impact reported results significantly during the first quarter. You heard Charles discuss this. As has been the case, we plan and hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. With the exception of our total segment results, this discussion of Wal-Mart International excludes the impact of currency.", "Because all but Canada and Puerto Rico report on a calendar year basis, the majority of the International countries results do not include April. This is consistent with previous reporting. I\u2019m highlighting this because of the Easter calendar shift this year. Easter was in the first quarter last year, but in the second quarter this year for those markets on calendar year reporting. Additionally, as noted, we had one extra day with a leap year in 2008.", "Let\u2019s get to the first quarter results. International net sales for the first quarter were approximately $21.3 billion. This includes the negative $4.8 billion impact of currency valuation, which led to an 11.1% decline in the first quarter US dollar sales. On a constant currency basis, before the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, sales were up 9.1% over the first quarter of fiscal 2009 which was very similar to what we reported in our last quarter. Our strongest underlying first quarter sales performances came from the UK, Brazil, and Mexico. Store growth in China contributed to a good total sales increase there as well.", "Segment operating income for the first quarter was approximately $880 million, down 16.2% from the comparative period last year. On a constant currency basis before the $252 million negative impact of currency valuation, operating income was up 7.8% from the first quarter of fiscal 2009.", "Operating income growing slower than sales was largely driven by a decline in gross margin, expenses from the closure of Sam\u2019s Clubs in Canada and the dilutive impact of the D&S acquisition, partially offset by the underlying expense improvements in the UK, Japan, and China. Excluding the impact of currency, membership and other income as a percentage of sales was virtually flat compared to last year.", "Gross margin for our segment was down versus the first quarter last year, largely due to the closure of the six Sam\u2019s Clubs in Canada, mix shifts towards food and consumables across many of the markets, and pricing actions taken in several markets, particularly in Japan and Brazil. We recognize that the inventory story for Wal-Mart International is not as strong a story as the other operating segments. We are committed to making improvements in this area. We plan to leverage some of the initiatives from the United States to improve inventory productivity within all of our markets.", "Now let\u2019s get into the results for several of our markets. In the United Kingdom, ASDA\u2019s strong performance in fiscal 2009 continued through the first quarter of this year. According to TNS, ASDA increased its market share by 30 basis points and grew at twice the rate of the market in the 12 weeks ending April 19th.", "Underlying comparable store sales growth was 8.4% excluding fuel, the timing of Easter, and the impact of leap day in fiscal 2009. Unadjusted comp growth was 6.4%. Sales growth continues to be driven by increased customer traffic and higher ticket. Our value conscious customers are attracted by ASDA\u2019s strong pricing and product assortment. Data from TNS suggests ASDA is winning new customers from all main competitors.", "The strongest performance was seen in food, where ASDA\u2019s commitment to save customers money every day has never been more important. Core basket drivers relating to items customers use to cook at home delivered the highest levels of growth in the quarter.", "In apparel, George continues to demonstrate broad customer appeal. In fact, according to TNS World Panel, George apparel gained 40 basis points of market share, with children\u2019s wear performing particularly well. As another testament to our product offering, all of the sales growth can be attributed to increased sales of full priced merchandise as spring and summer apparel sold well. In general merchandise, ASDA performed better than the market. The strongest growth came in homewares, pet care, kitchen, cleaning and baby products, all driven by effective in store activity.", "In the first quarter, ASDA\u2019s operating income grew ahead of sales, with strong control of expenses achieved through a fundamental commitment to EDLC through the ASDA; we operate for less, cost reduction program. Gross margin was in line with the first quarter of last year.", "While the outlook for both the UK economy and retail market remains very challenging, ASDA\u2019s management team believes that a positive pricing agenda backed by their extensive, we operate for less cost reduction program leaves the company very well positioned to continue to gain market share and grow ROI throughout this fiscal year.", "In Mexico, disposable income and customer confidence have been significantly dampened by the current economy. Customers appreciate low prices and Wal-Mex is delivering them more than ever. This drove an increase in traffic and ticket for the first quarter. First quarter total sales growth at Wal-Mex was 7.8%.", "Despite the impact of leap year in fiscal 2009 and the Easter calendar shift, comparable stores sales growth for the quarter was 1% and 1.9% for self service formats. In terms of comparable weeks, Wal-Mex same store sales grew 3.3% even though Easter was in the second quarter this year versus the first quarter last year.", "The focus on prices at Wal-Mex is also reflected in growth compared to the market. In each of the last two months of the period, Wal-Mex outperformed the industry, excluding Wal-Mex, on comparable store sales by more than 200 basis points as reported by the retail industry group ANTAD. If only self service formats are considered, the out performance was more than 300 basis points both months.", "This was another quarter with improvement in gross margin, despite investment in prices and the continued mix shift away from more discretionary formats like Suburbia and Vips. Additional pressure on margin came from sales mix within self service, as customers are decreasing spending on non food areas. The margin improvement was driven by efficiencies with suppliers, inventory management, and distribution. Operating income for Wal-Mex grew slower than sales due to expenses for Banco Wal-Mart.", "Before we move on, let me discuss the April outbreak of the H1N1 virus. As we mentioned in the sales call last week, we have seen it have the biggest impact in Mexico because it\u2019s the epicenter of the outbreak. This is really a second quarter event, because Wal-Mex reports on a calendar year. The sales release detailed steps Wal-Mex took including working with government health authorities to ensure the health and safety of associates and customers at all stores. Our thoughts are with the people of Mexico and the other areas impacted by this outbreak.", "Moving North to Canada, Wal-Mart Canada\u2019s total sales growth was 4.7% for the first quarter, driven by the super center expansion program, offset by the impact of last year\u2019s leap day and the closure of the six Sam\u2019s Clubs. Excluding the negative one percentage point impact of last year\u2019s leap day, comparable store sales for super centers and discount stores were essentially flat. Customer traffic was lower, but offset by increased average ticket.", "Food and consumables drove much of the sales growth in Canada, combined with a strong Easter season. These were partially offset by a continued shift in spending away from discretionary categories. On a regional level, Eastern Canada is performing well, while the West is showing signs of recovery. Ontario continues to be a challenging market where the major industries are manufacturing and automobile related.", "Operating income declined mainly due to the closure costs for the Sam\u2019s Clubs. Gross margin experienced pressure due to the weaker Canadian dollar impacting the cost of imported merchandise, as well as the shift of consumer spending toward food and consumables. Ongoing cost efficiencies in logistics and store operations resulted in expenses growing slower than sales.", "In Brazil, first quarter sales growth was 12.6% in nominal terms, with highlights again in the soft discount and cash and carry formats, both of which delivered double digit sales growth. Sales growth was also driven by the net increase of 31 stores since the end of the first quarter last year. Comparable store sales were slightly negative in real terms, negatively impacted by the Easter shift.", "As we continue to invest in new stores in Brazil, expenses are increasing as a percentage of sales compared to last year due to the inclusion of the new stores. This led to an operating income decrease when compared to last year.", "Now to Asia, in Japan, customer traffic at Seiyu continued to increase. Overall sales growth was positive in the quarter, even considering the negative impact of one less calendar day than last year. Food sales were up, driven by the expansion of EDLP items and more effective customer communication of our lower prices. General merchandise and apparel sales were down, both impacted by the softening economy.", "We did see bright spots at Seiyu in general merchandise categories where price leadership has been established. As a result, comparable store sales were up by 0.7%. We were pleased with this result; considering we had one less day in the quarter and the overall retail market generally experienced declining comp sales during the quarter.", "Gross margins were down due to the continued shift to EDLP. Every day low cost initiatives to support this price investment are being accelerated. Expenses were below last year in Yen and as a percentage of sales. Seiyu is driving improvements in store labor productivity, logistics efficiency, and home office costs. Even with this reduction in expenses, Seiyu did not fully offset the margin shortfall and the first quarter operating income was down slightly compared to last year.", "In China, comparable store sales were down 1.8% in the Wal-Mart China business and down 5.8% at Trust-Mart, average ticket was down in both businesses. This was mainly due to deflation in food and consumables, and declining customer confidence in the overall market. Customer count decreased in both businesses.", "During the calendar quarter, Wal-Mart opened 20 new stores and Trust-Mart opened one, bringing total store count to 246 during the period. Gross margin was essentially flat across the total business in China and we continue to see strong cost control at both businesses. Operating income was up at Wal-Mart China but down at Trust-Mart. We believe that as the global economy settles down, we will see improvement in our results in China.", "Overall at Wal-Mart International we remain committed to ensuring that we deliver price and value for our customers. They continue to trust our various brands because of our tradition and commitment to EDLC and EDLP.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for the update on Sam\u2019s Club.", "Brian Cornell ", "I\u2019ve been here for a month now and I\u2019m very excited to be leading the Sam\u2019s Club business. The warehouse club channel is a great channel to be in and we will continue to build on our strengths. During the past month, I\u2019ve spent time in the clubs talking with our associates and I\u2019m eager to work with the Sam\u2019s team. I\u2019m also excited to introduce some new members of the senior management team.", "In March, Ignacio P\u00e9rez, or Nacho as he is called, joined the team as Sam\u2019s Club EVP of Operations. Nacho is the former president and CEO of Wal-Mart Central America. Nacho has worked for Wal-Mart for the past 21 years and is a seasoned executive and operator. He has held senior leadership roles in Wal-Mart Mexico, Argentina and Puerto Rico and he was also responsible for the start up of the highly successful Sam\u2019s Club business in Mexico. His passion for associates, coupled with high performance expectations, has created strong results wherever he has served.", "You already know Linda Hefner as the EVP and general manager of the home business at Wal-Mart US. Starting on May 15th, Linda will lead merchandising for Sam\u2019s as EVP of Merchandising. I\u2019m very excited to have Linda on the team. She has made significant changes and improvements to the Wal-Mart home business, as seen whenever you walk into one of our Wal-Mart stores today. Under her leadership, the home team redefined the merchandising assortment by focusing on brands, quality, and by enhancing the in store presentation.", "Prior to joining Wal-Mart, Linda was executive vice president of global strategy and business development at Kraft Foods. She has also held senior roles in Sara Lee\u2019s apparel division. Linda\u2019s experience and success in a wide variety of merchandise categories will help us take Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s focus on quality and value to the next level.", "Moving forward, Sam\u2019s will continue to be a member driven business, promoting member trust and loyalty through outstanding quality at an outstanding value. It\u2019s a message I\u2019ve heard from our associates and members in each club I visit.", "I\u2019ve also heard that our Business members are under pressure from the economy. We are seeing more just in time shopping versus making advance purchasing. We are seeing more frequent trips and business owners shopping themselves versus sending an employee in order to save money. We know that our members need Sam\u2019s value and quality more than ever before and our entire team is working hard to constantly deliver value and quality to our members.", "With Nacho\u2019s focus on club operations and with Linda\u2019s focus on quality and value, we will meet the needs of both our Business and Advantage members. We will deliver on our value and quality commitment for every member, every month, every day, every time they shop. I look forward to personally leading this effort.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the results for the first quarter. Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s sales for Q1 of fiscal 2010 were $11 billion, that\u2019s a decrease of 1.4% when compared to the same period last year. The decline in sales was due to lower fuel sales associated primarily with declining fuel prices. In addition, Sam\u2019s had one less selling day in the quarter versus last year\u2019s leap year. Excluding fuel for the quarter, Sam\u2019s would have had sales increases of 3.1%.", "Comp club sales, excluding all fuel sales for the 13 week period, increased by 4.2%. Including fuel, the comp club sales number was down 50 basis points. The average retail price per gallon of fuel at Sam\u2019s Club decreased 40% for the first quarter compared to last year. Traffic was positive every month in the quarter, with Advantage traffic growing faster than Business. Business member average ticket increased, while Advantage member ticket declined slightly. Both ticket and traffic measurements exclude fuel.", "Strong categories during Q1 were primarily in the fresh food, dry grocery and consumable areas. We continue to see member spending focused on food and consumable categories. In fresh food, members continue to recognize the extreme value Sam\u2019s offers. Our meat, produce, bread and bakery categories have consistently shown strong comp sales increases. Additionally, we have improved our management of production planning at the club level, this allows us to drive sales, increase turns, and decrease shrink on our fresh items.", "Discretionary categories continue to experience sales pressures. Big ticket items continue to be challenged, with categories such as furniture, jewelry, and electronics remaining areas where members are spending less. Office electronics, which includes laptops, was a notable exception, with strong comp sales for the quarter. Price increases on tobacco products, related to the federal excise tax increase on April 1st drove strong sales for the tobacco category.", "Gross margin as a percent of total sales, both including and excluding the impact of fuel, increased for the first quarter versus the same period last year. The increase is attributable to a change in our merchandise mix as compared to prior periods.", "Sam\u2019s expenses on a percentage to sales basis for first quarter were up versus the same period in the prior year. The increase was due largely to the impact of declining fuel prices on total sales. Other factors included higher group health care costs, similar to those experienced by Wal-Mart, and utilities. The clubs did a great job with labor productivity for the quarter, with costs increasing below the rate of sales growth, excluding fuel. Our continuing effort related to effective scheduling has produced labor productivity improvements in our core business.", "Membership income was slightly down versus the prior year, mainly as a result of previous sign ups and renewal challenges that occurred in the period following our 2006 fee increases, with the residual impact being felt longer because we defer membership income recognition over a 12 month period. Additionally, we are seeing some pressure in our business add on memberships, which are additional paid memberships associated with a business membership. This is due to many small businesses facing cost cutting pressures and employee cutbacks.", "In other membership areas, both Advantage and Business memberships showed positive trends during the quarter. Our invoice comparison program for small business continues to show positive results, increasing sign ups and renewals. On the Advantage side, our value proposition and marketing efforts continue to drive sign ups and renewals.", "During the first weekend in April, we hosted our first Taste of Spring, in which member savings stations showed prospective members the potential savings of shopping with Sam\u2019s. The events drove both incremental traffic and sign ups. Our membership and marketing teams will continue to drive new member offerings, as well as new ways of showing the value of being a Sam\u2019s Club member. We\u2019ll be kicking off a new membership campaign at the end of May, building on the success of our October program.", "Other income decreased this quarter compared to the prior year period. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, operating income increased as a percentage of sales to 3.58% versus the 3.53% last year. On a dollar basis, operating income for the quarter was even with the prior year at $393 million. Ending inventory for the quarter was up 1% when compared to the prior year. Considering the company\u2019s goal of growing inventory at or less than half of the rate of sales growth, we met that metric when fuel is excluded from the calculation.", "On May 6th, we announced the closure of two clubs, one in Plymouth, Mass. and one located in Willoughby Hills, Ohio. We are actively assisting as many of our impacted associates as possible to locate new positions at neighboring clubs or Wal-Mart facilities. We are also working with members to transfer as many of them as possible to other Sam\u2019s Club locations. The impact of the closures on the quarter\u2019s financial results was not material.", "We\u2019re approaching the second quarter sales environment with caution, as we are coming up against last year\u2019s economic stimulus checks. Last year we saw members use their stimulus payments to purchase discretionary items, but with lower discretionary spending this year, there will be continued pressure on these categories.", "Additionally, we anticipate certain categories that were highly inflationary last year to experience declining rates of inflation or even deflation over the next several quarters. Given those considerations, we expect comp club sales for the 13 week period ending July 31st to be between flat and 3%.", "We plan to stay focused on driving efficiencies and controlling club expenses, while maximizing our top line sales potential, through the quality and value of our merchandise. We will continue to focus on meeting our member\u2019s needs in today\u2019s challenging environment.", "To conclude, let me say that I am encouraged by what I see in our clubs, by the opportunities to continue to grow this business, and by the enthusiasm of our associates. I\u2019m excited to be leading the Sam\u2019s Club team.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.", "Tom Schoewe ", "Let me kick off my discussion with a quarterly \u201creport card\u201d on our five financial metrics. Our first couple of metrics suggest that we like operating income to grow faster then sales and property, plant and equipment. For the reasons that Eduardo, Doug, and Brian discussed earlier, we don\u2019t have a plus in either of these columns. Next, we want to grow payables faster than inventories. We do have a good story here. Simply put, payables are down 1.7% and inventories are down 3.2% when compared to the same period last year.", "That leads me to our next objective, increasing inventory at less than half the rate of our sales growth. We have strong performance in inventory management thanks mainly to continued progress that Wal-Mart US is making. You also heard Doug\u2019s commitment to improve International\u2019s inventory performance. Given the process improvements currently under way in our operations, we anticipate continued good news on this front. The real takeaway here, operating management is doing a marvelous job of managing working capital.", "Now let\u2019s look at corporate expenses. We want them to grow at a slower rate than sales, so we need to look at these expenses three ways: First is our home office spend, which in my opinion, we managed extremely well. Second, is transformation, we talked about our three transformation initiatives; merchandising, finance, and human resources. Third, the additional investments in technology we\u2019ve made that Charles discussed earlier.", "These investments, coupled with our organization\u2019s emphasis to improve technology throughout the company are the reasons corporate expenses are growing faster than sales. Throughout the organization we remain committed to expense control and strong fiscal management. Although we didn\u2019t meet or exceed all five operating metrics, your takeaway should be that we\u2019re doing all the right things to position ourselves well financially, improve our business, and generate free cash flow.", "As both Mike and Charles mentioned up front, our free cash flow performance remains best in class and is a testament to the strong underlying operating results. We are proud of our continued strength, delivering $964 million, that\u2019s right, just under $1 billion, of free cash flow here in our first quarter.", "Let\u2019s shift gears and chat about ROI. Return on investment from continuing operations for the 12 months ended April 30, 2009, was down 40 basis points to 18.7% and that compares to the 19.1% we reported the same time last year.", "Now, let\u2019s get behind the numbers; first is our acquisition of D&S in Chile. Keep in mind the numerator only includes one quarter of earnings, while the denominator has our full investment in D&S. Second, you know that this year contains one less selling day than last year, because of leap year, again affecting the numerator. Finally, the Easter calendar shift, which affected International sales and profits. Most important, let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that an 18.7% pre-tax return remains very attractive.", "Now on to guidance. Carol covered our policy changes earlier. Since you\u2019ve heard from Eduardo and Brian on the separate guidance for Wal-Mart US and Sam\u2019s Club respectively, I\u2019ll just remind you that we will no longer forecast a total US comp store sales figure for the next 13 week period.", "We expect diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 to be between $0.83 and $0.88. Our guidance takes into account the company\u2019s strong underlying performance and the current economic environment. As mentioned several times during this call, the comparison of Q2 to the prior year is made more difficult because of the economic stimulus checks our customers received last year. Finally, recall, that as we told you at year end, we expect currency exchange rates to continue to be a headwind through the third quarter.", "Before we end the call today, I\u2019d like to leave you with a couple of really important takeaways. We had a strong first quarter with good performance relative to our competition. I\u2019m proud of the strength of our balance sheet and the free cash flow generated by our operations. The current economy may be challenging, but we\u2019re doing a great job of taking care of our customers and we will continue to do so long after the economy recovers. It\u2019s obvious that the Wal-Mart \u201csave money, live better\u201d mission is effective today and will be tomorrow.", "Thank you for listening and have a great day.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Thanks for joining us today for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2010. I\u2019d like to remind you that a replay of this call and related materials about the quarter are available on our Web site. We\u2019ll also post the full transcript for this call approximately one hour after the call is live.", "Here\u2019s the agenda for today; Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Charles Holley, EVP of Finance and Treasurer, who will cover our consolidated financial results, Eduardo Castro-Wright, Vice Chairman, responsible for Wal-Mart US, Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, and Tom Schoewe, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will finish the call with analysis on our financial metrics and earnings guidance.", "Before Mike begins his report, we want to cover a few housekeeping items. First, as a reminder, we no longer report sales results on a monthly basis. We now provide comparable store sales guidance and results on a 13 week basis in our quarterly earnings releases, just as we\u2019re doing today. We will not provide any sales results on the day when other US retailers traditionally report their results.", "We will continue to report comp store sales results on a fiscal calendar basis in our Form 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC. Eduardo and Brian will provide comp guidance for the current 13 week sales period that\u2019s under way in their respective discussions. This guidance is on the retail calendar 4-5-4 week basis, and not on the standard calendar basis.", "As we discussed last quarter, effective with the start of our fiscal year on February 1, 2009, our company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard Number 160, which is \u201cNon-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d This standard requires some accounting changes and minor modifications to financial statement presentation for minority interest in subsidiaries.

Also, diluted net income per share from continuing operations refers to diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart.", "Store counts, square footage updates and information on our financial metrics are available on our Web site www.Walmartstores.com/investors, and you\u2019ll find that information in the reconciliation and financial measures section.", "Thanks for listening to our news about Wal-Mart\u2019s second quarter of fiscal 2010.", "Mike, let\u2019s get started with our news.", "Mike Duke", "Welcome everyone and thanks for joining us. I want to start by saying that I feel our performance during the second quarter was particularly good, given a very challenging economy all over the world. I\u2019m pleased to report that our earnings per share came in at $0.88, right at the top of the guidance we provided three months ago, and we exceeded analyst consensus estimates.", "We are happy with the performance of our operations around the world. Even with lower sales than we\u2019d expected, we believe that our comparable store sales outperformed the retail sector almost every place where we do business. In a difficult economy, we managed our operations in a disciplined manner and we delivered another consecutive quarter of earnings growth on top of last year\u2019s earnings growth. I believe that this is an accomplishment few other large companies can claim up to this point.", "Consumers continue to face a difficult global economy, having to do more with less. We\u2019re accelerating our efforts to improve everything we do, for customers and shareholders. Our leadership teams are focused on improving productivity and efficiency in all operations, and widening the gap with our competitors. I believe that our associates around the world have never been more engaged in the business and in serving our customers. We appreciate their hard work.", "Now, let\u2019s review some key performance indicators in the second quarter. Total company net sales for the second quarter were $100 billion. Now, three factors affected our sales performance: First, the effect of currency exchange rates reduced our International sales for the quarter by approximately $4 billion, second, we had the impact of lower fuel prices at ASDA and at Sam\u2019s here in the US, and third, like other retailers, we experienced lower inflation in certain categories, including food.", "Comp sales at Sam\u2019s Club were within guidance for the 13 weeks. However, Wal-Mart US comps were below their expectations. We had another standout performance in free cash flow, generating more than $4 billion in the first half of the year. We continue to manage working capital well and will take advantage of opportunities that present themselves to us in today\u2019s challenging economy. Wal-Mart remains strong financially, with a solid balance sheet, great access to capital markets and one of the few double \u2018A\u2019 credit ratings.", "Overall, our customers are more disciplined in their spending. There\u2019s a new normal now where people are saving more, consuming less, and being more frugal and thoughtful in their purchases. Customers are shopping smarter. They want quality products that are cost effective, sustainable and provide real value, and that\u2019s exactly what we do and our mission won\u2019t change.", "Those who know me know that I talk a lot about being obsessed with how we can improve our customers\u2019 experiences in our stores. Let me just take a moment to share a short story with you. I recently spent a few hours visiting with a customer in her home and then shopping with her. Unfortunately, because of today\u2019s economy, her family income is down about 40%.", "She and her husband have three children under five years old, and the budget is much, much tighter than last year. So as a result, they have had to sacrifice. They really don\u2019t go out to eat much anymore. She doesn\u2019t buy any clothing for herself anymore. She\u2019s had to eliminate some other services, so they truly have had to find ways to manage their budget.", "As we walked through a couple of stores, I learned that she\u2019s buying more private brands and she\u2019ll buy larger pack sizes to save money, and she also pays more attention to ads. She said that one of the hardest things to do is to say no to her kids and she\u2019s having to do that more often. Ordinarily, her first choice wasn\u2019t always Wal-Mart, because it was a longer drive for her. But we did some comparison shopping. We shopped together as a matter of fact and compared prices and she realized that by shopping at Wal-Mart, she could save more than the extra cost of gas to drive a little further.", "So, how do we get customers like her in our store? We bring our mission of saving people money so they can live better to life. We also effectively and frequently communicate our value proposition, and we ensure that the customer experience is so good that she\u2019ll come back for all of her trips, even if it is a bit longer drive. What this story also illustrates is that in today\u2019s economy, Wal-Mart can continue to attract new customers, because we\u2019re helping her to do more with what she has. We help her save money so her family can live better.", "Wal-Mart US continues to increase its traffic. I believe that our stores have never been in better shape, and Eduardo Castro-Wright and his team are dedicated to even more improvements. Overall, the US stores are managing expenses well in the current sales environment, while continuing to enhance the customer experience. Customers are giving us the highest ratings we\u2019ve had since we started our surveys over two years ago.", "We\u2019re benefiting from investments in merchandising systems and continued productivity initiatives. I\u2019m especially proud of our performance in inventory, because it improves our financial results and the customer experience. Wal-Mart US reduced inventory by almost 6%, and that\u2019s on top of several quarters of consistent inventory improvement.", "Now, I\u2019m especially proud of the International team, led by Doug McMillon. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew by more than 13%. Of course, that\u2019s faster than the International sales growth of 11.5%. If you eliminate the effect of currency rate fluctuations, International remains our fastest growing business.", "Sam\u2019s Club also had a strong showing compared to its competitors in the warehouse club sector, reinforcing how members value their membership, and the quality of merchandise that Brian Cornell and his team are delivering. Even with price deflation in food, consumables and electronics, traffic is higher than this time last year and we\u2019re improving our market position in the club sector. At the same time, Sam\u2019s also lowered its inventories by more than 5%, contributing to our strong inventory improvement on a consolidated basis.", "We also continue to broaden and accelerate our efforts on issues important to customers and associates. Let me share two examples. Our sustainability programs are making Wal-Mart a better company. We recently proposed the creation of a worldwide sustainability index that for the first time will generate important data from suppliers and give customers a clear and consistent view of the environmental impacts of the products they buy. Customers want to know how their purchasing decisions impact our environment.", "We remain active in the health care discussion here in the United States. Business has to be involved in the process of determining how health care reform will affect all Americans. We took a stand on health care because we believe it was the right thing to do for our business.", "Looking forward, we are confident about Wal-Mart\u2019s long term future and in our ability to build on our leadership position. Short term, we believe the economy will continue to be challenging. We are accelerating our focus on reducing expenses and improving productivity in all of our operations.", "Now, Charles will review our consolidated results in detail.", "Charles Holley", "Total net sales for the company were $100.1 billion, which is down 1.4% compared to last year. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 2.7% to $104.3 billion. Without the effect of the $4.2 billion currency exchange translation and lower fuel prices in the US and UK, sales would have been approximately $5 billion higher. Food deflation was an additional headwind, one that\u2019s harder to quantify, but clearly a factor.", "Consolidated operating income was $5.9 billion, up 1.2%, with income from continuing operations before income taxes up almost 1%. Without the effect of currency exchange, our consolidated operating income would have grown 5.3%, which is higher than the constant currency sales increase of 2.7%. As Mike mentioned previously, we are pleased with our underlying performance.", "Diluted net income per share attributable to Wal-Mart was $0.88. The effect of currency exchange rates reduced earnings per share by $0.04 for the second quarter. Consolidated gross margin was up 85 basis points, due primarily to improvements made by Wal-Mart US and Sam\u2019s Club. Inventory, on a consolidated basis, remains an excellent story, thanks to Wal-Mart US and Sam\u2019s Club segments. Consolidated inventory was down 4.3%, when compared to the same period last year, and, that\u2019s against a year to date sales decrease of 1%.", "Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 85% at the end of the second quarter, which is up 46 basis points from last year. Our operating segments continue to do an excellent job of managing working capital, and this will be an important focus throughout the company for the balance of the year.", "The membership and other income line primarily includes membership revenue, tenant lease income and some other miscellaneous income categories. On a consolidated basis, membership and other income was up 4% this quarter compared to last year. Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up 74 basis points over this period last year. This was primarily due to the combination of lower net sales, including the impact of currency exchange rates, along with group health costs and technology and system expenses. Even with these headwinds, consolidated operating expenses were up only 2.4%.", "Unallocated corporate costs, also called corporate or other, were up $68 million, or 13.3% for the quarter, with the largest increase due to our planned investments in technology and systems. Core overhead expenses, which are included in the corporate segment, were roughly flat with last year, reflecting our continued focus on managing our expenses.", "At our June Shareholders\u2019 meeting, we met with the investment community and shared some information with you about our three transformation initiatives: people, merchandising and finance. In addition to ongoing technology investments, these initiatives are designed to increase and strengthen the company\u2019s efficiency and productivity. Each of the three initiatives is made up of both capital expenditures and operating expenses, including payroll.", "All three initiatives have short term and long term benefits. The people system initiatives are the smaller of these and are nearing completion. The two major longer term transformation initiatives are in merchandising and in finance. We continue to work prudently by implementing the rollout of the merchandising capabilities across all operating segments, as the merchandising investment is critical to improving the productivity and efficiency of our global business, enabling us to better serve our customers around the world, and to allow for future growth.", "The merchandising systems, which are continuing through the end of this fiscal year, are already delivering business improvements, such as gross margin enhancement, for the Wal-Mart US business, and will be leveraged for our other countries in the future. I won\u2019t steal Eduardo\u2019s thunder in speaking more about these results, but this investment is already paying off.", "The finance transformation is a multi year integrated program. We are well into the third year of this initiative and our progress is tracking well. In June, we successfully completed our first rollout for ASDA in the UK. We expect the majority of the foundational work to support other countries to be completed in the next 12 months. The result of these investments will be a single financial platform for all of our businesses worldwide, and one that will give us the additional capacity for future acquisitions and growth. Expenses for this finance system will plateau in the back half of this fiscal year.", "Now, let\u2019s cover the status of our interest expense, tax rate, and debt levels. Net interest expense was up 3.7% over last year\u2019s second quarter. Total debt was up; however, interest rates were lower when compared to the prior year. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 34.3%. We continue to expect the tax rate for fiscal 2010 to be between 34% and 35% percent, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may affect our rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax matters and the mix of domestic and international income.", "During these economic times, our balance sheet continues to remain strong and we continue to have good access to the credit markets. Our debt to total capitalization ratio was 40.3%, essentially flat with the 40% percent we reported at this time last year.", "Mike highlighted one of our ongoing success stories earlier, free cash flow generation. Recall that we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx. Through the combination of our solid operating management and discipline on expenses, as well as strong capital efficiency, we are pleased to report that the company ended the first six months of the fiscal year with free cash flow of $4.2 billion. This compares to $5.1 billion at this time last year.", "A deeper dive into our cash flow statement reflects payments for capital spending, or CapEx, of approximately $5.7 billion during the first half of this fiscal year, an increase of approximately 13% over the same period last year. This was within our plan for the first six months, and we expect our capital spending for the full year to be well within the original guidance of $12.5 and $13.5 billion.", "During the second quarter, our Board of Directors approved a $15 billion share repurchase program, replacing the prior $15 billion program, which had $3.4 billion remaining on it. In this quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.9 billion of our stock, which represented about 39.1 million shares. We have approximately $13.7 billion remaining on the new $15 billion program. We remain committed to our share repurchase program.", "As Mike noted, our company\u2019s financial position continues to remain strong. The attention of our operating and corporate teams to strong financial management continues to be a daily priority.", "Now, let\u2019s move to the discussion of our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with our Wal-Mart US business.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright", "We are pleased with the financial performance of the Wal-Mart business in the United States. Despite a difficult sales environment, as reflected by the negative retail industry comps that have been reported during this quarter, we were able to deliver strong profits because of our very disciplined management of the business. Further, the systems and processes we are investing in are demonstrating that we can deliver continued improvements. Our underlying business remains strong, with positive traffic driving a continuation of market share gains. We have now experienced those gains for several quarters.", "Sales reached $64.2 billion during the quarter, which is an increase of 0.3% over last year\u2019s second quarter. While traffic was up 1.3% for the 13 week sales period, comparable store sales declined 1.5%, which was below our guidance of flat to 3%. We attribute this shortfall to three factors. First, as experienced and reported by other retailers, reported comps reflect a continuation of a challenging retail environment. Consumers were more selective in discretionary spending during the second quarter than earlier this year.", "Second, grocery prices have been more sharply driven by deflationary pressures than we had expected, and this affected comps by approximately 150 basis points. Last, we believe we underestimated the benefit on comps that our stores received from last year\u2019s second quarter stimulus checks.", "Where this nets out is simply that in spite of softer sales than expected, our underlying business remains strong. Through this difficult economy, Wal-Mart continues to gain traffic. In fact, our comp store sales outperformed the Thomson Retail Index for each of the three months during the 13 week period on the 4-5-4 calendar by an average of 300 to 350 basis points each month. This points to a much better relative performance than the US retail market. We attribute the strength of our traffic to the improvements from our Project Impact strategic framework and, we believe these improvements are permanent and sustainable.", "In spite of the sales shortfall, we managed operations in a disciplined way and delivered a 5% growth in operating income for the quarter, on sales growth of 0.3%. Operating income reached $4.9 billion, above our plan, and a significant achievement that reinforces our ability to deliver outstanding bottom line performance, even in a difficult environment.", "Another highlight for the second quarter was our year over year 5.8% reduction in inventory. This equates to about $1.4 billion less inventory than this time last year. Lower inventory has been a major reason for profit performance and it continues to benefit customers by providing an improved shopping experience.", "The investment in our merchandising transformation initiatives is contributing to better gross margins and also to improved operating expenses. We also are executing a number of Project Impact initiatives that are focused on both cost and price leadership, as well as mix. The benefits of these initiatives flowed to gross margin during the quarter, as gross margin increased 109 basis points over last year\u2019s second quarter. Lower shrink, as well as flat year over year markdowns as a percentage of sales, also contributed to the improvement in margin.", "The strength of our logistics and transportation systems, along with lower fuel prices versus last year, is also reflected in the margin improvements. As a matter of fact, our case productivity increased 9% year over year. Importantly, with inventory in remodeled stores continuing to come down significantly versus the control stores, we expect that year over year inventory improvements will stay with us for quite some time.", "I\u2019m also pleased with how the investment in merchandising systems and processes is driving product quality in our fresh areas. We have greatly improved the flow of perishables into our stores, which has reduced damaged goods. Further, customers are giving us a lot of credit for improving the quality of our fresh offerings, and their perceptions are validated in our higher sales comps in grocery.", "Our grocery and health and wellness comps were positive and remained ahead of our major competitors during the 13 week period. In spite of deflationary pressures already discussed, our supermarket format, Neighborhood Market, achieved comps for the 13 week period of 3.8%. We continue to attribute our strength in sales across the store to the strong price leadership position that we have. It\u2019s clear from many of the research reports that have been published recently that Wal-Mart continues to be the price leader.", "One other merchandise unit I\u2019d like to highlight is home. Our positioning efforts, along with the merchandising transformation initiatives, have strengthened the sales momentum in this business. Sales of our proprietary brands, including Better Homes & Gardens, Canopy and Mainstays, as well as our new teen line, Your Zone, continue to grow ahead of comps reported by leading competitors. Our sales in kitchen, dining and food preparation products continue to be strong. In fact, when we compare our monthly home performance to what other retailers are reporting on monthly sales day, we believe we continue to gain significant share in this business.", "Let us now move to expense management. A very disciplined approach moderated our operating expenses, which increased 3.9% or 71 basis points as a percentage of sales year over year. Expenses, which were impacted by higher group health costs, increased advertising, and lower recycling prices, were still below our plan, and showed fairly significant improvement. Utility costs benefited positively from milder weather and lower rates.", "What is also important to note is that in a difficult sales environment, we managed labor and other store costs efficiently. As a matter of fact, group health costs, advertising and recycling drove more than half the increase in operating expenses, and we expect this expense pressure to decline in the second half.", "The focus on improving our structure and more tightly managing expenses will result in driving better earnings. Our organization remains very committed to improving our SG&A leverage, even in a low sales growth environment.", "The rollout of this year\u2019s remodeling program accelerated in the second quarter and will continue through October, with our goal being to reflect the Project Impact strategies in almost 650 stores. This includes all new construction and about 500 existing stores, some of which are expansions and relocations.", "Now let me share what we are seeing in the remodels. I\u2019m sure that the benefits of Project Impact are high on your list of questions. For starters, we have completed about half of our store remodeling goal for this year and we are encouraged by the fact that sales are exceeding our internal models by 100 to 125 basis points.", "In most stores, we have mitigated the disruption to our customers, as reflected by the fact that the impact to comps is lower than anticipated. Despite the initial disruption during the remodel, improvements in customer experience after the remodel are growing at twice the rate of the rest of the chain. Also, an important outcome is that Project Impact remodels are helping us attract new customers. Overall, our customer experience scores in the last quarter again reached record levels.", "Now, let\u2019s move to the third quarter. Based on the industry reports on back-to-school, we believe we are gaining significant share of this sizable business. Although it is a tough sales environment, we are pleased with the initial response to our back-to-school and back-to-college offerings. Now, like it has been the case for several seasons, customers are shopping much closer to the event.", "We are focused on delivering on our \u201csave money\u201d promise on top brands in school supplies, electronics, home and, in apparel, we have a very strong program in place, supported by the launch of the Miley Cyrus - Max Azria line. The coordinated color program for back-to-college has been received very positively. Back-to-college comp sales are running in the mid double digits ahead of last year.", "As Mike noted, we expect that the economy will remain difficult. Our own surveys point to ongoing concerns by consumers about their own financial situation. More people are concerned about unemployment. Because of that, we will continue to be focused on our price leadership message, which is so important in these times. We estimate that comp sales for the 13 week period from August 1 through October 30, 2009 to be between flat and 2%.", "In closing, let me remind you that for the first half of this year, the Wal-Mart US business has performed ahead of profit expectations. We believe we have a strategic framework in place that will continue to help offset an economy that will be challenging the rest of this year.", "I will turn it over to Doug for Wal-Mart International.", "Doug McMillon", "I\u2019ll cover our quarterly results in just a moment, but first, I\u2019d like to share a few observations from the past month. My family and I spent the month of July in Asia, traveling first to India, then to China and then on to Japan to experience our business and the cultures of these countries in a deeper way. I met with associates, visited our stores and government officials, spoke with the media, checked out the competition and visited customers in their homes in China and Japan.", "As you may guess, there are consistent themes from our customers. They are paying attention. They\u2019re paying attention to price, quality, and convenience in an intense manner. They\u2019re trying more private brand items. This is a great opportunity for us to gain and hold share. It reinforced our focus on productivity, value creation and communication of that value.", "I\u2019ve spent time in every country in the Wal-Mart International portfolio this year and I\u2019m excited about the opportunities we have to grow our business. As a stand alone company, we\u2019d be one of the largest retailers worldwide and certainly one of the fastest growing. Our associates are delivering for our customers and helping drive this growth. I\u2019m also proud of our operating performance, sales and operating income are both up on a constant currency basis.", "As we move to the specific results for the second quarter, I want to mention a few items that affect comparability of results for Wal-Mart International; currency exchange rates and the calendar. First, currency exchange rate fluctuations continued to affect reported results during the second quarter. We hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis, without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. With the exception of our total segment results, this discussion of Wal-Mart International excludes the impact of currency.", "Second, because all but Canada and Puerto Rico report on a calendar year basis, the majority of the International countries\u2019 second quarter results include April. Consequently, as we noted last quarter, Easter results are included in our second quarter for those markets that report on a calendar year. Finally, my references to last year are for the second quarter of fiscal 2009.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to the second quarter results. International net sales for the second quarter were approximately $24.0 billion. This includes a $4.2 billion impact of currency valuation, which led to a 5.1% decline from last year\u2019s US dollar sales. On a constant currency basis, before the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, sales were up 11.5% over last year. The increase in sales calculated on a constant currency basis is due primarily to strong performances in the UK and Mexico, and the addition of sales from our acquisition of D&S in Chile. The sales from Chile are included this year, but were not in last year\u2019s results.", "Segment operating income for the second quarter was $1.1 billion, down 6.2% from last year. On a constant currency basis, before the $237 million impact of currency rate fluctuations, operating income was up 13.3% from last year and grew faster than net sales, primarily due to several areas: ASDA\u2019s strong sales performance in the UK, Walmex\u2019s store growth and expense savings in Mexico, and productivity improvements in Canada and Japan.", "The gross margin rate was down slightly on a constant currency basis when compared to last year, largely due to a mix shift towards lower margin food and consumables, and continued pricing actions taken in several markets, particularly in Japan and Brazil.", "Expenses as a percentage of net sales improved slightly on a constant currency basis due to leveraging of the sales increase at ASDA, productivity improvements in Japan and expense savings initiatives at Walmex. On a constant currency basis, membership and other income as a percentage of net sales was slightly higher than last year.", "As I mentioned in the Q&A for the investment community after the shareholders\u2019 meeting in June, we still have room to improve in inventory management. We are implementing process changes in our markets to improve our inventory performance. Among our efforts are; improving the open to buy control processes, avoiding the tendency to fill the shelf by trusting our replenishment systems, and in some countries, making organization structure changes to improve accountability.", "Reducing unproductive inventory is a top focus for the division and our leaders. We can operate our business on less inventory, while increasing our in stock levels for our customers and members. I will report on our efforts in this regard in the coming quarters.", "Now let\u2019s get into the results for several of our markets. In the United Kingdom, ASDA continues its momentum and is performing extremely well, gaining market share and growing profits faster than sales. According to TNS, ASDA total market share increased to 17%, up from 16.7% last year. Additionally, ASDA has extended its price gap against its competitors, winning by a record margin the Grocer magazine award for the lowest priced supermarket for a twelfth successive year.", "ASDA\u2019s comp sales growth without fuel was 7.9%. Second quarter comparable store sales, excluding fuel, grew by 70 basis points, when you take into account the Easter calendar shift from Q1 last year to Q2 this year. The majority of the growth is due to an increase in ASDA customer traffic. Average ticket also increased, despite a sharp fall in food price inflation. We are particularly pleased that this performance is underpinned by acceleration in food volume growth over last year. The strongest sales results were in grocery, fresh meat and frozen foods.", "General merchandise comp growth strengthened in the second quarter, with strong sales performances in baby and pet care, and outdoor categories. George clothing is having an excellent spring/summer season, with market share up 35 basis points to 3.9%, and that\u2019s growth without the need for significant markdowns. Early sales of \u201cback to school\u201d products are extremely encouraging.", "Despite increases in disposable income, UK consumer confidence remains low, primarily due to unemployment fears. Consumers continue to be more prudent and are saving more. ASDA is well positioned to continue to gain share in this environment.", "The economy in Mexico continued to face challenges in the second quarter of this year, and beginning in April, the country experienced several days of business closures because of the H1N1 influenza outbreak. Walmex management continues to build on their strengths to better serve customers, while becoming an even more efficient operator. As you\u2019re about to hear, they are a model of our commitment that Every Day Low Costs provide Every Day Low Prices.", "At Walmex, second quarter sales increased 11.3% over last year, while comparable store sales grew 4%. Self-service format net sales grew 13%, while comp store sales grew 5.1%. Food continues to be our strongest category in Mexico, driving a 3.3% increase in traffic in comparable stores. Average ticket at Walmex also increased, growing 0.6%. As we saw in the first quarter, our customers in Mexico are reducing spending in non-food areas, such as clothing and general merchandise.", "Earlier this year, Walmex committed to exceed market growth by 50%. I\u2019m proud to report that Walmex has exceeded that target to date. ANTAD, a national retail association, reports on the industry\u2019s comps and market share growth. As ANTAD reported, total Walmex self-service sales for the January through May period grew 11.7%, compared with industry growth of 7.3% excluding Walmex. Comparable store sales for Walmex grew 3%, and self-service formats grew 4.1% in the January through May period. Industry comp store sales excluding Walmex for the corresponding period were only 1.2%.", "Second quarter gross margin was slightly behind last year. Despite this, operating income increased faster than sales primarily due to great results from cost savings programs including productivity initiatives, sustainable energy conservation, and declining energy costs.", "Moving north to Canada, the economy there continues to face pressures from contraction in gross domestic product, rising unemployment in manufacturing industries and poor consumer confidence.", "Wal-Mart Canada\u2019s second quarter sales grew 5.8% over last year predominately because of our supercentre expansion program.", "Sales of food and consumables are stronger, and are partially offset by soft sales in apparel and discretionary items. Comparable store sales growth for the quarter was 0.6%. Average ticket was up 1.7% and customer traffic dropped by 1.1%. The second quarter gross margin rate decreased from last year, primarily due to a shift towards food and consumables.", "Ongoing cost efficiencies in logistics and store operations resulted in expenses growing slower than sales. However, these did not fully offset the margin decline, which resulted in operating income that grew slower than sales.", "In Brazil, second quarter real comparable store sales increased 2%, with the best performances in food and consumables. Margin pressures came from competitive pricing actions. This combined with costs to open eight new stores this quarter led to operating income growing slower than sales. Despite the current economy, we remain enthusiastic about our business in Brazil.", "Moving now to Asia, in Japan, both customer traffic and overall sales growth at Seiyu continued to increase in the second quarter. Sales increased 1.4% over last year, on a comparable store sales increase of 1.3%. This is a continuation of the trend we have seen since Seiyu launched EDLP and began to aggressively communicate its price position.", "Seiyu\u2019s second quarter sales results are noteworthy as they represent continued out performance of the market. The shift in Every Day Low Price drove an increase in food sales of 2.1% and an increase in consumables sales of 6.7%. The general economic slowdown again affected spending on higher ticket general merchandise and apparel sales in the second quarter.", "Gross margin declined as a result of the continued rollout of EDLP. Every Day Low Cost initiatives in Japan are helping to reduce expenses in many areas, and leading to labor productivity and logistics improvements. However, the expense savings were not enough to offset the margin decline, and as a result, Seiyu\u2019s operating income grew slower than sales. We continue to focus on improving product costs and operating expenses.", "In China, we opened 10 new stores during the second quarter and now have more than 250 stores throughout the country with the inclusion of TrustMart. It is encouraging to see the positive improvement in sales over last year. Despite continued deflation in core food categories, comparable store sales increased over the second quarter of fiscal 2009, driven by price leadership initiatives. Comparable store sales increased 2.5% and 0.1% at Wal-Mart China and TrustMart, respectively, for a total China comp of 1.6%.", "Initiatives to integrate our TrustMart business, cost control measures and productivity improvements resulted in significant reductions in expenses from last year. As a result, second quarter operating income in China increased over last year.", "Let me close by talking about India. It\u2019s a country we have not discussed in a few quarters, but it\u2019s an important part of our company\u2019s future. While in Asia, I particularly enjoyed our time in India. This was my second visit and it truly is a great opportunity for Wal-Mart. We visited an EasyDay store in Amritsar, where the Bharti Wal-Mart relationship is improving the customer offering as we learn from our customers.", "We also visited the first \u201cBest Price Modern Wholesale\u201d facility, which opened May 30. We are pleased with the progress there. I was very impressed by the team at the store. They are meeting the needs of small business owners and learning how to serve them even better. We also visited the Bharti Wal-Mart Training Centre in Amritsar, which offers students free training and exposure to customer service practices in retail and cash and carry operations.", "I\u2019m extremely proud of the opportunity Wal-Mart is bringing to people in India and around the world. The opportunity to learn new skills, the opportunity to work for a company that values its associates\u2019 contributions, and most of all the opportunity to save customers\u2019 money and help them live better lives.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for the update on Sam\u2019s Club.", "Brian Cornell", "I\u2019m pleased with the underlying sales strength of the Sam\u2019s Club business. We are focused on driving sales by emphasizing the fresh foods and consumables that members need in today\u2019s economy. We are also pleased with the results of our membership initiatives, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. In addition, we continue to take steps to better manage our expenses.", "Before I get into the financial results, let me elaborate on some of our efforts to better understand our members\u2019 needs. Our senior management team has made significant progress on refining the strategy to drive future efficiencies. Sam\u2019s will continue to elevate its focus on using consumer and member insights to guide our business. We will step up the relevancy, uniqueness and quality of Sam\u2019s merchandise assortment, always at a superior value and with a best in class club experience. We will share more details with you in October.", "From a membership perspective, we are enhancing our product offering. Let me highlight a new program called eValues that we piloted in the second quarter. This program provides custom offers to our Business and Advantage Plus members directly on their Sam\u2019s Club Plus membership cards. We are pleased with the early test results and will continue to roll out the program in the coming weeks.", "We continue to find ways to leverage our data and technology in order to add value for our members.", "We are also continuing to strengthen our productivity and efficiency, leveraging our scale and technology, but staying flexible to adapt to individual members. We have been testing a few select changes designed to improve productivity and simplicity and are pleased with the early indicators of these tests.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the results for the second quarter. Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s sales for Q2 were $11.9 billion, which is a 3.2% decrease compared to the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to lower fuel sales related to lower fuel prices, as well as deflation in some key categories. Excluding fuel for the quarter, Sam\u2019s would have had a sales increase of 1.7%.", "Our comp club sales, excluding fuel, for the 13 week period increased by 60 basis points. Including fuel, comp club sales declined 4.3%, primarily due to the average retail price per gallon of fuel at Sam\u2019s decreasing 38% for the second quarter compared to last year. We expect to see continued sales pressure from fuel in the third quarter, with a potential turnaround in the fourth quarter.", "Also, let me remind you that Sam\u2019s Club tends to generate greater fuel profit when there is market volatility and especially when prices are falling. Last year, there was a significant drop in fuel pricing starting in the October/November timeframe. This price fluctuation resulted in larger fuel profit during the third quarter last year.", "While sales were also impacted by deflation in key categories, such as dairy, produce, meat and electronics, we experienced strong double digit unit growth in several of these categories. As an example, while we have had 35% deflation in cheese prices year over year, we also experienced double digit unit sales growth during the same period. Strong categories during the quarter included fresh foods and consumables. We continue to see stronger sales trends in house wares and small appliances, as members are eating at home more often.", "Big ticket discretionary categories such as furniture, mattresses, jewelry, and major appliances continue to face sales pressure. Given the softer sales trends, we are focused on managing our seasonal inventory, which contributed to an overall inventory reduction of 5.3% compared to the prior year. Overall apparel sell through is relatively good as we took pricing action on certain items.", "We will continue monitoring apparel sell through for August and September to deliver clean inventory for the third quarter. Traffic was positive every month in the quarter, with Advantage traffic growing faster than Business. Both Advantage and Business member average ticket, which exclude fuel, declined slightly.", "Gross margin, both including and excluding the impact of fuel, increased for the quarter compared to the prior year. The increase is driven primarily by the continued change in our merchandise mix to more fresh and consumable items.", "Operating expenses increased 6.1% or 90 basis points as a percentage of sales year over year due in part to higher group health costs and club remodels. We experienced wage pressures, as our strong unit sales growth in some fresh areas led to additional costs related to managing fresh foods in the clubs. We expect health care costs to continue to grow for the remainder of the year. Despite these cost pressures, Sam\u2019s sales per labor hour improved 90 basis points versus last year. We are committed to continuing our focus on our expense structure.", "Overall, membership and other income as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year. However, we are encouraged by the momentum behind Advantage and Business signups. On the Advantage membership side, we ran the $15 summer membership campaign for 100 days of summer. Demonstrating the savings to prospective members allowed us to convert a large percentage of prospective members from $15 memberships to $40 memberships.", "This, together with continuing the momentum of Business signups allowed us to see total new member counts increase in the high single digits versus last year. Still, we continue to see pressure in our Business add on memberships, which are additional paid memberships, associated with a Business membership. This is due to small businesses continuing to face cost and credit pressures, as well as employee reductions. Renewal rates continue to be close to flat.", "For the second quarter of fiscal 2010, operating income as a percentage of sales declined slightly to 3.5% versus 3.6% last year. Sam\u2019s operating income of $419 million for the quarter was down 5% percent compared to last year.", "The third quarter is under way. We expect both our Advantage and Business members to remain focused on value and to ensure that they are fully taking advantage of their membership benefits. Due to the continuing economic challenges, as well as the continued deflation in key categories, our expectations for comp club sales for the 13 week period from August 1 through October 30 are approximately flat, plus or minus 1%.", "I remain excited about leading Sam\u2019s Club and look forward to further discussing our business plans at the October meeting.", "Now it\u2019s on to Tom for a financial review and guidance.", "Tom Schoewe", "Let\u2019s start with the review of our quarterly report card on five key financial metrics. As you\u2019ve heard, we felt some headwind this quarter from currency, deflation, the economy, and the tough comparison created by the stimulus checks that were issued last year. That being said, we\u2019re in the positive column on three of our five metrics.", "As you\u2019ve heard several times on this call, inventory has been managed very well especially here in the United States. Consolidated inventory was down 4.3% on a year to date sales decrease of approximately 1%. With the kind of inventory reduction we reported this quarter, it\u2019s clear that payables grew faster than inventories. The real take away, our operating management is doing a marvelous job of managing working capital.", "We\u2019re also pleased that operating income grew faster than sales. This was in large part due to the performance of the Wal-Mart US business, as Eduardo discussed earlier. Despite the headwinds of currency exchange fluctuations, lower fuel prices and food deflation, we were able to accomplish this important goal.", "Another goal is to grow operating income faster than Property, Plant and Equipment, or PP&E. Given our planned CapEx schedule for this year, we did not reach this goal for the second quarter. Having said that, we remain on schedule to be within our capital expenditure range of $12.5 to $13.5 billion for fiscal 2010.", "As Charles noted earlier, the \u201cother\u201d segment, or unallocated corporate overhead, was up approximately 13%, mainly driven by technology initiatives. As a result, overall corporate expenses did not grow at a slower rate than sales. Our performance with free cash flow remains best in class among large cap companies. The underlying strength of our operations and our commitment to capital efficiency serve as the foundation for this performance. We remain proud of our continued strength, having delivered $4.2 billion of free cash flow for the first six months of this fiscal year.", "Return on investment from continuing operations for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2009 was down 100 basis points to 18.4%, compared to the 19.4% we reported at this time last year. The decline is mainly the result of foreign exchange, the legal accrual we took in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year and the impact from our acquisition of D&S in Chile.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to guidance. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 to be between $0.78 and $0.82 a share. At the beginning of this fiscal year, we said that our guidance for the full fiscal year was between $3.45 and $3.60 a share. Today, we are updating the range of our full year earnings guidance for fiscal 2010 to $3.50 to $3.60 per share.", "Back in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, we said that our expectations for the FX impact would be approximately $0.13 per share over the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. We are updating that particular expectation today to $0.11 per share, compared to the $0.13 we cited earlier.", "This has been a long call and we appreciate your listening, but before we wrap up today, let me summarize the key points about Wal-Mart\u2019s performance. We are proud of our second quarter performance. We believe that we are one of a very few companies to report year on year earnings growth so far this quarter, building on the improvement that we reported last year. Wal-Mart continued to outperform almost all of its major competitors on comp sales, indicating that we are improving our market position.", "In a difficult economy, we managed our operations in a disciplined manner and that contributed to our earnings performance. We continued to generate significant free cash flow. Wal-Mart has a strong balance sheet; great access to capital and an enviable double \u2018A\u2019 rating. Despite currency fluctuations and a tough economy, our underlying business remains extremely healthy.", "Throughout the rest of the year, we will remain focused on expense management, as well as increasing productivity and the efficiency throughout our global operations. Most important, we will continue to take care of the 200 million customers who shop with us around the world every week.", "Thank you for listening.

These changes are reflected in our quarterly financial statements. Because of these changes, during the call all references to income from continuing operations or earnings per share from continuing operations refer to income from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart or diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart respectively. Also, diluted net income per share from continuing operations refers to diluted net income per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart.", "Our executive team is ready for our report on both the fourth quarter and the year end results. Our President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Mike Duke will kick it off. Charles Holley, Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer will cover the consolidated financial results. Then we will get into the details of each operating segment. Eduardo Castro-Wright, Vice Chairman responsible for Wal-Mart US, Global Sourcing and Global.com will cover Wal-Mart US and provide comments on our other new initiatives. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International will follow Eduardo and cover results for the segment and our largest international countries by revenue. Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club has results for our warehouse club segment. Tom Schoewe, our Executive Vice President and CFO will finish up the call with our financial report card as well as our earnings guidance.", "Our press release this morning has a fair amount of noise in the fourth quarter and the year. There are many details covered in our notes which we advise you to review carefully. Charles is going to talk a lot about this in detail but before I turn things over to Mike let me share an overview of the key adjustments disclosed in the press release.", "First we had $372 million or $0.10 per share in net tax benefits primarily from the repatriation of certain non-US earnings that increased US foreign tax credits. Second was a $260 million pre-tax or $162 million net of tax charge equal to $0.04 per share from several business restructurings which we have announced recently. On a pre-tax basis, Sam\u2019s Club recorded a charge of $174 million for restructuring its operations, including the closure of 10 clubs. Wal-Mart US recorded a pre-tax charge of $73 million for restructuring its operations and unallocated corporate overhead included a pre-tax charge of $13 million for restructuring charges. Finally, please remember that in last year\u2019s fourth quarter we had the settlement for the wage and hour class action litigation. This was $382 million pre-tax or $255 million net of tax, approximately $0.07 per share.", "Now, Mike, let\u2019s get started with our great earnings news.", "Mike Duke", "I am really proud of the performance of our teams around the world and the results Wal-Mart has delivered for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. The strength of our earnings is exceptional. So let\u2019s get right into the numbers.", "For the fourth quarter Wal-Mart today is reporting earnings per share of $1.23 and adjusted EPS of $1.17, five cents above the top of our own guidance and five cents above First Call consensus. For the full year, we reported EPS of $3.72 which was above the top of our guidance of $3.57 to $3.61. Adjusted EPS for fiscal year 2010 was $3.66. Charles will cover much more detail on the adjustments for restructurings and the tax benefit.", "Net sales for fiscal 2010 were more than $405 billion, with International net sales exceeding $100 billion for the first time in Wal-Mart history. While I\u2019m disappointed that Wal-Mart US comparable store sales were below expectations for the fourth quarter, I am really proud of their underlying operating performance and the fact that Wal-Mart delivered record profits for the quarter. Consolidated operating income for the fourth quarter was up almost 14% to $7.3 billion, reinforcing the strength of our business.", "Last fall we committed that SG&A would grow less than sales. How did we do? We successfully shifted the productivity loop into higher gear. The diligent way we managed our businesses and tight control of our costs resulted in the company leveraging expenses for the fourth quarter. We plan to grow expenses slower than the rate of sales growth in this new fiscal year.", "Our free cash flow performance continues to be very strong. We closed the year with $14.1 billion in free cash flow, another record, and an increase over last year of almost 21%. Finally, we posted a pre-tax return on investment of 19.3% for the year; equal to last year\u2019s ROI performance and I\u2019ll let Tom cover the discussion on ROI.", "These results reflect the ongoing underlying strength of our business and of our strategies to improve shareholder value by delivering growth, leveraging expenses and improving returns. We remain a growth company, we added more than 34 million net square feet of retail space this year, which is equivalent to some retailer\u2019s total selling space. More than half of that growth came from International, which added 21 million square feet this year.", "What\u2019s even more impressive is that this is organic growth, since we had no acquisitions this fiscal year. We now have more than 8,400 units worldwide with 53 formats. The investments we have made in systems are benefiting the bottom line. We\u2019re managing our working capital more efficiently. Throughout the organization we choose to spend where we know there is real value.", "Now let me recognize some fourth quarter accomplishments of our three operating segments. I want to emphasize again the strong underlying performance of Wal-Mart US. Operating income grew at a faster rate than sales, inventory was down yet again almost 8% over this time last year and continued investments in remodeling and productivity initiatives and our sourcing position us for better top line sales growth. Eduardo will cover this in more detail.", "Now let\u2019s move to International, but first let me ask all of you a question. How many of you know a $100 billion business that grew top line sales by 12% and grew profit by 19% in this very difficult economic environment during this fourth quarter? I know you\u2019re thinking about it but let me go ahead and name one for you, the name, Wal-Mart International.", "In addition to their strong sales performance, International continues to make progress on reducing inventory and improving returns. International rounded out the year by leveraging constant currency operating expenses for a fourth consecutive quarter and before the effects of the Chilean acquisition. We expect continued strong growth from International again this fiscal year, especially in Brazil and China. We\u2019re also really pleased with our start up in India and we see substantial opportunity there long term.", "Sam\u2019s continues to improve its club efficiency and the in club experience and I love what they\u2019re doing with merchandise. Sam\u2019s finished the year with solid comp sales. Sam\u2019s also reduced inventory through its productivity and efficiency initiatives and for the fourth quarter Sam\u2019s leveraged expenses after restructuring adjustments.", "Now let\u2019s look back at the total company again. In the last month we made a number of significant changes to ensure that our strategy is driving Wal-Mart structure for the future. The streamlined structure at Wal-Mart US will enable us to grow in new markets, leverage scale for greater efficiency, and offer new opportunities for some of our most talented associates.", "At Sam\u2019s Club, we closed 10 underperforming US clubs and we announced new initiatives to strengthen member loyalty and to drive growth. Our new global sourcing team will enable us to leverage the scale of our global merchandising organization, reduce costs and drive quality through our supply chain. Eduardo will reference some of these early successes from the global sourcing organization.", "There\u2019s also great potential for Wal-Mart in ecommerce. The integration of our dot com organization with our stores around the world will broaden the reach of our brand to serve customers through multiple channels. Some of these changes will yield immediate results and others, like the repositioning of our global sourcing, and global ecommerce strategy, are more long term focused. We view these steps as building blocks for a stronger, more global Wal-Mart.", "The first quarter of fiscal year 2011 is well underway for all of our segments. The economy remains challenging for many of our customers around the world. Unemployment is forecasted to be higher this year than the last three years in many of our countries. We expect first quarter sales in the US will be difficult as we cycle through strong year over year comparisons and deflation. We remain very focused on growing top line sales and we believe we will see more improvement as the year progresses.", "Since I have closed out my first year leading Wal-Mart, I have to say I am so proud of the quality of our team, from the senior leadership to the store and club managers and associates at every level of our global business. The belief in our mission of saving people money so that they can live better is real and its deep and its energizing our culture more than ever. We will continue to make a difference in communities around the world. We were proud to contribute to the relief efforts in Haiti as we have done for so many other natural disasters. We will also continue to take a leadership role in sustainability. I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with suppliers and stakeholders.", "As I visit with customers, it\u2019s striking how much people trust us to provide more value and quality than any other retailer. Change has always been a part of our company and our culture. We\u2019re moving forward everyday to ensure Wal-Mart is a strong, relevant company for the future. What has not and will not change is that every part of our business is focused on being even more responsive to our customers.", "Now, Charles will get into the details on our consolidated financial results.", "Charles Holley", "As Mike just said, we were pleased with our strong earning performance and strong cash flow. There\u2019s a fair amount of noise in the fourth quarter results both this year and last year but the bottom line is we had a great performance. Recall that in the fourth quarter last year we had a $382 million settlement of wage and hour class action litigation or $255 million net of tax. Without this settlement our earnings per share for the fourth quarter last year would have been approximately $0.07 per share higher or $1.03 per share.", "This year we have two items impacting EPS for the fourth quarter. First we incurred a $260 million or $162 million net of tax charge or $0.04 per share for several business restructurings that have been announced and will be referenced during today\u2019s call. As you know, these business restructurings were put in place to strengthen our operations, streamline our structures, and allow our businesses to be more responsive to our customers and members. With respect to these restructuring charges, Sam\u2019s Club recorded a pre-tax charge of $174 million, Wal-Mart US a pre-tax charge of $73 million, and unallocated corporate overhead included a pre-tax charge of $13 million.", "Second, we recorded $372 million of net tax benefits primarily from the repatriation of certain non-US earnings that increased US foreign tax credits. This amounted to a benefit of $0.10 per share for our EPS for the fourth quarter. Given these two impacts, a $0.04 charge and a $0.10 benefit, adjusted earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $4.5 billion or $1.17 per share.", "For the full year, adjusted earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $14.2 billion or $3.66 per share. This compares to last year\u2019s adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $13.5 billion or $3.42 per share for last year, or an increase of 7% per share. Despite the noise and the reported EPS, we still exceeded guidance of $1.08 to $1.12 per share for the quarter and $3.57 per share to $3.61 per share for the year by $0.05 per share on our adjusted EPS.", "Now let\u2019s dive a little deeper into the fourth quarter details. Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased 4.6% or almost $5 billion to $112.8 billion. Net sales for the fourth quarter included a currency exchange rate benefit of $1.9 billion. The 13-week US comp store sales without fuel were -1.6%, you\u2019ll hear more details on the Wal-Mart US and Sam\u2019s comps sales from Eduardo and Brian.", "Fourth quarter consolidated operating income was $7.3 billion up 13.8% or $881 million from last year. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income would be $122 million less. Consolidated income from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart increased to $4.7 billion up $3.8 billion or 23.7% from the fourth quarter last year. Our solid results were driven by our focus on expenses and inventory management.", "The US operations continue outstanding success in inventory management which contributed to consolidated inventories being down 3.9% or $1.4 billion for the same time last year. These results coupled with our transformation investments, which I will discuss in a moment, were two of the contributing factors for the consolidated gross margin increase of 35 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year.", "Our excellent inventory management also helped our payables to inventory ratio. Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 91.8% at the end of the fourth quarter which is up 820 basis points from last year. This ratio increased from the prior period due to exchange rate fluctuations and better inventory management across all of our operating segments. We continue to do a great job of managing working capital. We are still in the early phases of focusing on growth, leverage and returns but we have already made significant progress. These priorities will be continued focal points going forward.", "In the fourth quarter, expenses grew at 3.2% on a sales growth of 4.6%. Simply put the company leverage expenses for the fourth quarter. Excluding the pre-tax legal settlement charge of $382 million last year, and the $13 million restructuring charge for this year, unallocated corporate overhead was up 8.8% for the quarter. The story here continues to be the same as in the recent quarters.", "We are continuing to invest in technology and systems which includes the transformation projects. These expenses are running higher than last year but the investments are yielding significant returns. Core corporate costs were up only 1% versus last year. A good example of how these transformation investments are paying off is the progress made in merchandise systems that have helped us better manage mark downs and improve space optimization, labor scheduling, and other processes.", "Lastly, we continue the implementation of SAP throughout the organization. The United Kingdom implementation at ASDA went exceptionally well and we are preparing for North America\u2019s \u201cgo live\u201d in the first half of fiscal 2011. Your key take away here should be that we do not anticipate any significant year over year cost increases for these financial systems.", "On a consolidated basis, membership and other income was down 4.8% or $42 million this quarter compared to last year. For the full year, membership and other income was down 3.6% or $119 million. Wal-Mart US was the main driver of the decrease. Net interest expense was down 4.7% or $23 million over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This was driven by lower average commercial paper balances due to our great management of inventory, along with favorable borrowing rates. Some of these savings were partially offset by lower interest rates on our cash balances.", "The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.4% and our annual tax rate was 32.4% this was due to the net tax benefits primarily from the repatriation of certain non-US earnings that increased the US foreign tax credits. The net tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter will not affect the tax rate going forward so for fiscal 2011 we expect it to be in the range of 34% to 35% although we may see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may affect our rate include changes of our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of international to domestic income.", "Now let me move on to a summary of our full year results for fiscal 2010. Net sales increased 1% or about $4 billion to approximately $405 billion. On a constant currency basis sales would have been $9.8 billion higher or 3.4% over last year. US comp sales without fuel for the 52-week period ending on January 29, 2010, were flat. Consolidated operating income was $24 billion which is up a little more than 5% from last year. On a constant currency basis our consolidated operating income would have grown 7.4% to $24.5 billion. Consolidated operating income grew faster than sales for the year because we were able to grow gross profit by 3.5%. Consolidated expenses grew at 2.7% on the sales increase of 1%.", "Income from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart increased to $14.4 billion up from $13.3 billion or 8.8% from the previous year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we continue to have ample access to credit markets. Debt to total capitalization ratio was 36.9% down from 39.3% last year. We will continue to target a debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 40%. Our strong balance sheet also allows us to spend capital and return income to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.", "CapEx spend in the fourth quarter was $3.3 billion which brought our annual CapEx spend to $12.2 billion. This was lower then our most recent guidance of $12.5 to $13.1 billion because of the timing of CapEx outlays in some of our international countries. We expect fiscal year 2011 CapEx to be the in the range of $13 to $15 billion which we shared at the October meeting for the investment community.", "The company repurchased approximately $2.2 billion of our shares during the quarter and $7.4 billion for the year. This represents 40.3 million and 145.5 million shares respectively. We have approximately $9.2 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase program. We remain committed to share repurchase this year. In addition, we paid $1 billion this quarter and $4.2 billion for the year in dividends. For the full fiscal year, Wal-Mart returned $11.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases 58% more than last year. This would not have been possible without our strong operating results and balance sheet.", "Last year I was proud to announce free cash flow of $11.6 billion. This year I\u2019m even more excited to report free cash flows of $14.1 billion. Our exceptional earnings and working capital management, especially inventory, were the primary drivers of this great result. They were also the drivers of our return on investment which was flat to last year\u2019s return on investment of 19.3%. Tom will further discuss our returns later in the call.", "Now let\u2019s move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Wal-Mart US.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright", "Throughout the last year we have repositioned our business to leverage expenses at a much lower growth rate than in the past. I\u2019m pleased to say that Wal-Mart US profits are growing at a much faster rate than sales. Our results are being driven by improved productivity across entire enterprise. Inventory levels, merchandise flow processes and lower cost of goods reflecting improvements in our new sourcing initiatives equally contributed to our results and were the primary drivers to the company\u2019s strong free cash flow performance.", "Comparable sales for the quarter were below our guidance, although the trend improved consistently throughout the period. Net sales were down 0.5% for the fourth quarter but up 1.1% for the full year to more than $258 billion. On a 4-5-4 basis Wal-Mart US comp sales were down 2% and 0.2% for both the 13-week period and the 52-week period respectively. Most of this decline in comp for the fourth quarter was due to a drop in average ticket which was driven by price deflation. We did experience, however, a slight decrease in traffic during the quarter and as I will discuss later, we\u2019re accelerating the implementation of several project impact initiatives to drive traffic to our stores.", "For the full year, customer traffic was up 1.3% while average ticket declined due to price deflation. It is important to note that on a two year stacked basis the business continued to outperform the market. Our comparable store sales for the past two years were 2.5% for the 52 week period and 0.4% for the 13-weeks ending January 29, 2010.", "As we shared with you earlier this fiscal year, deflation continued to have an especially onerous impact on our comps for the year, dropping by more than 300 basis points from the inflation experienced last year. We cycled peak inflation in November and the trends are now improving. As a matter of fact, in last year\u2019s fourth quarter grocery inflation ran approximately 600 basis points. This year we saw price decline by approximately 90 basis points thus creating a negative year over year swing of approximately 690 basis points.", "In consumer electronics we have had two consecutive years of near double digit deflation. TV sales in units increased in the in high double digits; however, average selling prices were significantly lower than the prior year resulting in a negative impact to both sales and comps for the fourth quarter. The good news is that we did gain market share. We have expanded our high end electronics assortment on both TVs and SLR cameras and these technologies are now available through Walmart.com. In approximately 400 stores we have added high end TVs and new LED technology and this will roll out to all stores by April. On a positive note, we have already seen the slowing of deflation in all major electronics categories.", "Gross margin was up 53 basis points over last year\u2019s fourth quarter and up 73 basis points for the full year. We\u2019re seeing benefits from investments we\u2019ve made in systems for merchandising planning, price optimization, mark down planning, and labor productivity. Because of our better sell through, mark downs are down 6.3% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Favorable inventory shrink results and lower transportation costs also favorably impacted fourth quarter gross profit. We are touching inventory fewer times and turning inventory much faster.", "Clearly, we are managing working capital more efficiently. Beyond these advantages, we are seeing early benefits from our global sourcing initiatives. We believe that we are well positioned to see the cost of goods sold come down, particularly where we have already completed the transition to the Global Merchandise Centers and the recently announced Li & Fung partnership. Global sourcing will be the anchor for cost of goods sold reduction and margin enhancement, while giving us a competitive advantage to further reduce prices.", "For example, in home, supplier rationalization and consolidation in bedding programs led to margin gains on items where we were already very competitive on price. Consolidating production with strategically aligned suppliers led to significant cost savings and margin improvement in several home programs. We achieved a combined cost of goods sold savings of 7.2% in bedding during the fourth quarter.", "Efficient inventory management continues to be part of our success story and is one of the contributors to our free cash flow performance. We reduced total inventory by $1.8 billion in our stores and distribution centers over the last 12 months. Wal-Mart US reduced total inventory by 7.6% on a full year sales increase of 1.1%.", "The Project Impact strategic framework has delivered improved planning; reduced inventory, higher customer satisfaction scores and better merchandise sell through. Our customers are very happy with the improved visibility throughout our stores, because we improved for them the shopping environment. We are pleased with the sales increase in clean Action Alley stores versus comparable control stores and that is why we have decided to accelerate its implementation. The rollout will be completed this first quarter.", "In addition, through our remodeling program, we expect to have more than 50% of the store base remodeled by the end of the third quarter, reflecting the new look and feel laid out in Project Impact.", "We achieved the highest customer satisfaction scores ever this quarter, which confirms to us that customers really like what they are seeing in our stores. Customers are rating us substantially higher on all of our key metrics; faster, friendlier, cleaner stores, coupled with improved merchandise assortment and increased price value perception. We appreciate the hard work of our store associates across the country in helping drive this performance.", "Expense control continues to be a major focus throughout the Wal-Mart organization. We had shared with you previously that healthcare was a large expense headwind in fiscal 2010. Through changes implemented already, healthcare costs started to abate at the end of the fourth quarter, and we do not expect healthcare to be a headwind in this new fiscal year.", "For the first time this year, in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 0.6% reduction in expenses, which is 10 basis points better than the 0.5% decline in sales. Our fourth quarter expenses as a percentage of sales were two basis points lower than last year. However, without the $73 million restructuring charge that Charles talked about earlier, expenses as a percentage of sales, were 12 basis points lower than last year.", "Labor productivity continues to increase and fourth quarter payroll expense was down 10 basis points compared to last year. In addition, indirect expenses such as utilities and store supplies were also down significantly. We also increased our advertising presence significantly this year through higher co-op advertising spending. Remember that the support we receive from suppliers related to co-op advertising is included in gross margin, while the expenses are classified in our SG&A line.", "For the full year, SG&A expense grew by 2.9%, driven mostly by health insurance costs. Labor productivity increased for the full year, and payroll expense for the stores was essentially flat as a percentage of sales with last year, in spite of significant increases in hourly wages.", "Utility costs and store supply expenses declined from the prior year. Excluding expenses related to co-op advertising that are substantially offset in gross margin, SG&A for the fourth quarter declined by 0.7%. Excluding expenses related to co-op advertising for the full year, SG&A increased by 2.6%. Including the restructuring charge, operating income for the fourth quarter was up 5.4% on a sales decrease of 0.5%. Without the restructuring impact, operating income for the quarter rose 6.8% on a sales decrease of 0.5%.", "For the full year, Wal-Mart US delivered its highest profit ever. We had operating income of more than $19.5 billion, which was up 5.2% from the previous year. Again, excluding this year\u2019s restructuring charge; operating income would have been up 5.6% on a sales increase of 1.1%. Other income for the Wal-Mart segment was down from last year for both the fourth quarter and the year. Last year, other income was favorably impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statements.", "Let\u2019s move now to highlights of our various merchandising units for the fourth quarter. As I pointed out earlier, grocery results continue to be heavily impacted by deflation. On a comparable basis to grocery retailers who report comps including food, consumables and pharmacy businesses together, our sales were essentially flat year over year for the fourth quarter. We believe that food deflation pressures will abate by the beginning of the second quarter of this new fiscal year.", "By itself, comps in health and wellness were very solid. Our pharmacy business remains strong and we continue to outperform the competition in this area. Maintenance and wellness categories, such as vitamins and adult nutrition, are generating consistently strong comps. Unit growth in optical has been very positive, driven by new lower price points and our 1-800-Contacts initiative.", "Our Great Value program is fully rolled out across the food and consumables area, and we are seeing solid mid-single digit sales increases, which compare very favorably to the overall grocery flat comp.", "Our customers give us a lot of credit for having expanded the product offering. What the customer now sees is a single point of view across many aisles. Without a doubt, our customers now consider Great Value a brand, rather than a collection of items.", "Hardlines and seasonal sales were soft during the period, as we believe customers reduced discretionary spending on decorative items during the holiday season. Solid merchandise sell through reduced the need for markdowns during the quarter. Cold and snowy weather in late December and January drove strong comp sales in automotive and seasonal hardware.", "In home, we saw continued strength in any product related to eating and entertaining at home, while sales of more discretionary items were softer than last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We are disappointed with our apparel performance for the quarter and for the year, and a full review of our apparel merchandising strategy has been under way now for a few months. We have refocused our efforts on the basics business, which continues to perform well, and we are pleased that our apparel inventory is clean throughout the chain.", "I spoke earlier about the deflation impact on electronics, which is the dominant category within entertainment. In toys, which also are in entertainment, sales of key items such as bicycles, ride-ons, and licensed products were strong for the holidays. Prudent buying decisions also led to reduced end of season markdowns.", "Wal-Mart Financial Services experienced strong fourth quarter net income growth, driven by check cashing and other money services. For the full year, financial services experienced strong double digit income growth from check cashing, the $3 MoneyCard, and the continued expansion of the Wal-Mart MoneyCenter.", "Walmart.com had an outstanding fourth quarter, delivering sales growth over 30% compared to last year. Site traffic and order growth both exceeded the market. It is no small accomplishment that fiscal 2010 traffic to the site exceeded one billion visits. Without a doubt, these results reflect the strength of the Wal-Mart brand across multiple channels.", "Now, let me move on to talk about some of our important business initiatives. We are escalating the next phase of Project Impact to leverage our size and scale to drive greater efficiencies and lower the cost of goods to help accelerate growth. A series of changes within the Wal-Mart US structure has moved us further along in our execution of this plan, while our recently announced global sourcing initiatives will further complement our efforts in this area.", "We have aligned the critical new store decision process by integrating Wal-Mart\u2019s Realty Division with Store Operations and Logistics under the leadership of Bill Simon, our Chief Operating Officer. Additionally, we have redefined responsibilities for our new merchandising execution group.", "This fiscal year, in spite of a challenging environment that led to softer sales, the Wal-Mart US business significantly increased ROI. Gross margin improvements, solid expense management, continued strong inventory management and capital efficiency drove this increase and led to a very strong free cash flow performance.", "The first quarter of fiscal 2011 is now under way. Customers remain cautious, especially in discretionary spending. Personal finances remain the top concern facing consumers in our latest monthly research report. Concern about unemployment remains much higher compared to last year, followed by concerns about the cost of living and the economy.", "I will close the Wal-Mart US discussion with our comp guidance. Our 13-week comp without fuel for the first quarter last year was 3.6%. We are forecasting a comp without fuel, to be flat, plus or minus", "one percent for the 13-week period from January 30 through April 30, 2010.", "Now, let me cover two other areas: global sourcing and global.com. I mentioned earlier some efforts of our global sourcing teams. These are still in the early stages, but we have kicked into high gear our efforts to leverage our size and global footprint to reduce the cost of goods that we import into retail markets around the world, and to strengthen our responsible sourcing initiatives.", "The core of our strategy will be to increase direct sourcing for the company\u2019s private brands that represent more than $100 billion at cost. Our Global Merchandise Centers will drive efficiencies in both general merchandise and food sourcing. In addition, we have signed an exclusive sourcing agreement with Li & Fung to have the company serve as a buying agent for Wal-Mart for general merchandise.", "I\u2019m excited about the opportunities to lower the cost of goods sold, further improve the quality of products, and accelerate the speed at which we can bring innovation to the market. Wal-Mart also remains committed to ensuring that all products are sourced in a responsible, ethical and sustainable manner.", "Before I pass things over to Doug for Wal-Mart International, let me cover our recent announcement on global.com. Earlier, I shared that Walmart.com had a strong fourth quarter. We are redefining roles and responsibilities within our global dot com organization and we are excited about the opportunity to accelerate the growth of Wal-Mart\u2019s multi-channel initiatives around the world. Customers will be able to experience the brand where ever and whenever they want. I will share more on this opportunity in the near future.", "Now, I will pass it to Doug.", "Doug McMillon", "As I end my first year leading the International division, I can\u2019t help but reflect back on the history of this great division. It is amazing how much we have accomplished since expanding the Wal-Mart business outside the United States in the early 90s. And, we have so much more to accomplish in front of us.", "During the past two decades, we\u2019ve expanded our expertise to operate successfully in emerging markets, run smaller stores and tailor various formats to local needs. We have integrated our organization\u2019s culture to reinforce strong customer service in all our markets. We continue to move with even greater speed, and we create freedom within a framework in the markets. In the future, we can strengthen our effectiveness in leveraging our size and expertise. It\u2019s exciting to know that we are successful outside the United States and that we have a lot of upside in future years. As Mike said earlier, all our countries are focused on delivering growth, leverage and returns.", "Our International business is a large part of global Wal-Mart. While acquisitions have played a big role, we have grown our business organically as well. In fact, organic growth has driven well over half of our International revenues. The growth prospects in markets like China and Brazil give us confidence that we can build on the momentum we\u2019ve experienced during the last several years. We\u2019re really pleased with our start up operations in India and see substantial opportunity there as well.", "Along with our long term growth story, it is encouraging to see that a business our size can grow sales 11.9% on a constant currency basis, as we did in the fourth quarter versus last year. We delivered this performance on strong underlying comps, new store growth and the Chilean acquisition, and we grew fourth quarter operating income faster than sales.", "I\u2019m excited about our effort in the area of leverage. Leverage means multiple things to our International operations. Of course, we are focused on leveraging operating expenses. In fact, before the effects of currency exchange rates and our acquisition in Chile, expenses only grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter, and 6.3% for the full year. You\u2019ll hear more about that when we discuss our quarterly results.", "Leverage also means a dedication to using our collective knowledge and best practices around the globe. The Marketing Center of Excellence we created in the UK last spring has improved our ability to communicate price in stores around the world. In addition, as some of you know, we reorganized our division in November to focus on leveraging our size and expertise. We can create additional leverage in process consistency for an area like back room inventory receiving, for example.", "Our efforts in growth and leverage are geared toward increasing the returns on our invested capital. We know we can generate solid returns from our organic growth. This past fiscal year, we added more than 500 new stores. The more predictable returns from organic growth in our established operations like ASDA, Wal-Mex and Wal-Mart Canada allow us to balance our risk profile.", "We are able to follow through on our priorities because of the commitment of our associates around the world. They have helped us deliver another strong quarter in what we all know has been a challenging economic environment in most markets. I\u2019ve attended store manager meetings in India and Central America these past two weeks and I wish you could\u2019ve seen their energy. Our associates and our leaders in International continue to take market share and look for ways to improve.", "Now, as we move to the specific results for the fourth quarter, I want to remind you of the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. As you know, we translate our financial results from various international currencies into US dollars, and the effects of this translation have been a negative factor in our financial results over the past four quarters. The trend in the US dollar has changed, and the translation has been a positive factor in our financial results for this quarter.", "Our results in the fourth quarter of last year through to the third quarter of fiscal 2010 were negatively impacted by the strengthening US dollar in late 2008. International net sales for the fourth quarter were $29.6 billion, an increase of 19.5% from last year. This includes a $1.9 billion positive impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, without the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, sales were up $27.7 billion, or 11.9% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our constant currency sales increase for the fourth quarter is due primarily to strong performances in the United Kingdom and Mexico, new store growth in Brazil and China, and the acquisition of D&S in Chile.", "International\u2019s operating income for the fourth quarter was up 26.9% from last year to $1.9 billion, including $122 million of positive effects from currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, our operating income grew faster than sales at 18.7%. In the fourth quarter, we continued the trend of the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, leveraging our constant currency expenses over last year before the impact of our Chilean acquisition. We maintained our constant currency gross margin while other income was flat as a percentage of sales.", "We\u2019ve also had a great full year performance in fiscal 2010. Net sales for the year were $100.1 billion, up 1.3% after the negative $9.8 billion impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our constant currency basis sales were up 11.2%, and excluding our acquisition of D&S, they were up 7.7%. Operating income for International was $5.0 billion, up 1.9% over last year, after the negative $540 million impact from currency. On a constant currency basis, full year operating income increased 12.8%.", "Before we move to the country details, let\u2019s discuss inventory. We continue to make the focus on inventory a priority and have seen improvement. Overall, we\u2019ve reduced our days on hand since the end of fiscal 2009. The United Kingdom, Mexico, and Canada are performing well.", "Now let\u2019s get into the results for several of our markets. Before we do, let me remind you that we hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis, without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency.", "My congratulations go out to the ASDA team on delivering great performance in fiscal 2010. ASDA had a strong year, ending with its highest ever market share, according to TNS, and operating income growth ahead of sales growth. ASDA\u2019s comp sales growth without fuel was 4.6% for the fourth quarter and 6.0% for the full year, primarily driven by increased customer count, but also by higher average ticket. There was inclement weather in the United Kingdom at Christmas and into the New Year, which forced people to shop closer to home, and affected customer traffic.", "Food continued to provide strong sales growth for ASDA even in the wake of slight price deflation. Both George apparel and general merchandise outperformed their respective markets, with George seasonal merchandise benefiting from cold weather. General merchandise saw significant growth in music, video and games.", "ASDA\u2019s web-based food home shopping service now reaches more than 97% of the population. The non-food internet platform also had strong performance, and customers can now pick up their online purchases in many of our stores.", "Excluding fuel, ASDA\u2019s gross margin was relatively flat for the fourth quarter. ASDA\u2019s profit grew ahead of sales in every quarter in fiscal 2010 and expenses as a percentage of sales declined as the ASDA \"we operate for less\" program continues to deliver efficiencies in stores, distribution centers and the home office.", "On the development front, ASDA opened 13 new stores in fiscal 2010 and relocated another two to larger locations. Of the new stores, three were ASDA Living stores. During the fourth quarter, three new stores were opened and one was relocated. As we enter the new year, ASDA has renewed its focus on EDLP with its largest ever rollback campaign. Given the uncertain economic outlook in the UK, we remain confident that an EDLP strategy remains the best way to help our ASDA customers save money every day.", "In Mexico, Wal-Mex continues to shine with sales growth, gains in market share according to ANTAD, and operational efficiency. In fact, Wal-Mex continues to win on its plan to grow 50% faster than the market and gain market share from both formal and informal markets. At Wal-Mex, fourth quarter sales increased 10.4% over last year, while comparable store sales grew 3.8%. Growth came from price campaigns, electronics, and home lines. Traffic was up 3.8%, with an average ticket essentially flat on price investment. Wal-Mex same store sales for self service formats grew by 3.9% for the full year, while same store sales for the industry, excluding Wal-Mex, declined by 1.1%.", "Wal-Mex reports separately its earnings under Mexican GAAP. We report our worldwide results using US GAAP. Under US GAAP, fourth quarter gross margin was relatively flat to last year, while operating expenses were leveraged down as a result of sustainable low cost operating programs. Operating income growth at Wal-Mex significantly outpaced sales growth. For the year, Wal-Mex sales grew 10.4% and operating income grew even faster at 16.9%. Even with 275 new stores this fiscal year, expenses grew slower than sales at 8.1%.", "Wal-Mart Canada\u2019s fourth quarter sales grew 2.6% over last year, primarily due to the supercentre expansion program. We now operate 84 supercentres in Canada, exceeding our target of 83 for this fiscal year. Fourth quarter comparable store sales in Canada declined 1.1%, impacted by unseasonably mild winter weather, an H1N1 scare, and an overall weak economy. Customer traffic was down 0.5% and average ticket was down 0.6% for the quarter.", "Overall sales growth was led by food and consumables partially offset by softer sales in apparel and general merchandise items. Canada\u2019s comparable store sales for the full year were essentially flat.", "Canada\u2019s fourth quarter gross margin increased slightly, even with the shift in sales to lower margin items. This was the result of improved vendor terms. With well managed expenses, operating income grew faster than sales.", "Moving south to Brazil, fourth quarter sales growth in Brazil was 14.6%, with comparable store sales growth of 5.6%, both in real terms. Overall, customer traffic increased 6.3% and average ticket increased 7.8% in real terms. The best performances came from our cash and carry format, Maxxi, as well as TodoDia, our soft discount format.", "We opened 61 new Brazilian stores in the fourth quarter, bringing our total fiscal 2010 new store count to 91. Despite pressure from our new store growth program, expenses as a percentage of sales improved from last year. Operating income in Brazil grew slower than sales due to margin pressure.", "Now, moving on to Asia, in Japan, overall sales declined 1.7% in the fourth quarter over last year and comparable store sales declined 1.9%. Price investment and deflation had a negative effect on average ticket. Sales and comparable store sales in real terms for the fourth quarter both increased over last year. For the full year, comparable store sales increased 0.3%.", "We launched EDLP at Wal-Mart Japan when our customers needed it most, in an economic slowdown. I am proud to say that we are seeing it take hold as Wal-Mart Japan outperforms the market. As the year progresses, we will continue to expand EDLP across all categories. Food and apparel sales were down, while general merchandise was up due to the EDLP shift, and gross margin was relatively flat. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down significantly from last year, as EDLC focus generates cost savings from labor and productivity initiatives. I\u2019m pleased to say that fourth quarter operating income at Wal-Mart Japan grew faster than sales.", "Rapid growth continued in China, with 14 new stores opened in the fourth quarter. This brings our total China store count to 279. Wal-Mart China\u2019s operations delivered a 4.8% positive comp sales growth over the fourth quarter of last year, driven by price leadership initiatives. Average ticket grew and traffic decreased slightly. Our combined China gross margin was down slightly from the fourth quarter of last year. However, operating income grew faster than sales because of continued successes in controlling expenses with productivity and sustainability initiatives.", "Many of you are aware that our second close on the TrustMart acquisition was scheduled to occur this month. Due to the complex nature of the transaction, Wal-Mart and the selling shareholder of", "TrustMart have mutually agreed to delay the second closing until November 26, 2010 to allow the conclusion of several administrative conditions of the transaction. In the meantime, Wal-Mart and TrustMart continue to focus on their core mission, saving our Chinese customers money so they can live better.", "Whether we\u2019re talking about that first Sam\u2019s Club outside of Mexico City, or our four thousandth International store, a Bompreco Hiper which opened in Brazil during fiscal 2010, our International associates are committed to outperforming the market, focusing on price leadership and enhancing the productivity loop, all so we can help our customers save money and live better. With this as our commitment, I\u2019m confident that we can continue to strengthen our market presence and grow profitability in fiscal 2011.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for the update on Sam\u2019s Club.", "Brian Cornell", "We continue to be pleased with the momentum at Sam\u2019s Club, and I am excited about sharing our results today. However, before I get started, it\u2019s important to note that the results I am discussing today exclude charges related to the 10 club closures, and the recently announced initiatives related to our demo and club membership rep programs.", "Now, let\u2019s move to some highlights for the fourth quarter. We continue to see broad based strong sales performance in fresh and health and wellness categories. More specifically, we had strong performance in numerous categories, including meat, produce, consumables, baby, pharmacy and OTC. I\u2019m also pleased with the recent sales strength of our apparel business, due in part to improved relevance and assortment driven by our merchandising team. Overall comp traffic increased 40 basis points and comp ticket increased 30 basis points in the fourth quarter.", "The eValues program continues to drive strong Plus membership income, as upgrades to Plus continue to significantly outpace last year. I\u2019m very pleased to report that Sam\u2019s Club leveraged operating expenses in Q4 with significant in club efficiencies. At the same time, we continue to see improvement in our membership experience scores. Our focus on expense leverage is expected to continue as we move forward.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the overall financial results. For Q4, total sales for Sam\u2019s Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.4 billion, or an 80 basis point increase over last year. Including fuel, fourth quarter sales were $12.3 billion, which is a 3.8% increase, primarily due to cycling lower fuel prices from last year. Fuel prices in Q4 this year are approximately 44% higher than prices in Q4 last year.", "Club comp sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period increased 70 basis points. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 3.7%. Total Sam\u2019s Club sales for FY10, excluding fuel, increased by 1.7% versus last year to $43.5 billion. Including fuel, sales for FY10 were $46.7 billion, which is a decrease of 40 basis points versus last year, due primarily to lower fuel prices for the full year versus last year. For the fiscal year, comparable club sales, excluding fuel, increased by 1.4%.", "For the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, operating income increased 9.4% versus last year to $479 million. However, we had a number of positive items in Q4 this year, versus a number of negative items in Q4 last year, all that are individually insignificant. Collectively if you exclude these items, operating income growth was only slightly positive for the quarter. Operating income for the full year was $1.7 billion, an increase of 2.4%, versus $1.6 billion last year.", "In addition to the sales strength in fresh, health and wellness and apparel, we continue to see good mix and profit performance in other categories, such as grocery, seasonal and home. A few key categories, including dairy, produce, meat and electronics continue to be impacted by deflation, which has been somewhat offset by strong unit growth. However, we expect that significant food deflation pressures will subside in the first half of the year. Additionally, tobacco continues to positively affect sales versus last year, primarily due to price increases. We\u2019re also pleased at the positive sell through during the holidays on d\u00e9cor and seasonal foods.", "Big-ticket discretionary categories, such as furniture and jewelry, continue to face sales pressure as members have tightened discretionary spending. Business member spending remained stressed during the quarter due to continued pressure on credit availability and the overall economic environment for many of our small business members.", "Inventory management continues to be very positive. We reduced inventory by 9.5% versus last year, although some of the reduction is due to deflation. We actively managed our seasonal transition and, as mentioned, had excellent sell-through on apparel items. We are entering the new fiscal year in a strong inventory position.", "As mentioned earlier, overall comp traffic and ticket were up for the quarter. Advantage comp traffic, excluding fuel, was positive for the 13-week period, while Business comp traffic, excluding fuel, declined slightly. Business average ticket, excluding fuel, increased slightly for the 13-week period, while Advantage average ticket, also excluding fuel, was basically flat.", "Gross margin, excluding the impact of fuel, increased 19 basis points for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandise mix. Including fuel, gross margin for the fourth quarter declined 23 basis points, primarily due to cycling last year\u2019s lower fuel prices.", "As mentioned earlier, I\u2019m very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 4.1% and our club wages were roughly flat in dollar terms versus last year. I\u2019m pleased that we continue to improve our in club efficiencies at the same time we are improving our in club experience.", "Because of our 5S program, which stands for sort, straighten, sanitize, standardize and sustain, we have more organization in our back rooms. This program is translating to less waste, higher associate engagement and higher productivity. I am very appreciative of the hard work of our club associates.", "Membership and other income for the fourth quarter increased slightly versus prior year. The increases continue to be primarily driven by Plus membership upgrades due in part, to eValues. For the full fiscal year, overall membership and other income decreased 1.5%. However, membership income for the year increased by 2.1% versus last year, with most of the improvement due to an accounting adjustment previously discussed in the third quarter.", "Other income, other than membership income, was down approximately 30% for the year. Other income last year was favorably impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statements.", "The eValues program continued to drive strong Plus upgrades, while new sign up performance was down versus last year. Renewal rates across the membership categories continue to be relatively flat, but with more renewals occurring in club versus via mail. Add on Business memberships continued to face headwinds given the challenges that many small business owners continue to face. We will continue to look for innovative ways to drive traffic, renewals and upgrades of existing members.", "We have started the new fiscal year and we remain focused on providing value and quality to our members. The changes we recently announced in the fourth quarter, while difficult, are providing momentum for fiscal 2011. We continue to focus on quality merchandise, membership engagement, club efficiencies and member experience.", "Through valuable member insights, we continue to look to make the best choices, category by category, for both our Advantage members and Business members. We are pleased with the early performance of Project Portfolio and we will continue to monitor and evaluate it to ensure we are improving the member experience and driving returns. We look to continue to leverage our existing member relationships to grow our membership, as well as grow the basket with existing members. We will continue to increase our pace of remodels to better serve our members as we drive growth and returns.", "Despite the continuing challenging environment, we expect comp club sales without fuel, for the current 13-week period from January 30, 2010 through April 30, 2010, to be flat, plus or minus one percent. Our comp sales for this period last year were 4.2% without fuel.", "I will turn the program over to Tom for the report card and guidance discussion.", "Tom Schoewe", "Recall from our third quarter call in November that our quarterly financial report card focuses on growth, leverage and returns.", "First, let\u2019s discuss growth. For the fourth quarter, we started cycling the exchange rate drops of last year and we actually saw a benefit from currency for the first time this year. However, this positive impact was small in comparison to the decrease we experienced for the full fiscal year. Let me point out that fiscal 2010 was an environment that was difficult to forecast, and challenging in which to operate. Deflation across categories such as food and electronics, as well as difficult comparisons, made top line growth tough.", "Net square footage grew by 3.7% since the end of last year, to total square footage of more than 952 million square feet around the world. In fiscal year 2010, we continued our focus on capital efficiency, increasing capital outlays on remodels, building smaller supercenters, and closing 10 underperforming Sam\u2019s Clubs. Although our square footage growth was just a touch shy of our forecast of 4%, we added 34 million net square feet of retail selling space this year. The additional square footage was done completely by organic growth, since we did not have any acquisitions.", "Next topic is leverage. Leverage is without a doubt, one of our strengths this quarter. We made a commitment in October to focus on expenses and in the fourth quarter, we made real progress. The company leveraged expenses in the fourth quarter, which directly reflects the underlying performance of all the segments. Each and every quarter going forward may not rival the results of this quarter, but we have a renewed commitment to the productivity loop in fiscal 2011 and beyond. Eduardo also shared with you that we are seeing early benefits of our global sourcing initiatives. We believe we are well positioned to see the cost of goods sold come down, which will allow us to continue our price leadership and deliver healthy margins.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to the final part of our report card. One of our goals is to provide consistency in pre-tax returns and strong free cash flow. Return on investment from continuing operations for the year ended January 31, 2010 was 19.3%. Let\u2019s pause the tape here, and go back to what I discussed in October. I think my words were something like this, \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the zone of delivering 19% pre-tax returns and we do that consistently, we have a very compelling story. Again, a 19% return on invested capital is very, very attractive.\u201d I committed to you that we planned to keep our returns in the 19% zone, and I am proud to say we achieved this goal for this fiscal year. We actually went one step further than just achieving our goal; we managed to keep ROI flat from last year.", "I\u2019m also extremely proud of our free cash flow generation for the year. We ended the fiscal year with free cash flow of more than $14 billion, an outstanding job in free cash flow. Integral to the free cash flow was strong inventory management across our segments. To demonstrate just how strong this performance was, I\u2019ll ask you to guess when the corporation actually reported an inventory level that was lower than fiscal 2010? The answer, fiscal 2006.", "Since then, the corporation has grown by nearly $100 billion in top line sales and operates today on basically the same inventory level. Inventory directly impacts free cash flow, ROI and it also allows our stores to continue to improve the customer experience they are delivering each and every day. Our focus on growth, leverage, and returns is in its early phases, but you can see, these priorities are already starting to show results.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to guidance. If you\u2019ll recall what Mike said earlier, our comparison to the first quarter last year is tough for our US businesses and we still expect deflation in many categories and markets where we operate. However, we are expecting comparisons to get easier as the year progresses. Taking that into consideration, our guidance for earnings per share for the first quarter is $0.81 to $0.85 and our guidance for the full year is $3.90 to $4.00 a share, both of which are in line with current First Call estimates. Earnings guidance assumes that we will see currency exchange rates basically at the same levels we see today.", "You heard many strong results across our business today. We are confident that our strategies around the world will help further improve top line sales and comps, as we continue to deliver on our mission to save people money so they can live better.", "In closing, I would like to summarize a few key points. We had strong underlying operating performance that allowed us to exceed earnings expectations. Free cash flow generation continues to be an incredibly positive story. In the fourth quarter, we delivered improvements in expense management. We will continue to make it a priority to leverage SG&A throughout the entire organization. Our focus on growth, leverage, and returns to drive shareholder value has never been stronger.", "Thank you for listening today.

Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover the key highlights of our quarterly results. Charles Holley, Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, has the details behind the consolidated financial results.", "Then we go to the operating segment leaders. Eduardo Castro-Wright, Vice Chairman, responsible for Walmart US, Global Sourcing, and Global Dotcom, will share the updates on our largest business segment and sourcing. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International, will cover results for the International segment and our six largest markets by revenue. Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, has results for our warehouse club segment. Tom Schoewe, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will round out the call with an update on SAP, our company\u2019s financial report card, and of course, Q2 earnings guidance.", "But first, let me cover some important changes we have made to our internal management reporting that affects our segment reporting beginning February 1, 2010, the start of our fiscal year. These changes only impact our segment reporting and do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we mentioned in our 2010 annual report, from time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment\u2019s operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations. These revisions generally are made because of alignment changes within the organization or cost allocations designed to drive greater accountability.", "When we make these measurement changes, the segment operating income for each segment affected by the revision is restated for all periods presented to maintain comparability. During the first quarter, we made two significant changes:", "Certain information systems expenses or what we refer to as ISD previously included in unallocated corporate overhead are now being charged to the segment that is driving these costs. This cost allocation will drive greater accountability for our overall technology expenses; it will improve the utilization of our information systems resources; and it will improve productivity.", "As part of our operational realignment, our Puerto Rico operations moved from the International segment to the respective Walmart US and Sam\u2019s Club segments. The Walmart US segment now includes the company\u2019s mass merchant concept in the United States and Puerto Rico, operating primarily under the varying Walmart brands, as well as walmart.com. The Sam\u2019s Club segment now includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States and Puerto Rico, as well as samsclub.com. The International segment now includes the company\u2019s operations outside the United States and Puerto Rico.", "As a result of these two changes, we have restated our segment reporting for all periods presented to reflect the comparability for the realignment and cost allocations.", "Additionally, Walmart US has moved the outdoor living and seasonal portfolios into the Home SBU from Hardlines. The shift was made as of February 1, because the merchandise better aligns from the customer perspective to these SBUs. Effective with the second quarter, the baby category is moving to the Grocery SBU from Apparel. ", "One other item I want to mention is one that did not impact the first quarter, but you will see when we report our results for the second quarter on August 17. As we have previously mentioned, in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we began a staged implementation of our new financial system. The implementation\u2019s first stage was ASDA, our UK subsidiary. The second stage was in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, and was implemented starting May 1, 2010.", "In connection with the second stage of that implementation, and coinciding with the improvements available in our new financial systems, we revised our methodology for valuing inventory under the retail method of inventory accounting.", "Specifically, we've improved our ability to measure inventory at more granular levels. The systems change will better align the accounting for inventory components with how the merchants run their businesses. As a result, the aggregation of certain inventory groups now occurs at lower levels, which produces a different cost valuation for the affected inventory.", "As I mentioned, this change became effective as of May 1, 2010 and will be reflected in the financial statements in the second quarter and for all prior periods presented. This change is not expected to have a significant impact on the results of operations on a going forward basis.", "Now, Mike, let\u2019s get started with our earnings news.", "Mike Duke", "Walmart kicked off fiscal year 2011 with record net sales and EPS for the first quarter. Across the business, our teams delivered on our commitment to the productivity loop, which drives ongoing value for customers and shareholders. We are managing expenses tightly and investing those savings in our everyday price leadership to drive additional growth, leverage and returns.", "Let me get right to the numbers for the total company. Today, we are reporting first quarter earnings per share of $0.88, $0.03 above our own guidance and First Call consensus. Net sales in the first quarter were just over $99 billion, a 6% increase over last year. Operating income for the company was up more than 10% this quarter, with strong relative contributions from each of our operating segments.", "For the second quarter in a row, we leveraged expenses as a company. Every operating segment and corporate leveraged expenses, and we plan to continue delivering on our promise to grow operating expenses slower than sales. The quality of our balance sheet remains world-class and reflects the strength of our underlying businesses.", "Now let me move to the highlights of the individual operating segments. First, Walmart US had a first quarter comp of -1.4%, which was below guidance. Strong management and the structural changes the Walmart US team put in place have enabled it to leverage expenses and deliver strong profitability and returns. Operating income was up 5.6%, growing faster than sales. ", "Eduardo and his team have a good understanding of the various internal and external factors associated with our customer traffic. A number of economic pressures, including gas prices and ongoing concerns about unemployment continue to affect key segments of retail, and this is especially true for Walmart\u2019s core customer.", "There are a number of steps Walmart US is taking to improve top line sales. As you\u2019ll hear from Eduardo in a moment, Walmart US has already taken some actions focused on price leadership and product assortment. It is important to strengthen Walmart\u2019s position as the everyday price leader and to separate ourselves even more from competitors. We are in the process of adding back some merchandise that has been deleted from our assortment. These changes are on a fast track, and the impact will become even more noticeable as we progress through this fiscal year.", "Sam\u2019s Club delivered a 0.7% positive comp sales without fuel and those results are on top of a very strong comp last year. Sam\u2019s also increased operating income more than 9%. The structural changes that Sam\u2019s made earlier this year, along with improved merchandise quality and enhanced membership initiatives contributed to a very good quarter. I believe Sam\u2019s is well positioned for the year ahead.", "International continues to be our fastest growing division, and an increasingly important contributor to our business. Sales grew by more than 21% almost 9% on a constant currency basis exceeding $25 billion in the first quarter, and profit grew even faster than sales. This performance shows the strength of our EDLC-EDLP model around the world. International leveraged operating expenses for the fifth consecutive quarter and most countries continued to improve their inventory management.", "As we look to the future, we\u2019re pleased with the long term opportunities in the emerging markets, especially as economies in those regions improve. We particularly see substantial growth ahead in Mexico, China, and Brazil, and a large part of our capital expenditure budget is committed to those markets.", "We continue to grow. More than 60% of the additional square footage of retail selling space this quarter was within Walmart International. We expect to have even more store openings throughout the company in the second and third quarters.", "A final thought before I close. Whether I visit with customers in our stores or with other CEOs or with leaders in Washington, people want to hear our views on the economy and how businesses can help solve the issues facing consumers today. Our associates appreciate the recognition that Walmart receives for so many contributions around the world.", "Our mission of saving people money so that they can live better gives us a unique ability to understand and truly care for the needs of people. We know this is what our customers expect of us and it\u2019s what we will always expect of ourselves.", "Now, Charles will cover the detailed financial results.  ", "Charles Holley", "For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, our earnings from continuing operations attributable to Walmart were $3.3 billion or $0.88 per share. This is a 9.7% increase from the $3 billion reported in the first quarter last year. Earnings per share this quarter included a $0.02 per share benefit from currency exchange rate translation. We are very pleased that our EPS of $0.88 per share exceeded both our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85 per share and the First Call estimate by $0.03.", "Overall, consolidated net sales increased by 6% to $99.1 billion for the quarter. This was driven by growth from Walmart International and helped by a currency benefit of $2.5 billion. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales would have increased 3.3%.", "The 13-week total US comparable store sales without fuel declined 1.1%. You\u2019ll hear more details on the Walmart US and Sam\u2019s comp sales from Eduardo and Brian.", "First quarter consolidated operating income was $5.8 billion, up 10.6% over last year and up 8.4% on a constant currency basis. Our strong results were driven by great expense management for the quarter. Expenses grew 3.9% on our 6% sales growth.", "As Mike mentioned earlier, the focus on the productivity loop resulted in the company, including our three operating segments and corporate leveraging expenses. We now have leveraged operating expenses for two consecutive quarters.", "Corporate, or unallocated corporate overhead, decreased to $390 million, a decline of 8% from last year. As Carol mentioned earlier, the unallocated corporate overhead now excludes the allocation of various systems costs to the business segments.", "Consolidated gross margin declined eight basis points, due to a change in mix between the segments. Our gross margin of 24.6% at the end of the first quarter is still very healthy. Each of the operating segments will provide more gross margin details later in the call. ", "Inventory grew 3.2% for the company, compared to the end of the first quarter last year, and on a 6% sales increase. Walmart US and Walmart International contributed to the increase in inventory, primarily due to the comparisons versus last year\u2019s significant inventory reduction. You will hear more about this from Eduardo and Doug.", "The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.6%. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2011 to be between 34 and 35%, and we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors, which may impact our rate, include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our US and international operations. Consolidated membership and other income decreased 2.6% to $751 million. The decline was primarily driven by a decrease in other income from Walmart US. ", "The company ended the quarter with negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion versus the positive free cash flow of nearly $1 billion at the same time last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was affected by the comparison to our significant inventory reduction program last year, especially in the Walmart US segment, which decreased inventory to fiscal 2006 levels. The inventory increase at the end of this quarter negatively impacted free cash flow by more than $2 billion. We believe our inventory is in line with our current business needs.", "Our payables to inventory ratio was 88.4% this year, up from 83% at the end of the first quarter last year. This ratio increased due to segment mix and better payables management by the International segment.", "One additional item on the cash flow statement that I\u2019d like to cover is the increase in short-term borrowings. This is primarily due to the SAP implementation. We increased our short-term borrowing of commercial paper to ensure we had a build-up of cash in place for accounts payables due to the systems transition to SAP. We aggregated payments for the week of May 3 into the first day of the week, instead of our normal process of paying throughout the week.", "Return on investment or ROI was 19.1%, up from 18.7% at the same time last year, because of the improvement in adjusted operating income, the timing of our Chilean acquisition and the accrual for the settlement of the 63 wage-and-hour class action lawsuits in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. Tom will further discuss our returns as a part of our financial report card later in the call.", "Our CapEx program this year includes both new stores and remodeling initiatives. Capital expenditures of $2.6 billion were about the same as the first quarter last year. Our balance sheet allows us to follow our strategic priorities and invest where needed. Its strength allows us to maintain a AA credit rating and have excellent access to credit markets. Our debt to total capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 41.4%, slightly up from the 41% last year.", "During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we repurchased a record $3 billion of shares, representing 55.6 million shares. As of April 30, we have approximately $6.2 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase program.", "On March 4, we announced an increase in our dividend to $1.21, an 11% increase over last year. As a result, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends for the quarter. The combination of dividends and share repurchase, or what we returned to shareholders, totaled $4.1 billion this quarter and compares to approximately $2 billion in the same quarter last year.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Eduardo and Walmart US.", "Eduardo Castro-Wright", "Our results for the quarter were mixed. As Mike mentioned previously, the structural changes we put in place earlier this year enabled us to leverage expenses and deliver strong profitability and returns. While operating profit grew significantly faster than sales, top line sales were lower than expected. Net sales were up 1.1% for the first quarter. Comp sales for the period were down 1.4% for the 13-week period. The entire comp decline this quarter was due to traffic, as average ticket was positive.", "There are a number of factors that we believe affected sales and traffic, the economy, deflation, competitive environment, and merchandise assortment. Rising gas prices and high unemployment levels continue to be the most pressing issues for our core customer. Gas prices are up 41% over this time last year. Our in-depth analysis reinforced the fact that there is a strong correlation between store comps and unemployment.", "Stores in areas with the highest increase in unemployment are running approximately 200 basis points lower comps than those with the lowest. We also have noticed changes in the spending patterns of our customer base. For example, the use of assistance-based funds like food stamps, or EBT, for food purchases has increased significantly over last year\u2019s first quarter.", "In our monthly survey of Walmart Moms, they acknowledged that they are spending less, especially on discretionary items and have reduced their number of trips to our stores to offset gas prices. They also have made other changes to their household budgets. In fact, the growth in average ticket this quarter was up more than 200 basis points over the fourth quarter, so customers are stocking up when they are in our stores.", "As expected, deflation abated somewhat during the quarter primarily in food, but it is still a headwind. We expect this to turn around in the near future. In addition, we are seeing increased price competition, primarily in consumable categories. We launched a new rollback initiative with the objective of further increasing our price gaps. ", "This particular rollback campaign will remain in place for at least the next 90 days, as we vigorously defend our price leadership position in the market. We are driving price leadership even more by increasing basket separation. For instance, we announced last week that rollbacks on pantry essentials are 14% lower than the lowest advertised prices across the market. ", "Let me share an example of the significance of this rollback program on a group of key pantry items in consumables and groceries. We selected 12 iconic branded products that consumers recognize. With regular pricing, the items are $44. The lowest advertised price across the market during the last 52 weeks was $34. Now at Walmart, those same items are $29, saving the Walmart customer as much as $15.", "As Mike mentioned earlier, we completed fine-tuning our merchandise assortment strategy to ensure we have the right products for our customers in every store. For example, we added back approximately 300 items in grocery. We continue to react to ongoing feedback from customers to ensure we have the products that they rely on from Walmart.", "Now, let me get back to the remainder of the first quarter financial results. Operating income grew at a faster rate than sales, up 5.6% for the quarter on a 1.1% sales increase. Our gross margin percentage remained flat year over year for the quarter. ", "As I told you before, for the past three years, we have been adjusting our inventory levels and cleaned up our stores, which had a strong positive impact on the customer shopping experience and on operating performance. Inventory grew approximately the same rate as sales in the most recent quarter. We feel that this rate of growth is appropriate for our business, and we will continue to manage our inventory growth as necessary to take care of our customers and drive shareholder value.", "I\u2019m very pleased with the way we managed expenses during the quarter. In a period where sales increased 1.1%, we managed to decrease SG&A expense by 70 basis points. This was driven by a 5.9% increase in labor productivity in our stores. At the same time, we improved our customer experience scores. Group health expenses have moderated from last year and did not affect the quarter expense comparison. We also had an absolute dollar reduction in Walmart US overhead, driven by our organization structural changes.", "In conjunction with our rollback program, we stepped up advertising and marketing efforts. Additionally, we increased our in-store communications to reinforce our price leadership message. As a result, expenses for advertising were up significantly over last year\u2019s first quarter.", "Other income for the Walmart segment was down. Last year, other income was positively impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statements.", "Now, let me cover some trends from our business units. As I said before, food deflation began to moderate during the quarter in areas like dairy, meat, and produce. Comp store sales results were solid compared to the market and we maintained a double-digit price gap versus competition across multiple categories. Snacks, beverages, produce, seafood and dairy all had comp increases, while dry grocery and consumables were soft.", "Comps in health and wellness were solid. Our pharmacy business remains strong, and we continue to outperform the competition in this area. Maintenance and wellness categories, such as vitamins and adult nutrition, are generating consistently strong comps. Let me remind you that in the second quarter, we are up against last year\u2019s headwind of strong sales from H1N1 related products.", "Our entertainment comp sales were negative, as we experienced mixed results by category. We continue to see strong performance in large panel TVs, with new LED technology, in laptops, and in wireless. We also benefited from a favorable DVD release schedule compared to last year. In toys, which also are included in the entertainment business unit, sales of bicycles and ride-on vehicles continue to do very well and exceeded plans. On the other hand, video games and gaming hardware were below expectations across all the gaming brands, due to fewer new releases and the lack of innovation in gaming systems.", "In hardlines, we were disappointed with the performance of our seasonal categories and stationery. Do-it-yourself automotive continues to do well as consumers work to extend the useful life of their vehicles. Our stationery business, which includes books and magazines, was impacted by the anniversary of the Twilight series launch.", "In home, results were mixed overall, with momentum in categories like outdoor living, bedding, home management, and food preparation. Weather drove mixed results on sales, most notably around Valentine\u2019s Day. Seasonal sales continue to occur closer toward the actual event.", "Our apparel performance remained below expectations and continues to be a work in progress for our team. However, some of the bright spots are active wear, licensed apparel and team sports. Our men\u2019s business, which was relatively better than other categories, was driven by active, t-shirts and shorts. Our apparel inventory remains in good shape.", "Walmart Financial Services continues to build on its momentum, with strong results in check cashing, primarily as a result of customers cashing tax refund checks. Sales of the $3 MoneyCard continue to increase. Walmart.com had another outstanding quarter, delivering comp growth of more than 50%, which outpaced the industry averages by a wide margin. Traffic, orders, average order size, and conversion were all up. Our rollback program applies to our online business as well.", "Now, I will briefly update you on some of our business initiatives. The new field organization that we discussed in February was fully operational by the end of this quarter. We expect additional productivity gains from this organization, as well as the benefits that will come from the newly established approach to talent development.", "We remain pleased with the progress of the Project Impact remodels. Merchandise categories including electronics, baby, home, fresh, and seasonal are showing sales improvements with the new layouts. We have previously said that remodeling efforts this year are significantly above historical levels and that we will remodel more than 550 Walmart stores this year. Remodels completed last year are running a positive 200 basis points relative comp sales improvement compared to the rest of the chain.", "We expect the benefit from these remodels to grow in the coming months when the bulk of them will be completed. By the fourth quarter, when the remodel activity stops for the year, we expect this effect to provide noticeable benefits to our results, since half the remodeled stores will be in our comp base.", "We also are pleased with the progress we are making on our global sourcing initiatives and the savings goals we have set for this year are tracking well. Our Global Merchandising Centers have already started to produce reductions in our cost of goods. All of the centers are now in place and are quickly building resources and addressing business needs.", "As expected, we are leveraging our global footprint to reduce costs. We also expect to see improvements in product timelines as the year progresses.", "We remain somewhat cautious about the second quarter. Gas prices and unemployment will continue to influence how our core customers shop with us. On the other hand, the recent changes we made to our assortment, food inflation, and our price leadership through rollbacks should result in a favorable reaction from customers.", "Finally, I\u2019m very proud of the announcement we made last week about our commitment to fight hunger in the United States. Our $2 billion of support through cash and in-kind donations for the \u201cFighting Hunger Together\u201d program will help us reach our goal where no individual in this country should needlessly suffer from hunger.", "I will close out the Walmart US discussion with our comp guidance. Our 13-week comp for the second quarter last year declined 1.5%. We expect a slight improvement from this level and are now forecasting a comp range of -2% to +1% for the 13-week period from May 1 through July 30, 2010.", "Now, we will switch to Doug to hear about our International business.", "Doug McMillon", "We have some strong results to report for Walmart International\u2019s first quarter. As Mike pointed out, we continue our fast-paced growth, increasing both sales and square footage. Because we have revised our reporting structure for Puerto Rico, these numbers exclude Puerto Rico for both this year and last year. We met our goal to grow profit faster than sales, and we continued to leverage expenses.", "I am also proud of the strategic work and accomplishments of our management teams and our associates and colleagues throughout the organization. Our three-pronged strategy remains on track:", "1.\tGrowth by winning locally. The leaders in our markets have the freedom to ensure relevance for our customers and to move with speed.", "2.\tLeverage costs by enabling the productivity loop, we operate for less, buy for less, and sell for less, and leverage the knowledge and expertise of our talent, by sharing and implementing best practices across the entire organization.", "3.\tBalancing returns with growth by managing our portfolio, including thoughtful capital allocation between our emerging and mature markets.", "Our commitment to our \u201csave money, live better\u201d mission has never been stronger throughout our worldwide team. Beyond our price leadership, we also have many initiatives in our markets to help our customers become more sustainable in their own lives, and I\u2019ll cover a few of those examples today. ", "The commitment to the live better side of our mission is being executed in many ways, from how we build our stores and transport products, to how we deliver more environmentally friendly products for our customers. But even more important, our commitment to sustainability also helps reduce our own costs across many areas of the business.", "Let\u2019s move on to our financial results for the first quarter. International net sales for the first quarter were $25 billion, an increase of 21.4% from last year. Sales were positively impacted by $2.5 billion from the relative strengthening of many currencies against the dollar. Sales on a constant currency basis were $22.5 billion, an 8.9% increase over last year\u2019s first quarter.", "Our constant currency sales increase for the first quarter is due primarily to strong underlying performances in Mexico, Canada, Brazil and China. In addition, for reporting purposes, this first quarter includes three full months of our Chilean operations; last year\u2019s first quarter included only two months. As a result, constant currency sales excluding Chile grew 7.5% over last year.", "International\u2019s operating income for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, up 27.8% from last year, and an increase of 13.9% on a constant currency basis. So, operating income grew faster than sales, despite the headwind from a $26 million charge, net of insurance, related to the recent earthquake in Chile. Operating income excluding Chile\u2019s total results grew 22.6% over last year on a constant currency basis when compared to the 13.9% growth, including Chile.", "In the first quarter, we continued the trend of the recent four quarters and leveraged our constant currency expenses. Expense savings and leverage in Japan and China were partially offset by headwinds in other countries. On a constant currency basis, gross margin increased slightly in the first quarter, while other income slightly declined as a percentage of sales. As for inventory, we continue to make good progress, with most of our markets reducing days on hand over last year.", "Now, let\u2019s get into the results for several of our markets. Before we do, let me remind you that we hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis, without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations.", "In the United Kingdom, I was proud to announce that Andy Clarke will be assuming the role of ASDA CEO. Andy will lead the efforts to become an even better food retailer, a broader non-food retailer and a leader in e-commerce. Andy has had a long career at ASDA working first as a store manager, followed by key roles in merchandising, as retail director, and most recently as chief operating officer. Andy not only has a depth of experience, but he has strong leadership skills that will help take our business in the UK to another level.", "For the last five years, we\u2019ve been very fortunate to have Andy Bond as ASDA CEO. Andy will now take his post as Chairman of ASDA\u2019s Executive Committee, helping ensure a smooth leadership transition at ASDA and also working on business opportunities for Walmart in the region.", "In the first quarter, ASDA\u2019s sales grew in the low single digits, while comp sales without fuel declined 0.3%. According to Kantar Worldpanel, retail food sales slowed significantly in the first quarter, and ASDA\u2019s market share dropped slightly in the 12 weeks ending April 19.", "Operating income grew faster than sales. ASDA\u2019s gross margin increased in the first quarter on a mix shift towards higher-margin George and general merchandise. Expenses as a percent of sales were approximately flat to last year. The \u201cWe Operate For Less\u201d cost saving program continues to deliver efficiencies in stores, distribution centers and the home office.", "I know many of you traveled to the UK last month to see our ASDA stores and hear about our strategy for growth, leverage and returns in the UK I'm pleased to report we are beginning to see good progress on many of the strategic initiatives presented.", "On EDLP, ASDA has recently moved to a record price position, lower promotional content and launched the internet-based ASDA Price Guarantee. On George, the launch of the 100 day quality guarantee has helped drive out performance to the market and a record conversion of ASDA shoppers. On e-commerce, online growth was 38% in the quarter, and we recently announced a second dedicated Home Shopping centre and completed the nationwide rollout of the \u201corder online, collect in store\u201d service.", "On new formats, we opened three small-format supermarkets and one new ASDA Living in the quarter. ASDA has recently made good progress towards their strategic goals. I am confident that our strong leadership team, led by Andy Clarke, will continue this progress and deliver positive sales momentum for the remainder of the year.", "Moving on to Mexico. In February, Wal-Mart de Mexico purchased 100% of Walmart Central America, our majority-owned subsidiary with operations in five Central American countries. Through this transaction, we expect to better leverage the Walmex expertise and growth story into our operations in Central America. To be consistent with how Walmex presents comparable information, the discussion here on Mexico represents only the results from Walmex. As a reminder, Walmex reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP, and we report our worldwide results using US GAAP.", "Although consumer spending in Mexico continues to be cautious, our discretionary formats had a solid first quarter. Additionally, Walmex\u2019s improved inventory management has led to higher gross margins in our self-service formats, due to a better inventory mix and fewer markdowns. All of this contributed to first quarter sales growth of approximately 11% and comparable store sales growth of 4.4%.", "All of Walmex\u2019s formats are performing well. Customer count was up 17.2% in total and 5.3% at comparable stores. Walmex same store sales for self-service formats grew by 4.0%. ANTAD\u2019s same store sales for the industry, excluding Walmex, grew by 1.2%.", "First quarter gross margin grew 89 basis points to last year, while operating expenses as a percentage of sales grew 37 basis points. Although not enough to stall the growth in operating income, expenses grew faster than sales at 14.3% as a result of last year\u2019s rapid expansion. With more stores, both depreciation and rent expenses have increased year over year. Operating income growth at Walmex significantly outpaced sales growth at 17.4%.", "Walmex was the country\u2019s only retailer recognized as a socially responsible company by the Mexican Center for Philanthropy and the Alliance for Social Responsibility. Our commitments to reducing energy consumption in our own operations have also been extended to Central America.", "Moving North to Canada. Walmart Canada\u2019s first quarter sales growth, excluding the impact of last year\u2019s closures of six Sam\u2019s Clubs, was 4.9%. This is twice that of the market and represents a record high in market share, according to Statistics Canada data. We attribute a good portion of our sales improvement to the supercentre expansion. We have opened 32 more supercentres in operation than at this quarter last year and we\u2019re on track to add between 35 and 40 supercentres this fiscal year.", "Additionally, our margins are benefiting from last year\u2019s initiatives aimed at improving customer experience and productivity. Now more than ever, we are able to offer Canadian customers more choices in merchandise at the right price.", "First quarter comparable store sales in Canada grew 1%, with customer traffic up 0.4% and average ticket up 0.6%. Overall sales growth was led by hardlines, health and wellness, and food and consumables, partially offset by softer sales in entertainment items. Canada\u2019s first quarter gross margin increased 101 basis points, even with the shift in sales to lower margin items. This was the result of improved private brand sales and improved supplier negotiations.", "Although expenses grew faster than sales at a rate of 6.2% due to timing of new store projects, operating income grew 18.8% much faster than sales on better sales volumes, mix, and supplier terms.", "Our Canada team continues to incorporate sustainability initiatives into our supercentre expansion program, with a roof-top solar system in Ontario and our sustainable distribution center in Balzac, Alberta, which opens this fall. These kinds of initiatives reduce costs, which benefit customers, shareholders and the environment.", "Now, down to Brazil. Earlier I mentioned our strategy of thoughtful allocation of capital in markets like Brazil. Since March of last year, we\u2019ve opened 95 new stores in Brazil, including four in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.", "Brazil\u2019s first quarter sales growth was 16.5% and comparable store sales grew 7.6%, both in real terms. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 2% and average ticket increased 9.6% in real terms. The best performances came from our cash and carry format, supermarkets, as well as our soft discount format.", "Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined slightly, and expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat to last year even after adding a significant number of new stores at the end of last year.", "Now, moving on to Asia. In Japan, overall, sales and comparable store sales both declined by about 1.4% in the first quarter over last year. Comparable store sales in real terms were essentially flat to last year. Price investment and deflation had a negative effect on average ticket, but EDLP continues to increase customer traffic.", "Food and apparel sales were down, while general merchandise was up. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down significantly from last year due to our continued execution of EDLC in support of the EDLP initiative.", "We opened five more stores in China in this first quarter, for a total of 38 new stores in the last 12 months. This brings our total China store count to 284. Total China sales increased 19.6% over the first quarter of last year with comparable store sales growth of 10.6% driven by our price leadership.", "Average ticket grew significantly, but traffic declined as our Chinese customers bought more each trip. Our combined China gross margin was down slightly from the first quarter of last year. However, operating income grew faster than sales, because of investments we made into energy efficiency and labor productivity programs. Our store associates are operating much more efficiently, and we have reduced our logistics expenses as a percentage of sales. China remains a key focus of organic growth and continues to deliver impressive growth and operating income.", "We continue to be very excited and optimistic about the future in India. We have an important business relationship supporting the 60-plus stores owned by Bharti Retail. We also have opened two Best Price Modern Wholesale cash and carry stores in India in the last year. Our associates are also making a difference in the community, educating farmers about improved agricultural prices and giving them incentives for producing a good quality farm product.", "Before we move on to Sam\u2019s, let me mention Chile. As you know, on February 27, more than one million Chilean households were damaged in an 8.8 magnitude earthquake. The rapid response from our associates was amazing; most of our stores were returned quickly to operational status. We announced a $1 million donation to relief efforts within 12 hours of the initial quake, and an additional $1.1 million in cash and in-kind donations have been provided from Walmart operations around the world to non-profits working on relief efforts.", "I\u2019m proud of the efforts of our team in Chile. Their devotion to their community and our Chilean customers is remarkable. I\u2019m also proud of our Walmart teams around the world who have donated their time and money to the relief efforts there. Our people truly do make a difference. ", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for an update on Sam\u2019s Club.", "Brian Cornell", "Before I discuss our detailed financial results, I\u2019d like to start with some highlights of a solid first quarter, as we continue to make progress toward our corporate priorities of growth, leverage and returns.", "We posted positive comp sales for the 13-week period on top of a very strong 4.2% comp last year. We leveraged expenses for the second straight quarter. I\u2019m very proud of what is being accomplished by our dedicated club managers and club associates, as well as our newly formed Innovation team, which is leading our efforts in improving club productivity and expense control.", "Sales in many of our largest categories continue to be strong versus last year, including meat, produce, HBA and pharmacy. Our merchandising team continues to respond to our members\u2019 wishes by adding exciting new products in the club at a great value. eValues continues to drive strong Plus membership penetration. Our new demo program, \u201cTaste and Tips,\u201d is now fully under way in our clubs, and both our members and we are pleased with these changes.", "During the quarter, we also began rolling out our new platform for samsclub.com, which gives members enhanced functionality and speed. We also announced a new field organizational structure, which will place our senior operations executives, along with our regional support teams, in key locations throughout the country. This will bring them even closer to our members, associates and local communities.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the detailed financial results. For the first quarter, net sales for Sam\u2019s Club, excluding fuel, increased to $10.8 billion, which is a 1.3% increase over last year. Including fuel, first quarter sales were $11.7 billion, which is a 4.6% increase versus last year, primarily due to significantly higher fuel prices this year versus last year.", "Fuel prices in the first quarter this year are approximately 41% higher than prices in Q1 last year. Club comp sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period increased 70 basis points. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 3.9%.", "Overall comp ticket was up for the quarter. Advantage and Business comp traffic, excluding fuel, declined for the 13-week period. Both Business and Advantage average ticket, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period.", "Operating income grew at a rate faster than sales this quarter, again as it did last quarter. Q1 operating income increased 9.2% versus last year to $429 million. Gross margin, excluding the impact of fuel, increased five basis points for the first quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandising mix. Including fuel, gross margin for the quarter declined by 26 basis points, primarily due to higher fuel prices this year.", "Inventory management continues to be very positive. We reduced inventory by 6.1% versus last year. While I\u2019m proud of our continuing strong performance, we continue to be mindful of maintaining the right balance between solid inventory management and ensuring we have the right products members want when they shop.", "In addition to the sales strength in many of our fresh and health and wellness categories, we continue to see healthy margin mix and profit performance in other categories, such as apparel, home, seasonal and automotive. During my weekly club visits, I am seeing more and more of our members shopping our seasonal categories, including grills, patio and outdoor plants. ", "We are seeing abatement in broad-based deflation, and, in fact have experienced some inflation in a few categories, like dairy and meat. Additionally, tobacco continues to positively affect sales versus last year, primarily due to industry-wide price increases, although we have now cycled many of the larger price increases from last year.", "On a positive note, we see strength in comp unit sales for items with price points greater than $150, such as jewelry and mattresses, where we offer great brands at exceptional values.", "While we continue to see good market demand for home electronics, our performance was not as strong as we would have liked in the first quarter. We were not positioned optimally from an inventory standpoint due to some industry-wide shortages on flat panels, as well as due to inventory transition to newer technology like LED TVs. We are now in a better position, having the latest technology from LG, Samsung and Vizio and we\u2019re experiencing improved performance at the start of the second quarter.", "While the economic environment is improving somewhat, our business members continue to be pressured by high unemployment and reduced credit availability and this is showing in some of our office products categories.", "We now have 14 Project Portfolio clubs complete and another 49 under construction. As you will recall, Project Portfolio is a test we have under way to increase the assortment of highly productive merchandise categories like fresh and health and wellness in our clubs. We are pleased with some of the early results and will continue to update you on our progress.", "As mentioned earlier, I\u2019m very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 1.4% and our club wages were down versus last year. We also are having excellent expense control in utilities, supplies and maintenance. We also continue to improve our in-club efficiencies at the same time we are improving our in-club experience. Units per labor hour have increased approximately 4% for the first quarter versus last year.", "Beginning in April, in response to the continuing challenging credit environment, we began paying an interchange fee in conjunction with our rewards credit program. Despite this, we were still able to leverage expenses during the quarter. This will continue to be a headwind for us the rest of the fiscal year.", "Membership income, the largest portion of Membership and Other Income, increased 2.5%, driven primarily by Plus membership upgrades. Renewal rates across membership categories are holding steady. Membership and Other Income for the first quarter decreased 3% versus the prior year, due to a decline in other income.", "Add-on Business memberships still face headwinds given the challenges that many small business owners are encountering. We will continue to look for innovative ways to drive traffic, renewals and upgrades of existing members.", "As we are now in the second quarter, we are focused on a number of efforts to drive value for our members and shareholders. We are very focused on maintaining our value perception with members in this very dynamic pricing environment. We continue to increase our reliance on valuable member insights as we make merchandising choices for our members. ", "We will continue to focus on expense leverage, while balancing that with maintaining a positive shopping environment for our members. Finally, but most importantly, we are focused on driving comp club sales and increasing our sales productivity. While we maintain positive comps, we have much more we can and will do.", "Despite the challenging environment, we expect comp club sales without fuel, for the current 13-week period from May 1, 2010 through July 30, 2010, to be flat, plus or minus 1%, versus positive 60 basis point comps last year for the comparable period.", "I will turn the program over to Tom for the report card and guidance discussion. ", "Tom Schoewe", "Before I get into our financial report card and report on growth, leverage, and returns, let me update you on our SAP implementation.", "Recall that for a number of quarters, we have been talking about finance transformation and the implementation of SAP. You know from our discussion last year that the implementation of SAP in the UK went smoothly. On May 1, we began implementing SAP throughout North America, that\u2019s excluding Mexico and Central America and so far we have not encountered any major roadblocks. I\u2019m proud of the team. ", "In fact, by the end of this month, more than 8,000 associates in North America will be using our new system. Our success should be attributed to the time our associate teams have invested to make sure that we do it efficiently, as well as leveraging what we learned from ASDA in the UK.", "As part of our global finance transformation, we have expanded the responsibilities within our existing US-based Walmart financial shared services organization to include Canada and Puerto Rico. Local transactional processes within core finance areas will transition in phases throughout the year.", "Additionally, we recently implemented a centralized contact center for all three countries providing suppliers and associates with an expanded scope of services for financial inquiries. These transformational changes allow us to: ", "Leverage knowledge and resources, ", "Increase efficiency, and ", "Provide cost effective financial processes.", "Now let\u2019s move on to our financial report card to see how well we have done with growth, leverage and returns. First, let\u2019s discuss growth. We grew both sales and square footage for the quarter. We remain on track to grow sales by 4% to 6% and square footage by approximately 4% this year. Net square footage increased to 956 million at the end of the first quarter, which is up 3.6 million square feet from the end of fiscal 2010.", "Because of the large base, the increase is only 0.4%, but an additional 3.6 million square feet is still reasonably significant. Recall that we are implementing many remodel initiatives here in the United States. These remodels account for a significant portion of our capital commitment this year. The company remains on track to spend between $13 and $15 billion in CapEx this year. That\u2019s consistent with what we announced last October.", "Next, leverage. Our renewed focus on the productivity loop mentioned at our investor conference last October has now produced two consecutive quarters of impressive results. Our expense management is a company-wide goal, which reflects the contributions of all the segments. That\u2019s why I am extremely proud of each one of our segments and the corporate office and the fact that they delivered leverage. It\u2019s a remarkable start to the year, which we are planning to continue.", "Leveraging expenses is just one part of the productivity loop. We reduce expenses, lower prices and give more to our customers and ultimately our shareholders. Our leverage story is amazing and by combining that with other global initiatives like sourcing, we are becoming an even stronger company.", "The last part of our financial report card relates to returns.", "First, our free cash flow at the end of this quarter was a -$1.6 billion. Over the last couple of years, our strategic priorities in logistics and the stores have removed a significant amount of inventory. As I mentioned during the fourth quarter call, inventory management was integral to our free cash flow performance last year and a relatively low inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2010. In fact, it\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s been since fiscal 2006. The year-end balance was particularly low here in the United States. We saw that return to more normal levels here in the first quarter.", "Our goal is to provide a consistently high pre-tax return on investment, or ROI. ROI for the 12 months ended April 30 was 19.1% and up from the 18.7% we reported last year. As I mentioned earlier, we increased square footage and continue to invest in the business. Average invested capital, the denominator used to calculate ROI increased 5%. However, with our expense management and our focus on the productivity loop, our trailing 12-month adjusted operating income, or the numerator for ROI has grown by 7.4%. Overall, we are very pleased with this performance.", "Now let\u2019s move on to guidance. Based on our view of the business, and the current US sales environment, which Eduardo discussed in detail, we expect second quarter diluted earnings per share to be between $0.93 and $0.98. This guidance assumes that currency exchange rates remain at today\u2019s levels.", "In closing, I\u2019d like to summarize with a few key points:", "The company increased sales by 6% and added over three million square feet in the quarter.", "The corporation leveraged expenses for a second consecutive quarter, an accomplishment we are proud of here at Walmart.", "All of this resulted in an exceptional pre-tax return, or ROI, of over 19 % at the end of the first quarter.", "Thank you for listening today.

The forward-looking statements made in this call discuss, among other things, management\u2019s forecasts of our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and for all of fiscal year 2011, the assumption underlying those forecasts that currency exchange rates will remain at current levels, management\u2019s forecasts for the comparable store sales for our Walmart U.S. segment and comparable club sales without fuel for our Sam\u2019s Club segment, in each case, for the current 13-week period, management\u2019s expectations as to our anticipated tax rate for fiscal year 2011, quarterly fluctuations in that tax rate and factors that will affect that tax rate, management\u2019s goal for a consistently high return on investment and management\u2019s expectation that the application of a new inventory valuation method will reduce reported earnings per share in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and for how the comparable period comparison will be affected by that application.", "Those forward-looking statements also discuss management\u2019s expectations for consistently strong results in our Sam\u2019s Club segment, our Walmart International segment continuing to be a strong contributor to our growth and overall results, year-over-year pressure from increases in inventory to be seen in the last half of fiscal year 2011, management of inventory to be in line with current business needs, the moderation of our payables to inventory in the second half of fiscal year 2011, future store openings, and construction of our stores in Chicago, Illinois, as well as management\u2019s view that we will not stray from our EDLC-EDLP business model.", "In addition, those statements discuss the expectations of management that our Walmart U.S. segment is on a track for improvement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and will have a more relevant inventory assortment and the right mix of new and innovative products, will broaden and accelerate key sustainability initiatives and will see better comparable sales in its apparel business by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, and that changes being made in the segment\u2019s business will improve its top line sales in the fourth quarter; the segment\u2019s inventory will increase modestly, and the segment\u2019s gross margin rate for the second half of fiscal year 2011 will be essentially flat compared to last year.", "The forward-looking statements also note management\u2019s plan for our Walmart U.S. segment to win in every category which allow customer purchasing decisions to drive the goods to be included in the segment\u2019s assortment.

Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2011. All information for this quarter, including updated unit counts, square footage, and financial metrics is available on our Website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of this call will be available on the Website after 7 AM Central Time on August 17th, 2010. Our executive team is ready to report on our second quarter results of fiscal 2011.", "Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover the key highlights of our quarterly results. Charles Holley, Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, has the details behind our consolidated financials. Then we will go to the operating segments. Bill Simon, our new President and CEO of Walmart U.S., will be followed by Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International, and then we will have Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club.", "Tom Schoewe, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will round out the call with an update on our SAP implementation, our company\u2019s financial report card, and earnings guidance. But first, let me cover some important changes we have made that affect our financials. During the second quarter, we had two changes. As you know, we have been implementing SAP through a staged timetable across our businesses. The implementation\u2019s first stage was ASDA, our U.K. subsidiary. The second stage was in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, and implementation started May 1, 2010. In connection with the second stage of that implementation, and coinciding with the improvements available in our new financial systems, the SAP implementation gave us the ability to improve our methodology for valuing inventory under the retail method of inventory accounting.", "We have improved our ability to measure inventory at more granular levels. The systems change will better align the accounting for inventory components with how the merchants run their businesses. As a result, the aggregation of certain inventory groups now occurs at the lower levels, which produces a different cost valuation for the affected inventory. The retrospective application of this accounting change has impacted both segment and consolidated operating income, as well as consolidated net income.", "Let me share the effect of this change. For fiscal year 2010, adjusted earnings per share are currently $3.73, up $0.01 from the reported $3.72. This change was driven by the impact to cost of sales from the described inventory accounting change. While fiscal 2010 changed by $0.01 of EPS, there are some quarterly fluctuations or volatility in merchandise shipments. For example, you will notice that last year\u2019s second quarter, Walmart reported EPS of $0.88, but today, we are reporting $0.89 per share for the same quarter.", "For the third and fourth quarters, we adjusted EPS by a negative $0.02 and a positive $0.03 respectively. These adjustments impact the operating income of both Walmart U.S. and Walmart International. Financial information for all periods discussed on this call and in our second quarter earnings release today is presented on a comparative basis for the retrospective application of this accounting change. Please note that we have provided detailed explanations in the notes of the press release.", "The Website section titled \u201cfinancial results\u201d contains the comparable financial information for each quarterly reporting period in fiscal 2010 and the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Second, as of this quarter, we have started including Wakana units in our unit count for Walmart Japan. Wakanas are fully owned, stand-alone take-out restaurants generally less than 1,000 square feet. One last reminder, recall that effective with this fiscal year, the operations in Puerto Rico moved from Walmart International to their respective U.S. segments. Comp sales and all information today in Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club reports do include results from Puerto Rico.", "Now, Mike, let\u2019s get started with our earnings news. Mike?", "Mike Duke", "Thank you, Carol. Welcome everyone. I am pleased with our second quarter EPS. Despite a tough sales environment, we managed the business well, delivering on expense leverage through our commitment to the productivity loop. Today, we are reporting EPS of $0.97, within our guidance of $0.93 to $0.98. We consistently grow earnings and this quarter\u2019s EPS grew 9%. More important, we are raising our EPS guidance for the full year to $3.95 to $4.05.", "Net sales for the quarter were up almost 3% to more than $103 billion. Operating income for the company was more than $6 billion, up more than 4%. The company leveraged expenses for the third consecutive quarter. This remains a priority throughout the company. We surpassed 8,500 worldwide units in July, representing various formats. During the quarter, the company added almost 5 million square feet of retail space in our 15 countries. We had significant square footage growth in Mexico and China, and I am pleased that China is on track to reach the 300-store mark in September.", "Our balance sheet remains world-class and reflects the underlying strength of our business. Now let me move on to the highlights of the individual operating segments.", "In Walmart U.S., I am pleased with the speedy leadership transition, with Bill Simon taking the reins of our largest operating segment. Bill is a strong leader who transformed the customer experience in our stores and has continued to drive innovation and improvement throughout the business. As expected, Walmart U.S. had a challenging second quarter. Total sales and operating income were flat to the prior year, with comps declining 1.8%. The top priority for the business remains improving top line sales and customer traffic. I am fully aligned with Bill\u2019s focus on assortment and pricing, and with strengthening our supplier relationships. I am also impressed with the urgency and the speed that he and his team are demonstrating in executing changes in strategy that are making sense for our customers and shareholders. They are moving rapidly to build on the initiatives that worked and adjusting those that have not worked.", "Sam\u2019s Club delivered 1% comp growth, which was at the top of their guidance. They also increased operating income and continue to maintain the right balance of inventory in the clubs. I am pleased with how Brian and the team are focused on membership and merchandise, and I look forward to consistently strong results ahead. Walmart International continues to be an impressive growth engine. Doug and his team grew net sales by 11%, and grew operating income faster than sales. They also leveraged expenses for the sixth quarter in a row.", "We continue to see aggressive growth throughout International. I mentioned Mexico and China earlier, I need to call out Walmart Canada. It opened its 100th supercenter in July. We expect that International will continue to be a strong contributor to our company\u2019s growth and our overall results. In his new role leading global e-commerce and global sourcing, Eduardo Castro-Wright is bringing an even greater intensity to positioning Walmart as the global leader in multi-channel retail. You can expect to hear more about both of these areas at our investor conference in October.", "We will not stray from our EDLC-EDLP business model and we will keep listening to our customers and associates. The slow economic recovery will continue to affect our customers, and we expect they will remain cautious about spending. Walmart remains committed to our mission of saving people money so that they can live better. Our leadership team across the company has never been stronger, or more focused on our priorities of growth, leverage and returns. As we build the Next Generation Walmart, we are confident about the future of our business.", "Now, I will turn it over to Charles for the detailed financial results. Charles?", "Charles Holley", "Thanks Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the company delivered earnings from continuing operations of $3.6 billion, an increase of 3.4% from last year. Walmart reported earnings of $0.97 per share, a 9% increase over last year\u2019s earnings per share of $0.89. Earnings per share included a benefit of approximately $0.01 from currency exchange rate fluctuations and was within our guidance for the quarter of $0.93 to $0.98 per share.", "In addition, we are pleased that we delivered earnings per share for the second quarter above First Call consensus of $0.96. Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to $103 billion for the quarter. Walmart International was the main driver of growth and was helped by a currency benefit of $857 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales increased 2%.", "The 13-week total U.S. comparable store sales without fuel declined 1.4%. You will hear more details on the Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club comp sales from Bill and Brian. Expense management continues to be a positive story. Walmart leveraged expenses for the third consecutive quarter, with expenses growing only 0.6% on a sales growth of 2.8%. The CEOs for the three operating segments will give additional details on their leverage performance.", "Unallocated corporate overhead, which includes corporate expenses, decreased to $416 million. That\u2019s a decline of 15.3% from last year. Although unallocated corporate overhead can have some volatility from quarter to quarter, we continue to manage our core corporate overhead expenses well. The key takeaway is that we were able to leverage those expenses in the second quarter.", "Consolidated gross margin decreased 32 basis points to 24.7%. The decrease was driven by Walmart U.S., which Bill will elaborate on, later in the call. With a gross margin decrease more than offset by expense leverage, the company was able to grow operating income at 4.4% over last year. This growth rate was slightly faster than sales. The company\u2019s operating income of $6.2 billion included a $46 million benefit of currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 3.6%.", "Consolidated membership and other income increased 30 basis points to $710 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2011 to be between 34% and 35%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may impact our rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations.", "Return on investment for the trailing 12 months was 19%, up from 18.4% at the same time last year. Inventory grew 4.3% for the total company, compared to the end of the second quarter last year, and on a 2.8% sales increase. Walmart U.S. and Walmart International contributed to the increase in inventory, primarily due to the comparisons versus last year\u2019s significant inventory reduction and the new Walmart U.S. strategies.", "While inventories were up at the end of the second quarter, payables were up even more. Payables grew at 17.9%, so our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 97.6%, up from 86.3% at the same time last year. The growth in payables is partially related to the growth in inventory, but was impacted to a greater extent by the timing of our payment cycles, pushing the payables balance to unusually high levels.", "Although the increase in inventories over last year continues to pressure free cash flow, the growth in payables this quarter actually overcame that pressure. Walmart ended the first half of fiscal 2011 with free cash flow of $4.5 billion compared to $4.2 billion last year, which is very strong. We will continue to manage our inventory to be in line with our current business needs. However, we expect to see year-over-year pressure from higher inventories in the back half of this year.", "The high payables to inventory ratio should moderate in the second half of the year. Our balance sheet remains strong. We continue to have excellent access to credit markets. Our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 43.2%, slightly up from the 40.4% last year at the same time. The 8.8% increase in our total debt levels, partially offset by lower average borrowing rates, resulted in a slight increase in net interest expense to $485 million.", "Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $3 billion, slightly below last year\u2019s CapEx of $3.1 billion. Year-to-date, Walmart has spent $5.6 billion in capital expenditures. As we shared with you last quarter, we expect a larger number of new store openings in the third quarter. This is the second quarter in a row that Walmart has set a record for share repurchase. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $3 billion or 55.6 million shares, and this quarter, we repurchased $4.1 billion or 81.3 million shares. As you remember, during our shareholders\u2019 meeting on June 4th, we announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which replaced our previous $15 billion plan. Our new authorization has $12.4 billion remaining.", "In the second quarter, Walmart also paid $1.1 billion in dividends. The dividends and share repurchase of $4.1 billion represent $5.2 billion that the company has returned to the shareholders this quarter. Year-to-date, Walmart has returned $9.4 billion to shareholders. We are proud of how we manage our business. The strength of our balance sheet serves as a foundation of our commitment to growth, leverage and returns.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We will start with Bill and Walmart U.S. Bill?", "Bill Simon", "Thank you, Charles. I am honored to lead the Walmart U.S. business and pleased to have the chance to talk to you for a minute about the many challenges and opportunities that we have. We have set out a clear direction for change in our business and believe this will put us on a track to see improvement by the fourth quarter.", "In the second quarter, for the first two months of the quarter, Action Alleys were clear of merchandise and our stores featured many deep rollbacks on price. The deep rollbacks we featured in May and June did improve price impression, but they did not generate the level of top line sales we had hoped for. In July, we put the emphasis back on our core EDLP model. Our associates are helping our customers realize that we are the price leader.", "We also engaged with suppliers to review our assortment to make sure that we had the breadth of inventory that Walmart customers have come to expect. In the coming weeks and months, our assortment will be more relevant to our customers, with the right mix of new and innovative products. We are leveraging our suppliers\u2019 capabilities to help us drive impactful features. And we are restoring thousands of products to our assortment and adding new items. We plan to win in every category and let customers decide through their purchase decisions what to include in our assortment.", "During the past six weeks, we have returned merchandise to Action Alley. Our store managers now have more autonomy to make decisions on what\u2019s right for their customers. We believe it will take some time to see significant changes in comp sales, but we are beginning to see more encouraging traffic trends. Now, I would like to get to the details on the results for the second quarter.", "Net sales were flat for the second quarter. Comp sales for the period declined 1.8% for the 13-week period. Comps did improve by the end of the quarter, and traffic trends improved sequentially during the period. Consistent with the most recent quarters, customers continue to spend cautiously, especially on discretionary products, and the paycheck cycle remains pronounced. Government assistance continues to increase as a form of payment, particularly in regions with higher unemployment and credit now only represents about 15% of our tender.", "Investments in rollbacks in the first two months of the quarter caused a decrease in operating income of 22 basis points, as our gross margin rate was down year-over-year. Walmart U.S. inventory is up 4.4% compared to last year, represented by increased inventory now placed in Action Alley and increased assortment as we focus on solid in-stock levels. The quality of our inventory is increased, and turns are up. Inventory is still low when compared to historical levels. In fact, it\u2019s well below the July 2007 and the July 2008 levels of inventory. And we will continue to monitor it closely in the coming months.", "We continued our trends of expense leverage. In a period where sales were flat, we reduced SG&A expense by 159 basis points, the result of three key factors. First, the store management teams delivered a 2.8% increase in labor productivity, as our scheduling systems continue to match associate hours with customer traffic. Our scores overall in customer satisfaction remain in line with the strong scores we have been consistently reporting.", "Second, our sales shortfall resulted in a decrease in the accrual for the management incentive plan for the first half of the year. And, third, we changed our advertising strategy and brought media expenditures back in line with historical trends. Recall that advertising expenses were up significantly last quarter versus previous periods. We will continue to broaden and accelerate key sustainability initiatives, as they help make us a better company and contribute to expense savings. We particularly focused on energy improvements this quarter.", "Our logistics team continues to deliver more improved fleet efficiency. We are also expanding our use of fuel cell technology to power our stores. Currently, we operate two such fuel cells and we are planning to have as many as 10 by the end of the year. Each fuel cell can generate up to 60% of a typical supercenter\u2019s power needs. Other income for the Walmart segment did not change significantly on a year-over-year basis.", "Now, let me cover some trends affecting sales. In a mostly deflationary food environment, our grocery sales generated slightly positive comp sales. As I mentioned earlier, the more aggressive rollbacks did not generate the overall sales lift we expected, but we did see a sequential improvement in grocery traffic during the quarter. Fresh continues to drive growth. Events like Summer Fruit Fair presented the department with greater authority and helped drive double-digit comp growth for many items in produce, including strawberries. Fresh categories, including dairy and meat, for example, had modest inflation, that was offset by deflation in other areas. We gained significant share this quarter in the soft drinks and snack category, both during and after the rollbacks.", "Health and wellness comp sales were slightly negative, due to higher generic utilization and a shift to 90-day prescriptions. Wellness categories continued to show positive results. Recalls in over-the-counter areas impacted the business negatively. Optical sales continue to show double-digit unit growth, driven by the strength of our low price points for a complete set of glasses. Initial back-to-school sales indicate that customers are shopping more closely to the event. We are driving price messages for school supplies, electronics, apparel and home or dorm items.", "More than 1,000 stores have merchandise specific to college areas, and all stores carry merchandise with logos from local high schools. We are very focused on delivering basics in back-to-school apparel, such as socks, underwear, tees, and school uniforms. Overall apparel comps remain negative. We are focused on improvement in our apparel business and believe we will see better comps by the fourth quarter. Our team is re-emphasizing offerings for our core shopper and including more relevant size offerings in our core brands, Faded Glory, Danskin Now and Just My Size.", "In home, comps were negative. Sales of grills, lawnmowers and patio sets were soft. Indoor categories were mixed, with strength in floor care, appliances and bedding, categories for many student dorm rooms. Sales in baking and decorating were strong, reflecting the ongoing trend of customers cooking and baking at home. Hardlines also had a negative comp. As people look to save on do-it-yourself items for homes and their cars, sales in categories like automotive and hardware did improve.", "Our entertainment comp sales were negative, but we are seeing improvement in back-to-school related areas. We are up against last year\u2019s converter box sales and are pleased with unit sales growth for our larger screen TVs. Comps remain challenged by a decline in average unit retail prices. Our wireless business remains strong behind the popularity of our Straight Talk offering and sales of iPhones.", "Walmart Financial Services experienced double-digit growth, led by continued growth in check cashing and the Walmart Money Card. We are also benefitting from the extension of our Walmart MoneyCard agreements with Green Dot Corporation and GE Money Bank. Walmart.com continues to grow at a rapid pace. Average order size was essentially flat, but traffic increased significantly. Sales of many categories were strong, including health and beauty, home, and entertainment. We moved many large items such as playground equipment and pools to the online channel and saw significant upticks in sales of these products.", "The final group of our 550 store remodels, scheduled for this year, are currently underway. We have improved our remodeling process by reducing the level of disruption for our customers and associates as merchandise is moved around the store. We are very pleased about the decision by the City Council to approve three stores in Chicago. This is part of our goal to build several dozen stores across Chicago during the next several years. With the news of Chicago, we have been contacted by numerous officials in some of the largest U.S. urban markets who want to discuss opportunities with us. This bodes well for our continued growth in the U.S. in the future.", "Now, let\u2019s look forward. As I mentioned earlier, we are confident that the changes we are making will improve the top line sales by the fourth quarter. We are focused on the right assortment, price leadership, driving traffic and delivering an unbeatable customer experience in our stores. We recognize that it will take time to see significant changes in our comps and that the U.S. economy remains challenging. Gas prices and unemployment continue to influence how our core customers shop.", "The 13-week comp for the third quarter period last year was a negative 0.5%. We are forecasting a comp of minus 2% to plus 1% for the 13-week period from July 31st through October 29th, 2010. You may recall that last year, we reduced our inventory in the second quarter by 5.7%, or $1.4 billion, when compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, year-over-year inventory reduction grew to $1.8 billion. It\u2019s clear that last year\u2019s inventory was lean and we are now up against that very low base. As we bring merchandise back to meet the needs of our customers, we expect to see modest increases in inventory in our stores and distribution centers. We are comfortable with the level of inventory growing at or slightly above the same rate of sales. We expect the gross margin rate for the second half of this year to be essentially flat when compared to last year.", "Now, I will pass things over to Doug to hear about our International business. Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks Bill and congratulations on your new role. At our annual shareholders meeting in June, Mike talked about how Walmart\u2019s culture appeals to every country, sets us apart from the competition, and builds trust with our customers. This culture allows our associates to continue driving growth and achieve great results through customer service. I see this first hand in every country I visit, and he couldn\u2019t be more right. Thanks to our associates for another strong quarter.", "I am very pleased with our double-digit sales growth and operating income growth this quarter. International net sales for the second quarter were $25.9 billion, an increase of 11% from last year. This sales increase includes $857 million from the relative strengthening of many currencies against the U.S. dollar. Sales on a constant currency basis were $25 billion, a 7.3% increase over the second quarter of last year.", "On a constant currency basis, sales increased for the second quarter primarily due to a strong underlying performance in Mexico, as well as new store growth in Brazil and China. International\u2019s operating income for the second quarter was $1.3 billion, up 16.8% from last year, and an increase of 12.7% on a constant currency basis. We are very pleased that in a tough environment, we grew operating income faster than sales.", "Excluding the impact of acquisitions, for six consecutive quarters now, we have leveraged our constant currency expenses. With tight expense management, our teams leveraged expenses in almost all of our operating countries, with the exception of slight headwinds in Mexico and Canada.", "On a constant currency basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales increased slightly in the second quarter, while membership and other income declined as a percentage of sales. As for inventory, we continue to make good progress reducing days on hand compared to last year, despite headwinds in China and Japan. Overall, International inventory grew slower than the rate of sales growth.", "Now, let\u2019s get into the results for several of our markets. As a reminder, we hold country management accountable for their results on a constant currency basis, without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations. Let\u2019s change things up a bit for this quarter. Latin America has so much going on there, and we continue to see terrific growth opportunities there, so let\u2019s start with Walmart Mexico and Central America.", "As you know, in February, Wal-Mart Mexico purchased 100% of Walmart Central America, our majority-owned subsidiary with operations in five Central American countries. Until the Central America business has been a part of Walmex for a full year, the discussion here on Mexico will exclude the results of Central America. As a reminder, this discussion is under U.S. GAAP. Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP.", "Walmex\u2019s sales for this quarter were up 9.8%, and comparable store sales were up 2.7%, outperforming the industry. This sales increase is even more impressive when you consider the Easter calendar change and the comparison to higher sales during last year\u2019s H1N1 outbreak. So far this year, Walmex has opened 60 new stores and restaurants. For the second quarter, all of Mexico\u2019s formats have positive comp growth. Customer count was up 3.7% at comparable stores. Average ticket declined 90 basis points on EDLP price investments in the Bodega Aurrera format.", "For the second quarter, Walmex same-store sales for self-service formats grew by 2.2 %, while ANTAD\u2019s same-store sales report for the rest of the industry grew by 1.3%. Second quarter gross margin grew 85 basis points from last year and operating expenses as a percentage of sales grew 45 basis points. Higher utility rates were a large component of expense growth. Despite the expense headwinds, operating income grew at 19.4%, which was faster than sales.", "Now to Brazil, another key market where we continue to grow. Since the second quarter of last year, we opened 93 new stores in Brazil. This includes 7 new stores in the second quarter of this year. Brazil has the greatest number of retail banners of our countries, and that enables us to have formats that meet the local and regional needs of our customers. Brazil\u2019s second quarter sales growth was 13.3% and comparable store sales grew 3.1%, both in real terms.", "Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 5.2% and average ticket increased 9.1% in real terms. Sales at our cash and carry, supermarkets and soft discount formats continue to perform well. A change in sales mix and soft sales in fresh resulted in a 1.1 percentage point decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales. Expenses as a percentage of sales improved even after adding a significant number of new stores at the end of last year.", "Moving to Asia, in Japan, second quarter overall sales and comparable store sales both declined by approximately 0.8 %, the result of continued deflation in grocery and consumables. This performance is on top of a market that had comp declines in the low-single digits. The market data is sourced from the Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI.", "In real terms, comparable store sales in Japan increased by 1.6%, as traffic continues to increase because customers are responding well to EDLP. Food and consumables showed strong performance, while general merchandise and apparel sales were down. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down significantly from last year due to our continued focus on execution of EDLC in support of the EDLP initiative.", "China continues to be a growth market for Walmart. In the second quarter, we opened 7 stores, for a total of 36 new stores in the last 12 months. This brings our total China store count to 291. Sales increased 15.4% over the second quarter of last year, and comparable store sales growth remained strong at 6.1%. Average ticket grew significantly, but traffic declined as customers continue to buy more each trip. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was down slightly from the second quarter of last year on continued price leadership. Operating income grew faster than sales, due to the continued expense savings from labor productivity programs and energy efficiency initiatives.", "We continue to be pleased with our support of Bharti Retail and the progress in India. Bharti Retail continues to grow and now operates 72 supermarkets and 6 compact hypermarkets, with great sales growth. Our two cash and carry stores are performing well, and we have recently announced the opening of our third store. In the United Kingdom, ASDA continues to make good progress towards their strategic goals. In May, ADSA announced its intent to acquire the Netto Food stores located in the U.K. These stores will bring many great new locations and a platform for smaller store formats throughout the United Kingdom. Of course, the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close later this year.", "In the second quarter, ASDA\u2019s sales grew in the low-single digits, while comp sales without fuel declined 40 basis points. According to Kantar Worldpanel, ASDA\u2019s market share dropped slightly in the 12 weeks ending July 11th. ASDA\u2019s gross margin as a percentage of sales increased in the second quarter on a mix shift towards higher margin George and general merchandise. George had a particularly strong quarter, with strong sales of World Cup related merchandise and our 100-day quality guarantee. Customers continue to respond well to our guarantee, and we continue to see this as a unique competitive advantage in the market. Expenses as a percentage of sales declined slightly as the ASDA \u2018we operate for less\u2019 program continues to deliver efficiencies. As a result, operating income grew faster than sales.", "On e-commerce, ASDA\u2019s second dedicated home shopping center will open next month and will provide enhanced coverage in an area of low market share for ASDA. ASDA\u2019s customers are facing recently announced tax increases and cuts in government spending. These are likely to cause our U.K. customers to face a challenging 12 to 18 months. Recent price reductions on high volume staples such as milk and eggs and the guaranteed lowest basket price show ASDA\u2019s commitment to provide the value our customers expect and trust us to deliver.", "And finally Canada, Walmart Canada\u2019s second quarter sales growth was 4.2%. The growth was largely due to the supercenter expansion program and a strong category performance in existing stores. As Mike said, we now have 100 supercenters in Canada, 40 more than this time last year. Comparable sales in Canada were flat to last year. Traffic was down 40 basis points and ticket up 40 basis points in the second quarter as customers continue to be cautious. Sales in Western Canada have been softer than both Ontario and Quebec. Growth was led by sales of food, consumables and health and wellness, partially offset by softer sales in entertainment and hardlines. Canada\u2019s gross margin rate increased over last year, due to better inventory management, a reduction in shrinkage and improved purchasing.", "Canada\u2019s expenses grew faster than sales primarily due to our bank startup costs and an increase in utility rates. Despite the increase in expenses, Canada\u2019s second quarter operating income grew faster than sales. In closing, our associates are merchants first. In more than 4,200 International stores, we remain focused on the customer and executing on the basics of price leadership, assortment and in-stock. Every day, our associates strive to provide a great customer experience and earn trust.", "I am encouraged by the progress we are making at leveraging Walmart knowledge globally to improve our customer proposition and increase shareholder value. Now, I will turn it over to Brian for an update on Sam\u2019s Club. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you Doug. At Sam\u2019s Club, our strategy remains focused on taking care of our members and staying true to our brand promise of \u2018Savings Made Simple\u2019. To fulfill that brand promise, we focus every day on making the right merchandise choices, enhancing the shopping experience and engaging our members in different ways.", "Before getting into all of the financial details, I want to share some of the key highlights about our business. First, we are reporting a comp sales increase of 1%, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period, which I am pleased to say, was at the top of our guidance. We are proud to recognize the accomplishments of our dedicated managers and associates who lead our efforts in improving club productivity and expense control on a daily basis. Excluding the impact of the interchange fee related to the Sam\u2019s rewards credit program, which we detailed in last quarter\u2019s call, we leveraged expenses for the third straight quarter.", "We are improving our shopping experience with innovation and technology. Early last week, we announced plans to upgrade all clubs to WiFi by the end of the year. Our members will benefit by having the use of their smart phones while shopping. And our associates will be able to demo new IPTVs and other networked devices on a real-time basis.", "In addition, last week, we announced that we will carry the iPhone 4 in our clubs. We have stepped up our efforts to bring the most sought after brands into our clubs sooner and more often, relying on member insights to make the most relevant merchandising choices for Sam\u2019s members. Growth continues to be a priority, and our team welcomed a new club that opened last month in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, marking our tenth club on the island. We also have another grand opening next week in Nicholasville, Kentucky.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the detailed financial results. For the second quarter, net sales for Sam\u2019s Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.4 billion, which is a 60 basis point increase over last year. Including fuel, second quarter sales were $12.5 billion, which is a 2.2% increase versus last year, primarily due to higher fuel prices this year compared to last year. Fuel prices in the second quarter this year were approximately 11.3% higher than last year.", "Club comp sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period increased 1%. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 2.6%. Comp ticket increased for the 13-week period, with both Business and Advantage average ticket, excluding fuel, increasing. Comp traffic, excluding fuel, declined for the 13-week period. Sales in many of our largest fresh and health and wellness categories continue to be positive, including produce, meat, snacks, baby care and pharmacy. We also are seeing an uptick in discretionary spending via positive performance in categories such as mattresses, jewelry, domestics and house wares. The momentum in mattress sales is complemented by the rollout of our new delivery program.", "Sales in apparel continue to improve, the result of adding several key brands that are resonating with our members. Seasonal categories such as grills, patio, seasonal decor were also successful during the quarter. Additionally, tobacco sales continue to be very positive. Overall, broad-based deflation appears to be abating, and we have even begun to experience some inflation in a few categories like meat and dairy. However, we continued to see pricing pressure in the second quarter in some laundry and paper categories.", "In the second quarter, consistent with many key competitors, we continued to have negative trends in our entertainment and technology business. The industry has experienced reduced promotional activity; however, we have seen improvement in this business over the past few weeks.", "Our second quarter operating income increased 2.4% versus last year to $428 million, including a $16 million contribution from fuel profit. Excluding fuel, operating income decreased by 1.7%. Gross margin rates, excluding fuel, increased by 15 basis points during the second quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandising mix towards higher margin fresh products. Including fuel, gross margin rate for the quarter increased by 8 basis points. Inventory increased slightly by 80 basis points versus last year.", "We have been strategically aggressive in key events like \u2018back-to-school\u2019 and \u2018back-to-college\u2019 and we anticipate a solid season. We continue to be mindful of maintaining the right balance between solid inventory management and ensuring we have the right products members want when they shop our clubs.", "We have completed work on 33 of what we call \u2018pure Project Portfolio clubs\u2019, with another 16 under construction. In addition, we have completed or are completing approximately another 70 scheduled remodels, in which we have added various aspects of Project Portfolio as part of the remodel. Stated another way, \u2018pure Portfolio\u2019 clubs or clubs in which no other material remodel activity was conducted. As a reminder, the main focus of Project Portfolio is to increase the assortment of highly productive merchandise categories like fresh and health and wellness. We continue to be pleased with the direction of the test and are making adjustments as we move forward. Overall, our members are pleased with the key changes.", "Expenses grew 2.7% versus last year, driven by increases in credit card interchange fees, remodel and marketing expenses. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 2.7% and our club wages were basically flat versus last year. Units per labor hour increased approximately 1.4% for the second quarter versus last year. I am very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency.", "Membership and other income for the second quarter increased by 1.2% versus the prior year. Membership income, the primary driver, increased 80 basis points versus last year, mainly due to Plus membership upgrades. In July, we hosted a \u2018stock- up\u2019 event to drive increases in membership and traffic, and we are pleased with the incremental sign-ups. Our Plus membership, with eValues and other new benefits, such as earlier shopping hours, continues to show good momentum.", "Add-on Business memberships still face headwinds, given the challenges that many small business owners are encountering. We will continue to look for innovative ways to drive traffic, renewals and upgrades of existing members. In May, we launched a pilot program in an effort to help business members get access to the credit and capital they need to run and grow their businesses. I am pleased with the positive response from our small business members to these initiatives.", "The third quarter is underway and we are focused on a number of efforts to drive even greater value for our members and shareholders in accordance with our corporate priorities of growth, leverage and returns. The Sam\u2019s Club team is keenly focused on top line sales growth, driving comps and productivity.", "From August 6th through the 8th, we hosted an \u2018Open House\u2019 which allowed non-members to shop our clubs without incurring a standard surcharge on their purchases. This event introduced prospective members to the value proposition behind Sam\u2019s. We were very pleased with the results from both the sales and membership perspective.", "On a final note, last week, Todd Harbaugh was appointed Executive Vice President of Operations upon the announcement of Nacho Perez\u2019s [ph] retirement. Todd joined Walmart in October of 1990. During his 20-year career, he served in a variety of positions and most recently held the role of Senior Vice President of Integration, Planning and Communications at Sam\u2019s Club. We wish Nacho well, and we are pleased to have great team depth, which is demonstrated by Todd\u2019s appointment.", "The current economy remains challenging for both Business and Advantage members. However, we have seen sales momentum over the past few weeks. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from July 31st, 2010 through October 29th, 2010, to range from flat to positive 2%.", "I will turn the program over to Tom for the report card and guidance discussion. Tom?", "Tom Schoewe", "Thanks Brian. Like last quarter, before I get into our financial report card and discuss growth, leverage and returns, I would like to give you a quick update on our SAP implementation.", "We shared with you previously that on May 1st, we began implementing SAP throughout North America, that would exclude Mexico and its Central America subsidiary. This implementation has now been up and running for three months. As you would expect with any major system initiative, we have experienced some challenges along the way, but I am proud to say that nothing prevented us from successfully completing our monthly close processes during the quarter, so we really feel good about the numbers, the integrity of the numbers. Most of our challenges have been in the area of change management, which are being addressed, since the new system is performing as designed.", "We will continue to leverage what we have learned as implementation in other countries continues. We plan to go live in Japan later this year and have also started work in Mexico. Now let\u2019s move on to our financial report card to see how well we have done with growth, leverage and returns. First, let\u2019s discuss growth. For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we grew both our square footage and sales. Sales grew almost 3% for the quarter, mainly driven by Walmart International, which you heard about earlier in this call.", "Net square footage of retail space increased by approximately 5 million square feet to 961 million square feet at the end of the second quarter. So far this year, we have added 8.6 million square feet, in an effort to reach more people, so that they can save money and live better. We continue to feel good about our growth prospects across the company. As always, we will update both CapEx forecasts and square footage goals for this year and next at the October meeting for the investment community.", "Next is a discussion on leverage. Our commitment to the productivity loop and every day low costs has now resulted in three consecutive quarters of expense leverage, and obviously this has been a significant contributor to our bottom line results. We are really proud of our progress here.", "Finally, let\u2019s chat about returns. As I mentioned in the first quarter, inventories at the end of last fiscal year were relatively low for Walmart. This \u2018starting point\u2019 obviously will impact free cash flow all year, as it did for the second quarter. The difference here is that in the second quarter, the accounts payable increase positively affected free cash flow. Earlier in the call, Charles covered these details. Having said all that, our free cash flow through the first six months of this year was $4.5 billion, and compares to $4.2 billion we reported for the same period last year.", "Our goal for return on investment is to provide a consistently high return. Return on investment for the 12 months ended July 31st was 19%, up from the 18.4% last year. The story behind ROI is really driven by strong operating performance. As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, we increased square footage and continue to invest in the business. Average invested capital or the denominator used to calculated ROI increased 5%. However, our continued focus on the productivity loop has produced strong operating results. The trailing 12-month adjusted operating income or the numerator for ROI has grown by almost 9%. Overall, we are very pleased with this performance in return on investment.", "Now let\u2019s move on to guidance. Based on our view of the business, and the current U.S. sales environment, we expect third quarter diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 to be between $0.87 and $0.91 per share. Please remember what we discussed earlier in the call and the fact that our new retail inventory valuation methodology will reduce last year\u2019s third quarter reported earnings per share. In addition, there will be an offset to that reduction in Q3, with an improvement to the restated fourth quarter earnings from last year. You might want to keep this in mind as you refine your model.", "With all that in mind, and based on the underlying strength of our business, we are raising our full-year EPS guidance to a range of $3.95 a share to $4.05. This guidance assumes that currency exchange rates remain at today\u2019s levels. In closing, I would like to summarize with just a few key points. We delivered strong EPS this quarter, ahead of First Call consensus. Expense leverage was the main driver of the bottom line this quarter and will continue to be a strategic priority. ROI is extremely healthy and above the prior year as we continue to deliver solid operating performance. And finally, Walmart has produced strong and consistent earnings growth, and solid returns to shareholders, both in the form of share repurchase and dividends.", "Thank you for listening today.

And then, rounding out our operating segment discussion will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, who will discuss the results for our membership warehouse segment. Finally, in his last earnings call as CFO, Tom Schoewe will cover our corporate financial report card and our Q4 earnings guidance, as well as some insights into our updated full-year guidance. ", "Before we start to discuss our performance for the quarter, let me cover some important financial information. First, I\u2019d like to remind you of the inventory accounting change that we made in the second quarter. Due to the retrospective application of that accounting change, financial comparisons for this third quarter and going forward until the first quarter of FY12 will be compared against the financials as adjusted for this change. For example, last year in Q3, we originally reported earnings per share of $0.84, which was adjusted to $0.82 per share, because of this accounting change. The income statements, balance sheets, ROI and segment P&L information with the adjustments for all quarters of fiscal year 2010 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 are available on our website on the quarterly financials page.", "Second, for the past two and a half fiscal years, Wal-Mart U.S. has had six strategic merchandise units or SBUs and we\u2019ve been reporting on them in these calls. Those units or SBUs were grocery, entertainment, hardlines, apparel, health and wellness and home. Wal-Mart U.S. also offers financial services and products outside of these SBUs. The new merchandising structure, which goes into effect with our third quarter report today, aligns similar categories and allows us to be even more competitive in each customer channel, improving how we target and how we localize our merchandise. Let me cover the makeup of each of these four merchandise units. ", "First is general merchandise or GM for short, which includes toys, seasonal, hardlines, and entertainment. Seasonal includes merchandise for events such as Halloween and Christmas, as well as greeting cards and celebrations. Hardlines includes hardware, do-it-yourself categories, fabrics and crafts, automotive and sporting goods. Entertainment includes electronics, music, computers, cameras, photo services and cellular. Second is food which includes all fresh products, snacks and beverages and dry foods. Next is softlines, which covers apparel, jewelry, accessories and shoes, as well as home - both indoor and outdoor living. And last is consumables and health and wellness. Consumables include personal care, beauty, paper, chemicals, baby and pets. Health and wellness covers Rx, over-the-counter medicines or OTC, and optical. ", "Our dotcom sales for each merchandise area are included in each respective category. So, for example, toy sales from Wal-Mart.com are included in the general merchandise unit. ", "Last, this quarter we had a tax benefit of $191 million, which is approximately $0.05 per share, related to favorable adjustments to current transfer pricing policies after negotiations with a foreign tax jurisdiction. ", "Please bear this information in mind as you listen to the rest of the call. Now Mike, let\u2019s get started with our Q3 results. Mike? ", "Mike Duke", "Thank you, Carol, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. In the third quarter, Wal-Mart performed well, and we have solid results to report today. So, let\u2019s get right into them. ", "Third quarter earnings per share were $0.95, compared to an adjusted $0.82 last year. Our results included a tax benefit of $191 million, or approximately $0.05 per share, which you will hear more about later. ", "We are pleased with our EPS growth this quarter. Net sales for the third quarter increased 2.6% to $101.2 billion. ", "The company leveraged expenses for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I\u2019ve said consistently, the productivity loop is here to stay. We will drive everyday low cost to deliver on every day low price. It\u2019s ingrained in our business and it\u2019s how we operate around the world. ", "Consolidated operating income was $5.6 billion, up 3.1% from last year. We also added almost 10 million square feet of selling space through 117 new units this quarter. International remains a key to our future growth. And, I continue to be impressed with their performance. Sales of Wal-Mart International were up 9.3% and operating income grew faster than sales. We continued to deliver stable return on investment. ", "And, we have an important takeaway for the fourth quarter. We are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to reflect the tax benefit from the third quarter and the ongoing underlying strength of our business. Tom will cover it in more detail at the end of the call. ", "Now for the highlights of the individual operating segments.", "Our Wal-Mart U.S. business is on the right track. Comp sales were within guidance for the third quarter. Operating income grew faster than sales, and Bill and his team delivered expense leverage. The U.S. team is taking the right steps to position our stores for the fourth quarter and for next year. I\u2019m happy to see the response from our customers when I walk stores. They like our progress on merchandise assortment. ", "I might add, too, that just last week, when I visited stores here in the U.S., I loved the positive energy from our associates. Our associates are really excited about the changes in recent months. ", "Also, I really like our holiday preparations. We know this is a time of year when customers count on us more than ever. Our own surveys and the reports on the recent U.S. election cycle indicate that financial uncertainty still weighs heavily on everyday Americans, including many of our core customers. The paycheck cycle is still pronounced for these customers. Whether it\u2019s for everyday groceries, or for discretionary items, Wal-Mart U.S. will be the price leader throughout the holidays, and I remain confident about improving comp trends in the fourth quarter. ", "Moving to Wal-Mart International. Doug and I recently had the opportunity to walk our stores, and visit with customers, associates and government leaders on an extended trip throughout Asia. So, let me share just a few takeaways from the trip. ", "It\u2019s clear that our business model is well-suited to this part of the world, just as it is in other markets around the world. We continue to see tremendous upside in China. In Japan, I\u2019m really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making and Doug will share more specifics on our success in Wal-Mart Japan. In India, we opened our fourth BestPrice Modern Wholesale cash and carry unit last week, and the country offers tremendous growth opportunities for Wal-Mart. We\u2019re optimistic about the response from the government of India about making changes on foreign direct investment in the country.", "We\u2019re seeing operating income strength in more established markets like Mexico, Canada and the U.K. ", "More than ever, I believe Wal-Mart is positioned to deliver our unique benefits to consumers and to seize growth in all of our markets. ", "Sam\u2019s Club just has great momentum with the positive comp growth Brian and his team posted for the third quarter. Sam\u2019s has really stepped up the quality of our merchandise and made our clubs more relevant to members. That focus has paid off, and it\u2019s delivered strong sales for the third quarter. I also like the creativity and the enthusiasm that Sam\u2019s Club is using to drive membership sales more aggressively and their commitment to improving productivity. ", "Throughout the company, we are striking the right balance between managing the business for the short term and producing sustainable growth for our shareholders. Our focus on driving growth, leverage and returns is positioning us to succeed in the fourth quarter and for the long term. ", "Before I close, on behalf of our 2.1 million Wal-Mart associates around the world, we extend our heartfelt wishes for a happy holiday season and a wonderful start to the New Year in 2011. ", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charles for the detailed financial results. Charles?", "Charles Holley", "Thanks Mike. For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the company delivered earnings from continuing operations of $3.4 billion, an increase of 9% from last year. ", "Earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.95, compared to last year\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $0.82. Earnings per share included a tax benefit of $191 million, which is approximately $0.05 per share, due to the favorable adjustments from negotiation of transfer pricing policies with a foreign tax jurisdiction during the third quarter. Currency exchange rate fluctuations were not a significant factor for earnings this quarter. Excluding the aforementioned tax benefit, earnings per share for our underlying business were within our guidance for the quarter of $0.87 to $0.91 per share. ", "Consolidated net sales increased 2.6% to $101.2 billion for the quarter. Wal-Mart International was the main driver of the sales growth and was helped by a currency exchange rate benefit of $349 million, compared to a negative impact of $2.6 billion last year. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales increased 2.3%. ", "The 13-week total U.S. comparable store sales, without fuel, decreased 0.7%. You will hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club comp sales from Bill and Brian.", "Expense management is once again a positive story. The company leveraged expenses for the fourth consecutive quarter, with expenses growing only 2.1% on a sales growth of 2.6%. The CEOs for the three operating segments will give additional details on their expense performance. ", "Unallocated corporate overhead, which includes corporate expenses, grew to $378 million. That\u2019s an increase of 8.3% from last year. While core corporate overhead expenses actually decreased 0.5% for the quarter, we did experience volatility in some unallocated foreign currency derivative mark-to-market positions quarter over quarter that is the primary driver of the increase. Although unallocated corporate overhead can have some volatility from quarter to quarter, we continue to closely watch our spending in this area. ", "Consolidated gross margin declined 6 basis points to 25%. A decline in International\u2019s gross margin was offset by a slight increase in Wal-Mart U.S. expense leverage. The company grew operating income at 3.1% over last year, meeting our goal of growing operating income faster than sales. The company\u2019s operating income of $5.6 billion included an $11 million benefit of currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 2.9%. ", "Consolidated membership and other income increased 1% to $713 million for the quarter. Excluding last year\u2019s favorable adjustment in the Sam\u2019s Club segment, consolidated membership and other income would have been up 3.2%.", "The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.5%. Due to the favorable adjustment discussed earlier, we now expect the tax rate for fiscal year 2011 to be between 33% and 34%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuation. ", "Factors which may affect our tax rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax matters, settlements of tax contingencies and the mix of income among our U.S. and international operations.", "Year-over-year consolidated inventory grew 7.7% on a 3.8% year-to-date sales increase. All three segments contributed to the growth in inventory, with the primary driver being Wal-Mart U.S. Bill will cover more details in the Wal-Mart discussion. ", "Payables grew faster than inventories. Payables increased 17.1%, so our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 88.2%, up from 81.1% at the same time last year. A portion of this increase is driven by Wal-Mart U.S., as the segment had an earlier than normal seasonal build-up of inventories for the holidays. International was also a factor this quarter, as new store growth and currency exchange rate factors contributed to the increase in both payables and inventory. Although the year-over-year growth in inventory continues to pressure free cash flow, the growth in payables partially offset that pressure. ", "Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, our capital spend was ahead of this time last year. Wal-Mart ended the third quarter of fiscal 2011 with free cash flow of $2.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion last year for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. We will continue to manage our inventory to be in line with our current business needs. However, we expect to see year-over-year pressure from higher inventories in the fourth quarter of this year when compared to the prior year. ", "Our balance sheet remains strong. We continue to have excellent access to credit markets. You will recall that in October we went to the market with a $5 billion debt offering. At the time of issuance, two of the four tranches, the three-year and five-year bonds, were issued at the lowest corporate rates on record.", "Our debt to total capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 46.4%, up from the 41.3% last year at the same time. The increase in this ratio was due to the growth in the long-term debt. The 19.9% increase in our total debt levels, partially offset by lower average borrowing rates, were the primary factors in an 8.6% increase in net interest expense totaling $516 million.", "Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $3.8 billion, bringing our year-to-date spend to $9.3 billion. We expect to spend between $13 billion and $14 billion in capital expenditures for the fiscal year, in line with our guidance outlined at the October 13 investor meeting. ", "Our return on investment for the trailing 12 months was 18.6%, up from 18.4% at the same time last year, due to continued expense leverage. ", "In this quarter, we repurchased 73.4 million shares for $3.9 billion. As you remember, on June 4, 2010, we announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which replaced our previous authorization of $15 billion. We now have $8.5 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, Wal-Mart has returned $14.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. ", "We are extremely proud of how we\u2019ve leveraged expenses and grown shareholder value in this tough environment. Our balance sheet and credit rating are strong and healthy. We remain focused on growth, leverage and returns.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to a discussion of our operating segments. As usual, we\u2019ll start with Bill and Wal-Mart U.S. Bill?", "Bill Simon", "Thank you, Charles. Wal-Mart U.S. made very good progress during the third quarter on assortment, and we consistently drove promotional intensity. We had strong support throughout the quarter from our suppliers in adding to our assortment and in bringing innovation to our shelves. Our progress is not only reflected in improving sales trends, but also in customer experience scores. Our methodical approach to Wal-Mart\u2019s current initiatives is moving us in the right direction. ", "What\u2019s most important now is that we are in a position of strength for the busiest and most critical season of the year, and we\u2019re expecting a positive comp in the fourth quarter. We will lead on price as we continue to save our customers\u2019 money every day. ", "We\u2019re stepping up our strategic initiatives to help our core customers, as they struggle in the current economy. Remember 68% of our business comes from customers with household incomes under $70,000 per year. These customers deliver to us about 22% of their share of wallet, so there remains a lot of opportunity to deliver even more on Wal-Mart\u2019s core promise.", "Comp store sales for the 13-week period, which ended October 29, declined 1.3%, which was within our guidance. Our comp sales performance is somewhat suppressed by reporting requirements that I\u2019ll get into shortly. For the third quarter, net sales were $62.2 billion, flat to last year. While we would have liked Q3 sales to have been higher, we\u2019re encouraged by the quarterly sequential improvement in comp sales and customer traffic. However, compared to last year, traffic decreased and the average ticket was down slightly.", "Inventory in Wal-Mart U.S. was up 6.5% compared to this time last year, driven primarily by the planned seasonal build-up in the distribution centers. We\u2019ve also been staging merchandise for the holidays at our import DCs. In-store inventory was up approximately 3% in the third quarter compared to last year. We\u2019ve managed our inventory well, even as we add to our assortment. In fact, inventory at the end of the third quarter is still below levels from two years ago.", "Even while adding almost 10 million square feet of retail space since last year, we were still able to decrease our total operating expense by $61 million. This is indicative of our focus on expense management, since we also had flat sales growth. ", "I\u2019m pleased to report that Wal-Mart U.S. has now leveraged operating expenses for four consecutive quarters. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were down 9 basis points.", "Store labor of course, remains our biggest expense item. And, sales per labor hour, or labor productivity, were up versus last year, on relatively flat wage dollars. It\u2019s a credit to our store associates that our customer experience scores are at the highest level in three years. Customers are also happy with the action alley displays, because of the price intensity and product availability that they deliver. In addition, because they are pallet-driven, the action alley displays are very efficient from a labor standpoint.", "Other contributing factors to the decrease in operating expenses were the following. As I mentioned last quarter, we changed our advertising strategy and brought media expenditures back in line with recent historical trends. ", "Expenses were favorably impacted by lower estimated health expenses. And, our flat net sales growth resulted in a decrease in our estimates for the incentive plan. ", "National high levels of unemployment have also created headwind in operating expenses, with many states increasing unemployment insurance taxes per associate. In fact, unemployment insurance taxes are up 25% for the quarter versus last year. These types of changes are largely uncontrollable, but can be expected to impact our business from time to time.", "Operating income for the quarter grew faster than sales to $4.4 billion, an increase of 1.9%. The growth, as we said, was driven by expense leverage and an increase in gross margin rate of 5 basis points. Gross margin improvements were driven by lower markdowns and increased supply chain efficiencies. Our logistics and transportation teams continue to drive lower costs, despite higher fuel costs for the quarter.", "Other income for the Wal-Mart segment decreased slightly to last year.", "Let me move on to merchandise. Carol covered the change in our merchandise categories earlier, and I\u2019ll go into detail on our four new units. We continue to make progress on our strategy of focusing on EDLP, broadening our relevant assortment, improving in-stock, and driving promotional intensity throughout the store. This is achievable by partnering with our suppliers, driving innovation, leveraging best practices within the company, and listening to our customers. But against this backdrop, let me remind you that the paycheck cycle remains pronounced, especially in our grocery business. ", "Our food comp sales were a solid positive for the quarter, with strong sales performance in fresh, snacks and beverages. Produce and dairy were our strongest categories. In fact, our recent focus on apples was very successful in driving excitement and incremental sales. On several apple varieties, we were the clear price leader throughout the entire season, because of the work of our global sourcing team. We were able to streamline the supply chain process, which increased our speed to market and improved our quality and freshness.", "Halloween sales also were strong in food and candy. Customers appreciate the creativity we brought back to the bakery category this year, and we had excellent sell-through in baked goods. Categories in fresh, like meat and dairy continued to see some inflation, while some areas of dry grocery still experienced deflation.", "Our assortment review progress is moving very well. We\u2019ve added the most SKUs back in food and customers are responding. We\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making, with categories as varied as marshmallows, pie filling, jams and jellies. For example, eight weeks after modulars with additional SKUs were completed. On average, we saw a 39 basis point increase in sales in these categories. We\u2019re also expanding our assortment in many cases to achieve or store of the community relevance.", "For the holidays from Thanksgiving through New Year\u2019s, we are focusing on turkeys and also full meal options at very competitive prices. Bake centers are back in all our stores and we expect these to help drive sales in November and December. ", "Consumables and health and wellness had a negative comp for the quarter. Deflationary pressures continue to affect sales of key consumables. We\u2019re pleased with the continued growth of our beauty business, where we also see a lot of new, innovative products driving increased sales. ", "In health and wellness, we\u2019re up against strong sales during last year\u2019s H1N1 season. The business has been impacted also by supplier recalls in the over-the-counter business, and we expect this to remain a headwind during the near-term. In addition, like some of our drug retail competitors have cited, we\u2019ve seen increased generic prescription utilization due to the economy. Overall scripts were up, indicating that we\u2019re gaining share. We\u2019re pleased with being able to provide preventative flu shots this year to our customers as well.", "In October, Humana and Wal-Mart announced an innovative co-branded Medicare Part D prescription drug plan starting in 2011. The plan is nationwide with a premium of less than $15 a month, and in-store co-pays on generic medications starting as low as $2 when plan members use preferred pharmacies like Wal-Mart, Neighborhood Markets or Sam\u2019s Club. When you add up the savings based on the monthly premiums being less than 50% of the average plan, the low copayment, and cost shares, a typical Medicare Part D beneficiary could save more than $450 each year. We believe this will drive incremental traffic to our pharmacies.", "Our general merchandise unit, which includes entertainment, toys, seasonal, and hardlines, had a negative comp for the quarter.", "Clearly the fastest growing item in the store is our wireless solution, Straight Talk. Straight Talk and prepaid wireless sales have been impressive during the quarter. Let me explain how we\u2019re reporting sales of these items. ", "Reporting convention calls for sales of Straight Talk and third-party gift cards, such as iTunes and restaurant cards, to be included in sales, net of the product cost. In other words, we only account for a commission on sales. As these sales grow, they have more of an impact on our business. Had they been included in this quarter\u2019s comp sales at full transaction value, these items would have added almost 40 basis points to our comp sales for the period. Given the trend of Straight Talk and third-party gift cards, they would represent as much as 50 basis points to our anticipated fourth quarter comps, if they were included at the full transaction value. These categories will ring through our registers more than $2 billion for the full fiscal year. ", "Additionally, let me cover some other highlights in our general merchandise area. Entertainment comps were impacted by average selling price declines, particularly in LCD and plasma TVs, consistent with industry trends. However, despite this headwind, sales were up and we had solid increase in units in our TV category. Back-to-school sales were up in home office and laptops. Music sales, particularly CDs, continue to decline. Toy comparisons were impacted by the earlier timing of our promotional fall program last year. But we have bought up in the toy category this year, because we planned aggressively for the fourth quarter. ", "Unseasonably warm weather in October hindered sales in cold weather categories, such as hunting and hardware, driving mixed results in hardlines for the quarter. We\u2019re very pleased with the results of our tire event in October. A strong comp in automotive was accompanied by slower sales in seasonal goods and heaters. ", "Overall, our softline comp, including apparel and home, was negative. In apparel, warmer weather put pressure on our cold weather business, particularly in ladies, men\u2019s and children\u2019s. As we cycle through the inventory based on our previous apparel strategy, we\u2019re seeing improving sales trends. Our focus on the core customer has started to show areas of encouragement, as sales of socks and underwear, ladies\u2019 plus sizes and active wear outperformed the rest of apparel. We are very pleased with the expansion of our plus size offerings across all of ladies. In fact, comp sales of plus size active wear increased double digit for the quarter. ", "Jewelry continues to improve, driven by a renewed emphasis on costume jewelry. In home, we extended the season in the garden center and were pleased with double digit comps in multiple outdoor categories. There was some weakness in discretionary and d\u00e9cor categories, but customers responded well to back-to-college, cooking and dining merchandise, as well as and floor care. ", "In financial services, check cashing remains our top performing category, and we are gaining share. We continue to benefit from the extension of our Wal-Mart Money Card agreements with the Green Dot Corporation. Wal-Mart.com grew at a faster rate than the overall online market again this quarter. Sales in many categories were strong, particularly electronics and home. We expect continued strong online sales this holiday season, driven by strong Site-to-Store demand, free shipping to home, an expanded FedEx metro pickup, now in five major metropolitan markets and our Pick Up Today program, now available in over 800 stores. ", "Before I get into a discussion of the holidays, let me discuss our growth plans. ", "As we outlined at our October meeting, next year, we expect to open between 155 and 165 supercenters, with 45 to 50 being new units, the remainder conversions. Wal-Mart is also planning on opening 30 to 40 medium to small format stores. In addition, we\u2019ll remodel more than 500 stores. The remodels going forward will cost less than what we\u2019ve experienced in the last two years, and will take 40% less time, for fewer disruptions to both the customer and the associate. ", "So far this year, we\u2019ve remodeled more than 580 stores. These remodels have helped drive our highest ever customer experience scores and will deliver a great shopping experience this holiday season. We finished all remodel work at the end of the third quarter. Also, during Q3, we opened 98 new supercenters, including 71 relocations or expansions. ", "We\u2019ve recently announced a few of our special deals for Christmas. We unveiled our top toys on November 1, started sending out our 52-page toy catalog on November 5, and created a dedicated section of our website to the top toys of the season. Last week, we also announced free shipping to your home through Wal-Mart.com for selective holiday items, including all electronics. We were very pleased with the initial response from our customers to this offer. ", "Our marketing efforts will be focused on bringing to life how our customers can rely on Wal-Mart to save them money so they can live better. Our holiday message is focused on basket savings. We believe that we have the right level of media buy for the fourth quarter. We also have increased our efficiencies through a strategic program of digital, print and electronic buys. We have a number of aggressive programs underway to reach the customers often and early for the holidays. Last year, our fourth quarter comp sales declined 2% versus the previous year. ", "Our Wal-Mart culture ensures that we have a correction of errors every season. We\u2019ve built our 2010 plans on lessons learned from last year. ", "Christmas is 39 days away from today. The holiday season is certainly here. We believe our core customers are focused on price, basics, toys for kids and practical gifts. Customers are also spending more time researching online and looking for multi-channel solutions. They will budget for new technology items like eReaders and gaming systems. Like back-to-school and Halloween, we expect that a lot of the spending will come close to Christmas. Wal-Mart is well prepared to take care of our customers this holiday season. ", "We\u2019re expecting Q4 to be another quarter of sequentially improving comp sales. And, as I pointed out earlier, we expect positive comps for the holidays. For the 13-week fourth quarter period from October 30, 2010 to January 28, 2011, we\u2019re forecasting our comp sales to range from a negative 1% to a positive 2%. ", "Now, I\u2019ll pass the mic to Doug to tell you about Wal-Mart International. Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks Bill. Wal-Mart International continues to deliver on our financial priorities of growth, leverage, and returns. Our growth this quarter has come from comparable store sales and our new store program, and we\u2019re meeting our goal of leveraging operating expenses. I\u2019m pleased that our merchants\u2019 focus is on serving customers with quality merchandise, compelling assortments, and price leadership. We\u2019re driving local customer relevance as we grow sales, and it\u2019s great to see the arrival of seasonal items heading into the holidays in many countries. ", "As Mike mentioned, we recently completed a visit to China, India and Japan. We visited customers in their homes, talked with them in stores, met with our associates and discussed things like merchandising, EDLP and the opportunity to build a career in the company. We left even more enthusiastic about Asia. Scott Price, Ed Chan, Raj Jain and Toru Nada are building a strong business in the region. ", "Our business in China has a lot of momentum. This market is developing at a rapid pace and we\u2019re well positioned. India\u2019s potential is also enormous. Bharti Wal-Mart is growing and learning how to better serve customers in India every day. Our results in the BestPrice cash and carry units are promising. It was great to see Wal-Mart spirit and culture in New Delhi and Chandigarh. ", "Wal-Mart Japan is making meaningful progress. Our items and prices, plus the in-store experience, are tangibly different since my last visit. The team is driving growth, building momentum and leveraging Wal-Mart\u2019s global ability in sourcing.", "After returning from Asia, we left again to visit Johannesburg, South Africa. We continue to view Sub-Saharan Africa as an important market and are pleased with how the process is going so far. We can help add value for customers, future associates and all of the various stakeholders in that region. ", "Now, let\u2019s discuss our third quarter results. ", "International net sales for the third quarter were $26.9 billion, an increase of 9.3% from last year. This includes a $349 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Sales on a constant currency basis were $26.6 billion, a 7.9% increase over the third quarter of last year. As I mentioned during the investor meeting in October, we\u2019re driving comp store and new store growth. Our strategy of organic growth and local relevance delivered the increase in constant currency sales in the third quarter. This increase was primarily a result of: a strong comp store sales performance in China, Japan, and the U.K and new store growth in Mexico, Brazil, China and Canada.", "International\u2019s operating income for the third quarter, which included an $11 million benefit of currency exchange rate fluctuations, was $1.2 billion, up 13.5% from last year, and an increase of 12.4% on a constant currency basis. Constant currency operating income grew faster than sales. As a reminder, last year\u2019s third quarter results were adversely affected by currency exchange rates, as well as charges in our businesses in Chile and a sale-leaseback transaction in Japan. Without the impact of these prior year charges, constant currency operating income grew slower than sales for the third quarter, primarily due to a low gross margin in Brazil. ", "Membership and other income was flat as a percentage of sales. ", "We once again leveraged our constant currency expenses. Our results this quarter benefited from significant expense reductions in Wal-Mart Japan through their EDLC implementation. We also grew expenses slower than sales in Brazil and Central America.", "On a constant currency basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by 22 basis points in the third quarter primarily due to the changes we are making in Brazil which I\u2019ll get into further in a moment.", "International inventory grew 13.9%, which was faster than the rate of sales growth. We did not meet our objective of growing inventory at less than half the rate of sales and we\u2019re very focused on improving this metric. ", "Now, we\u2019ll turn to the results for several of our markets. As a reminder, we hold country management accountable for their results on a constant currency basis without the impact of potential swings in exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency fluctuations.", "As you know, in February, Wal-Mart Mexico purchased 100% of our majority-owned subsidiary with operations in Central America. Until the Central American business has been part of Walmex for a year, the discussion here on Mexico will exclude the results of Central America. This discussion is under U.S. GAAP. Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. ", "Walmex\u2019s sales for the third quarter were up 10%, and comparable store sales were up 2.8%. The sales growth at Walmex is driven by the 256 net new stores and restaurants that have opened since the third quarter of last year as well as a positive comp growth in all Walmex formats. Customer traffic and average ticket both increased 1.4% at comparable stores. ", "For the third quarter, Walmex comp store sales for self-service formats grew by 2.4%, while ANTAD\u2019s comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, showed 1.2% growth. ", "Walmex\u2019s third quarter operating income grew 4%, which is slower than sales growth. Third quarter gross margin at Walmex declined slightly from last year and expenses as a percentage of sales grew faster than sales. Higher utility rates in the current year continue to pressure expenses in Mexico. ", "The fourth quarter is an important period for Walmex. We will be growing our sales by leveraging new imported merchandise in Sam\u2019s and Wal-Mart supercenters as well as winning in electronics, entertainment and toys. ", "Now to Brazil. In the past 12 months, we have opened a net of 79 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 452. This includes seven new stores in the third quarter of this year. In real terms, Brazil\u2019s third quarter sales growth was 12.4% and comparable store sales grew 1.2%. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 6.4% and average ticket increased 7.6%, both in real terms. Comparable sales at our cash and carry and supermarket formats continue to perform well. ", "At the October analyst meeting, Eduardo Sol\u00f3rzano and I talked about how we are seeing the effects on our margins of converting to a net costing approach, and that we\u2019re moving forward with integration to simplify the business. In the third quarter, gross margin as a percentage of sales declined 1.7% from last year, and expenses as a percentage of sales improved slightly. ", "Marcos Samaha returned to Wal-Mart Brazil to assume the role of CEO during the third quarter of this year. Our management team is very focused on improving how we will buy in Brazil in support of Brazil\u2019s conversion to EDLP. The integration challenges we have as a result of running what amounts to three separate businesses remain, and we continue to re-engineer our processes, so we\u2019re expecting to see continued pressure on Brazil\u2019s results. ", "Moving to Asia. In Japan, third quarter net sales in real terms increased 6.4% and comparable store sales performed very well, increasing by 6.1%. While EDLP, local relevance, and positive customer perception are the key drivers of these results, we did see an uplift from having the right assortment for the warmer than average August. Wal-Mart Japan\u2019s traffic increased over last year as a result of our remodeled stores, but average ticket declined. Based on information from the Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, our performance is ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan and we continue to increase our market share. ", "Wal-Mart Japan sales of food and consumables showed a strong performance, while apparel sales were down. Expenses as a percentage of sales are down due to EDLC, even after excluding last year\u2019s sale-leaseback charges. Overall, I\u2019m pleased to report that operating income in Japan grew faster than sales. ", "China is clearly a significant market. In the past 12 months, we opened 32 new stores, bringing our total China store count to 298 at the end of this fiscal quarter. Sales increased 15.2% over the third quarter of last year on a comparable store sales increase of 6.9%. Average ticket grew, but traffic declined. In addition, TrustMart stores had lower traffic during the third quarter as we converted stores to new formats. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. Operating income declined due to the merchandise conversion and integration programs for TrustMart. ", "Many of you are aware that our second close on the TrustMart acquisition was scheduled to occur this month. We continue to make good progress in TrustMart with our system and merchandise improvements. Wal-Mart and the selling shareholder have mutually agreed to extend the closing to May 26, 2011, while certain conditions of the contract are being completed. In the meantime, Wal-Mart and TrustMart continue to focus on their core mission, saving our Chinese customers\u2019 money so they can live better. ", "As you know, we support Bharti Retail and their new store growth in India. Bharti Retail continued to grow, opening 24 stores in the third quarter of this year, and now operates 93 supermarkets and six compact hypermarkets. Under our joint venture with Bharti, we now have three cash and carry stores and are pleased with the continued sales growth in India.", "Turning now to the United Kingdom. In the third quarter of this year, comparable store sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.3%. Overall sales growth was in the low single digits, with the fastest growing areas being George apparel, produce, baby and toys. While comparable store traffic and ticket were both up in the third quarter, according to Kantar Worldpanel, ASDA\u2019s market share dropped slightly in the 12 weeks ending October 31. ", "ASDA is improving its offering to customers, specifically in the areas of assortment and quality. Andy Clarke and his team have made targeted price investments including core food products. In September, ASDA committed to providing quality by re-launching its private brand under the Chosen by You label, and the products have been selected based on consumer blind taste tests. One thousand items have already been launched and we expect an additional 2,500 by the first quarter of next year. ", "Operating income grew faster than sales in the third quarter. This was driven by an increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales from increased sales of George apparel. Expenses as a percentage of sales at ASDA were flat to last year. ", "ASDA opened two new stores in the third quarter of this year, bringing the total store count to 379. Since the third quarter of last year, we have opened three superstores, five supermarkets, and three ASDA Living stores. ", "ASDA has recently added strength to its leadership team. Simon King was recently announced as our Chief Operating Officer. Simon brings a wealth of retail and supermarket experience and is a great addition to a strong team. In addition, Charles Redfield has been appointed Chief Merchandising Officer. Charles brings more than 20 years of Wal-Mart experience and was most recently in merchandising in our Sam\u2019s U.S. division. ", "The Netto acquisition we announced in May of this year continues to progress, and we\u2019ve received formal approval from the OFT, or Office of Fair Trading, in the third quarter, with a requirement to sell 47 of the Netto stores. The remaining Netto stores will add 148 new stores and 1.1 million square feet. Full conversion of these Netto stores to the ASDA supermarket format is expected to be complete by this time next year. ", "We are encouraged by the recent sales momentum in the U.K. We are well positioned for the holiday season. At a time where economists are forecasting very tough economic conditions, ASDA remains committed to saving customers\u2019 money every day. ", "And finally Canada. Wal-Mart Canada\u2019s third quarter sales growth was 4.6%, due to a strong supercentre expansion program and sales of food. We have a total of 109 supercentres in Canada, 40 more than this time last year. Comparable sales in Canada were negative 0.4% on lower traffic, which was down 0.1%. Ticket was down 30 basis points. ", "While Canada experienced record market share in food, consumables and baby, we experienced declines in sales of electronics and automotive. Despite the sales mix shift towards lower margin items, Canada\u2019s gross margin rate increased by 36 basis points over last year, due to better inventory management, including a reduction in shrinkage and improved purchasing.", "Canada\u2019s expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to incremental expenses on the launch of our banking operations, and higher advertising investment. Canada\u2019s third quarter operating income grew faster than sales, as the increase in margin offset the growth of expenses as a percentage of sales. In addition to Canada\u2019s 109 supercentres, we have 212 Wal-Mart stores. So our business in Canada is still largely general merchandise driven. ", "As you know, with the exception of Canada, the fourth quarter ends on December 31 for our countries, so Wal-Mart International is halfway through the fourth quarter. In addition to the normal competitive pricing situation, we\u2019re currently working towards more of an EDLP approach in Brazil. As we make that conversion, we will experience some profit pressure and we\u2019re expecting that it will be more challenging than in previous quarters to grow profit faster than sales. We anticipate a very competitive fourth quarter in some of our countries. While we expect sales to grow, the competitive environment is pressuring overall gross margin. ", "One last item of note. We recently announced our non-binding offer to purchase an ownership interest in South Africa\u2019s Massmart, and we are currently exploring a variety of options relating to ownership structure with the ultimate objective being to maximize shareholder value. Massmart offers a compelling growth opportunity with a talented team that is also a good cultural fit with Wal-Mart. We see the opportunity to increase value for Massmart customers and reach even more customers together. We remain excited about this potential investment. ", "Now, Brian will cover Sam\u2019s Club. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you, Doug. During our recent investor meeting, we outlined how Sam\u2019s Club will continue to drive growth, leverage and returns through our Savings Made Simple framework. We are focused on listening to our members and effectively serving their needs. ", "Before we get into the financial details for the third quarter, I want to share some key highlights. ", "Comp sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period ended October 29, increased by 2.4%. I am excited to say Sam\u2019s exceeded our original guidance of flat to 2%. We also were solidly within our updated guidance of 1% to 3%, which we provided on October 13 at our investor meeting. We maintained a strong margin rate, but due to expense pressures, couldn\u2019t translate that performance to operating margin.", "Our sales momentum is evidence that our members are responding well to our improved merchandising offering. Sales during the quarter were particularly strong in fresh, jewelry, home and certain technology and entertainment categories. We also introduced more than 100 new items in fresh this fall, a historic high for Sam\u2019s Club. ", "Recently, an independent third party annual survey ranked Sam\u2019s Club Pharmacy second of all U.S. pharmacies. This was our highest rating ever. To build on this success, we\u2019re expanding health and wellness offerings. As of yesterday, our members can take advantage of the lowest Medicare Part D plan offered in the marketplace at Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s pharmacies. And let me remind you that our Sam\u2019s Club pharmacy is open to members and non-members. ", "Innovation and service drive success in technology and entertainment. So, it\u2019s important to our members that we have the most up-to-date technology and top brands. We introduced LG, and the Apple iPhone and iPad. We\u2019ve also stepped up our associate training to provide more technology assistance to our members. We\u2019re also near completion on \u201cwi-fi-ing\u201d all of our clubs, which enhances the shopping experience. ", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the detailed financial results. For the third quarter, net sales for Sam\u2019s Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.1 billion, which is a 138 basis point increase over last year\u2019s third quarter. Including fuel, third quarter sales were $12.1 billion, which is a 2.7% increase versus last year, due in part to higher fuel prices this year compared to last year. Fuel prices in the third quarter this year were approximately 8% higher than last year.", "As I mentioned earlier, comp club sales, excluding fuel, for the 13-week period increased 2.4%. Including fuel, club comp sales increased 3.8%. Comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period, both for Business and Advantage members. Comp traffic, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period, among Advantage members, but declined slightly among Business members. ", "Our food and beverage business both had strong sales. We did experience inflation in dairy and meat. Back-to-school and back-to-college, as well as the fall tailgating season, drove sales in technology and entertainment. ", "We were pleased to see we gained dollar share in computers and TVs during August and September. ", "In home, we continue to see very strong comps in furniture, domestics, and house wares. And jewelry comps were in the high single digits. Finally, tobacco and fuel sales continue to deliver strong comps. ", "Sam\u2019s gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased by 22 basis points during the third quarter, primarily driven by the continued shift in merchandising mix towards higher margin fresh products, apparel and jewelry, as well as an increased margin in technology and entertainment. ", "Our merchants have done an excellent job managing seasonal buys and sellthrough to mitigate margin impact of markdowns. Including fuel, the gross margin rate for the quarter increased 8 basis points compared to last year. ", "Inventory increased by 4.2% versus last year, driven in part by the normal anticipation of the holiday season. Additionally, you may recall, last year\u2019s inventory levels were lower than our historic levels due to inventory management initiatives and an impact from a calendar shift on merchandise receipts. ", "Our inventory turns were up in the third quarter. With conservative buys for Halloween, we were able to manage sellthrough for a successful Halloween season. We entered the fourth quarter in a strong inventory position and we are actively managing our seasonal transition through the holidays. ", "Operating expenses grew 4.8% versus last year, driven by increases in credit card interchange fees, remodeling and marketing expenses. As I explained in our first quarter call, beginning in April, in response to the continuing challenging credit program, we began paying an interchange fee in conjunction with our credit card program. We will not continue to feel this headwind in the fourth quarter. ", "During the third quarter, 26 clubs were remodeled this year versus 23 last year. Additionally, during the quarter, we increased our marketing budgets for key fall initiatives, including our back-to-school program, football season, 15 weeks for $15 membership and Labor Day eValues for all event.", "For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 60 basis points. Units per labor hour decreased slightly for the third quarter versus last year. Although we did not leverage expenses for the quarter, I am pleased with our year-to-date performance on expense leverage. As a result of the increased expense level, third quarter operating income decreased 7.1% versus last year to $367 million. This represents a decrease in operating margin of 32 basis points from last year. Excluding fuel, operating income decreased by 8%. Membership and other income decreased 5.1% from last year. ", "You may recall that in last year\u2019s third quarter, we recognized a favorable accounting adjustment to membership income, as well as experienced strong comp results from the rollout of eValues for Plus memberships. Excluding the effects of the accounting adjustment last year, membership and other income for the third quarter increased 40 basis points, compared to last year. Membership income, the primary driver, decreased 5.9% versus last year. Excluding the accounting adjustment, membership income was flat.", "We are pleased with the continued increases in Plus membership penetration and new member sign-up at the Plus level, reflecting our focus on this initiative. We are also pleased with our overall renewal rates. These strengths have been offset by two factors: first, the continued erosion in the number of business add-ons, due to the economic pressure that so many small business members are experiencing; second, the net impact of the membership loss from the 10 clubs closed last fiscal year, compared to new club openings this year. ", "In the third quarter, we began to overlap the successful launch of last year\u2019s eValues program, which kicked off August 17, 2009. To spur additional upgrades and acquisitions, we hosted a weekend Labor Day event, which delivered strong results. The Labor Day eValues Savings Celebration served as a trial and awareness vehicle for all members to experience the additional discounts afforded by eValues. As we enter into the second year of eValues, we continue to focus on providing relevant and meaningful values to our members through various events. We expect the trend in small business membership to continue to pressure net membership income in the fourth quarter. ", "The fourth quarter is underway and we are focused on driving even greater value to our members and shareholders. Our annual Taste of Sam\u2019s event kicks off this Friday and lasts through the weekend. We plan to demonstrate Sam\u2019s is your one-stop shop for the holiday season for both meals and entertaining. Each club will host at least 18 demos each day. We also will demo more than 50 different holiday foods and entertaining merchandise items. This event always drives traffic and new member sign-ups. ", "In non-food categories, we feel we are solidly positioned across the club to have a successful holiday season and we are focused on meeting all the gifting needs for our members with a fresh approach to merchandising the product. We are very pleased with the early sales results in holiday d\u00e9cor, holiday gifting and food categories. We\u2019re entering the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum in home, apparel, jewelry and new products from Apple, and we anticipate strong comps in these areas.", "We continue to see our third quarter sales momentum carry over into the first two weeks of the fourth quarter. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from October 30, 2010 through January 28, 2011, to increase between 1% and 3%. Last year, Sam\u2019s comp without fuel for the comparable period rose 70 basis points.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom for the report card and guidance discussion. Tom?", "Tom Schoewe", "Thanks Brian. Before I get into our financial report card to discuss growth, leverage and returns, let me provide an SAP update. ", "North America continues to get better with each monthly close. Mexico has now started the SAP conversion and Argentina is next in line. With each country that goes live, we get more efficient.", "Now, time for the financial report card. First, let\u2019s discuss growth. ", "For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we grew our square footage, net sales and operating income. Sales grew almost 3% for the quarter, mainly driven by International. Net retail square footage grew by approximately 10 million square feet to 971 million square feet at the end of the third quarter. So far this year, we have added 18.6 million square feet, as we introduce the Wal-Mart promise to more and more customers globally. We are still bullish on our growth prospects, both here in the United States and in our International markets. And, we continue to grow operating income, as mentioned earlier, up more than 3% in the quarter. ", "Now let\u2019s move on to leverage. We\u2019ve now produced four consecutive quarters of expense leverage as we maintain our focus on the productivity loop and resulting everyday low costs. Like last quarter, expense leverage was a significant factor in achieving our bottom line results. And, as Mike indicated, we remain committed to expenses growing slower than sales.", " ", "Finally, let\u2019s talk about returns. As I mentioned in the second quarter, inventories at the end of last fiscal year were relatively low for Wal-Mart. This \u201cstarting point\u201d continues to impact free cash flow. Accounts payable, as Charles indicated, benefitted free cash flow. That said, our free cash flow through the previous nine months of the fiscal year was a healthy $2.9 billion, but below the $3.6 billion we reported for the same period last year. ", "Remember, our goal for return on investment is to maintain a stable return. ROI for the 12 months ended October 31 was 18.6%. That\u2019s up from the 18.4% we reported last year. Like last quarter, the story behind ROI is strong operating performance. ", "As I mentioned earlier, we are growing square footage and continue to invest in our business. Average \u201cinvested capital\u201d, or the denominator used to calculate ROI, grew by 7.3%. However, our continued focus on the productivity loop has produced strong operating results. That leads us to the numerator, the trailing 12-month adjusted operating income, has grown by 8.4%, far better than the increase in the denominator. ", "Overall, we are extremely satisfied with our ROI performance. Face it, at 18.6% pre-tax return, this is very impressive. ", "Now let\u2019s move on to guidance. Mike mentioned earlier that we are raising our EPS guidance for the fiscal year. Based on what we see today, and our expectations for the U.S. sales environment, we expect full-year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 to be between $4.08 and $4.12 per share; that\u2019s up from our previous full-year guidance of $3.95 a share to $4.05. Correspondingly, our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share guidance is between $1.29 and $1.33. Both of these ranges assume that currency exchange rates remain at today\u2019s levels. ", "Before I close, let me summarize some of the key points for our third quarter. At the end of the day, we posted another strong quarter. First, we reported more than $100 billion in net sales. As I indicated, we added approximately 10 million of square feet of retail space. Once again, we leveraged operating expenses, which allowed us to grow operating income faster than sales. We had another quarter of great EPS growth. ROI is 18.6% and better than at this time last year. And, finally, our free cash flow of $2.9 billion is the second highest third quarter performance on record. Having said that, we understand that we have an opportunity to improve even further across our businesses. ", "First, we have an opportunity to improve Wal-Mart U.S. comp store sales. We believe the fourth quarter will be in positive territory. As we continue to make progress in our merchandise assortment, we will expect inventory in Wal-Mart U.S. will settle down and will once again generate even more free cash flow. In Wal-Mart International, we will improve operations in Brazil to increase profitability, and we will accelerate growth in China and in India. We will continue to grow in Mexico and add more supercentres in Canada. The International growth story is compelling. ", "The sales momentum at Sam\u2019s Club will continue into the fourth quarter and into next fiscal year. We expect to see expense leverage from Sam\u2019s by next fiscal year as well. ", "All of this kind of makes me think just how much has changed in the short time, a little bit more than a decade, that I have been proud to serve here at Wal-Mart. Our sales, our store count and our square footage have more than doubled since then. ", "Sales rose from roughly $150 billion and EPS of $1.25 a share in fiscal 2000 to the kind of results we\u2019re talking about today, sales well north of $400 billion, and we shared our new guidance with you today that EPS should be in a range from $4.08 to $4.12. That compares to the $1.25 that I talked about for fiscal 2000. ", "We are just shy of 8700 units around the world, which enables us to do a great job of taking care of our customers and our members and we\u2019re ready to help them to have a great holiday and a fourth quarter. ", "We believe that there\u2019s no better retail model than Wal-Mart, and it means that we can continue to deliver strong shareholder value. ", "This is my last call as CFO. Charles will take over as CFO for Wal-Mart, effective December 1.

Those forward-looking statements for the Wal-Mart International segment also discuss management\u2019s expectations that: ASDA\u2019s commitment to Saving Customers Money Every Day will be more important in 2011; EDLP in Brazil will increase sales volume and reduce operating costs; the segment\u2019s Canadian bank will be profitable in fiscal 2012; 40 new supercenters will open in key regions around Canada; and organic growth will include significant investments in soft discount formats in Mexico and Brazil, and larger formats in China and Canada.

This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review both the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2011.", "All information for this quarter including updated unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, including ROI, are available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of the call will be available on the website as well around 7:00 a.m. Central Time today, February 22, 2011.", "Today, you'll hear from key Wal-Mart leaders, starting with Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., for the opening comments and key highlights of the quarter and the year; Jeff Davis, in his first call as Wal-Mart\u2019s Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. As you'll see from our press release, we do have some noise with our numbers. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up this time will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club; Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will also have highlights on our largest countries within international. We will close the segment discussion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. Finally, our CFO, Charles Holley, will cover our financial report card and a variety of points on guidance. ", "Before we start to discuss our performance for the quarter, there are a few items to keep in mind as you listen to the results. First, we had certain items that affected our fourth quarter EPS last year, as well as an accounting change in fiscal 2011 that affected last year. These items need to be considered for comparison purposes. Second, as a reminder, we had a tax benefit from the third quarter, which we reported in November. The tax benefits from the third quarter and the fourth quarter that we're reporting today affect our full year and quarterly results.", "Third, I'd also like to point out that during the quarter, we had income from discontinued operations. This income resulted from the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit related to the disposition of our German operations in fiscal year 2007. Including this tax benefit, diluted net income per share attributable to Wal-Mart was $1.70 for the fourth quarter and $4.47 for the full year.", "Fourth, this is the last quarter that we'll remind you about our adjusted P&Ls and balance sheets that are available on the Wal-Mart website under Financial Information. Effective with the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Wal-Mart changed the methodology for valuing our inventory. The retrospective application of this accounting change resulted in adjustments to reported amounts. The adjusted financial statements I mentioned earlier cover all of fiscal year 2010 as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and they're on our website. Throughout this call, all earnings and earnings per share amounts reflect the amounts for FY '10 adjusted for this accounting change. ", "I'd also like to mention that we're discontinuing our discussion of consolidated membership and other income beginning in fiscal 2012. This line item is most relevant for Sam's Club and they'll continue to discuss it going forward. You'll also note that in today's discussion, as well as in the accompanying press release, we provide disclosure on both reported and underlying earnings per share. The reported EPS takes into consideration all the items, including tax benefits and restructuring charges. The underlying EPS is based on our pure operating performance. You'll hear these terms throughout the discussion today.", "Now Mike, let's get started with our Q4 and our full year results. Mike?", "Mike Duke", "Thank you, Carol, and thank you all for joining us. We are pleased with our strong earnings performance for both the quarter and the full year across our three operating segments. At the same time, we are disappointed by our Wal-Mart U.S. fourth quarter sales. Earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and the full year exceeded the guidance we provided last quarter. We are reporting $1.41 per share for the quarter and $4.18 per share for the full year. These numbers include certain tax benefits that positively impacted EPS, and Jeff will cover this shortly.", "Based on the underlying performance of the company, our earnings per share were $1.34 for the fourth quarter, which exceeded First Call consensus and our guidance. Wal-Mart increased net sales from the previous year by almost $14 billion to $419 billion. As a company, we leveraged the expenses for the quarter and the year, reinforcing our commitment to the productivity loop and EDLC.", "Operating income rose to more than $25 billion for the full year, a 6.4% increase over what we reported this time last year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow, closing the year with almost $11 billion. We met our goal to deliver stable return on investment, and finished the year again with ROI above 19%.", "For the year, we returned a record $19.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase. Let me pause for a moment. $19.2 billion return to shareholders. Now that was worth repeating. However, as I said, sales for Wal-Mart U.S. were below our expectations for the fourth quarter. The team did manage expenses well during the quarter and contributed operating income growth of almost 5%. Bill has a clear vision today of the underlying issues, and his action plan addresses the areas critical to the sales turnaround. Some of the pricing and merchandising issues in Wal-Mart U.S. ran deeper than we initially expected, and they require response that will take time to see results. Price leadership is critical to our success. We will reinforce our commitment to deliver EDLP. This is what Wal-Mart was built on.", "We will deliver a merchandise assortment and presentation relevant to our customers. As Bill will share with you, many of the fourth quarter problems stem from merchandise assortment and presentation issues that contributed to customer traffic declines, as well as some of the issues related to the remodeling program. I believe Bill is on the right track to see sales improvement throughout the year. Let me be direct on this point. There is no greater priority for me or for Bill than getting sales back into positive territory. ", "Wal-Mart U.S. will also continue to grow through our supercenters and additional formats. We will move forward with even greater urgency in opening small stores. I'm encouraged by the response we're seeing in urban markets like Chicago, Washington, D.C., San Diego and New York.", "It's no surprise that we see growing opportunities in online shopping. I am pleased with the sales results of Walmart.com during the fourth quarter and expect e-commerce and multichannel to play an increasingly important role across our business. Sam's Club now has annual sales just shy of $50 billion. I'm pleased that the Sam's organization is really contributing to our shareholder value. Sam's Club turned in a strong performance for the year, delivering comp sales near the top end of guidance. Brian and his team grew net sales 4.4% for the quarter and 3.5% for the year. Sam's comp sales, without fuel, improved sequentially every quarter, with fourth quarter being the strongest. We're seeing the comp sales momentum continue and expect strength in the first quarter. Attracting new members will continue to be the top priority for the year ahead. ", "Wal-Mart International continued to be our growth engine and we expect accelerated growth ahead. International net sales exceeded $109 billion this year, an increase of more than 12%. Every market contributed a sales increase in fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. For the full year, International grew operating income faster than sales.", "We added 458 net units this year and almost 8% more selling space in our international markets. Almost 70% of the additional square footage came in two important emerging markets: Mexico and China. I've told our international leaders that I'd like to see them accelerate organic growth in our emerging markets.", "We also will grow through acquisitions. We look forward to closing the Massmart transaction in South Africa and expanding our presence in many sub-Saharan African markets. In the U.K., we continue to work towards finalizing the acquisition of the Netto stores.", "I'd like to specifically recognize our business in Japan, where our Seiyu stores continued their strong focus on Every Day Low Price and operational efficiencies. As a result, Wal-Mart Japan has grown full year profits for each of the past three years, with this fiscal year being the best of the three years.", "You're familiar with our company mission of helping our customers save money so they can live better. Our engagement on the \"live better\" societal issues continues to have a meaningful impact in our communities. Doug and I had the opportunity to share some of our experiences with leaders from companies and countries around the world at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month. ", "We found there's a lot of interest in our global commitment to sustainable agriculture and our new initiative in the U.S. to make the food we sell healthier, and healthier foods more affordable for our customers. We were honored that First Lady Michelle Obama joined Bill Simon to launch this initiative last month. ", "We recognize that around the world, there is growing concern about inflation and higher prices, particularly in food and energy. I believe that Wal-Mart is one of the best positioned retailers around the world to handle these kinds of headwinds, because of our commitment to EDLC and EDLP. This is something we will continue to address. You'll hear more about this from our business leaders. ", "As I look ahead for this fiscal year, I am confident that no retailer is better positioned to win globally than Wal-Mart. We will not waver in our commitment to our customers. Our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns guide us in our decisions and strategies. We will continue to add square footage and new formats. We will grow sales and increase comps. We will continue to leverage operating expenses through the productivity loop and we will continue to maximize our returns to the shareholders through dividends, share repurchase and a stable ROI. ", "Now Jeff will cover the details on our consolidated financial results. Jeff?", "Jeff Davis", "Thanks, Mike. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Wal-Mart delivered income from continuing operations of $5 billion, an increase of 4.3% from last year. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $1.41, an increase of 11.9% compared to $1.26 for the fourth quarter last year.", "We have some noise in both this year's and last year's earnings per share numbers that I would like to explain further. This year, we recorded $243 million of net tax benefits, primarily from the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits. This net tax benefit added approximately $0.07 to our reported EPS of $1.41 for the fourth quarter. ", "By comparison, last year's $1.26 per share had both a benefit and a charge in the fourth quarter. First, we incurred charges for several business restructurings in the amount of $260 million, or $162 million after-tax. These charges reduced our reported EPS by approximately $0.04 per share. Second, we recorded $372 million of net tax benefits primarily from the repatriation of certain non-U.S. earnings that increased U.S. foreign tax credits. These net tax benefit added approximately $0.09 to our reported EPS. ", "In summary, our fourth quarter underlying EPS grew 10.7% from $1.21 last year to $1.34 this year, which was above our guidance of $1.29 to $1.33 per share. The $1.34 earnings per share points to the strength of our consolidated business.", "For the full year, earnings from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $15.4 billion, an increase of 6.3% over last year. For the fiscal year, reported earnings per share and underlying earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.18 and $4.07, respectively versus our adjusted EPS of $3.73 and underlying EPS of $3.67 last year. The underlying $4.07 excluded certain tax benefits recorded in the third and fourth quarters that aggregate to approximately $0.11 per share for the fiscal year. ", "Earlier, Carol mentioned an important point. In the fourth quarter, the company recognized in discontinued operations an approximately $1 billion tax benefit in connection with the disposition of our German operation in fiscal 2007. This matter was resolved with the United States Internal Revenue Service during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Now let's dive into the fourth quarter and the fiscal year results.", "Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.5% or almost $2.8 billion to $115.6 billion. Net sales included a currency exchange rate benefit of $664 million. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 1.9%. The 13-week U.S. comp sales, without fuel, declined 1.1%. You'll hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Bill and Brian.", "Gross margin for the quarter was flat to last year at 24.6% of sales. Fourth quarter consolidated operating income was $8 billion, up 7.3% or $546 million from last year. This includes a currency exchange rate benefit of $58 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income grew 6.5%. ", "Operating income grew faster than sales by leveraging operating expenses. The productivity loop is a priority focus throughout the company. Expenses grew approximately 50 basis points on sales growth of 2.5%, which is the fifth consecutive quarter that expenses grew slower than sales.", "Unallocated corporate overhead grew 9.1% to $505 million for the quarter. What we classify as core within our corporate overhead expense actually decreased 3% for the quarter. The mark-to-market of several unallocated foreign currency derivative positions was the primary driver of the increase. It is important to note that unallocated corporate overhead decreased 2% to about $1.7 billion for the year.", "On a consolidated basis, membership and other income declined 4.5% or $36 million this quarter compared to last year. For the year, membership and other income was down 1.9% or $56 million. As Carol remarked, membership and other income continues to be an important part of the Sam's Club business but to a lesser degree for the other segments.", "Net interest expense for the quarter increased 13.4% to $532 million. For the fiscal year, net interest expense was $2 billion, an increase of 6.4%. This was driven by higher debt levels but partially offset by lower interest rates. Our AA credit rating allowed us to access low-cost debt. As a reminder, earlier this year, we issued $5 billion of debt at some of the lowest corporate rates on record at the time. We continue to have ample access to the credit markets. At the end of the year, our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 42.1% compared to 37% at the end of last year.", "The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.7% and 32.2% for the year. This was due to the net tax benefits we previously discussed. These items reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 320 basis points for the quarter and approximately 180 basis points for the fiscal year.", "Net sales were approximately $419 billion for the year, which is an increase of 3.4% or $13.8 billion over last year. Net sales included a currency exchange benefit of $4.5 billion. On a constant currency basis, our net sales for fiscal 2011 grew 2.3%. As a reminder, currency translation negatively impacted sales by $9.8 billion in fiscal 2010. For the 52-week period ended January 28, 2011, U.S. comp sales without fuel declined 1.1%.", "Consolidated operating income was $25.5 billion, an increase of 6.4% from last year, and included $231 million from currency rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income grew 5.5% to $25.3 billion. Consistent with our quarterly results, operating income grew faster than sales for the year as we leveraged expenses. Expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 32 basis points.", "This year was another strong year for cash flow generation. We closed the year with free cash flow of $10.9 billion. Recall last year, free cash flow was $14.1 billion, enhanced by the artificially low inventory position at year end. Annual CapEx spend was $12.7 billion, which was lower than our most recent guidance of $13 billion to $14 billion. This resulted from lower spending and timing associated with the Wal-Mart U.S. segment. CapEx spend for the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion.", "We paid almost $1.1 billion in dividends this quarter and $4.4 billion for the year. As a reminder, we increased our dividends per share 11% to $1.21 from $1.09 in fiscal year 2010.", "Wal-Mart repurchased approximately $3.8 billion of shares during the fourth quarter and $14.8 billion for the year, which is the most we ever repurchased. This represents nearly 70 million and 280 million shares, respectively. We have approximately $4.8 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced in June of 2010.", "In summary, Wal-Mart returned $19.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase for the fiscal year. As Mike noted, this is truly a record return to our shareholders. Payables as a percentage of inventories for the company were 92.4%, relatively stable from 93.1% last year. Although inventory levels increased 11%, consolidated inventory turns were flat with the prior year. In addition, we effectively manage payables. ", "We continue to produce a consistently high and stable ROI. We finished the year with 19.2% return on investment compared to 19.3% at the end of last year. ", "Now, let's move on to a discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Sam's Club. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you, Jeff. As I've shared with you during the fiscal year, our strategy is to meet our members' needs and deliver on the Sam's Club brand promise of simplifying our members' lives by helping them make smart choices. We achieved that promise by understanding what our members want and providing the merchandise they want at the quality and value they expect. It's important to remember that in last year's fourth quarter, we took a charge for restructuring our operations related to the closure of 10 clubs. Our discussion today therefore excludes that charge of $174 million for comparative purposes.", "I am very excited to share our results with you today. As they indicate, Sam's members are responding to the offering and experience in our clubs. We had a strong quarter and are very pleased with our club performance. Thanks to the efforts of our dedicated managers and associates, we grew sales and operating profit, as well as leveraged expenses for the quarter and the fiscal year. Let's start with the fourth quarter results. ", "Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.7% for the 13-week period ending January 28, 2011. I am very pleased to share with you that we were at the top end of our guidance of a comp club increase of 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter. As Mike mentioned, Sam's reported sequential comp improvement quarter-by-quarter throughout the year.", "Overall, comp ticket and traffic, excluding fuel, increased for the 13-week period by 210 and 70 basis points, respectively. We are also pleased that our members, both Business and Advantage, visited with us more often and put more items in their basket and flat beds during the quarter. Sales during the quarter were particularly strong in fresh foods and grocery, health and wellness, home and apparel categories.", "Sam's Club operating income for the fourth quarter increased slightly versus last year to $487 million. Excluding fuel, operating income for the fourth quarter was flat versus last year. And now, highlights for Sam's for the full year.", "Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.7% for the 52-week period. Overall comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for the 52-week period by 180 basis points. While overall comp traffic declined slightly, we did see increases in frequency of visit by both our Advantage and Business members.", "Operating income grew 1.3% to $1.7 billion versus last year. We opened four new clubs during the fiscal year, with the most recent opening in January in Sharpsburg, Georgia. We are investing more aggressively in member acquisition ahead of club openings and are seeing positive results. We continue to see growth in the Sam's Club brand in our international markets as Doug and his team opened 14 new Sam's Clubs this fiscal year. We continue to work with the international team to share best practices across the organization to ensure we are meeting our members' needs, both in the U.S. and around the world.", "We also continue to improve our member experience by updating our older clubs. We completed 65 club remodels, expanded two clubs and relocated three clubs during the fiscal year. Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. ", "For the fourth quarter, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased to $11.9 billion which is a 2.5% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Including fuel, fourth quarter sales were $13.1 billion, which is a 4.4% increase versus last year. Price and volume of fuel contributed almost equally to the increase in fuel sales.", "For the fiscal year, net sales for Sam's Club, excluding fuel, increased 1.4% versus last year to $45.2 billion. Including fuel, net sales for the fiscal year were $49.5 billion, which is an increase of 3.5% versus last year. Fuel increases were driven by 17% increases in fuel prices and a 12% increase in gallons sold for the full year versus last year. Including fuel, comp club sales increased 4.5% and 3.7% for both the 13-week and 52-week period, respectively.", "Comp ticket, excluding fuel, increased for both Business and Advantage members for both the 13-week and the 52-week period. Comp traffic, excluding fuel for both the 13-week and the 52-week period, increased for our Advantage members and declined for our Business members. Additionally, we saw our frequency improve for both Business and Advantage members, for the quarter and the fiscal year. So our members are shopping with us more often and putting more items in their baskets and flat beds. While traffic may be down with our Business members, frequency and ticket are up. We expect to continue to see pressure on Business members through late fiscal 2012.", "During the holidays, we focused our messaging on feeding the family and home entertaining, and these messages delivered strong sales in fresh foods, grocery and beverages. We introduced approximately 100 new fresh foods, including bakery programs for cookies, cake and artisan breads. The new product launches all drove mid-double-digit comp sales. And in our Freezer/Cooler category, we introduced a new high-quality appetizer program, which also drove mid-double-digit comps. Inflation in selected meat, produce and dairy categories aided increases in average unit price, partially offset by downward unit pressure.", "We also had a very successful holiday season in key discretionary categories, such as home, domestics and apparel. The team did a great job providing high-quality merchandise and preferred brands at a tremendous value to our members. We transitioned well from holiday season, minimizing markdowns and ending the year in a strong inventory position. ", "Relative to the industry, we are very pleased with the sales of our electronics and technology categories in the fourth quarter and grew market share over the fiscal year. Members responded well to our strong brand offering, including LG and the Apple iPhone and iPad. We continue to experience price pressure in electronics, especially in televisions, but had positive unit sales growth of TVs for the quarter. Our expanded health and wellness offering continues to drive strong sales performance. Tobacco and fuel sales also continue to deliver strong comps. ", "Sam's gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased by eight basis points during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the continued [ph] shift in merchandising mix towards higher margin fresh products, very effective management of seasonal merchandise to minimize markdowns and improved global sourcing. Through improved sourcing, we decreased our damage rates throughout the year. Including fuel, the gross margin rate for the quarter decreased 11 basis points compared to last year.", "Recall that last year's inventory levels were lower than our historic levels due to inventory management initiatives. It's not surprising that our inventory is up. We closed the year with inventory up 14% compared to this time last year. We feel we've returned to a more comfortable inventory level that provides a good balance of flow and availability. We anticipate this trend of period-over-period inventory growth to continue into the first quarter. Additionally, we have shifted shipping volume forward into the year to meet our earlier club seasonal transition dates. Due to these items, our inventory turns were down slightly in the fourth quarter.", "Operating expenses for the fourth quarter grew 3.4% versus last year. During the fourth quarter, we incurred charges for certain assets that were taken out of service, including the temporary closure of a club in Rhode Island we plan to rebuild, as well as costs associated with continued restructuring of our field organization. If you exclude these items, we leveraged operating expenses by approximately six basis points.", "For the fiscal year, operating expenses grew 2.5%, driven by credit card interchange fees, remodeling, and higher marketing investments that drive traffic. Despite this, we were still able to leverage expenses for the fiscal year. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 223 basis points. Units per labor hour increased 27 basis points for the fourth quarter versus last year. For the fiscal year, sales per labor hour increased 198 basis points and units per labor hour increased 172 basis points. ", "Membership and other income for the fourth quarter decreased 1.9% from last year. Membership income, the primary driver, was flat for the fourth quarter versus last year. Other income decreased 15% due to last year's results being favorably impacted by a number of miscellaneous items, none of which was individually significant to the financial statement. For the fiscal year, membership and other income decreased 2.2% driven in part by a favorable accounting adjustment in the third quarter of last year to membership income. Excluding the effects of the accounting adjustment last year, membership income, the primary driver, increased approximately 80 basis points compared to last year. The increase was driven by strength in our Plus membership upgrades, as well as the number of new members joining at the Plus level.", "We continue to be pleased with the progress of our eValues program for Plus members, as we enhanced the program to make it even more meaningful for our members. Additionally, we are further simplifying the way we communicate value offered to our Plus member. For example, we've always offered a discount to our Plus members on their prescriptions, but the discount varied across prescriptions. Now it's a simplified program, with an 8% discount on branded prescriptions and a 40% discount on generics, not part of our $4 and $10 generic prescription plan. Our members understand it clearly and it's paying off with upgrades.", "Our membership renewal rates remained steady throughout the year. Our win back program targeted to inactive members also contributed to our improved membership rates. We expect small businesses to continue to be under pressure throughout fiscal 2012 and anticipate continued softness in business member sign-ups.", "For the fiscal year, operating income increased 1.3% versus last year. Fiscal 2012 is underway. Our plan is focused on delivering the financial priorities of growth, leverage and return. Our existing fleet of U.S. clubs will grow. As we shared with you in October, we plan to add between seven and 12 new, expanded or relocated clubs next year in the United States. Sam's Club has committed a significant portion of our capital spend to remodels. We expect to complete remodels on 60 to 70 clubs this year. Our CapEx plan for the fiscal year remains the same at approximately $1 billion.", "Our strategic initiatives will continue to be driven by insights, quality and innovation. In merchandising, we continue to provide our members the best prices on everyday need purchases, leverage fresh foods and grocery to feed our members' family, continue investing in areas like technology services and expand our progress in making Sam's Club a destination for our members' health and wellness needs.", "In membership, we will step up our efforts to attract new members and continue to focus on building relationships with existing members across a variety of touch points, including eValues, wireless network access in clubs, our smartphone application and an improved .com site to allow for easier member interaction, and operations we are focused on driving member experiences that are efficient and engaging.", "Our sales momentum for fiscal 2011 is carrying over into the first few weeks of the new fiscal year. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from January 29, 2011 through April 29, 2011, to increase between 1% and 3%. Last year, Sam's Club comp, without fuel, for the first quarter comparable 13-week period rose 70 basis points. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Doug to tell you about Wal-Mart International. Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks, Brian. This year has been another one of meaningful achievement for the team in Wal-Mart International, both in financial terms and in our positive impact in the communities we serve around the world. Our financial goals remain grounded in growth, leverage and returns, and Wal-Mart International continues to have strong growth in both net sales and operating income. On the topic of growth, I'm pleased to say that we've met our goals of opening locally relevant formats as we discussed in the October meeting for the investment community. In fiscal 2011, our organic growth included 458 net new stores, representing an 11.2% increase in store count and a 7.8% increase in square footage. This growth includes 282 new stores in smaller formats, each less than 40,000 square feet. ", "In addition to comp store sales growth and the delivery of our new stores, we are excited about our pending investment in South Africa and the sub-Saharan region of Africa. In addition, we continue to work towards completion of our acquisition of the Netto stores in the U.K. ", "Given that we're recapping the end of the year, please allow me to take just a minute and highlight some of the successes our teams have delivered beyond the quarterly financial results. For the second year in a row, Wal-Mart Central America was named the Most Admired Multinational Company in Central America. Wal-Mart China received several honors including the Best Retail Place to Work and a China Best Employer. Our ASDA team in the U.K. was selected as Britain's Best Value Retailer for the 12th consecutive year. In addition, Wal-Mart Mexico's foundation received the prestigious 2010 World Business and Development Award granted by the United Nations development program, the International Chamber of Commerce and the International Business Leaders Forum. The award recognized the foundation's indigenous product commercialization program, which offers training and funding to boost the production processes of marginalized communities and indigenous groups living in isolated regions to improve their income and quality of life.", "And in India, we opened our second training center to teach our associate candidates the skills of being a successful Wal-Mart retailer. Enabling our associates in India is a critical part of our success. You can imagine the students' surprise when, while he was in India recently, Mike Duke stopped by the classroom to answer their questions. To date, more than 3,000 students have been certified and 1,050 have been placed in various jobs, out of which nearly 200 are placed in our best priced modern wholesale cash and carry stores. These are the associates that will help us fuel our growth in the country. ", "Now let's get to the numbers. For the full year, our business achieved constant currency sales of $104.8 billion or 7.6% growth over fiscal 2010. Our constant currency operating income of $5.4 billion grew even faster at 9.7%. I'm also pleased to say that we leveraged operating expenses for the year. All markets grew full year constant currency sales over last year, with some of the highest increases coming from Brazil, China and Mexico. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses grew slower than sales at 5.8% due to strong expense management in Japan and the United Kingdom. On a constant currency basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. ", "On a reported basis, Wal-Mart International's net sales were $109.2 billion in fiscal 2011, growing 12.1% over fiscal 2010. This includes a $4.5 billion benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Operating income was $5.6 billion, including a benefit of $231 million from changes in currency exchange rates. ", "Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter constant currency sales were $30.7 billion, growing 6.6% over last year. On a constant currency basis, operating income was $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter constant currency operating income growth of 4% was slower than sales growth. While gross profit margin and expenses remain constant as a percentage of sales, this year's constant currency operating income did not have the benefits of real estate sales in Canada that we had last year. ", "Constant currency operating expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year as expense leverage in Mexico and the U.K. offset pressures in our other markets. On a reported basis, fourth quarter net sales were $31.4 billion, growing 8.9% from last year. Net sales for the fourth quarter include a $664 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. Fourth quarter operating income was $2 billion, including a $58 million benefit from changes in currency exchange rates. ", "For the quarter, we did not meet our goal of growing inventory at less than half the rate of sales and we're intent on making improvements here. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew at 12.6%. Days-on-hand increased 0.4 days over last year. Adding many of this year's new stores in the fourth quarter had a significant effect on this metric. ", "Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. As a reminder, we hold country management accountable for their results on a local currency basis without the impact of potential swings and exchange rates. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comps are presented in nominal rates. In Mexico, Walmex continues to deliver great results, growing sales in the fourth quarter and growing operating income faster than sales. Until Walmex has annualized its March 2010 acquisition of Central American operations, the following discussion will include only Walmex's results in Mexico. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP, so some of the numbers may be different.", "Walmex's net sales for the fourth quarter were up 9.2% and comparable store sales were up 2.9%. The sales growth at Walmex is driven by the 255 stores and six restaurants that have opened since the fourth quarter of last year, positive comp growth in all Walmex formats and good holiday sales. Customer traffic increased 10 basis points and average ticket increased 2.9% in comparable stores. For the fourth quarter, Walmex comp store sales for self-service formats grew by 2.5%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry excluding Walmex showed only 1.3% growth. ", "Walmex's fourth quarter operating income grew faster than sales at 15.2% on a higher gross profit margin and expense leverage. Fourth quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 79 basis points from last year, and discipline in expenses allowed for expenses as a percentage of sales to decline by 27 basis points. ", "Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the fourth quarter amid some exciting changes that are happening in our operations there. However, we did not grow operating income faster than sales. Although we are disappointed with this year's results in Brazil, we've already begun the changes to see business improvement. In January, Brazil began implementing EDLP. Shelf prices on more than 2,000 items were reduced the week of the launch and additional items are being moved to EDLP every week. Over the long term, we expect the EDLP in Brazil to increase sales volume and reduce operating costs as we've seen in Japan. During this period of change, however, we expect some sales pressure in Brazil. ", "In real terms, Brazil's fourth quarter sales growth was 7.8% and comparable store sales were flat. Customer traffic at comparable stores declined 5.2% and average ticket increased 5.5%, both in real terms. Sales at our cash and carry and supermarket formats performed well during the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 93 basis points over last year due to margin pressure last year. Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 161 basis points, primarily due to adding many of this year's new stores in the fourth quarter. This increase in expenses caused Brazil's operating income to decline by 41.7% from last year. In the past 12 months, we have opened 45 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 479. This includes 27 new stores in the fourth quarter of this year.", "Moving to Asia. Wal-Mart Japan has seen success from its implementation of EDLP, growing sales in the fourth quarter. However, operating income did not grow faster than sales. The results are showing that customers prefer EDLP. Based on information from the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, our performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan and we are increasing our market share in a deflationary environment. ", "Fourth quarter net sales and comparable store sales increased approximately 3.1%, both in real terms. Wal-Mart Japan's traffic increased 2% over last year as the newly remodeled stores continue to attract customers, and average ticket in real terms increased 1.5%. Wal-Mart Japan sales of food, consumables and general merchandise each showed a strong performance, while apparel sales were down. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased slightly by 19 basis points from last year and expenses as a percentage of sales increased 63 basis points from last year. As with last year, fourth quarter operations were again profitable. As Mike mentioned earlier, Wal-Mart Japan has grown full year profits for each of the past three years, with this fiscal year being the best of the three years. We look forward to the continued impact of EDLP there.", "Overall, China sales grew in the fourth quarter as well, but operating income did not grow faster than sales. Net sales for the fourth quarter in Wal-Mart China grew 9.6% over last year and comparable stores growth was 1.8%. Average ticket grew 9.6% in China but traffic declined 7.2%. The primary traffic decline resulted from Trust-Mart finalizing its merchandising transition to Wal-Mart assortments. Fourth quarter gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 96 basis points over last year, primarily due to purchasing efficiencies from growing sales and a reduction in the low-margin assortments at Trust-Mart. Expenses as a percentage of sales grew 197 basis points primarily due to the lower sales during the Trust-Mart merchandising transition to Wal-Mart's assortments. Fourth quarter operating income declined approximately 8%. ", "In the past 12 months, we opened 49 new stores including 45 supercenters and that brings our China store count to 328 stores. Wal-Mart and the selling shareholder of Trust-Mart have mutually agreed to extend the closing of the remaining Trust-Mart stores to May 26, 2011, while certain conditions of the contract are completed. ", "Before moving on, let's give a brief update on India. As you know, we support Bharti Retail and their new store growth in India. Bharti Retail, whose stores are excluded from our store counts, opened 30 new stores in the fourth quarter of this year and now operates 118 supermarkets and 10 compact hypermarkets. In our separate joint venture with Bharti, we've increased the number of cash and carry stores to five. Fourth quarter comparable sales at our cash and carry stores increased 11.3% over last year.", "Turning now to the United Kingdom. ASDA continued to grow sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of this year. However, operating income grew at a slower rate than sales as ASDA increased price investments during the holiday season. In the fourth quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.6% with overall sales growth in the low single digits. Average ticket grew 3% and traffic declined 1.4% in the fourth quarter as customers made larger purchases and shopped less frequently in the U.K.'s record December snowstorm. Sales were strong in clothing, toys and sports, and grocery.", "ASDA launched its price guarantee last April where customers can go online and with a few clicks, check their basket price against competitors. Over 1 million customers checked their baskets in 2010. Recently, ASDA strengthened its commitment to price, guaranteeing to be 10% cheaper than its competitors and an additional 800,000 baskets have already been checked under the 10% program. Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined slightly in the fourth quarter. Expenses as a percentage of sales were slightly lower than last year under ASDA's \"We Operate for Less\" program. However, the expense performance was not enough to offset the decline in gross margin.", "ASDA continues to broaden its appeal and sales of ASDA's premium brand \"Extra Special\" performed strongly over the Christmas period. According to Kantar Worldpanel, \"Extra Special\" was the fastest growing premium brand of the major retailers. Chosen By You, ASDA's mid-tier private label continues to perform well, and in the first quarter of next year will be extended to grocery, meal solutions and chilled foods. ", "ASDA opened six new stores during the fourth quarter, including four superstores and two supermarkets. ASDA's commitment to Saving Customers Money Every Day will be more important in 2011 as VAT taxes in the U.K. have risen to 20% compared to 17.5% at this time last year and fuel prices rise to record levels. ", "And finally with Canada. Wal-Mart Canada sales grew in the fourth quarter of this year. However, operating income did not grow faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.8% in the fourth quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in food, hardlines and health and wellness. This translated into fourth quarter comparable sales growth of 40 basis points. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was relatively unchanged from last year's higher rate and expenses were relatively unchanged from last year as strong cost controls in our retail operations offset the costs from our new bank. ", "Operating income declined as last year's results included the gains from sales of some of our real estate properties. Excluding these gains, operating income would have increased from the fourth quarter of last year. While operating income from our retail operations grew in line with sales, this growth was offset by the startup costs of our new bank.  Average ticket increased 60 basis points for the fourth quarter and traffic declined 20 basis points.", "In the past 12 months, we opened eight new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 325 stores. In fiscal 2012, we expect to open 40 new supercenters in key regions around the country. Canada continues to offer significant opportunity and we have a winning strategy to capture a greater share of this market. Building on our long track record of growth and performance, we are confident in our ability to expand and we see a long-term opportunity to serve our customers in more ways. ", "I'd also like to mention that in the beginning of the fourth quarter, Canada opened the first sustainable fresh food distribution center estimated to be 60% more energy-efficient than traditional refrigerated centers and saving approximately $4.8 million in energy costs over five years. The 400,000-square-foot Balzac facility is among the most energy-efficient distribution centers in North America. ", "Looking forward into fiscal 2012, we remain committed to sales growth and growing our operating income faster than sales each quarter. Our expectations for organic growth include 23 million to 24 million new square feet in our current markets, including significant investments in soft discount formats in Mexico and Brazil, and larger formats in China and Canada. We expect our capital expenditures to continue to range between $4 billion and $4.5 billion for the fiscal year.", "Our focus on price leadership, customer service and productivity have produced good results for fiscal 2011 and we're well prepared to meet our fiscal goals in 2012 in more than 4,550 stores. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Bill for the update on Wal-Mart U.S. Bill?", "William Simon", "Thank you, Doug. As Mike said, we were disappointed with our sales performance. Our 1.8% comp decline for the fourth quarter didn't meet anyone's expectations. They certainly didn't meet mine, period. For the fourth quarter and the full year, we again delivered strong operating income and we continue to leverage operating expenses. The P&L is in excellent shape, all we need is top line growth. ", "Let me start with the fourth quarter recap of merchandising and I'll get into financial results for the quarter and the full year and wrap up with a look at our expectations going forward. ", "Certainly as others have reported, whether an individual tax refund loan delays or headwinds for the fourth quarter sales, but the primary factor for our negative comp sales performance was General Merchandise and more specifically, electronics. It's no surprise that General Merchandise makes up a larger percentage of our sales mix for the fourth quarter, and electronics, which comprises the largest portion of the overall General Merchandise sales mix, had continued price deflation. Despite the price pressure on TVs, we still had positive unit growth and we grew market share.", "There are some bright spots in electronics. Though you may not have seen it on the sales line, we again had very strong sales of our prepaid wireless products in the fourth quarter. But recall, that we can only account for commission on sales of prepaid wireless products and services, as well as third-party gift cards. Had we been able to account for the full sale, we would have added 60 basis points to the fourth quarter comps.", "I'm pleased with our sales performance in Food and Health and Wellness businesses. Food, our largest business, delivered positive low single-digit comps in the fourth quarter. We believe the additional assortment we put in the grocery increased our relevancy for customers. We brought back many opening price point items that were important to our core customers to help generate traffic and loyalty. The modular changes for SKU add-backs in Food were mostly completed by November and contributed to better sales. The quality improvements we've made in our Produce business are also taking hold with our customers. ", "Health and Wellness comp sales were positive, driven by improvements in both pharmacy and over-the-counter categories. This came despite supply headwinds in OTC, driven by ongoing issues as a result of recalls by key suppliers and a larger-than-expected generic mix. We see many encouraging trends in our Health and Wellness business. First, our new Humana drug program enrolled more people than we expected. This provided some tailwind toward the end of the fourth quarter and will continue to do so this fiscal year. Second, the cold and cough season is picking up traction and we're well prepared. ", "Our Consumables business had low single-digit negative comps for the quarter. We'll complete our new modular sets in the first quarter, which will help us highlight opening price points and recapture traffic loss to competitors. However, in categories where we've already made modular changes such as paper products, we're seeing positive sales momentum, driven by improved customer conversion and offsetting commodity-driven deflation. ", "We posted mid-single-digit negative comps in apparel. We have seen improving sales trends in Men's, Ladies' Plus and Women's offset by a pullback in Juniors. Customers are also buying closer to need, particularly in seasonal apparel. I'm encouraged by recent trends as we add back assortment in key apparel categories including shoes and accessories.", "Home comps were low single-digit negative, though winter weather helped drive sales in snow removal and bedding. Promotional and new items as well as home management, floor care and dining did well for the holidays. Home decor continues to face headwinds. ", "Sales in our seasonal category were slightly below projections in the fourth quarter. We lost sales by having seasonal merchandise spread across too many areas of the store during the fourth quarter. Going forward, our seasonal merchandise for holidays such as Easter, Halloween and Christmas will have integrated targeted plans to present a more compelling presentation and product offering for our customers.", "Our In-store Toy business was slightly negative over the holiday season. However, combined with tremendous online Toy growth, our overall Toy sales met our expectations this holiday season. Our last General Merchandise category, hardlines, had a comp decline in low single digits. Sales growth of course sporting goods and automotive categories where we started to add back assortment, offset softer sales in large exercise equipment, crafts, stationery and books. ", "I shared with you last quarter that we began reassorting our General Merchandise categories, adding back deleted items and categories and making space allocation changes. This process will take longer than it did in the Food side of the business. With the longer lead times in General Merchandise, we will be working on this throughout the year. Product cycle times, modular changes and department space allocations are scheduled to change throughout the year. Our goal is to gain traction on these before we get into the General Merchandise-rich fourth quarter. ", "We know the power of online shopping, which industry reports said grew by 11% during the fourth quarter. Walmart.com's fourth quarter sales growth exceeded the industry and were on par with the industry leaders, and this too is a competitive advantage as we offer customers the opportunity to shop on their terms. ", "Now let us get into the financial details for the fourth quarter and the full year. As I mentioned, comp sales for the 13-week period were negative 1.8%. Slower traffic was a major factor in the comp decline, and average ticket was up slightly versus the prior year. For the full year, comps on a 4-5-4 basis declined 1.6%. For the 52-week period, average ticket was up slightly, traffic drove the majority of the comp decline. All financial details beyond comp are provided on the fiscal quarter and the year. For the full year, net sales were up 13 basis points but declined 46 basis points in the fourth quarter. ", "Inventory was up 8.2% compared to last year. Recall, we ended last year with low inventory levels as a result of our aggressive inventory reduction program. Aside from our sales shortfall in this year's fourth quarter, some of our planned initiatives deliberately increased inventory, namely the addition of merchandise in Action Alley and increased assortment. In fact, these two initiatives contributed approximately 120 basis points of the total growth. At the end of the year, we did not have any significant inventory exposure. In fact, inventory turns in the fourth quarter were flat with last year.", "Gross profit dollars improved 15 basis points for the fourth quarter. The sales decline and lower margin electronics merchandise led to a favorable mix. Gross margin rate was up 17 basis points for the quarter as a result of the favorable mix. For the year, gross margin was up $11 million or two basis points over the prior year. Our gross margin rate for the year was basically flat. ", "We leveraged operating expenses again now for five consecutive quarters. Sales per labor hour or labor productivity were up again for the quarter and even more for the full year. I want to recognize the operational performance of our stores, particularly during the intense winter weather storms in December, January and now February. Our store teams continue to increase store standards and this will position us well as we work to enhance our assortment and implement the merchandising initiatives, including adding merchandising to Action Alley. I would also add that our sales performance resulted in a decrease in the expense for incentive plans. Going forward, that's not how I want to reduce our expenses. ", "Fourth quarter operating income grew 4.8% to more than $6 billion. For the full year, operating income was up 22 basis points as a percentage of sales increased 3.1% to almost $20 billion. These are very strong results given the state of the economy and the difficulty we had during the fourth quarter on the sales line. I'm confident we can improve sales throughout the rest of the year. We spent the last six months analyzing our assortment and presentation and delving into customer insights about their shopping habits and their preference. ", "Beginning this month, we're removing the high-capacity end caps to make way for a more robust, proper Action Alley presentation. As I mentioned, space and assortment changes are now underway to improve our merchandise presentation, particularly in apparel, sporting goods, toys and hardlines in most of our U.S. stores. ", "As we've experienced, average unit retail prices are expected to continue to decrease in electronics particularly for TVs, hardware and gaming. We believe we can mitigate some of this price pressure by increasing our focus on products and categories like iPads and other tablets that offer greater growth opportunities. While we progress in the second and third quarter, we should begin to see the sales declines in these categories abate. ", "Our team is implementing a four-point plan that we expect will improve performance in our existing stores. First, Every Day Low Price leadership, savings on the basket. Wal-Mart will deliver consistent Every Day Low Price, which is what the Wal-Mart brand stands for, on a basket of goods. We also will support our messaging with targeted marketing in-store and with a variety of media.", "Two, broadest assortment possible. Under the leadership of our new chief merchant, Duncan Mac Naughton, we will continue to work with our suppliers to deliver the broadest assortment possible at the lowest price in the market. Three, improve remodel efficiency and returns. We will change our remodeling program to right-size merchandise categories and eliminate remodel disruptions. We will continue to drive efficiencies through our remodeling program to reduce capital costs and expenses. And four, access for our customers. We'll leverage Walmart's strength to expand multi-channel initiatives so our customers can shop on their terms. ", "We'll also make meaningful progress on growth as we expand our store format portfolio to continue to grow through supercenters which continue to offer us the best return on investment and launching small formats. The development of our small format is progressing ahead of schedule. We expect to open our first Wal-Mart Express stores in the second quarter. This will be a new format for both rural and urban locations. We're very pleased with the reception customers are giving potential Wal-Mart stores in cities such as Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York and San Diego. As I said, we're driving efficiencies in our remodeling program. ", "In October, we projected a range of $7.5 billion to $8 billion for our capital expenditure budget for fiscal 2012. We're now expecting our capital, including remodeling and logistics, will be between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. We continue to expect to add 11 million square feet of selling space, which will be between 185 and 205 units. We'll also continue to convert discount stores to supercenters. ", "The first quarter of fiscal 2012 is underway. Pressure from higher energy and commodity costs are factors that we'll watch closely as they affect our own logistics and transportation costs, as well as the prices the customer pays. Rising gas prices and still-high unemployment levels weigh on the minds of our customers. These issues affect discretionary spending and figure into our assessment for guidance. The use of government assistance programs continues to rise and is up about 50 basis points over this time last year. Close to 80% of our payment mix is still made up of some form of cash including debit cards. Credit as a form of payment has dropped from last year and is now less than 14% of our payment tender. ", "During the fourth quarter, inflation in dairy, meat and produce were somewhat offset by deflation in snacks, beverages and dry grocery. Weather issues have affected crop availability in produce and we expect to see continued inflation in fresh food categories. ", "Labor and higher cotton prices are affecting apparel and home categories, and softlines were consolidating suppliers to improve purchasing power and leveraging our buying power with raw material suppliers. We continue to work with our suppliers to reduce inflationary pressure where possible and only pass on price increases when they cannot be avoided. Our logistics team continues to increase productivity and efficiency, and I'm happy to report that for the full year, cases per hour were up 5.6% for the year over last year. Our transportation efficiency increase measured in cases per mile improved 4% for the year. We expect that our productivity initiatives can help mitigate higher fuel prices this year and further increase efficiencies in fiscal 2012.", "Last year, our 13-week comp for the first quarter declined 1.4%. We expect Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the first quarter running from January 29, 2011 through April 29, 2011, to range from negative 2% to flat. Let me remind you, the changes that I outlined will take time before we see positive comp trends. ", "We expect our productivity initiatives to continue to help us leverage expenses in the first quarter, even on lower sales. We're forecasting our inventory levels to remain somewhat higher than last year through the first half of this year as we implement the changes I've covered. And last, we expect gross margin to be flat to slightly up for the quarter. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Charles for the rest of the guidance discussion.", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Bill. Let's get right into our financial scorecard. First, growth. Despite continued economic headwinds, we grew both sales and square footage. Sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and 3.4% or almost $14 billion for the year. By adding 511 net units this year, we continue to provide access for customers to save money so they can live better. Net square footage increased by approximately 33 million square feet, to almost 985 million square feet at the end of the year. Wal-Mart International alone contributed over 20 million square feet or more than 60% of this year's increase. Much of this growth in International was focused on emerging markets, where we believe there are excellent growth and return prospects. ", "We plan to deliver square footage growth of 3% to 4% and we were just about in the middle, growing selling space by 3.4% for the year. We continue to expect to increase square footage between 3% to 4% for fiscal 2012, and this takes into account our move in the U.S. towards smaller, more productive supercenters. ", "Next metric, leverage. Our focus on the productivity loop has been a company priority for just over a year. We are proud that the company leveraged expenses now for five consecutive quarters. All segments contributed to the company leveraging expenses for the year. Their continued focus has helped make a significant contribution to our bottom line. This will continue to be an important focal point. ", "One area where I can say I'm proud of our progress on leverage is in unallocated corporate overhead. The focus of our corporate support teams paid off with a year-over-year decline in corporate expenses. Looking forward to fiscal 2012, we have some planned investments in global e-commerce which will be reflected in unallocated corporate overhead. These are strategically important to the company but may contribute to higher growth in these unallocated expenses.", "As we close the year, I'd also like to recognize the progress that our teams around the world have made on converting our financial systems to SAP. We're not finished yet, but the majority of our business now operates on the new system. We surpassed the largest implementation earlier this year with the transition of our North American operations. The countries still on the list to transition to SAP are all of those in Latin America, China and India. This will provide a common platform to better integrate acquisitions in the future.", "Finally, returns. Our commitment, which I mentioned at the October Analyst Meeting, was to keep ROI stable, which we did again this year. Return on investment was relatively flat at 19.2% compared to 19.3% last year. This is a very strong return relative to our competitors. I also mentioned back in October that quarterly fluctuations will occur based on our operations. For example, an acquisition may initially be dilutive to ROI. However, in the mid to long term, our continued goal is to maintain a stable ROI.", "Free cash flow for the year was $10.9 billion. This is incredibly strong and gives the company tremendous flexibility. Well, let me remind you that last year, we reduced inventories in Wal-Mart U.S. by approximately $2 billion. This made our inventory artificially low and makes the comparison difficult between last year and this year. We were not expecting to be at last year's level and we are very happy with our operating results to produce another year of strong returns. Now let's move on to guidance.", "Based on our views of the economic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect first quarter of fiscal 2012's diluted earnings per share to be between $0.91 and $0.96, which compares to last year's EPS of $0.87. The company's expectations for full fiscal 2012 EPS is to be between $4.35 and $4.50, an increase from fiscal 2011 underlying EPS of $4.07. These estimates assume that currency exchange rates remain at current levels. For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between the range of 33.5% and 34.5%, although we may see some quarterly fluctuations. Factors which may affect our rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of international to domestic income. ", "In October, we announced our capital expenditure plan of between $13.5 billion and $14.5 billion for the year. Based on where we ended fiscal 2011 and reviewing our capital needs based on efficiencies for new stores and remodels, we are now reducing our guidance to $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. This lowers the top and bottom of our range by $1 billion. If we have more opportunities to invest in emerging markets like China, we will do so. Let me remind you that this guidance does not include CapEx for any acquisitions. ", "The new guidance ranges are as follows: Wal-Mart U.S., $6.5 billion to $7 billion, down from $7.5 billion to $8 billion; Wal-Mart International, $4 billion to $4.5 billion, unchanged; Sam's Club, $1 billion, unchanged; and corporate and other will be $1 billion, unchanged.", "I am pleased and honored to serve as Wal-Mart's Chief Financial Officer, and I am proud of the finance organization I have the opportunity to lead. We remain committed to driving strong operations with the foundation of a strong financial position. This is key to delivering long-term shareholder growth. This mission is intrinsically linked with our mission to save customers money so they can \"live better\". As a company, we will continue to focus on leveraging our cost structure and global footprint, along with driving the right balance between growth and returns.", "Let me remind you of Wal-Mart's key numbers for this fiscal year of 2011 that just ended. Almost $11 billion in free cash flow; a return on investment of over 19%; over 30 million net new square feet; and over $19 billion return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. These numbers represent the commitment and hard work of our associates around the world, the strength of the Wal-Mart business, and the continued execution of our strategic plans.

", "The forward-looking statements also include statements that discuss management's expectations regarding Wal-Mart's effective tax rate for fiscal 2012, quarterly fluctuations in that tax rate and the factors that may impact that tax rate. The forward-looking statements made in this call also discuss, among other matters, management's expectations that the transition in the area of general merchandise in connection with the 4-point plan of the company's Wal-Mart U.S. operating segment will not be completed until the second half of fiscal 2012; that it will take time to shift the culture in Wal-Mart's Brazilian operations to the Every Day Low Price model and improve the profitability of those operations; that Wal-Mart's Sam's Club operating segment will add even more value to Wal-Mart's overall portfolio; that there will be ongoing activity in the e-commerce area around the world; that Wal-Mart will continue to manage the business for the short term and long term; and that Wal-Mart will continue to grow comps and open new stores.

", "These forward-looking statements also include statements that discuss management's expectations with respect to the Wal-Mart U.S. operating segment; that the addition of more SKUs throughout all categories will result in further traction and improve both traffic and ticket; that the new Humana program in the Pharmacy area will drive positive results in the coming months; that results across the Hardlines business will improve; that adding back deleted items in more categories will continue to take time; that momentum with respect to the indoor categories will pick up during the second quarter of fiscal 2012; that the segment will open 140 to 160 new and converted units and, in certain areas, between 30 and 40 new Neighborhood Market stores in fiscal 2012. ", "Regarding the segment's commitment to small-format stores, the several Wal-Mart Express pilot stores will initially be opened in rural and urban areas with a goal to have 15 to 20 stores by the end of fiscal 2012; that the Wal-Mart Express stores will include the Site to Store program; that there will be differences among the pilot stores as to the assortments and services offered to determine the right model for such format; that the segment will complete its store remodels in less time than in the past 2 years; and that such remodels will be less disruptive to customers and associates; that the segment's Pick Up Today program will be in 3,000 of the segment stores by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and will have continued growth as more items become available in that program; that the segment will not repeat its deep rollback programs; that changes in gas prices and inflation will influence the actual performance of the segment concerning the effect of the segment's continued focus on productivity initiatives; that the segment's inventory levels will return to normal Wal-Mart levels by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2012; and regarding Wal-Mart's commitment to be there to help communities affected by natural disasters.

And the information on this call should be read in conjunction with that annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q and together with all its other filings, including current reports on Form 8-K, which we have made with the SEC through the date of this call.

This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Key information for this quarter, including updated unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, is available on our website at walmartstores.com/investors. A full transcript of the call will be available on the website after 7 a.m. Central Time today on May 17, 2011. Historical data can also be found on the site as well. ", "We have a full agenda for today's first quarter recap. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., will start off with the key results and commentary on our business strategies. As you can see from our press release this morning, we do have some discrete items that are accounted for in our results. So Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial results, including more analysis on the noise. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up will be Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, will cover the overall results for International as well as our 6 largest countries. We will close the segment discussion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. Finally, our CFO, Charles Holley, will present our financial report card and our guidance for the second quarter. ", "Recall that we do not provide a full year guidance update this quarter. In our fourth quarter call from February, we said that we would no longer provide details on the membership and other income line except for Sam's Club because it's only relevant and material for Sam's. In this quarter, we include a discussion of a gain from the sale of an investment in Chile that is included in other income. Also, as we do from time to time, we will make reclassifications for consistency. ", "Let me remind you as you listen today that our fiscal calendar for Wal-Mart International is different from the corporate fiscal calendar. All of our International countries, with the exception of Canada, end their fiscal quarter on March 31, while our consolidated financials end on April 30. This is particularly important given the shift in the Easter timing this year. International sales from Easter in all but Canada will be included in the second quarter results. ", "And finally, our Annual Meeting of Shareholders is Friday, June 3, at the Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas. We'll start promptly at 7 a.m. Central Time. If you can't join us in person, the meeting will be available via webcast on the corporate website. That's walmartstores.com. ", "Now Mike, let's get started with our first quarter results. Mike?", "Mike Duke", "Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart is reporting EPS of $0.98 from continuing operations, exceeding our guidance range for the first quarter. This reflects the stability and strength of our global operations. ", "Let me dive into some of the key numbers for the quarter. Net sales were up 4.4% to $103.4 billion with strong contributions from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. Wal-Mart U.S. comps were negative 1.1%, which was roughly the mid-point of our guidance. Sam's Club comp of 4.2% was 120 basis points above guidance. Consolidated operating income was up 2.8% to $5.9 billion. ", "The company leveraged operating expenses. The really great thing is that we have many more opportunities to leverage our scale, technology and innovative processes across the entire business. Return on investment was down due primarily to currency translation and cash accumulations. Jeff will provide additional details. For the quarter, the company returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. ", "Now let me move on to the highlights of the individual operating segments. The Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales decline of 1.1% was within our guidance range. We recognize we still have work to do, and comp sales growth remains the greatest priority for me and the entire Wal-Mart U.S. team. The good news is that the plan Bill Simon and his team are executing is gaining traction. Bill will elaborate more on our progress. We're focused on delivering EDLP in a wide assortment, and customers are responding favorably where we've made the most progress on executing the plan. I'm encouraged with what I hear from customers when I visit our U.S. stores. In grocery, we are further along with the transition, but the work on general merchandise will not be completed until the second half of the year. ", "Our business model positions us well for customers who appreciate the one-stop shopping that our U.S. supercenters offer. Despite improvements in some areas of the economy, core Wal-Mart U.S. customers are still stretched. They remain concerned about rising prices for gas, energy and food as well as employment issues. Customers trust us to be their ally in fighting rising gas prices and inflation. We continue to earn that trust when we deliver on our commitment to EDLP. ", "International remains the key growth driver for our company, and the segment has seen continued growth through a combination of comps and new stores. We will see the results of the Easter sales in the second quarter in our International markets, so I'm pleased to report that almost every market had strong sales growth this quarter. Mexico, China and Chile, not only had the best comp growth, but also the highest percentage sales increase for the quarter compared to last year. It's not a surprise that Japan's March sales were soft as the country continues to recover from the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami. We're pleased that we're beginning to see Japan stabilize. ", "Our overall growth comes from comp sales and new stores, but we also grow through acquisitions. In April, we completed the acquisition of the Netto stores in the U.K., and the transition is underway to convert these stores to the ASDA brand. The Netto transaction and its results will show up in our second quarter. We're waiting for the outcome of the competition tribunal hearings in South Africa on our proposed investment in Massmart. ", "I continue to see tremendous opportunity in the emerging markets like Brazil. Last month, I spent a week traveling to 3 cities in Brazil where I visited 25 stores. I believe that the transition underway to EDLP is right for our customers, though it will take time to shift the culture and improve the profitability. ", "Operating income for Wal-Mart International was up 1.2% on a reported basis. International did not leverage expenses, so there is further opportunity on SG&A. ", "Sam's Club delivered really good results this quarter with a 4.2% comp that was well above our guidance. I really like the positive momentum at Sam's Club, which is reflected, not only in comp sales, but also in increases in new members. We've been upgrading the quality and the value of our offering at Sam's, and the results are strong across-the-board. This quarter delivered the highest member experience scores that Sam's has ever had. ", "I'm proud of the work of the Sam's Club team. They also delivered strong operating income and leveraged expenses. The warehouse club channel is increasing in importance in the retail landscape, and Sam's is gaining further momentum. We expect Sam's to add even more value to the company's overall portfolio. ", "Wal-Mart has a tremendous growth opportunity in e-commerce. Customers today want continuous shopping channels, and they want price transparency. We're bringing together our stores, logistics expertise and systems to create an integrated shopping experience that moves seamlessly with the customer from the store to web-enabled devices. ", "Over the last few weeks, you've also seen us ramp up investments in new talent and technology. We closed on the acquisition of Kosmix, and our teams are integrated into @WalmartLabs in Silicon Valley. This acquisition allows us to expand our capabilities in the online social commerce environment. ", "The growth potential of e-commerce is especially significant in markets like China. We are committed to being at the forefront of this growth. On Friday, we announced that we are acquiring a minority stake in Yihaodian, one of China's leading online retailers. Yihaodian has achieved a significant position in online grocery sales as well as general merchandise, including electronics and apparel. We expect ongoing activity in the e-commerce area around the world. ", "We know our customers also expect us to be a leader on the issues that matter to them. In April, we issued an expanded Global Responsibility Report in which we provided greater transparency and accountability on our efforts to be a responsible company around the world. We're pleased with the response to this report. ", "As we build the next-generation Wal-Mart, staying close to the front lines of the business is at the top of my agenda, and I expect the same of every member of our leadership team. From Brazil to Silicon Valley, I visited more than 75 stores in this quarter alone. Everywhere I go I see customers working hard to make ends meet. Inflation and gas prices are adding to the pressures. They look to us to help them save money and live better. ", "I've never been more confident in the relevance of our EDLP promise and our talented teams delivering on that promise. Wal-Mart will continue to manage the business for the short term and the long term. We will grow comps and open new stores, and we remain committed to leveraging expenses and improving returns for our shareholders. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for more details on our financial results. Jeff?", "Jeff Davis", "Thank you, Mike. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Wal-Mart's income from continuing operations was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart were $0.98, an increase of 12.6% compared to $0.87 for the first quarter last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations included the benefit of approximately $0.01 per share related to currency translation. In the first quarter last year, earnings per share benefited from currency translation by $0.02. ", "In addition to the impact of currency translation, we have several other discrete items that impacted the first quarter. All the following numbers are pretax. We realized approximately $117 million from the mark-to-market gains on foreign currency derivative positions. ASDA recorded an approximate $67 million charge related to the removal of future benefit accruals and the effect of future pay increases from its defined benefit plan. Wal-Mart Japan incurred approximately $51 million casualty loss related to the March earthquake and tsunami. And finally, Wal-Mart Chile recorded approximately $51 million gain from the sale of an investment. ", "All of these items are included in operating expenses with the exception of the gain from the sale in Chile, which is recorded in membership and other income. The net summary of these items accounted for approximately $0.01 of our EPS for the first quarter. ", "As Mike mentioned, consolidated net sales increased by 4.4% or $4.3 billion to $103.4 billion for the quarter. The increase in sales was driven by Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club and included a currency exchange rate benefit of $1.3 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 3% to $102.1 billion. ", "The 13-week U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 0.3%. You will hear more details on the Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's comp sales from Bill and Brian. ", "For the quarter, gross margin on sales was 24.4%, down 30 basis points compared to last year, driven by Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes other investment in global e-commerce, decreased by 20.8% to $309 million for the quarter. The $117 million mark-to-market gains on foreign currency derivative positions were the primary drivers of the decrease. Excluding these gains and global e-commerce initiatives, our core corporate overhead expense increased approximately $15 million or 3.9% compared to last year. I'm happy to say we have EDLC focused in our corporate areas. ", "Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 18 basis points on sales growth of 4.4%. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating expenses increased 1.9%. Our focus on ensuring Every Day Low Costs remains a priority throughout the company. ", "First quarter consolidated operating income was $5.9 billion, a 2.8% increase versus last year, which included a $49 million currency benefit. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income increased 1.9% for the first quarter versus last year. ", "Net interest expense for the quarter increased 10% to $518 million. This was driven by higher debt levels compared to last year as we opportunistically issued new debt at historically low rates, offset partially by lower average interest rates on our outstanding debt. ", "The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be between 33.5% and 34.5%, although we will see some quarterly fluctuations. Changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations may impact our effective tax rate. ", "First quarter consolidated inventory grew 9.5% compared to last year. The inventory growth was primarily covered by a comparable increase in payables. Payables as a percentage of inventories remained stable at approximately 90%. In addition, consolidated inventory turns remained stable. ", "In the first quarter, we issued $5 billion of long-term bonds for general corporate purposes at tighter levels than preliminary pricing guidance suggested, indicating strong investor demand. Our AA credit rating provides continued access to low-cost debt. ", "The debt-to-total-capitalization ratio was 46.1% in the first quarter compared to 41.6% at the end of the first quarter last year. Since last year, we issued more than $10 billion in debt at historically low interest rates. We ended the first quarter with negative free cash flow of approximately $400 million due to our increased investment in inventory and timing of payments for our accrued liabilities. Free cash flow was in line with expectations. The company ended last year's first quarter with negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion due to lower-than-normal inventory levels at the end of fiscal 2010.", "Capital expenditures were approximately $2.4 billion for the first quarter compared with $2.6 billion in the first quarter last year. We added approximately 3.7 million of new retail square footage and 59 new operating units during the quarter. In the first quarter, we distributed $1.3 billion in dividends. As a reminder, we increased our fiscal 2012 annual dividend per share by approximately 21% to $1.46 from $1.21 in fiscal 2011. ", "In addition, we repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of shares during the first quarter, representing approximately 39.3 million shares. This leaves us with approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June. ", "Clearly, one of our priorities is returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter, Wal-Mart returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. ", "Return on investment or ROI for the trailing 12 months ended April 3, 2011, was 18.5% compared to 19.2% for the prior year. The primary drivers of change in ROI were the impact from currency exchange and cash held for pending acquisitions. ", "Now let's move to the discussion of our operating segments. We'll start with Sam's Club. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thank you, Jeff. I am very excited to share that Sam's Club momentum has continued into the new fiscal year. We sequentially increased our comp sales in each quarter of last year, and that momentum continued into the first quarter. ", "Comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2% for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2011, exceeding our guidance of 1% to 3%. This is our fifth quarter of sequential quarterly comp improvement. We combined solid unit sales growth and increased traffic with excellent margin management. We leveraged operating expenses this quarter. ", "Our membership acquisition performance was wrong. In fact, it was our best quarterly performance since I joined Sam's Club in March of 2009. This strength was driven by key membership events and excellent execution in the clubs. These strong results across all key areas of our business flow through to operating income, which, excluding fuel, increase faster than the rate of sales. ", "Before I get in the detailed financial results, let me address the current dynamic around fuel, an important part of our value proposition. Our fuel stations establish the initial price perception and drive traffic to the clubs. We also know that great prices on gasoline drive member loyalty in terms of renewal rates and ticket. We're pumping more gallons of fuel and generating more sales dollars per gallon this year versus last year. ", "Fuel prices in the first quarter this year are approximately 35% higher than a year ago, and gallons sold are up 22%. Including fuel, first quarter sales were $12.8 billion, a 9.4% increase over last year, and operating income increased 7% to $459 million. While top line fuel sales have increased, fuel profit on a dollar basis was basically flat to last year for the quarter. ", "We see a large impact on gross margin percentages. Volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results, both positive and negative. We will continue with our strategy around fuel to be the price leader in the market. Our discussion today therefore excludes fuel for comparative purposes unless otherwise noted. ", "Now let's turn to the detailed financial results. For the first quarter, net sales for Sam's Club increased to $11.3 billion, a 4.9% increase over last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 4.2%. Despite the impact of heavy snow in February, and flooding and tornadoes in April, comp club sales increases were strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions, and we are particularly pleased with the combined sales strength of our South and West divisions. Comp performance was driven more by our item growth than inflation. ", "Comp ticket and traffic increased for the 13-week period by 190 and 230 basis points, respectively. Comp ticket increased for both Business and Advantage members. Comp traffic increased for Advantage members and was relatively flat for our Business members. ", "Our ticket and traffic performance was driven in part due to our strategy to be the price leader in key everyday needs categories, such as grocery, cleaning and laundry. We also hosted several events, such as our second eValues Savings Celebration, in which we offered eValues to all members and the Taste of Sam's event. ", "The frequency of member visits improved for both Business and Advantage members, particularly during the weekends. We have taken an approach to the weekends in which our clubs are focused on executing specific plans to elevate the in-club experience and member service. The plans are focused on key areas that are high touch points like fresh food, grocery and the front end. These are paying off in sales and improved member experience scores. ", "From a merchandise perspective, comp increases were strong across fresh foods, grocery, home and apparel categories. We continue to see inflation in key categories, such as produce, meat and dairy. However, we managed through inflation with little impact on our margin and have seen continued growth in units sold year-over-year. The quality of our sales in our core categories was very strong, and we grew comp sales despite tobacco being a headwind during the first quarter. The challenge in tobacco is driven by the cycling of last year's tobacco pre-buys in anticipation of significant price increases as well as a change in our credit card reward program that disproportionately impacts our members who shop this category heavily. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year. Recall that the average income for a Sam's Club member is above $75,000 annually. Discretionary spend is increasing as seen in our improved sales performance in home, apparel and certain technology and entertainment categories, including consumer electronics. Our gross margin rate was flat as a percentage of sales for the first quarter. ", "For the quarter, inventory, including fuel, was up 10.6%. As we have mentioned in previous calls, we anticipated higher inventory growth rates through the quarter. These increases were driven by larger seasonal buys, earlier transition in seasonal and electronics and inflation. Additionally, we were up against historically low inventory levels last year. We expect inventory growth rates to return to a single digit in the second quarter as we manage inventory flow and members' needs. ", "As mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our progress on expense leverage and club efficiency. We reduced expenses as a percentage of sales by 17 basis points, driven by controlling wage costs. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 3.1% and units per labor hour increased 2.5%. ", "Membership and other income for the first quarter increased 40 basis points versus last year. As you know, membership income is recorded under the deferred revenue recognition basis, so it's important to understand what's going on with membership income on a cash basis. Growth in membership income on a cash basis was very strong with increases in the mid- single digits. This strength came across all membership segments, and we are very pleased with the overall membership results. Membership income in the first quarter increased 40 basis points versus last year. For the second quarter, we anticipate membership income to continue the positive momentum with key events planned to engage our members in the clubs. ", "We have also placed an emphasis on in-club renewals and on our Plus membership offering. We saw broad-based strength in renewal rates across membership categories in the quarter. Business add-on membership trends had begun to stabilize and are showing positive momentum. However, our small business members remain concerned with the economy and reduced access to credit. Therefore, we anticipate continued headwinds for our Business memberships throughout the fiscal year. ", "First quarter operating income increased to $457 million, a 6.3% increase. Our sales momentum remains strong as we enter the first weeks of the second quarter. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the current 13-week period from April 30 through July 29 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 1% for the comparable 13-week period. ", "Now I will turn the program over to Doug to share with you the results for Wal-Mart International. Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks, Brian. On March 30 and 31, we shared with you while we are so excited about the growth prospects for China and Asia at our Annual International Conference for the Investment Community in Shenzhen, China. We came with a full team, including Scott Price, Cathy Smith, Ed Chan, Ed Kolodzieski and others, and we provided additional insight into our business strategy, our Asian operations and answered many questions from the analyst community. ", "One of the key takeaways from that meeting is that we have a strategic plan in place to move Wal-Mart International from a good business into a great business, and this will be underpinned by doing what we do best: providing our customers great value through Every Day Low Prices. Our management team is focused on delivering that plan through what I referred to as the 4 dimensions of growth: comp store sales; new stores; e-commerce and multichannel; and finally, acquisitions. ", "Here is what our first fiscal quarter looked like in terms of these 4 dimensions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, all of our markets had encouraging comp store sales results with Mexico, China and Chile having the highest comps. By the way, as it relates to Chile, we've seen double-digit comp store sales for several quarters since we made this investment, and I'm really proud of the Wal-Mart Chile team and our integration team. They've done a great job. The Easter calendar change and Brazil's EDLP implementation negatively impacted our comp store sales, and I'll discuss the detail shortly. ", "As it relates to new store growth, we increased our total store count 11.8% or 487 stores for the past 12 months. This translates into 7.9% more square feet than at the end of the first quarter of last year with most of the increase in Mexico and China. ", "During the first quarter, Wal-Mart International added 2.6 million square feet of retail space through 54 units. We have had some good results internationally in the area of e-commerce and multichannel. During the first quarter of this year, ASDA's online grocery and general merchandise sales grew 20.8% from last year, and Brazil's online general merchandise sales grew 41.1%. We're learning more about the online business in China through the November 2010 launch of the Sam's Club e-commerce site. ", "As it relates to acquisitions, our team in the U.K. completed its purchase of the 147 Netto stores from Dansk Supermarked in April 2011, which falls in our second fiscal quarter. We expect to complete the in-store conversions this year, investing more than GBP 100 million and creating more than 1,500 jobs. ", "Two of our leaders in the U.K., Judith McKenna and Karen Hubbard, have done a great job getting us to this point, and we look forward to seeing the results of our conversions and integration. In fact, we have already opened our first 3 converted stores. We currently own a 35% equity interest in Trust-Mart stores and hold voting rights with respect to an additional 30% interest. We have agreed to acquire the remainder of Trust-Mart once regulatory approvals have been obtained. ", "In April, we obtained antitrust clearance and now expect to finalize the other regulatory approvals and complete the transaction by the end of this fiscal year. ", "And finally, in South Africa, competition tribunal hearings began on May 9. This is what we expect to be the final step in the approval process for our potential investment in Massmart and in sub-Saharan Africa. We remain excited about the opportunity to serve customers in this part of the world. ", "Turning to other events happening with our business. We're very proud of the passion and speed with which our associates responded to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Within the first 3 days following these events, Wal-Mart associates working across Japan quickly took action to help by setting up distribution points for relief items in our store parking lots when the stores themselves were too damaged to open. Associates brought in 95 tons of blankets, flashlights, batteries, water, emergency food and warm clothing. We will continue to actively provide assistance on the ground and monitor the situation to look for additional ways we can help. Our thoughts are with our associates, our customers and the communities we serve in the affected areas. ", "From a global perspective, food inflation has made recent headlines. Families in many countries spend a significant amount of their income just on food, and some of these countries rely heavily on imported commodities as the primary source of food. So increases in food prices can have a fast and dramatic effect in some parts of the world. We're experiencing some inflation in our sales numbers in just about every market. Argentina, Brazil and Central America are currently experiencing inflation across our basket of goods. We're seeing our highest inflation levels in Argentina, and we're doing our best to keep prices down for our customers in each market. ", "Now let's get to the numbers. Carol reminded you earlier about the one-month lag on the International calendar. Consequently, we will see the majority of this year's Easter sales in our second quarter results. Wal-Mart International's first quarter reported sales were $27.9 billion, a growth of 11.5% over the first quarter of last year. All of our markets had strong sales growth except in Japan as our sales results include the effects of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Changes in currency rates increased our net sales by $1.3 billion. Our first quarter constant currency sales grew 6.2% over last year. This growth came despite the effects of the Japan disasters and the Easter flip. Mexico, China and Chile provided the strongest net sales growth in the first quarter. Jeff detailed the results of several discrete items that affected first quarter comparative results for Wal-Mart International. Please remember these as you review our segment details. ", "Our first quarter operating income increased 1.2% over last year to $1.1 billion. However, on a constant currency basis, operating income was $1 billion, a decline of 3.3%. The decline in constant currency operating income resulted from a decline in our overall gross profit margins and the effect of the discrete items Jeff mentioned earlier. Without these discrete items, constant currency operating income increased over last year but did not grow faster than sales. Wal-Mart International's first quarter constant currency gross profit margin declined from last year due primarily to the change in sales mix associated with the Easter calendar shift and investments in price. ", "First quarter membership and other income increased from last year to the $51 million gain on the sale of an investment in Chile. Without this gain, membership and other income would've increased $23 million. Constant currency operating expenses for Wal-Mart International grew faster than sales because of the pressure from the discrete items Jeff covered. Without these items, we leveraged constant currency expenses versus last year because of strong expense management in Chile, Canada and Japan. ", "Our progress on inventory was disappointing for the first quarter of this year with days on hand increasing over last year in most of our markets. Much of the 11.4% increase in inventory has to do with new store growth, but clearly, our management teams across all countries, especially China and Brazil, have this as a priority. ", "Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams account for the results on a local currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency, and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. In Mexico, our sales continue to grow at a fast rate, and operating income grew faster than sales. This will be the last quarter we only discuss Walmex as results in Mexico. Our second fiscal quarter will be the first time we discuss consolidated results of Walmex and Central America. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP, so some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results. ", "Walmex's net sales for the first quarter were up 6.9% and comparable store sales were up 1.7%. Sales growth came from the strong new store growth program in Mexico where we have 288 more stores than at the end of the first quarter of last year. Customer traffic declined to 2.2% and average ticket increased 3.9% at comparable stores. ", "For the first quarter, Walmex comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 1.5%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, showed only 0.9% growth. Walmex's first quarter operating income grew faster than sales at 9.2% due to higher gross profit margin. ", "First quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased 54 basis points from last year. However, expenses grew 10.4%, primarily on costs of new stores and remodels. Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the first quarter, and Brazil continues to implement EDLP and increase the number of items. However, operating income declined from last year. Prices on more than 10,000 items, primarily in food, have been reduced, and this number increases each month. As I've said before and as we saw in Japan, this is a long-term initiative, so we expect to experience some pain during the conversion period. We're very confident about our opportunities in Brazil and expect to invest approximately $775 million this year, upgrading logistics, and technology and opening 80 new stores. ", "On another note, our wholesale operations, Sam's Club and Maxxi, have delivered on plan for the first quarter in Brazil. In real terms or removing the impact of inflation, Brazil's first quarter net sales and comparable sales both declined from last year. Customer traffic at comparable stores decreased 8% and average ticket increased 1.9% in real terms. As expected, first quarter gross profit margin as a percentage of sales declined 140 basis points from last year due to the migration toward a consistent EDLP offering. ", "Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 92 basis points, primarily because of the lower sales growth and 42 new stores opened since the first quarter of last year. The gross margin pressure caused a significant decline in Brazil's operating results from last year.", "Earlier, I mentioned the Online business in Brazil grew 41.1% this quarter. This was on top of last year's sales growth of 80%. We launched the e-commerce site at the end of 2008 with 10,000 products in 11 categories. Today, we offer than 70,000 products across 21 categories. ", "In the past 12 months, we have opened 42 new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 480. This includes one new store in the first quarter of this year. ", "Moving to Asia, during our investor meeting in March, Scott Price provided insight into our execution path for Japan's EDLP and EDLC implementation, and importantly, the value of successfully communicating our EDLP approach to Japanese customers. As you know, the March 2011 earthquake affected Japan and began the start of a very challenging period. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, overall supermarket comparable store sales declined by 3.3% in March of 2011. This is especially tough since this decline is on top of last year's 5.6% comp sales decline. According to METI, our performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan, and we've maintained our market share in what has been a deflationary environment. ", "Wal-Mart Japan's first quarter sales were better than overall supermarket sales. However, the effects of the earthquake and tsunami resulted in an operating loss in the first quarter of this year. First quarter net sales and comparable store sales were flat to last year in real terms. Wal-Mart Japan's traffic declined 2.8% over last year, and the average ticket in real terms increased 2.2%. Our remodeled stores had increases in average ticket of 5.7%, and our other stores had ticket increases of 1.7% both in real terms. ", "Sales in over-the-counter pharmacy, paper goods and baby had the strongest performance, while sales of electronics, apparel and cosmetics were down. Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased by 79 basis points from last year. Expenses as a percentage of sales increased 2% from last year or declined 67 basis points without the earthquake and tsunami charge. Wal-Mart China sales grew in the first quarter as well, but operating income declined slightly from last year. Net sales for the first quarter grew 12.4% over last year and comparable store growth was 4.5%. ", "Average ticket grew 11% in China, but traffic declined 5.8%. The primary traffic decline was in Trust-Mart stores. First quarter gross margin increased 54 basis points over last year, primarily due to purchasing efficiencies. Expenses as a percentage of sales grew 102 basis points, primarily due to increases in associate compensation and tax costs. First quarter operating income declined 4.2%. In the past 12 months, we opened 49 new stores, including 45 supercenters, and that brings our China store count to 333 stores. ", "Turning now to the United Kingdom. Andy Clarke and the ASDA team had a solid start to the year, growing sales in the first quarter of this year. However, operating income declined from last year, primarily as a result of the charge for the ASDA-defined benefit plan and, to a lesser extent, acquisition cost for Netto. ", "In the first quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 10 basis points. We will see ASDA's strong sales from Easter and the royal wedding in our second quarter. Average ticket in the first quarter increased 30 basis points and traffic decreased by 20 basis points. Sales of chilled foods, children's wear and home were particularly strong in the first quarter. In support of ASDA's EDLP offering, ASDA increased its price guarantee to 10% at the start of the year, and almost 3 million customer baskets have been checked online. First quarter operating income declined from last year due to the discrete charge covered earlier as well as other acquisition costs associated with the Netto purchase. Excluding these charges, ASDA's expenses grew slower than sales under the We Operate for Less program. Operating income was essentially flat to last year. ", "ASDA private brands continue to perform well with its premium brand, Extra Special, and the mid-tier brand, Chosen By You. Chosen by You has been ranked by Kantar Worldpanel as the fastest-growing private brand across the top 4 U.K. grocery retailers. In the last 12 months, ASDA has opened 12 new stores for a total store count of 386. ASDA's commitment to EDLP comes at an important time for its customers who are dealing with the burden of inflation, taxes and record petrol prices. ", "And finally, Canada. Walmart Canada sales grew in the first quarter of this year, and operating income grew faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.4% in the first quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in most categories. However, first quarter comparables sales declined 60 basis points from last year. Average ticket increased 3.6% for the first quarter and traffic declined 4.2%. As a percentage of sales, gross margin declined to 38 basis points from last year and expenses also declined 42 basis points despite the increase in cost from the new Walmart Canada Bank. The 5.8% increase in operating income from last year was a result of operating expense savings. Walmart Canada recently announced its plans to enter the Quebec grocery market with the transformation of its existing stores into supercenters. The first phase of this conversion is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of this year, and these supercenters will carry a full range of fresh food as well as general merchandise.  ", "In addition, we will open our first 5 supercenters in the province of Manitoba in the second quarter. In the past 12 months, we opened 8 new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 325 stores. This year, we expect to open 40 supercenters, including conversions and expansions. ", "There are also strong results in our other markets. We have a good track record of leveraging our processes and resources to add value for a new markets, customers and associates. Our January 2009 acquisition of D&S in Chile is a recent example. Wal-Mart Chile grew constant currency sales, 11.5% in the first quarter, and retail square footage increased by 6.5% or 31 stores. ", "Our focus on growing sales continues long after the acquisition. Constant currency sales grew 10.9% in the first quarter of this year at our Central American operations. We acquired Central America in 2005, and first quarter sales are now just under $1 billion at $950 million. ", "In closing, Wal-Mart International is well positioned to continue delivering on growth opportunities and comp stores sales, e-commerce and acquisitions. We will also continue to deliver on new store growth. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Bill for the update on Wal-Mart U.S.", "William Simon", "Thank you, Doug. Earlier in the call, Mike mentioned that we're gaining traction in our Wal-Mart U.S. business as we implement the 4-point plan that I laid out in the fourth quarter. Recall that this plan focuses on driving Every Day Low Price, delivering the broadest assortment possible, improving our remodeling efforts and integrating a multichannel experience for our customers. ", "Now our best comp performance remains in the Grocery and Health and Wellness business, both of which had positive comps in the first quarter. As I mentioned in February, these businesses delivered positive comps in the fourth quarter as well. Our negative 1.1 comp sales were the midpoint of our guidance of negative 2% to flat for the quarter. Comp sales declined for the 13-week period was driven by lower traffic, which was partially offset by an increase in ticket. Inflation provided the small tailwind. The importance of delivering Every Day Low Price has never been greater, as our customers are consolidating trips due to higher gas prices. Our greatest priority remains to grow comp sales. We're focused on our EDLP strategy and moving away from the deep discounts that were in the headlines this time last year. ", "We've launched our new ad match marketing campaign in early April, and the customer response has been terrific. Net sales rose 0.6% to $62.7 billion for the first quarter. Grocery, again, delivered low single-digit positive comps for the quarter. Our Food business is delivering positive sales growth that's on par with the top competitors, and we're seeing a recovery in our Consumables business. Customers are responding positively as we expand our merchandise assortment, adding back items across all categories. We began our SKU add back program in the third quarter with dry grocery. We're pleased with the comp sales improvement to date in this area, which is up 150 basis points from the fourth quarter. I believe that sales improvement supports our belief that we're on the right track. As we add more SKUs throughout all categories, we expect to gain further traction, improving both traffic and ticket. ", "In Consumables, we executed modular changes, the ones I mentioned last quarter, and saw positive sales momentum from categories like hair care and fragrance. These modular changes focused on bringing back assortment, ensuring opening price points were available in all categories and increased the holding power on the shelf. As an example, our air care modular was updated in February, and we've experienced an 880-basis-point comp improvement from the fourth quarter through the first quarter. ", "The paycheck cycle remains pronounced. During the quarter, we saw a continued pressure from ongoing macroeconomic conditions as customers continued to trade down to opening price points in some private label products. Our grocery inflation was approximately 1% during the quarter with the greatest impact on perishables. We continue to act as the agent for our customers by building trust through EDLP. ", "Our Health and Wellness business had a low single-digit positive comp, driven by our Prescription business. 5 years ago, Wal-Mart launched the $4 prescription drug program, a move that changed the industry and shifted more customers from branded to generic products. While this change helped drive traffic and unit sales, the increase in generic utilization does pressure the top line. However, the new Humana program, which is generating incremental pharmacy sales and other industry dynamics, more than offset this pressure. We expect this program to drive positive results in the coming months. ", "Entertainment had mid- single-digit negative comps. That area is still being impacted by price deflation in key electronics items. We did have strong TV unit sales as customers used tax refund loans during the quarter. We continue to see strong prepaid wireless sales, especially in services, though these services are not fully reflected in our top line sales. Hardlines comps were low single-digit negative. Easter crafts performed well, offset by a weakness in stationary and hardware. Automotive generated positive comp sales. Temperatures have begun to rebound this month, and we expect improved results across the Hardline business. Apparel had mid- single-digit negative comp, with the greatest weakness in kids, ladies and shoes. Where we've brought back assortment, like ladies plus, sales and trends are improving. In fact, we posted positive comp for the quarter in ladies plus. We simply are not converting enough of our grocery customers to shop apparel, and we've been working hard on strategies to improve this important area of the store. We're very focused on driving improvement in basics, including socks, underwear and T-shirts. We're adding back deleted items and even more categories, though this will continue to take time. ", "And we're investing in prices we recognize that customers have seen higher prices across the industry for cotton-related apparel. Apparel is a work in progress, but one that has a tremendous amount of an attention throughout the organization. ", "Home posted a mid- single-digit negative comp as well, impacted by delays in the start of the spring selling season. Outdoor Living, in particular, a large part of our sales plan for the quarter, had double-digit negative comps because of weather impacts. We're seeing that turn around now with more favorable weather across most of the country, and I'm pleased with how our customers are responding to our Outdoor Living assortment this month. ", "During the first quarter, most of our indoor home categories, including home decor, cooking, dining and bath, had improving sales trends, the result of offering broader assortment. We expect to see momentum pick up in indoor categories during the second quarter. Our Walmart.com Online business remained strong with an increase in traffic and order size. Electronics remained a strong category, including televisions, wireless and home office. ", "In Hardlines, tires and automotive categories are strong. And in home, we're seeing ongoing strength of sales and furniture. We're also pleased with the ongoing momentum of our Site to Store business. ", "And now I'll cover the remaining financial results. Gross profit dollars were up 0.6% over last year, in line with the first quarter sales growth, causing the gross margin rate as a percentage of sales to remain flat as expected. Our logistics team continues to implement multiple efficiency initiatives that have minimized the impact of diesel price increases on the cost of sales. ", "We were able to leverage expenses again this quarter with total SG&A up only approximately 40 basis points compared to last year. Sales per labor hour improved again for the first quarter, building on last year's progress and productivity. Marketing expenses were at more normalized levels compared to the same quarter last year. Additionally, we delivered reductions in our accident costs due to significant attention from store operations. ", "Operating income grew faster than sales at 0.8% for the quarter over last year. As expected, inventory was up 6.3% compared to this time last year. However, the year-over-year growth rate of inventory has slowed 190 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. The increase is due in part to our continued focus on bringing back assortment in grocery. 100 basis points was due to inflation, primarily in grocery categories. Approximately, 100 basis points of the increase were also due to higher in-transit inventory as we expand our global sourcing initiatives. ", "We also recognized increases in inventory for home, toys and seasonal, where weather slowed seasonal sales. Overall, the quality of our inventory remains in good shape. We can assure that Wal-mart stores are always in stock, especially for high turn items in grocery. We must make sure that all stores are customer-ready every day. ", "Our displays must come to life in terms of delivering value and excitement for our customers. We remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in the U.S. and plan to open between 140 and 160 new and converted units this year. Back in October, we shared with you that we plan to open between 185 and 205 units. Consistent with the $1 billion reduction in capital expenditures that we disclosed last quarter, we are delaying the delivery of additional in-box conversions of discount stores to supercenters as we take the time to review and adjust this initiative. Most of our capital commitment goes to supercenters. However, we're also committing to small formats, including those between 30,000 and 60,000 square feet as well as stores that will range from 15,000 to 30,000 square feet. ", "The strength of our Food business is reflected in the continued performance of our Neighborhood Market grocery stores, which average about 40,000 square feet today. We're pleased with both the comp and the returns of these grocery stores. In fact, this quarter, our Neighborhood Market comp increase was approximately 4%, driven by traffic increase of almost 2%. ", "Because of this momentum, we're starting to accelerate the opening of even more Neighborhood Markets. We're on schedule this year to open between 15 and 20 Neighborhood Market stores to capture growth in untapped markets. ", "We will also open several of the Wal-Mart Express stores as a pilot in both rural and urban areas with the goal of having 15 to 20 stores by year end. This is our new format, averaging 15,000 square feet and offering customers fresh food along with key general merchandise categories. ", "Wal-Mart Express will also include our Site to Store programs, so that customers can take advantage of Wal-Mart's broad online merchandise assortment. The Express pilots will be different, so we can determine which merchandise assortment is right for the community. Some will have pharmacy, some won't. The goal is to get the model right, so that when we have the format, we'll roll it out and it will be successful. ", "I've already talked about the first 2 points of the 4-point plan: price leadership and the broadest assortment. Our third point: We're driving efficiencies in our remodel program. Our remodels are underway this quarter and will be completed in less time than in the past 2 years. They will be less disruptive to our customers and associates. Through reengineering efforts, we're able to increase the efficiency of our remodeling plan by reducing, on average, 15% in the cost for each supercenter. ", "And finally, our multichannel integration is an important focus for our long-term growth strategy. We're testing several programs to help us better integrate the stores with our website. Our expanded Pick Up Today program is currently rolled out to 2,800 stores and doing well. While it's early for data, we're pleased with the customer response. The program will be in 3,000 stores by the end of the second quarter. We expect to see continued growth in this service as we make more items available on Walmart.com for immediate pick up. ", "Rising gas prices, high unemployment and increasing inflation continue to be the most important issues facing our customers today. One in 5 Wal-Mart moms list gasoline as a top expense behind housing and car payments. We continue to be prepared to help her with low prices and broad assortment during this time of uncertainty. ", "Last year, during the second quarter, Wal-Mart had the deep rollbacks that drove our unit sales of some items but did not deliver the intended traffic and basket lift we were looking for. We will not repeat these programs this year. ", "We're monitoring the economic environment carefully, as significant changes in gas prices and inflation during the quarter will influence our actual performance. We expect Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the second quarter period, running from April 30 through July 29, to range from negative 1% to positive 1%, and our 13-week comp for last year in the second quarter declined 1.8%. ", "Our continued focus on productivity initiatives will enable us to leverage expenses through the second quarter. Inventory will return to normal Wal-Mart levels, meaning half the rate of sales growth by the end of the third quarter after we anniversary our efforts to bring back assortment. ", "Before I close, I'd like to recognize the hard work of our associates who've been impacted by the flooding across the central plains in the South. Countless associates and customers are dealing with the effects of the rising Mississippi River. When our stores are also affected, our priorities are to get them open and operating. They're often the first place that people in the community turn to for basics and clean-up products, and Wal-Mart will be there to help our customers get back on their feet no matter what the disaster. It's part of our mission and it's part who we are. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Charles.", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Bill. Let's get right to our financial scorecard. First, growth. Jeff pointed out earlier that sales increased 4.4% in the first quarter with solid sales results from Wal-Mart International and Sam's Club. We continue to remain focused on growing comp sales and new stores throughout our markets. And let me add, comp sales improvement is our clear priority for Wal-Mart U.S. We will continue to invest in growth, and our capital plan of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion remains in place for this year. ", "We're still on track for sales growth of 4% to 6% and square footage growth of 3% to 4%. I remind you that these goals exclude acquisitions, such as Netto. We added 59 net units and approximately 3.7 million square feet of retail space since the end of fiscal 2011. International contributed almost 2.6 million square feet in the first quarter. Worldwide, we now have 9,029 units and approximately 989 million square feet of retail space. ", "We have great opportunities for long-term growth in emerging markets, such as Brazil and China. Wal-Mart U.S. will continue to open supercenters in smaller formats. In addition, Sam's Club will open between 7 and 10 clubs this year. ", "Turning to leverage. As Mike said earlier, the productivity loop remains a crucial priority for us. We continue to drive efficiencies throughout our business, which helps sustain our commitment to Every Day Low Price. For 6 consecutive quarters now, our company has leveraged operating expenses.  ", "And our third priority, returns. On a rolling 12-month basis ending April 30, 2011, return on investment ended at 18.5%. It is important to know that our underlying operations continue to maintain stable returns. ", "In March, we were pleased to report that our Board declared an annual dividend of $1.46 per share for the fiscal year, a 21% increase over the previous year's dividend. We returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders during the first quarter through dividends and share repurchase. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders. ", "Last quarter, I mentioned that the majority of our business now operates on our new SAP financial system, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada. We have completed our conversions in Mexico, and we have just recently started in Central America and Argentina. These improved systems provide more efficient financial processes around the world, allowing Wal-Mart to leverage knowledge and resources and increase consistency throughout our organization. ", "Next let's move on to guidance. Based on our views of the macroeconomic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect second quarter fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.05 and $1.10, which compares to last year's earnings per share of $0.97. These estimates assume the currency exchange rates remain at current levels. ", "In closing, I'd like to summarize a few points from our call today. We delivered strong earnings per share above our guidance for the first quarter of the fiscal year despite continued economic headwinds affecting our customers. We increased net sales by 4.4% and added approximately 3.7 million square feet of retail selling space around the world. ", "Leveraging expenses remains a priority as it serves as a pre-cursor to EDLP. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we have leveraged operating expenses. Our business model, Every Day Low Costs driving Every Day Low Prices, is central to how we operate. We are on track for company sales growth of 4% to 6% this year. We intend to grow through comp sales and new stores as well as through multichannel initiatives, including e-commerce. And finally, we remain committed to shareholder returns through share repurchase and dividends. ", "Thank you for listening today.

This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal year 2012.

A full transcript of this call will be available on the website after 7:00 a.m. Central Time today on August 16, 2011. ", "Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will open the call with his thoughts and key highlights of the quarter. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details, including information on certain items affecting our EPS. Then we'll go to the operating segments. Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. will begin our segment discussions. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International, will follow Bill. Please note in his call, the clarifications on the impact of our acquisitions. We'll close the segment discussion with Brian Cornell, President and CEO of Sam's Club. And our CFO, Charles Holley, will wrap up with our financial report card and guidance. ", "Before we discuss our second quarter performance, we do have a couple of reminders. You'll note in our press release that we have certain items affecting EPS this quarter, and Jeff will cover these shortly. As you know, we closed on the acquisitions of the 147 Netto stores in the U.K. and our majority interest in Massmart during this quarter. The Netto stores are fully consolidated into our financials but do not include any results from Massmart. The balance sheet from Massmart is consolidated using their fiscal year-end balance. Massmart continues to operate as a public company and closed their fiscal year on June 26. Massmart will report its year-end results on Thursday, August 25. ", "Many of you often ask about what's included in the non-controlling or as we used to call minority interest line. This line primarily relates to non-controlling ownership interests in Mexico, which includes Central America, as well as Chile, Trust-Mart in China, India and now Massmart. Beginning in the third quarter, we will consolidate Massmart's operations in our consolidated financials on a 1-month lag, consistent with most of our international operations. Finally, let me remind you that our fiscal calendars for international differ from that of our corporate time line. All of our international countries, with the exception of Canada, end their fiscal year on December 31, while our U.S. and Canada operations end on January 31. ", "Now Mike, let's get started with our Q2 results. Mike?", "Mike Duke", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Today, Walmart is reporting second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 from continuing operations, which is a 12.4% increase over last year and near the top of our guidance. Let's get right to the key results. Net sales increased 5.5% to $108.6 billion. Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, were flat for the 13-week period. Sam's Club comps, without fuel, were up 5%, right at the top of the guidance for the period, and Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales within guidance at negative 0.9%. International reported net sales of $30 billion, a strong 16.2% increase. We also grew internationally through 2 significant acquisitions. ", "Consolidated operating income increased 3.1%. Walmart ended the quarter with free cash flow of $4 billion. For the quarter, the company returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Operating expenses in the second quarter grew at the same rate as sales. We remain committed to the productivity loop and to strong expense management throughout the Walmart organization. We have the right initiatives in place to leverage for the full year. ", "Let's move to the highlights of the individual segments. I'm encouraged by the sales improvements in our Walmart U.S. stores. Comps have improved sequentially month-to-month within the quarter. In fact, this was the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The goal of the Walmart U.S. team remains positive comps by year end. In the second quarter, Bill Simon and the Walmart U.S. team completed the assortment add back in grocery for food and consumables, resulting in better customer traffic on this side of the store. We're making progress in expanding our general merchandise assortment and seeing positive comps in some categories such as sporting goods, but we still have work to do, and the team is focused on implementing the plan. ", "I've recently observed several consumer focus groups, and it's clear that many consumers are still struggling. They're trading down to stretch their budgets, buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons. That's why we are laser-focused on investing in price to help our customers. There certainly are many reports on Walmart pricing and the fact is, that the gap has narrowed in some cases. We're committed to widening the gap on price, and we have a specific plan and timetable to deliver EDLP to every customer. ", "Walmart U.S. also managed the business well in the second quarter, growing operating profit faster than sales to nearly $5 billion. Walmart International has strong growth again through a combination of comps and new stores. Second quarter sales grew 16.2% with sales growth in all markets except Japan, which is still recovering from the natural disasters. The international segment is an increasingly important part of our growth story and operating income improved nearly 9% in the second quarter. ", "I am pleased that we closed on the acquisitions of Netto and Massmart, and integration is well underway in the U.K. and Africa. I'm excited about helping underserved customers in sub-Saharan Africa, and I'm also excited about the 15,000 jobs that we expect to create on the continent over the next 5 years. You'll hear more from Doug McMillon about the significant new store growth in Latin America this quarter led by Mexico. ", "Every Day Low Price remains one of our strongest competitive advantages, and we continue to use this strategy in more of our international markets. We're transitioning to EDLP in Brazil and Central America. We recognize that it takes time to implement EDLP fully in a market, but we believe this is right for our customers over the long term. ", "Sam's Club continued its strong momentum in the second quarter, delivering a 5% comp without fuel. This is the sixth straight quarter of comp improvement for Sam's, a testament to the team's execution to drive quality, value and savings for members. I'm also pleased with the momentum in membership income as Sam's improves its renewals and upgrades. Sam's also delivered strong operating income, driven in part by very good fuel sales and Sam's leveraged operating expenses. The strategy to win the weekend that Brian Cornell and his team have in place will position Sam's Club well for the back half of the year. ", "In the second quarter, our global e-commerce team stepped-up its work on delivering a continuous shopping experience to customers from the store to the Web to their mobile devices. In mature markets, we're investing in multi-channel initiatives by integrating our stores with online services. We completed the rollout of Pick Up Today in all Walmart U.S. stores and within the last month, we announced that VUDU, our movie streaming technology, is now available on Walmart.com, as well as through any iPad browser. ", "Walmart's brand and scale, coupled with consumers' need for value, also gives us opportunities in some of the fastest growing markets in the world today. In June, we established Walmart's China e-commerce headquarters in Shanghai, and we put in place the leadership team to quickly build this business. We are investing in the right talent and technology to pursue the growth in e-commerce. I believe that Walmart is the best positioned retailer to serve the needs of the next-generation customers who are striving to join the emerging global middle class. They're connected to the world through smartphones and social media. They have higher expectations of value, quality and a better life. We will continue to advocate for policies that make sense for our customers and our business. ", "In the U.S., we're pleased by the momentum around e-fairness, legislation to eliminate the unfair advantage that online-only retailers currently have. Recently, we've seen the passage of laws in key states like California, Illinois and Texas, strong efforts from the small business community and a clearer call for reform from our nation's editorial pages. We're encouraged by the growing interest in a federal response to this issue as well. We will remain engaged in the debate in Washington. ", "We've also called for modernizing our nation's corporate tax code. Last month, I testified before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee on reforming the tax code to drive job growth here at home and encourage America's competitiveness abroad. To achieve comprehensive reform, we've called for putting everything on the table including the existing incentives that benefit us. There are 3 key points that I emphasized to the committee: one, lower their corporate tax rate; two, get rid of existing incentives that benefit some industries over others; and three, level the international playing field with a territorial system. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for the detailed financial report. Jeff?", "Jeffery Davis", "Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.09, which was within our guidance of $1.05 to $1.10. The $1.09 compares to $0.97 for the second quarter of last year. Income from continuing operations included certain pretax items as follows: We recorded an approximate $49 million mark-to-market loss on certain foreign currency derivative positions related to the Massmart acquisition. We realized costs of approximately $36 million related to the acquisitions of Netto and Massmart. We recognized expenses of approximately $30 million related to the damages from tornadoes and floods in our United States operations. These items totaled $115 million and are included in our operating expenses. In addition, Walmart Mexico recorded an approximate $17 million revaluation charge from the implementation of the SAP financial system, which Doug will provide additional details later. The combination of these expense and gross margin items on EPS from continuing operations was approximately $0.03. ", "Now let's move to the rest of the P&L. Consolidated net sales increased 5.5% or $5.6 billion to $108.6 billion for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by Walmart International and Sam's Club and included a currency exchange benefit of $2.3 billion. Sales for Massmart were reported in our operating results starting in the third quarter. Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period ended July 29 were flat and negative 20 basis points for the 26-week period. You will hear more details on the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club comp sales from Bill and Brian. ", "For the quarter, gross margin on sales was 24.7%, a 10-basis point reduction compared to last year. Sam's Club fuel sales were the primary contributor to the margin decline. Unallocated corporate overhead and other, which includes our ongoing investment in global e-commerce increased approximately 21.8% to $509 million for the second quarter. Excluding the $49 million loss on mark-to-market foreign currency derivative positions I mentioned earlier and our global e-commerce initiatives, our core corporate overhead expenses increased 2.9%.", "Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were flat to last year at 19.5%. Operating expenses grew at the same rate as sales or 5.5%. Excluding the items affecting operating expenses that I previously mentioned, the company leveraged operating expenses for the second quarter. To reiterate what Mike said, the company is committed to leveraging operating expenses for the full year, and we have focused expense management initiatives in place throughout the company. ", "Consolidated operating income, which included a $110 million currency benefit was $6.4 billion, a 3.1% increase versus last year. Net interest expense for the quarter increased 19.2% to $578 million. The increase in interest expense was a result of higher debt levels as we opportunistically issued new debt over the last 12 months at historically low rates. The higher debt levels were partially offset by lower rates on outstanding debt. Going forward, we expect the percentage growth and net interest expense to moderate, but remain in low- to mid-teens through the balance of the year. ", "The additional debt raised our debt-to-total capitalization ratio to 45.7% at the end of the second quarter compared to 43.2% last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 32.2%. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be at the lower end of our range of 33.5% to 34.5%, although we may see quarterly fluctuations. Our effective tax rate may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. ", "Income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart was $3.8 billion, an increase of 5.7% over last year. During the second quarter, the company repurchased $1.4 billion of shares, representing approximately 26.1 million shares which brings the year-to-date repurchase to $3.5 billion or 65.4 million shares. In June, the board approved a new $15 billion repurchase authorization, which has $14.1 billion remaining. In addition to the share repurchases, Walmart returned to shareholders $1.3 billion in dividends during the quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. So in summary, Walmart returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase during the second quarter with $6.1 billion year-to-date. ", "Consolidated inventory grew 11.1% compared to last year. Walmart International was the main contributor to the increase, primarily driven by currency evaluation, acquisitions and significant international growth. Payables as a percentage of inventories were 90% versus 98% in the prior year. Last year's percentage received a benefit from the timing of payment cycles, which resulted in a higher-than-normal payables balance. Capital expenditures were approximately $3.3 billion for the second quarter compared to $3 billion in the prior year. We added growth in virtually every country with 176 net new units, excluding acquisitions of which 113 units were opened in Mexico. ", "Free cash flow remained strong. We ended the quarter with a positive free cash flow of $4 billion compared to $4.5 billion last year. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in accounts payables from the timing of payment cycles enhanced free cash flow last year. ", "Return on investment or ROI for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2011, was 18.4% compared to 19% for the prior year. The majority of the decline in ROI is attributable to acquisitions in currency. We are always aware that acquisitions like Netto and Massmart can have a short-term impact on company ROI. On the other hand, these acquisitions added 462 new units and 18.4 million square feet this quarter. ", "Now we'll turn to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?", "William Simon", "Thank you, Jeff. The goal at Walmart U.S. remains clear. Deliver positive comps by year end, and our plan is straightforward, and it's also working. We're expanding our assortment of merchandise backed with Walmart's Every Day Low Price promise. Our customer response is reflected in the improved results we saw in the second quarter. Walmart U.S. gained sales momentum throughout the quarter after a difficult May, which was impacted by high prices at the gas pump and severe spring weather. Our sales trend improved in June and again in July. In fact, our July $454 million comp was positive, and we improved in both customer traffic and ticket as the quarter progressed. ", "Our net sales rose approximately 40 basis points to $64.9 billion for the second quarter. Comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 29 was inside our guidance at negative 0.9% and the best quarterly comp performance in almost 2 years. Ticket was positive every month of the quarter. Traffic, which drove more than half of the comp, improved sequentially each month. Better traffic was driven in part by the 90-day rollback program at the gas pump. This program, which is available in 18 states saves customers $0.10 a gallon on gas and diesel when using a reloadable Walmart gift card or credit card. ", "Grocery and health and wellness, which represent 2/3 of our sales revenue, continue to deliver positive comps. We also saw trend improvements in all other businesses except entertainment. This improvement is attributable to our focus on expanding merchandise assortment, price leadership and increased in-stock levels. Weather trends across the country later in the quarter also helped. ", "The economy remains challenging for our core customers. Customers are still consolidating trips due to higher year-over-year gas prices. The swings in sales due to paycheck cycles remain pronounced, and our stores must staff and stock for the volatility both up-and-down. We also have seen an increase in the number of customers relying on government assistance for food and necessities for their family. Our grocery business continued its positive trend and again delivered low-single digit positive comps for the period. Food remains a key traffic driver to our stores. The strong performance during the July 4 weekend offset softness in the Memorial Day weekend. ", "Sales across dry grocery continue to accelerate from additional assortment. Sales of consumables also improved over the first quarter. We continue to see strength in our new modular programs that are bringing back assortment and had strong seasonal performance in pets and beauty, both of which delivered basis points comp improvement in the triple digits versus the first quarter. While we saw an increase in grocery inflation of approximately 3.5% during the quarter, customers remain under continued pressure and are trading down to lower price points and smaller pack sizes, as well as opting out of discretionary purchases. As a result, we're seeing minimal pass-through of inflation to sales. ", "Food inflation has replaced gasoline price as the most important household expense concern. In addition, more than 15% of Walmart moms in our monthly survey have experienced the loss of a household wage earner's job in the last year. Almost 40% of these Walmart moms indicate they're holding off or eliminating items they would normally buy, reinforcing the need for us to drive Every Day Low Price. Moms of all income levels showed a drop in confidence over the last year, with middle-income moms showing the greatest drop. And our health and wellness business again delivered a low-single digit positive comp driven by the strength of our prescription business. We continue to benefit from the additional traffic in our pharmacies as a result of the Humana program and our optical business benefited from the kick-off of our $29 back-to-school eyewear offering. We expect the momentum to continue in the third quarter as more parents get their children ready for school. ", "Neighborhood markets posted positive comps for 15 consecutive months now, delivering a comp of over 3% for the second quarter. This format reflects the ongoing strength of our food and health and wellness business. Overall, apparel comps declined in the mid-single digits during the second quarter, which includes approximately 300 basis points improvement from the first quarter. This performance was driven by ongoing business initiatives, especially in our basic apparel offering, an improvement in sales of summer merchandise tied to the warm weather. Men's, ladies and our baby apparel delivered the best comps for the period. Our children's apparel, shoes and intimate departments remain soft. ", "We are well positioned to gain sales and share for the important back-to-school season. We are expanding our offerings in important categories to regain customers, and we're adding back items in key brands. We're confident that the back half of the year will see ongoing improvement in apparel sales. ", "Comp sales for home declined in the mid-single digits for the quarter. We remain committed to strengthening this important category. Better weather versus the first quarter drove customers to our Outdoor Living department. We were ready, given our expanded assortments and innovation across the categories. However, there appears to have been a trade-off in indoor living categories. Customers are opting out of decor items for their homes or they're trading down. ", "Entertainment had high-single digit negative comp sales for the quarter. As others have reported, media and gaming continue to experience significant headwinds. New movie releases from last year were also a headwind. However, customers do shop for value and our $5 movie bin continues to do very well. Double-digit deflation in TV prices still exist, but our unit sales were up again. Customers want innovation and tablets continue to sell very well. We continued to see strength in our prepaid wireless business, although as you know, we record this as a net commission in our comp sales as opposed to its full transactional value. ", "Straight Talk remains a billion dollar plus brand for Walmart U.S. Within toys, we gained momentum as the quarter progressed. Sales of licensed toys associated with new movie releases and seasonal items including pools, water toys and bikes improved significantly. ", "Hardlines had low-single digit negative comp sales but improved over the first quarter. Favorable weather drove sales across sporting goods, especially hunting, fishing and camping and air movement-related products. New modulars in stationery and crafts helped push items in these categories. Tires sales continue to do well for automotive. ", "We\u2019ve spoken often about multi-channel retailing, allowing customers to shop on their own terms. We're now moving towards a strategy called continuous channel shopping, recognizing the continued integration of customers using web-based devices to shop our stores and to research and shop online as well. Today, roughly 60% of walmart.com sales involve the stores through services such as Site to Store and Pick Up Today. In fact, some of our highest volume Site to Store sales come out of large metropolitan areas such as New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. ", "During second quarter, we also launched a delivery and installation service program for electronics. We're providing delivery, setup and installation for TVs. We also offer basic setup for home theater and wireless networks. The in-home service network has up to 50,000 technicians available who'll service our customers. Our prices are very competitive and this now puts us on par with other electronics retailers. ", "Now I'll cover the remaining financial results. Our gross profit dollars were up 1.2% over last year second quarter, growing faster than the rate of sales. We lapped last year's deep rollback program in the second quarter, which we expected to impact our rate comparison this quarter. Additionally, our logistics team continues to drive routing and load efficiencies, allowing us to minimize the majority of the headwinds associated with rising diesel prices impacting the cost of goods. In fact, rising diesel costs were a headwind, 2/3 of which were mitigated by these transportation initiatives. ", "SG&A was up approximately 70 basis points compared to last year. Slightly higher payroll-related expenses, management incentive plan accruals, as well as the storm-related damages Jeff mentioned earlier were the primary drivers for the increase in SG&A. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising spend versus last year and a reduction in our accident costs related to store operations. Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. Operating income rose 2.1% over last year to almost $5 billion. ", "Inventory was up 4.8% compared to this time last year, which on a year-over-year quarter comparable is 150 basis points lower than what I reported last quarter. Productivity gains offset inventory growth that was primarily driven by inflation, new stores and assortment add-back initiatives I mentioned. In short, inventory is moving back in line with where we'd like it to be. We're focused on growing our business also through new stores and our priority remains supercenter growth. We added 18 supercenters this quarter, including new and converted stores. We're very pleased with the opening of the first 4 Walmart Express units and the initial results are positive. Let me remind you, these are still pilot stores, and we're testing different formats. ", "Our Neighborhood Market format is delivering a return at the same level as our supercenters, which have the best ROI in the company. These results have encouraged us to move faster on expanding our grocery format. Our multi-year development pipeline has approved 180 Neighborhood Markets through our real estate committee, and we'll announce more details on these growth plans in October. ", "We're moving forward with our remodel plan that we discussed last quarter. In addition to reducing the costs of remodels, we expect faster completions and significantly less customer disruption. In July, we entered into an agreement with the Nielsen company to share our point of sales data, which will provide deeper insights into customer purchasing and unmet needs, both nationally and in key local markets. The data will cover grocery including food, consumables and health and wellness categories, except for prescriptions.", "This agreement will better equip our merchant to evaluate their business and optimize assortment, pricing and promotion. It will enable our store operators to react and quickly make changes in their local stores. And the data's analysis puts us in a better position to identify category opportunities in the U.S. and collaborate with suppliers to develop customer-driven programs. ", "Based on the start of August sales, we're confident that our plans are working, and we'll see ongoing sales improvement. We expect comp sales for the 13-week period from July 30 through October 28 to be between minus 1% and plus 1%. Last year's third quarter 13-week comp was negative 1.3%. Timing of our calendar ending on Friday means a large portion of the Halloween sales could fall into the fourth quarter period. We still remain concerned about the increased economic pressure on our customers and the uncertain impact it will have on their shopping behavior. With the ongoing economic volatility, it's important as ever to deliver on our one-stop shopping promise, a broad assortment of merchandise backed with Every Day Low Price. ", "We remain committed to the productivity loop and our goal of leveraging operating expense. We will continue to invest in price to help our customers weather the economy, so gross profit should be flat to slightly down for the third quarter. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Doug for the international update.", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks, Bill. During our briefing following our Shareholders Meeting on June 3, I laid out our key initiatives for leveraging our scale and expertise in the Walmart International markets. They included making progress on EDLP as a global pricing philosophy, enhancing the productivity loop to get costs down, further developing global talent and sharing ideas back-and-forth with the U.S. businesses, both Walmart and Sam's Club. It's only been a couple of months since then, and I'm happy to report that we have already made progress on each of these areas. I'm also proud to share some important milestones that Walmart International achieved in the second quarter. As you know, ASDA completed its acquisition of 147 Netto stores in the U.K. ASDA has already converted more than 60 of these stores, which now have more than 4x the number of products than previously offered. This means customers can find what they need for the entire week just as they do in ASDA superstores. ", "In addition, we completed our 51% acquisition of Massmart. Massmart is a leading general merchandise retailer and basics foods wholesaler in sub-Saharan Africa and the second largest in consumer goods. As you heard, we will include the results from our countries in Africa in our third fiscal quarter. In terms of sharing ideas back and forth, South African suppliers offer an important opportunity for us to bring new and exciting merchandise to our other markets. Recently, we contracted with Ocean Fresh, a South African seafood supplier to export sustainably sourced wild hake, a fish, to our stores in the United States. This is helping to create 100 jobs in South Africa, and we believe this is the first indicator of even more opportunities on the continent. To recognize our new partnership with our customers in sub-Saharan Africa, we have launched our Working Together to Save You Money campaign, offering price reductions in Massmart\u2019s stores for an extended period of time. ", "Now let's get to the numbers. Walmart International reported second quarter net sales of $30.1 billion, an increase of 16.2% over last year. Changes in currency rates increased our net sales by $2.3 billion. As a reminder, our markets benefited this fiscal quarter from Easter sales and in the United Kingdom, the royal wedding. Last year, second quarter results benefited from sales related to the World Cup. So in some cases, there were difficult comp sales comparisons. ", "On a constant-currency basis, net sales were $27.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% over last year\u2019s second quarter. All of our markets had constant currency sales growth, except in Japan, where sales were affected by the March 2011 natural disasters. Mexico, the U.K., Canada, Brazil and China provided the strongest net sales growth in the second quarter. As a percentage of sales, Walmart International second quarter constant currency gross profit margin and other income was flat to last year. Second quarter reported operating expenses were $6 billion, which includes an increase of $500 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. Although Japan, Brazil, the U.K. and Chile had expense leverage in the second quarter, Walmart International's constant currency operating expenses grew faster than sales at 9.4%. ", "Our second quarter reported operating income grew 8.9% from last year to $1.4 billion, and this includes a benefit of $110 million from changes in currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 50 basis points. Excluding the $53 million in charges that Jeff mentioned and the $14 million impact on costs associated with the integration of Netto, Walmart International grew constant currency operating income 5.6%. Inventory management continues to be a challenge as days on hand increased over last year in most of our markets. Our constant currency inventory, excluding Massmart, grew 11.1% as we added a significant number of stores in most of our markets. ", "Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. Country management teams are held accountable for their results on a constant currency basis. The following discussion of country results excludes the impact of currency and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal basis. Comp sales are reported on a calendar basis. We'll kick off this quarter with the U.K. ASDA had a solid second quarter, growing sales excluding fuel ahead of last year. However, operating income declined due to $31 million of costs related to Netto. Adjusting for fuel sales and Netto, ASDA grew operating income faster than sales. ", "In the second quarter of this year, comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 50 basis points. Traffic decreased by 120 basis points and average ticket increased 170 basis points. Customers are consolidating their trips in the face of high fuel prices. ASDA grew expenses slower than sales in the second quarter, leveraging on tight expense management. After excluding the Netto costs, ASDA's expenses declined from last year. ASDA continues to gain recognition for saving people money everyday, supported by the 10% online price guarantee and now more than 250,000 baskets are being checked online by customers each week. As a clear statement to the quality our customers can find, ASDA's private brands and other products have won more than 300 awards so far this year, including Retail Champion at the International Cheese Awards, Meat and Fish Retailer of the Year and numerous other wine awards. ", "In June, ASDA was recognized as the price leader by the Grocer magazine as the lowest priced supermarket for the 14th year running. So it was no surprise that there were long lines of customers on grand opening day at our converted Netto stores. In these stores, customers will receive the same ASDA low prices, the 10% price guarantee and in-store pickup from online shopping. ", "Including the stores from the Netto acquisition, ASDA's total store count was 536 at the end of the second quarter. Economic indicators suggest that 2011 will remain a challenging year for our U.K. consumers, and we're confident that ASDA and its Netto store conversions are entering the second half of the year with good momentum, delivering availability and Every Day Low Prices. ", "Finally, Judith McKenna, who spent several years as ASDA's Chief Financial Officer has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Judith has a long track record of success, and we look forward to her experience in ASDA's operations. Congratulations, Judith. ", "Let's move to the Americas. In previous earnings discussions, I discussed only the results of Mexico and Central America separately in this section. Now that one year's passed since our Central American operations have been combined into Walmex, we will discuss the results of the consolidated company going forward. While the following results are on a U.S. GAAP basis, Walmex separately reports its earnings under Mexican GAAP. So some numbers are different from the Walmex reported results. ", "Overall, Walmex sales grew at a fast rate, but operating income declined from last year second quarter due to the noncash accounting charge mentioned earlier by Jeff. As we mentioned last quarter, our operations in Mexico went live with the SAP implementation during Q2. This effort increased the level of precision for inventory valuation and the result was a noncash accounting charge of $17 million. Walmex's consolidated net sales for the second quarter were up 9.1%. Comparable sales from Mexico were up 1.1%. Average ticket in Mexico increased 2.2%, and customer traffic declined 1.1%. Comp stores in Central America were up 6.2% on a constant-currency basis. ", "As Walmex noted in its earnings call on July 19, our teams continued to strengthen its EDLP position in Mexico, and we've converted to EDLP in each of our 5 Central American countries, making permanent price reductions on more than 12,000 items. We've also converted all of our Central American supercenters to the Walmart brand. ", "Mexico's second quarter consolidated comp store sales for the self-service formats grew by 1.9%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, exuding Walmex, grew faster at 2.2%. In the second quarter, Walmex advanced its investment schedule for new stores and logistics modernization and opened 129 stores in this quarter as compared to 57 in the second quarter of last year. An aggressive, but steady, rate of new store openings is part of the new store growth plan. And Walmex has achieved 45% of planned floor expansion to date. We will begin to see the sales from these new stores in our third fiscal quarter as the majority were opened at the end of June. ", "Second quarter gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year. Walmex's consolidated second quarter operating income declined 5.3% from last year and decreased 2.2% from last year after excluding the noncash inventory charge. Walmex's expenses grew faster than sales at 14.1% from last year, primarily due to the new stores. With 394 more stores than at the end of the second quarter of last year, Walmex is well positioned for the rest of the year. ", "Moving on to Brazil. Net sales grew in the second quarter; however, operating income declined from last year. As part of our progress in implementing EDLP as a global pricing philosophy, Brazil began its EDLP conversion earlier this year. The number of items converted to date represents a large portion of Brazil's overall sales. Brazil's second quarter net sales grew and comparable sales grew from last year. Average ticket increased 7.4% and customer traffic declined 4.6%. We believe that the investment in EDLP is right for our ultimate success in the marketplace and more important, best for our customers. ", "Second quarter gross profit margin and expenses, both as a percentage of sales, declined slightly from last year. So in terms of enhancing the productivity loop, Brazil is making progress. Brazil has a long history of sustainability initiatives and this is an area where Walmart can make a big difference and contribute savings for the company and our customers as well. Walmart Brazil is partnered with 13 of the largest multinational suppliers to review end-to-end sustainability and reduce our impact on the environment. ", "In the past 12 months, we have opened 42 net new stores in Brazil, bringing our total store count to 487. This includes 7 new stores in the second quarter of this year. And for Canada, Walmart Canada had solid sales growth in the second quarter of this year with operating income growing faster than sales. Net sales grew 5% in the second quarter compared to last year, primarily due to the supercenter expansion program and strong sales in many merchandise categories. Second quarter comparable sales increased 1.2% from last year. Average ticket increased 2.1% for the second quarter and traffic declined 0.9% for comparable stores. ", "Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 62 basis points from last year as Canada's merchants continue to be very focused on inventory management. Expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased only 31 basis points from last year, primarily from the increase in costs from growing Walmart Canada Bank. Walmart Canada has been successful in managing its expenses by placing a significant focus on enhancing supercenter productivity. And this contributed to the 10% increase in operating income from last year. Canada's supercenter presence continues to grow at a faster rate. In addition to 9 store expansions and 9 in-box conversions this year, we expect to open about 40 new supercenters this year. Currently, just over 8 million customers a week visit our Canadian stores. Our goal is to have customer shop the entire store, and we're working on further strengthening all of our merchandise categories. In the past 12 months, we opened 10 new stores in Canada, bringing our store count to 329 stores. ", "Moving to Asia, Japan's constant currency sales declined in the second fiscal quarter, but operating income grew when compared to last year. Japan's second quarter results include the effects of the March 2011 natural disasters, which continue to affect the entire country in many ways such as brownouts, food shortages and contamination fears. Three of our stores in Japan have yet to reopen. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the second quarter declined by 1.7% from last year. When comparing our performance to these METI results, our comp performance continues to stay ahead of other large-scale retailers in Japan. ", "Second quarter net sales declined 1.6% from last year and comparable sales declined 28 basis points, both in real terms. Walmart Japan's traffic declined 23 basis points from last year, and the average ticket in real terms declined 5 basis points. Walmart Japan has recently announced permanent EDLP reductions on 1,000 items at a time when our customers need it the most. Sales and general merchandise had the strongest performance as customers prepared for energy shortages and restrictions. Sales of televisions were higher than normal as the expiration of analog television signals nears. ", "Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was flat to last year, and Japan leveraged expenses even in these trying times. Expenses as a percentage of sales declined 49 basis points from last year. Steve Dacus, who was serving as Chief Operating Officer, was promoted to CEO of Walmart Japan in June. His extensive experience in Japanese retail, combined with his time in our Sam's operations in the U.S. position him very well to lead our team. Congratulations, Steve. ", "While Walmart China sales continue to grow in the second quarter, the sales growth was not enough to offset the increase in expenses. As a result, China had a small loss from operations. Net sales for the second quarter grew 9.7% over last year and comparable store growth was 1.8%. Average ticket grew 10% in China, but traffic declined 8.2%. The primary traffic decline was in our Trust-Mart Stores. In April, we obtained antitrust clearance to purchase the remaining interest in Trust-Mart. We began the rebranding of our Trust-Mart stores in the third quarter of this year, which provides us the first opportunity to communicate the new types of merchandise already being offered in our Trust-Mart stores. Expenses as a percentage of sales, grew 244 basis points, increasing from last year as result of additional government levies and new store growth. Second quarter gross margin increased 103 basis points over last year as our Trust-Mart stores can now take advantage of leverage opportunities from our Walmart stores. ", "In the past 12 months, we opened 53 new stores including 48 supercenters and that brings our China store count to 344 stores. I'd like to congratulate Sean Clarke on his promotion to Chief Operating Officer of Walmart China. Sean has spent several years as the Chief Financial Officer in Canada, and we look forward to leveraging his experience into our Chinese operations. ", "In closing, all of our markets are focused on our key goals of delivering growth, leverage and returns with organic growth of 24 million square feet since the second quarter of last year and the acquisition of an additional 18.4 million square feet in the second quarter of this year, we are well positioned to drive growth for the balance of the year. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Brian for the news on Sam's Club. Brian?", "Brian Cornell", "Thanks, Doug. I am very pleased to give the Sam's Club update today. We had an outstanding second quarter. Sam's Club posted its sixth quarter of sequential improvement as comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 5%, at the top of our range. We have the best momentum in membership we've seen in years, driven by strong renewals and growth in members joining at the Plus level. Not only did we leverage expenses, but we also grew operating profit without fuel by 13.3%, much faster than the growth in sales. Similar to first quarter, our fuel business was strong during the quarter. We are pumping more gallons of fuel and generating more sales dollars per gallon this year versus last year. Fuel prices in this year's second quarter are approximately 43% higher than a year ago and gallons sold are up 16%. Fuel price is an important first price impression for our members, reminding them the value of their membership. ", "Including fuel, second quarter net sales were $13.6 billion, a 9.5% increase over last year and operating income increased 15% to $492 million. Volatility and fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. Our discussion today, therefore, is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes, unless otherwise noted. ", "Now let's look at the financial results and our achievements for the quarter. Net sales for the second quarter were $12 billion, up 4.9% from last year. Comp club sales for the 13-week period increased 5%, and we're strong across all 3 geographic operating divisions. We are particularly pleased with the sales strength of our Western division, which includes 22 states located in the Western U.S. Recall that we have 3 divisions in Sam's Club, each headed by a seasoned SVP. Comp traffic and ticket increased for the 13-week period by 2.6 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively. Comp traffic and ticket increased for both Advantage and Business members. ", "The quality of our sales growth in our core categories was very strong, despite the over 100-basis point headwind we had from tobacco sales. We continue to face challenges in tobacco sales. The industry is softer than last year. In addition, since we changed the credit card rewards program, there is a greater impact on members who shop this category heavily. We anticipate tobacco being a headwind for the rest of the year. We continue to focus on categories our members tell us are most important to them such as fresh and health and wellness to optimize our growth. We also want to be the price leader in everyday needs items. This is contributing to strong ticket and traffic performance despite inflation pressure. Our fresh business delivered high-single digit comps for the quarter led by bakery, produce, meat and whole meal solutions. These results are driven by high-quality standards we have in place. ", "Dry grocery and beverage comps were in the mid-single digits. In beverages, hot weather categories such as soda and sports drinks performed very well. Comps for our health and wellness area were in the mid-single digits. Sam's free in-club health screenings are driving traffic and pharmacies script growth. ", "Despite the challenging economy, we continue to see good results in discretionary areas, including home and apparel. Driven by very strong sales in men's, children's and basic areas, apparel achieved a double-digit comp increase this quarter. Our home line area achieved a high-single digit comp as kitchen electrics, housewares and domestics were all strong. Even with average selling price deflation, our consumer electronics business delivered a mid-single digit comp sales increase. New products like tablets are driving greater sales in electronics. ", "Overall, we believe that inflation impacted our comp sales by 200 to 250 basis points. We continue to see mid-single digit inflation in key food categories. However, we have managed through these price increases with little impact on margin. Despite the impact of inflation, we continue to see growth in units sold year-over-year. We continue to deliver on our commitment to quality and value, especially with our proprietary brands. These initiatives are important in giving our members choices. Here are a few highlights: since the beginning of the year, we have introduced 3 new brands, Artisan fresh in deli and bakery, Simply Right in baby and health and beauty aids and Daily Chef in frozen foods and refrigerated products. These new brands represent close to 100 items this month, with plans to roll out 400 more by the end of Q1 next year. ", "Early sales and member feedback are overwhelmingly positive with results at or above expectations in all 3 brands. Our regional management structure and improved training programs continue to help our operations team focus on winning the weekend. This focus on weekend performers has yielded positive results, and we are pleased with our weekend traffic and comp sales results. Our most recent member satisfaction survey results tell us that our members think we're on the right track. The survey showed an improvement across all metrics, with strong improvement in overall member satisfaction. Our July 4 eValue savings celebration, which gave all our member a taste of our successful eValues program, performed well. Compared to both last year's performance and the pre-event period, the savings celebration drew a higher percentage of members shopping, higher sales per member and an increase in members upgrading to Plus membership. Additionally, baskets that include eValues items had a higher value than those without an eValues item. ", "Membership and other income was down 11 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to the second quarter last year. It's important to explain what's driving this reduction in other income. Previously, we rented space to a third party for a portion of our wireless business. We are now running this business with Sam's Club associates. This means we no longer receive rental income from the third party as we have in prior years. The sales and expenses of our wireless business are now included directly in our operating results. While we are just a few months into the change, we're encouraged by the early results. Wireless sales performance in the back half of the quarter was better than expected, and we anticipate the overall effect of this change to be positive to our operating results. ", "Membership income for the second quarter increased 1.2% versus last year. We continue to see a trend from the past several quarters of improving net membership results. Growth in membership income on a cash basis was strong. Renewals are increasing at a rate that has exceeded our expectation and outpaced last year's performance. Our penetration of Plus members continues to grow at a healthy pace. ", "We have seen new sign of growth overall even as small business members continue to struggle in this economy. Our proprietary credit program continues to be well received by our members, driven by in-club marketing initiatives and an overall bounce back in the utilization of credit. We find that among members who use their Sam's Club credit product, overall engagement and retention is higher. For the third quarter, we anticipate continued positive momentum in membership. Gross margin rate increased by 9 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, while gross profit dollars increased 5.6%. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing inflation in several categories, and we are managing this impact across the business. We believe that inflation will continue to be a pressure point for the remainder of the year. ", "I am very pleased with how our clubs manage expenses during the quarter. Driven by strong wage cost control, we reduced expenses as a percentage of sales by 32 basis points. You may recall that last year in this call, we discussed the impact of higher interchange fees related to the Sam's rewards credit program. I'm happy to say that even when this expense is excluded from last year's comparison, we leverage expenses by 14 basis points. For the quarter, sales per labor hour increased 1.9%, and units per labor hour increased 69 basis points. ", "Looking at the bottom line, our second quarter operating income, without fuel, increased to $467 million, a 13.3% increase over second quarter last year. At the end of the second quarter, inventory, including fuel inventory, was up 5.5% compared to last year. Overall, we were pleased with inventory levels in our clubs and distribution centers. Our inventory increase is primarily due to inflation and to a lesser extent, a change in the seasonal transition of holiday merchandise. ", "Looking ahead, our sales momentum remains strong. Our growth rates were strong in the back half of the second quarter and as we enter the first few weeks of the third quarter, our momentum has continued. It's important to remember that it was in the third quarter last year that our comp performance began to accelerate, so our comparisons for the back half will be more challenging. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from July 30 through October 28 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.4% for the comparable 13-week period. ", "Now I will turn the program over to Charles for a wrap up and guidance. Charles?", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Brian. As Mike said, we continue to be very focused on our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns. I'm really proud of the way we continued to improve throughout the quarter despite the fragile global economy, which is obviously affecting consumers. I also want to note that Walmart's balance sheet and capacity continue to be an advantage, especially during the market volatility we have seen recently. Our ability to access short and long-term funding has never been better. This is a result of a strong Walmart business model. We still have many opportunities to improve around the world. ", "In the second quarter, we had solid sales growth in international and Sam's, and we're progressing in Walmart U.S. We still have much work to do to drive top line growth, and we believe we are focused on the right initiatives. Despite the slowdown in the global economy, we continue to find very good growth opportunities for new stores across our global operations. We added 638 net units, with 315 units for Massmart, 147 units from Netto and 176 units through organic growth. Regarding acquisitions, we remain very thoughtful in acquiring new operations. Our focus will continue to be investing in companies that can deliver value to our customers and shareholders. ", "Turning to leverage, our commitment to productivity and cost containment remains high. Although we were flat on this metric on a reported basis, I remain encouraged with our expense management. The underlying SG&A rose less than the rate of sales when you exclude FX losses and acquisition-related costs. Bear in mind that our efforts are not just simply focused on cutting expenses but on a blend of expense management and technology leverage to improve productivity. I want to point out that productivity improvements also help our associates serve our customers and members better and improve our cost structure. If we can save 1 or 2 seconds in every cashier transaction around the world, the savings can truly add up. ", "As an example of a productivity initiative in our Walmart U.S. stores, we have implemented more one-touch freight, which optimizes the palette prior to arrival at the store. We're collaborating with suppliers to look at the entire supply chain as if it were vertically integrated to take unnecessary costs out of the system. We are also leveraging technology to enhance our workflow to make the workday more efficient for our store associates. ", "As you have heard from us before, we know that strengthening price leadership starts with being the low-cost provider. As we continue to lower our cost, we will also be investing in price, helping our customers save money so they can live better. We will be relentless in widening the price gap, as Mike says, to pass savings along to our customers around the world. We believe that EDLP will lead to top line growth as customer traffic improves. ", "And last, our priority of returns. On a rolling 12-month basis ending July 31, 2011, return on investment or ROI ended at 18.4%. ROI was impacted negatively by the acquisitions and currency. It's important to know that our underlying operations remain solid. ", "As you know, our company remains committed to share repurchase. We announced a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization on June 3 at our Annual Shareholders meeting. Given our acquisition activity in the second quarter, we had less money dedicated to share repurchase. The combination of our annual dividend and share repurchase program indicate the strength of our company and our continued commitment to returning value to Walmart's shareholders. Our investment in SAP throughout the company is ongoing, and is designed to increase the consistency of our processes throughout the organization. While the majority of our businesses have converted or are underway, the effects of the conversion will continue into next year. The financial effects should be minimal. ", "Now let's move on to guidance. Based on how we view our business relative to the economy and sales environment in the United States and throughout the world, we expect third quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $0.95 and $1, which compares to last year's third quarter earnings per share of $0.95. Last year's third quarter included $0.05 per share of tax benefits. We are narrowing the range of our full year earnings per share guidance and increasing it by $0.01. We now expect our full year earnings per share guidance to range between $4.41 and $4.51 versus our previously stated range of $4.35 to $4.50. All of the above EPS guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels. ", "As I close, I'd like to summarize a few key points from today's call. First, our second quarter earnings per share of $1.09 was solidly within our guidance. Looking ahead, we are raising our full year EPS guidance. We continue to manage our business well despite a very tough global economy. Net sales increased 5.5% with contributions from all 3 operating segments. We are still on track to deliver our yearly sales growth target of 4% to 6%. We will use the productivity loop to deliver on our EDLC-EDLP model and are committed to leveraging expenses for the full year. Walmart has a very strong balance sheet that we believe is an important advantage as the global markets remain volatile. Last, we remain committed to delivering shareholder returns through a combination of share repurchase and dividends as we did in the second quarter.

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the fourth quarter and the full year results of fiscal year 2012.

A full transcript of this call will be available on the website after 7:00 a.m. Central Time today, that's February 21, 2012.", "Here's the lineup for today's call. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will open the call with his thoughts about the quarter and the year. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up, Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. Next, Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International. Then we'll close the operating segment discussion with Rosalind Brewer, commonly known as Roz, our new President and CEO of Sam's Club. Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up with his thoughts, as well as EPS guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year '13.", "A few reminders before we get into the details. Walmart's consolidated financial statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for our U.S. and Canadian operations and December 31 for all other operations. Walmart International unit counts, with the exception of Canada, are stated as of December 31. Massmart currently reports on a June 30 fiscal year end, but is consolidated into our results on a calendar year basis with a one-month lag.", "This year, fiscal '13, is a leap year, and we will have an extra day in our company results for the first quarter and the full fiscal year. Leap year doesn't affect comp sales reporting. We will continue to report comp store sales on the 4-5-4 retail calendar when we announce quarterly earnings. So next year at this time, when we report fourth quarter earnings in February, we'll report a fourth quarter comp on the 4-5-5 basis. Details on comp sales in this call for the countries within Walmart International are on a calendar basis. We look forward to seeing all of you at our annual international meeting for the investment community in Toronto in April when we have an in-depth look at the Walmart Canada business. ", "Now Mike, let's get started with our results. Mike?", "Michael Terry Duke", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Today, every segment of our business is stronger than it was a year ago, and we're in a great position heading into this fiscal year. I'm pleased with Walmart's performance for the fourth quarter and the full year. ", "Let me start with our most important results.", "We are reporting $1.51 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter and $4.54 for the full year. Both of these numbers include net benefits to EPS of $0.07 and $0.05, respectively. Jeff will cover the details behind our EPS shortly.", "Walmart U.S. reported positive comp sales of 1.5% for the fourth quarter. And let me point out that this includes positive comp traffic. Sam's Club continued its sales momentum. Comps, without fuel, increased 5.4% for the quarter. International continues to be a strong growth engine for the company, delivering $35.5 billion in sales for the quarter and more than $125 billion for the year.", "Net sales, including acquisitions, rose almost 6% for the year to approximately $444 billion. Our company leveraged expenses for both the quarter and the full year. Walmart has now leveraged operating expenses for 2 consecutive years.", "The company returned $11.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this year. These results demonstrate our commitment to delivering growth, leverage and returns for our shareholders. They also reinforce our belief that Walmart remains the best positioned global retailer.", "It's was 50 years ago this year that Sam Walton started our company with a single store in Rogers, Arkansas and the promise to help customers save money so they can live better. He saw an opportunity to deliver on that promise. And today, our associates serve more than 200 million customers every week around the world.", "Our price leadership is making a difference across the United States as many family families are settling in to a new normal. Our core customers remain cautious about their finances, and they turn to Walmart and our EDLP promise to help them manage through today's economic challenges.", "The plan that Bill and his team put in place a year ago was the right plan. We churned the productivity loop, reduced expenses and invested the savings in lower prices. We listened to our customers. We added back assortment and increased in-stock. And we brought back layaway.", "Together, these efforts have resulted in quarter-by-quarter improvements in traffic and sales, and the U.S. business finished the year in a solid position. You can expect us to invest even more in lower prices, and we are confident that the positive trends will continue this year.", "Walmart International delivered strong growth through comp store sales and a record number of new units, including the acquisition of Massmart and Netto. It's interesting to note that with more than $125 billion in sales last year, Walmart International would clearly be among the top 3 largest retailers in the world.", "Doug and his team are well-positioned to serve the expanding needs of middle income customers in high-growth markets. We are gaining share in almost every market, and I'm optimistic about growth in new regions such as Africa. The leadership teams across International remain focused on improving profitability. You'll hear more from Doug about the Powered by Walmart initiatives, which will strengthen productivity and reduce expenses in our markets.", "Sam's Club comp sales had been consistently strong throughout the year. Merchandise assortment has improved in quality and value. And operational efficiencies contributed to expense leverage and a stronger member experience. Sam's also is focused on further increasing membership this year.", "I'd like to appreciate Brian Cornell for his contributions. Brian developed great leaders and is leaving Sam's Club a stronger business. Rosalind Brewer jumped right into her new role as the CEO, Roz is an outstanding strategic and operational leader, and I expect Sam's Club momentum to continue.", "We've also added a very talented executive to lead Global eCommerce. Neil Ashe has a strong background in interactive content; has an understanding of converting online customers, which is critical to our eCommerce growth strategy. In the last quarter, we continued to roll out new multichannel capabilities to offer the seamless experience between the store and our eCommerce platforms that customers increasingly want. We will continue to invest in the right talent and capabilities to seize the growth in Global eCommerce.", "The recent leadership transitions we've made show the depth of our management bench. I believe we have one of the strongest teams in business to date, and we will continue to develop and attract the best global talent in every part of our business.", "I'm excited about yesterday's announcement of our pending investment in eCommerce in China. We recognize that capital commitments, as well as investments in eCommerce, affected ROI and free cash flow for the year while we remain committed to our future growth, and investments like these position us well going forward.", "Looking back at Walmart's performance, it's worth noting that in one of the most challenging economies in decades, we emerged as one of the world's strongest companies. We have continued to grow sales and earnings, and as I look forward to our 50th anniversary year, I see tremendous opportunities still ahead for our company and our shareholders. ", "Let me tell you why I see so much upside. Our core Walmart U.S. business is back on track. In fact, every segment of our company is growing. Walmart's 10,000th unit, a Sam's Club, opened in Mexico in November, and by year end, our company had 10,130 units around the world and operated more than 1 billion square feet of retail space. International is our growth engine and will improve returns. Sam's Club has strong momentum. We've made significant progress in building our eCommerce capabilities, and we're continuing to lead on the social issues that matter to our customers.", "We were pleased to see that this year's World Economic Forum in Davos that the issues that we're focused on, sustainable growth, sustainable agriculture and women's economic empowerment, are the same issues the world community is focused on. I want to thank our leaders and our associates for moving the next-generation Walmart forward this year for our customers and our shareholders. We have high expectations for FY '13. ", "Now I'll turn over to Jeff for more financial details. Jeff?", "William S. Simon", "Thank you, Jeff. Last quarter, I kicked things off by getting right to the good news, and I'd like to do that again. Most of my comments will be about the fourth quarter, and then I'll summarize the full year results.", "For the fourth quarter, Walmart U.S. achieved a 1.5% comp, our fourth consecutive quarter of comp improvement and our second consecutive positive quarterly comp. As Mike mentioned earlier, we also achieved our first positive traffic quarter in quite a while. January was our strongest performance in the quarter with every business unit showing strong traffic improvements versus last year's fourth quarter. All 3 geographic units delivered positive comps for the quarter as well.", "We had a great holiday season. We started off with layaway services in October, spurring traffic improvements in the fourth quarter. Black Friday sales were strong, and consumers continued to respond favorably throughout Christmas and in to the new year. Our comprehensive marketing campaign helped tie it all together and drive traffic as we secured a very large share of voice with strong, creative and innovative social media initiatives.", "Throughout the quarter, we implemented strategic initiatives to better serve our core customer. To put it simply, our business model is working, and we continue to drive progress on 3 major fronts:", "First, our commitment to price leadership has never been stronger. As we outlined last quarter, we invested in price and reduced our gross margin by 13 basis points or about $100 million in the fourth quarter alone. We'll continue building on this initial investment in fiscal '13.", "Second, our focus on expanded assortment has resonated with customers. We've completed the initial phases of our SKU add-back program, returning more than 10,000 items to the shelves. Initially, add-backs drove higher tickets as customers discovered their favorite items had returned to the shelf. In fiscal '13, we're further refining our macro space allocation for departments and categories, an effort we started last year. We're pleased with the early customer response to these changes.", "Third, we'll continue to improve on-shelf availability. We now use a process involving third-party physical audits of our stores on a weekly basis. This allows us to see what customers see in their store. The program started in the first quarter and we've great progress throughout the year, improving more than 600 basis points and are now tracking in the mid-90s on a percentage range.", "Now let's discuss the details of our fourth quarter performance. Net sales were $72.8 billion, an increase of 2.4% over last year. Our 1.5% comp was driven equally by both positive traffic and ticket. All of our business units delivered positive comps, with the exception of apparel, which was hampered by unseasonably warm weather.", "Grocery, which includes food and consumables, continued its positive performance by delivering low single-digit positive comps. ", "Our food business had positive traffic and had a mid-single-digit comp. We saw strong sales throughout the holiday season as we provided one-stop meal solutions for our customers.", "We were aggressive in serving customers across the entire entertaining season, from Thanksgiving through the Super Bowl. Our bake center and meal trains in action alley provided additional holding and selling power and communicated a strong price message to customers. ", "Overall comps for consumables rose sequentially each month in the quarter, benefiting from improved on-shelf availability and price investments. The investments we've made in improving our assortment have really delivered for our customers as seen by positive comps in every department.", "Despite moderating inflation in certain categories, grocery prices continued to be an issue for many of our customers. For the fourth quarter, total grocery inflation was approximately 4%. However, trade down and other initiatives reduced the net inflation impact on our customers to between 100 and 200 basis points.", "Our health and wellness business also performed well, delivering low single-digit positive comps. Our pharmacy prescriptions, over-the-counter and optical businesses all had positive comps.", "Hardlines continued its positive performance with a low single-digit positive comp. Continued assortment initiatives, especially in sporting goods and stationery and crafts, drove sales throughout the quarter. Increased emphasis on tires drove strong sales versus last year. As other retailers have noted, unseasonably warm weather had a negative impact on cold weather-related merchandise categories.", "Strong holiday performance supported by layaway and the Walmart price match guarantee helped improve the sales trend in our entertainment business by over 700 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter. Black Friday drove strong sales of electronics early in the quarter and we saw an overall increase in the number of TVs sold, helping to offset the continued price deflation across the industry.", "Our Straight Talk business continued to perform well as customers responded to our expanded assortment of smartphones. ", "Our entertainment business, which includes electronics and toys, had a low single-digit positive comp.", "Our toy business had high single-digit positive comp, benefiting from layaway during the holiday period. This performance represents approximately 900 basis points of improvement versus the fourth quarter last year. Customers utilized the service to reserve some of the season's hottest items and clearly appreciated the layaway opportunity in toys.", "Our home business continued to improve over the last 4 quarters, and I'm happy to report positive low single-digit comp for the fourth quarter. This represents the first positive quarterly comp in 2.5 years. We've worked diligently to focus on the basics and improved assortment through add-backs and item merchandising. Home management and food preparation were standout categories in our home area, and outdoor living performed better than expected during the warmer weather.", "Apparel had low single-digit negative comps. Sales rebounded at the end of the quarter, improving approximately 170 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter. As others in the industry have reported, the warmer-than-usual weather had a big impact on cold weather apparel sales. We saw continued strength in our basics categories, indicating that our strategic focus from fashion to basics and essentials is working.", "Our online business continues to grow, driven by strong sales in tablets, computers and toys. We saw increased customer activity across our various multichannel initiatives. Programs like Site to Store and Pick Up Today, which, together, generated double-digit comps during the holidays, continued to provide consumers with various shopping alternatives that are unique to our retail store footprint.", "Now let's look at the financial details for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, net sales were up 2.4% to $72.8 billion. We invested in price in the fourth quarter. Gross margin rate was down approximately 13 basis points from last year's fourth quarter in line with our expectations. Gross profit dollars were up 1.9% to $19.6 billion.", "Through operational leverage and expense management, Walmart U.S. again leveraged expenses for the quarter. Operating expenses increased 2.1% on a sales increase of 2.4% in the fourth quarter. ", "Operating income grew 1.4% for the quarter to $6.1 billion due to our price investment strategy. ", "At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory was up 8.5% versus last year. The primary drivers of the increase were the continued broadening of our assortment, comparisons of weather disruption to last year, food inflation and new store growth. Most of our inventory growth is in the high-turning grocery business. With our assortment strategy in place, our inventory focus will be to ensure we have the right inventory position to drive sales.", "Now I'll summarize our financial results for the full year. Fiscal year '12 sales were up 1.5% to $264.2 billion. For the 52-week period, comp sales were positive 0.2%, which was a 180 basis point improvement over last year.", "Gross profit dollars increased 1.4% to $72.7 billion. Gross margin was down 2 basis points, reflecting some price investment. Full year expenses increased 1% on a 1.5% sales increase. ", "Operating income grew faster than sales for the year, increasing 2.2% to $20.4 billion. ", "Over the course of the year, we added 119 supercenters, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions, as well as 27 small formats. For the year, we added 9.6 million square feet of space for Walmart U.S.", "Supercenters remain the best vehicle to capture market share, and we remain committed to growing through new Supercenters, as well as smaller formats. The Neighborhood Market format continues to deliver above-industry results with approximately 5% comp during the fourth quarter and positive traffic throughout the year.", "As I said in October, we plan to add between 14 million and 15 million square feet of retail space in fiscal year '13. These will include adding between 210 and 235 total units, which include new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. Within that total, 80 to 100 will be small formats, primarily Neighborhood Markets. We will remain efficient in our capital spending this year by lowering remodel and construction costs.", "Expense reduction and improved productivity are even greater priorities for us this fiscal year. For us, leverage is not simply about cutting expenses year-over-year, but drawing from our long history of driving productivity. We've demonstrated this ability across many functional areas.", "The steps our logistics team has taken have helped mitigate fuel price increases and improved supply chain efficiency. For example, we've increased associate productivity and asset utilization, which helped decrease our cost per case shipped every year for the last 5 years. During the same period, we've delivered 361 million more cases and drove 287 million fewer miles through more efficient loading and routing optimization.", "In marketing, we reached even more consumers through more channels during the holidays while lowering our overall advertising expense by more than 10% for the year. Achieving these results is not always easy. It requires discipline across the organization and a shared commitment among our associates to deliver EDLP for our customers.", "Finally, we continue to utilize process engineering and innovation to help us meet our leverage goals. Our aisle locator system and the integration of the electronic product code technology helps better manage inventory accuracy and contributes to on-shelf availability. Our inventory management system and innovative OneTouch freight program are having a positive impact on the business. Given our scale, when we can reduce steps and tasks, the savings add up quickly.", "Fiscal year '13 is underway, and I'm pleased with our strategic plan and how customers are responding to increased assortment and lower prices. A challenging economy and rising gas prices will continue to drive customers to seek value. In the past, significant increases in gas prices over short periods of time have led to trip consolidation and higher ticket. We'll continue to help consumers adapt to such trends.", "Based on our view of the economy and our core customer, we're forecasting comp sales for the 13-week period from January 28, 2012, through April 27, 2012, to range from flat to positive 2%. As I look back on fiscal year '12, we performed much better than a year ago, and I'm proud of our improvements. There's still a great deal to do, and I'm confident going into this year because we have a strong leadership team driving the direction and implementation of our strategy. Our assortment is back. We're operating efficiently. Our comps are positive. We're investing in price and winning back customer traffic. We're committed to being even better in fiscal year '13.", "And now, I'd like to turn it over to Doug for an international update.", "Rosalind Gates Brewer", "Thanks, Doug. It is an honor and a privilege to take on the leadership role for the Sam's Club business, and I am so impressed by this team. We just finished a great overall fourth quarter and a complete and outstanding fiscal year for Sam's Club. Our entire organization is highly motivated to continue this great momentum. Member experience survey results are at an all-time high. Our merchandising team is doing a fantastic job of finding items that members want at a great value. And the club operators are doing a great job of getting those items in front of the Sam's Club members. ", "First, I'll review our Q4 results and then provide analysis on the full year. Including fuel, fourth quarter net sales were $14 billion, a 6.8% increase over last year. Gross profit increased by 4.4%. SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, increased by 26 basis points and operating income increased 7.6% to $524 million for the quarter.", "Our fuel business has been strong all year, including the fourth quarter. Fuel profit was relatively flat in Q4, but overall volume was very good. Fuel prices in this year's fourth quarter were approximately 13% higher than a year ago and gallons sold were up 8%. As we have said before, we look to fuel to set the first price impression for Sam's Club. It is clearly a traffic driver for existing and potential members.", "Volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. The remainder of our discussion today, therefore, is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes unless otherwise noted. ", "We were very pleased with Sam's top line performance this quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $12.6 billion, up 5.4% from last year. For the 13-week period, comp sales increased by 5.4%. Combined with a 2.7% comp sales increase for the same period last year, this is an 8.1%, 13-week comp on a 2-year stacked basis. All 3 geographic operating divisions did well in the quarter with the west division turning in our strongest comp performance. Comp traffic and ticket increased for the 13-week period by 3% and 2.4%, respectively.", "We completed a very successful holiday season with strong sales during Thanksgiving week and throughout December. And in January, we drove even further momentum. Our members continue to respond to our key merchandising initiatives. ", "Sales by category varied with high single-digit comps in food and beverage categories and mid-single-digit comps in health and wellness categories, both key categories in our portfolio of strategy. ", "Home and apparel comp sales grew mid-single digits. Investments in seasonal promotions and price deflation led to a comp sales decline in electronics.", "Overall, SKU inflation across the club impacted the quarter comp by 250 to 300 basis points. Inflation continues to impact meat and selected grocery categories and, as I mentioned, deflation continues to impact electronics prices. We are very pleased to see continued unit growth in electronics year-over-year.", "In fresh categories, ongoing improvement in quality and the extension of our new proprietary brand initiative, were very successful, with produce and bakery being real standouts, delivering double-digit growth. In grocery and beverage areas, driving price leadership on national brands was key to high single-digit comp growth. ", "In our health and wellness business, we continue to drive awareness of our great service and low prices through a variety of communications, including the launch of our new Healthy Living Made Simple magazine. Prescription counts are growing faster than the market, and we had high single-digit comp performance in pharmacy and related areas. We introduced a new pricing structure in optical with discounts for Plus members, and that program drove both strong comps and membership upgrades. In baby, price leadership and other initiatives drove high single-digit comp growth.", "In home and apparel, we are featuring favorite national brands such as Keurig coffeemakers, which led to double-digit growth in our kitchen electrics categories. ", "Brands also helped drive stronger sales in basic and children's apparel. Overall apparel comps were in the low single digits. ", "The improved quality and fashion of our seasonal d\u00e9cor and foods categories drove solid performance during the holiday, though toys was challenged due to the heavy discounting in the market place. We were very pleased with our profitability in these categories.", "In electronics, we held market share in a very challenging price environment while managing margins effectively. We were very pleased with our unit growth in electronics this holiday season. Our sales in wireless and tablets were particularly strong with the Apple brand, a favorite. ", "In short, our merchandising strategies are working very well and are driving strong momentum already in this new fiscal year. Membership and other income was up 9.1% when compared to the fourth quarter last year. We realized a financial benefit related to our profit-sharing arrangement with our credit card provider, and we grew membership income. This increase was offset by a decline in rental income. ", "As we had mentioned previously, prior to this fiscal year, we rented space to a third party for a portion of our wireless business and receive rental income. We currently run this business with Sam's Club associates, and the sales and expenses of the wireless business are included directly in our operating results.", "Membership income for the fourth quarter increased 2.5% versus the fourth quarter last year. Remember, for reporting purposes, membership income is recognized over the membership period rather than when it is collected. Driven by increases in both Plus upgrades and new members joining at the Plus level, our penetration of Plus members continued to grow during the fourth quarter. We saw improvement in new primary business member sign-ups, while business add-on membership remains soft.", "During the fourth quarter, we launched our Sam's Club iPad app and released a significant update to our smartphone app. During the holiday season, we were pleased with the level of sales through these mobile technologies. The weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas were the strongest weeks. Our members love the convenience and efficiency generated by these services and the majority of sales through mobile devices are from members shopping items in their local club by leveraging our Click 'n' Pull program.", "Mobile support was prominent throughout all of our marketing programs. This included members being able to view items early through their mobile device during our day after Thanksgiving event. During our Holiday Taste of Sam's Club event, members could scan QR codes on the Taste and Tips station to vote for their favorite sampled items and get recipes related to those products. We are excited about these technologies and the opportunities that they provide for our members.", "Net sales were strong for the fourth quarter. We managed gross margin rate well in a very competitive and inflationary pricing environment. Our gross margin rate decreased by 11 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year while gross profit dollars increased 4.6%.", "Total SG&A expense increased by 4.1% for the fourth quarter. As a percentage of sales, this is an improvement of 15 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter last year. We continue to drive operational efficiencies and in the fourth quarter this year, our labor expense grew slower than the rate of sales. Sales per labor hour increased 1.1%. Our strong performance in labor expense management was partially offset by higher advertising costs versus the fourth quarter of last year.", "Looking at the bottom line, our fourth quarter operating income increased to $524 million, an 8.3% increase over fourth quarter last year. At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory, including fuel inventory, was up 2% compared to last year. Overall, we're pleased with the inventory levels in our clubs and our distribution centers.", "Now let me summarize our key financial highlights for fiscal year 2012. With fuel, full year net sales were $53.8 billion, up 8.8% over last year. Gross profit increased by 5.1%. SG&A expense, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 55 basis points, and operating income increased 9% to $1.9 billion for the year.", "Looking at the results, without fuel, for the year, net sales were $47.6 billion, a 5.4% increase over last year. For the 52-week period, comp sales increased 5.1%. Comp traffic and ticket increased by 2.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Comp traffic and ticket increased for both Advantage and Business members. We continue to see members visiting our clubs more frequently throughout the year.", "For the full year, membership income increased by 1.4%, and we experienced growth in Plus membership upgrades, overall renewal rates and primary member sign-ups. ", "Gross profit increased by 4.7%, an 8 basis point reduction as a percentage of sales. ", "Full fiscal year SG&A expense grew by 3.3%. This is an improvement of 24 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to last year. The impact of the additional interchange fees last year was 11 basis points as a percentage of sales. ", "Operating income increased to $1.8 billion, a 7.9% increase over last year.", "I'm looking forward to leading the Sam's team into the next fiscal year. The team already has a great strategy defined for the year and it won't surprise anyone that the member is at the center of our strategy. We're dedicated to providing the best choices for our member in terms of price and quality with an emphasis on fresh and refrigerated foods and health and wellness categories. Our operations team will ensure our members have a great experience in the clubs by continuing to optimize our staffing and by ensuring associates are well-trained.", "We're also focused on leveraging technology and mobile platforms to communicate with our members and provide access to the great value Sam's Club offers, no matter how they choose to shop with us. Our partnership with the Insights team is allowing us to further define and target our merchandise offerings.", "Our primary growth will come from comp sales. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from January 28, 2012, through April 27, 2012, to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2% for the comparable 13-week period.", "Our plans also call for continued growth through new, relocated or expanded clubs. We are on schedule to open 10 to 15 units this year with up to 9 of those being new units, which is a significant increase over the 3 new units we opened in the past fiscal year. We have a great opportunity to engage new members in key markets. I'm really looking forward to seeing how much more the Sam's Club team accomplishes this year. ", "Now I'll turn the program over to Charles for a wrap up and guidance. Charles?", "Charles M. Holley", "Thanks, Roz. We are pleased with our full year performance and especially our results for the fourth quarter. We were disciplined and focused on improving our business, and I'm happy to say that we made good progress this year, especially in the back half of the year.", "We have leveraged expenses for 2 consecutive years and improved all areas of our business. Last year at this time, Walmart U.S. was in the early stages of reintroducing action alley and adding merchandise assortment and strengthening our focus on EDLP.", "In a challenging economy and a highly promotional competitive environment, our U.S. businesses won in the fourth quarter and in the year. Sam's Club continued its strong sales momentum. And we believe that both Walmart and Sam's are extremely well positioned in the retail market.", "International remains our growth engine. Between acquisitions and new store growth, we added record square footage and units this year. Sales were strong and we are gaining market share. We continue to be focused on the improving profitability and returns of our international operations.", "We have a strong and consistent underlying business that positions us well for this year. Today, we are reiterating some our fiscal 2013 goals that we shared in October.", "Net sales will grow between 5% and 7%, representing an additional $22 billion to $31 billion in sales. We expect to grow square footage by 4% to 5% this year or 45 million to 49 million square feet. Recall that we are adding units and square footage with an eye toward continued capital efficiency and reduced costs for construction and remodels. We will continue to make investments where we see we can better serve our customers and provide for returns to our shareholders.", "You've heard about leverage throughout this call. It is our standard. There is no doubt that we are reducing expenses and investing in lower prices for Walmart customers. You can expect margins to decline as we put these initiatives into place. EDLP matters to our customers, and we will deliver on that mission to help them save money. We are also committed to reducing operating expenses as a percentage of sales by more than 100 basis points over the next 5 years. We have started on this effort and you heard some of those results already. Our operating segments and our Home Office support areas are working even harder on this goal this year. ", "This will be accomplished by investing in technology and improving productivity in our stores. Walmart is a very efficient company, but it is always looking for new ways to standardize best practices in stores, optimize the supply chain, leveraging technology and improve associate productivity. We are constantly increasing best practices by sharing across borders, across functions and across people. More importantly, we are fast adopters of best practices to drive leverage. Some of these savings will also help increase international profitability. And as Doug noted, we plan to improve returns of our international segment.", "Of course, we will remain committed to our shareholders. Walmart returned $1.2 billion and $5 billion to shareholders through dividends for the quarter and fiscal year, respectively. Combining share repurchases and dividends, Walmart returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the quarter and $11.3 billion for the fiscal year.", "Mike summed it up well. Walmart is the best positioned retailer in the world. Every retailer tries to adapt to customer changes and to economic fluctuations. But the Walmart model allows our company to serve customers in ways other competitors cannot in the long run.", "Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic that employment reports will continue to improve. However, we know that gas prices have begun to creep up again. Regardless of how the economy turns this year, Walmart will continue to lead on low prices that we know our customers depend on to live better. ", "Therefore, taking into consideration the current global operating environment, we expect first quarter fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.01 and $1.06. This compares to earnings of $0.98 per share in the first quarter of last year, which included a $0.01 net benefit from multiple items.", "For the full year, we are expecting earnings per share between $4.72 and $4.92. This compares to the earnings per share of $4.54, which we reported today and included $0.05 of net benefits from certain items. All earnings per share guidance assumes that currency rates remain at current levels. ", "As Walmart enters our 50th year of operations, we plan on continuing the success of the previous 49 years. The company has grown from one store in Rogers, Arkansas to the great company it is today: Almost $444 billion in sales, more than 10,000 retail units around the world and more than 2 million associates serving 200 million customers every week. We are proud of our culture, the work we have done over 5 decades and the future that we have ahead of us. Walmart is a company consistently delivering an increase in sales, increase in earnings per share and strong cash flow. We remain committed to continuing this trend for our shareholders.

This Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal 2013. All information for this quarter, including our unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, is available on our website, and that's walmartstores.com/investors.", "Please note that while we update unit counts on a monthly basis on our website, in the earnings discussion today, unit counts and square footage are referred to as of the quarter end. Our press release is available on the website, and a full transcript of this call has already been posted there.", "Here's the agenda for today's call. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will open the call with his thoughts about the quarter as well as highlights of our key results. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. Then we'll kick off the operations portion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. Next will be Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International.

Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up the call with an analysis of our financial priorities as well as EPS guidance for the third quarter and the full year.", "A few reminders before we get into the details. Walmart's consolidated financial statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for both our U.S. and Canadian operations and December 31 for all other operations. We provide comparable sales guidance for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club on the 4-5-4 calendar each quarter for the upcoming quarter. We do not give any annual comp guidance for the U.S. operations.", "We refer to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates throughout this call. As you know, for financial reporting purposes, each period, we convert the balance sheets and operating results from the local country currency to the U.S. dollar. The increase or decrease in the company's results as a result of changes in these currency exchange rates from one year to the next is what we refer to as the impact of currency exchange rates. We calculate the effect of such changes as the difference between current period activities translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and translated using the comparable prior year period's rates. We also exclude the impact of acquisitions until those acquisitions are included in both comparable periods. This methodology is what we use to calculate measures on a \"constant currency\" basis. There is additional disclosure in today's press release on the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations to our business.", "When we use the term gross profit, we're referring to actual dollars. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit rate refers to the percentage obtained by dividing gross profit by sales dollars. All comparisons are calculated as the change between the current quarter and the prior year quarter unless stated otherwise.", "Consistent with our forward-looking statement at the beginning of today's call, we discuss our existing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation and related matters in the filed portion of our May 17, 2012, Form 8-K as well as in our Form 10-Q that was filed on June 1, 2012. Please refer to that disclosure on our website for information concerning these FCPA matters. The investigation remains ongoing, and it would be inappropriate to comment further on specific allegations and for us or others to come to specific conclusions until the investigation is finished.", "As a reminder, our annual meeting for the investment community is Wednesday, October 10 in Bentonville, Arkansas. The meeting will begin early in the morning that day. And as always, we will video webcast the presentations, and they'll be archived on the Investor portion of our website.", "During the past year, we've been working very hard to enhance our corporate website, and the new site will be live next week. You'll find the Investors tab at the new site located at www.corporate.walmart.com, and you'll be redirected if you go to our current website to the new location.", "One last item. We launched the Walmart Investor Relations app in April, which has a great deal of information for our shareholders. The latest update of the app will be available the last week of August. You can download it really easily for both iOS and Android devices.", "That's it for the announcements. So let's get started, Mike, with our results.", "Michael Terry Duke", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Walmart had a strong second quarter, and I'm pleased with the earnings and overall results our company delivered. Our more than 2 million associates around the world did a fantastic job of serving our customers, and they really appreciate that we help our customers save money so that they can live better.", "Walmart reported second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.18 at the top of our guidance of $1.13 to $1.18. This represents an 8.3% increase from last year's second quarter EPS of $1.09.", "Let's cover some of the highlights from the second quarter. Walmart U.S. continued its momentum this quarter with comp sales growth of 2.2%. Ticket and traffic were positive, and operating income grew faster than sales. Our Walmart U.S. business now has delivered positive comp sales for 4 consecutive quarters.", "I'm really proud of International's underlying performance. All countries delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales would have grown 7.2%, and operating income would have been up 11.9%.", "Sam's Club continues to provide value to its members by delivering consistently strong results driven by positive traffic and ticket due to quality merchandise. Comp sales without fuel increased 4.2%, and operating income grew more than twice the rate of sales. We reported consolidated net sales of $113.5 billion, up 4.5%. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $2.2 billion, and without that impact, net sales would have been $115.7 billion.", "It should be no surprise to hear me say that our company leveraged operating expenses again this quarter. Our intense focus on delivering productivity and reducing cost allows us to invest in lower prices for our customers and to deliver strong profitability for our shareholders. Consolidated operating income was $6.7 billion this quarter, up 4.9% from last year. We achieved our goal of growing profits faster than sales.", "I'm really pleased with the continued momentum we see in our Walmart U.S. stores, and this now marks 3 consecutive quarters of positive comp traffic and 4 quarters of positive comp sales. There's such a clear focus among the leadership team to drive the strategy of broad assortment and price leadership. We continue to win back customers and attract new ones. We will not let up on our passion to reduce operating expenses so that we can invest in lower prices. This is the promise our customers expect from Walmart and what drives greater loyalty.", "We are also pleased with the sales and profitability for Walmart International. Our goal is to achieve profitability and returns that are more balanced, and to do that, we must improve operational and sales productivity in some of our emerging markets. EDLP drives customer loyalty and helps reduce cost. Our full transition to EDLP is underway, and this remains central to long-term growth for International.", "We are moderating our strategic investment in new stores in 3 emerging markets as we focus our leadership teams on improving comp sales in existing stores. International remains our growth engine but at a slightly slower pace, and you will hear more from Doug on the details.", "We are strengthening our capital efficiency model to improve site approval, design and the review process for new stores in all operating segments. We believe this will increase the success rate of our new stores and provide for stronger comp sales in the future. Across all operating segments, we also are reducing construction cost to deliver more productive stores.", "Now I love visiting Sam's Club. The quality and innovation in merchandising and services are contributing to strong comp sales with increases in traffic and ticket. On a 2-year stacked basis, Sam's continues to drive fantastic comp sales while improving quality. The result of Sam's initiatives is greater value, which helps attract new members and strong renewals.", "We've been focused on stepping up the intensity of our Global eCommerce opportunity. Recruiting talent is easier now that we're gaining more respect in Silicon Valley for the innovative work that we're doing. The technology community sees our potential for the next generation of eCommerce, and there is a great deal of excitement about working for Walmart. Our goal is to have a deeper relationship with our customers to drive greater loyalty, and eCommerce is key to that strategy. We're also constantly driving innovation. We're building a new global platform to take our assortment and services to every one of our markets simultaneously.", "As you know, we previously took a minority position in Yihaodian, a fast-growing eCommerce business in China. We're pleased that this week, our potential increased investment in Yihaodian received conditional approval by the antitrust regulatory authority in China. We still have a few important steps before the agreement is completed, but we're encouraged by the progress and pleased with the response from the government.", "On July 2, we marked the 50th anniversary of our company, and we're pleased that our mission to save people money so that they can live better continues to drive us. The Walmart Every Day Low Price model is as relevant today as it was in 1962. For today's customers, the paycheck cycle remains pronounced in the United States and in our international markets. Given the continuing economic pressures, we believe that our price leadership and value are growing in importance to customers across income levels.", "Before I close, I'm going to share some comments about our associates and the strength of the morale around the Walmart world. During the second quarter, I visited stores in Chicago, Texas, the Pacific Northwest, also the U.K. I am inspired by our associates and the conditions of our stores. They are happy to work for Walmart and to serve our customers.", "As we continue to deliver greater results, we appreciate that Walmart customers and shareholders recognize the consistency of our results, the strategic steps we're taking to improve our business and the value of the investments we're making for the future. I believe that Walmart remains the healthiest and the best-positioned retailer for delivering growth, leverage and returns.", "Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for the financial details. Jeff?", "Jeffery Davis", "Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2013, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.18, which compares to $1.09 last year. Recall last year, we had $115 million of pretax items that increased operating expenses and $17 million of pretax items that reduced gross profit. The sum of these pretax items negatively impacted EPS from continuing operations by approximately $0.03.", "Now let's get to our results for the second quarter. Net sales increased 4.5% or $4.9 billion to $113.5 billion for the quarter. The increase included $1.9 billion of net sales from acquisitions, offset by a negative impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $2.2 billion. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 4.7% to $113.8 billion.", "As you can see, our company is not unlike many other global companies that were impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other foreign currencies. The U.S. dollar strengthened approximately 6% against our non-U.S. market currencies, with the greatest impact coming from Mexico and Brazil. As a result, net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $3 billion year-to-date.", "Moving to our comp sales. Total U.S. comps without fuel increased 2.5% for the 13-week period ended July 27. Bill and Roz will provide more details on the strength of our comp sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club.", "Membership and other income grew 4.7% compared to the second quarter of last year. Therefore, we closed the quarter with total revenue of $114.3 billion, up 4.5% from $109.4 billion last year.", "Gross profit increased 3.8%, which corresponds to an 18-basis-point reduction in gross margin compared to last year. This is primarily due to price investments in Walmart U.S. and key international markets.", "Our company continues to drive operating expense leverage. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 20 basis points to 19.3% from 19.5% last year. Not only did the company leverage on a reported basis, we also leveraged expenses without the $115 million of pretax expenses realized last year.", "Other unallocated expenses grew 14.4%. As a reminder, the components of other unallocated includes 3 areas: core corporate, Global eCommerce and global leverage services. Recall for comparability, last year in the second quarter, we had a $49 million loss on mark-to-market foreign currency derivative positions. Without this item, other unallocated increased 26.7%.", "So let me provide additional detail on this increase. Within core corporate, we incurred approximately $34 million in expenses related to third-party advisors reviewing matters involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we expect these expenses to continue through the rest of the year. Excluding the expenses related to the FCPA, core corporate rose 13.2%, primarily due to higher incentive accruals resulting from better operating performance. You heard an update from Mike earlier on Global eCommerce activities, and we will continue to make ongoing investments in this important growth area moving forward.", "As you know, one of our key financial metrics is to grow operating income faster than sales growth. Second quarter consolidated operating income grew 4.9% to $6.7 billion, which was faster than the rate of growth for sales. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 6.4% compared to 4.7% for net sales. However, on a constant currency basis and giving effect to the $132 million prior year pretax items, consolidated operating income increased modestly, slower than sales at 4.3%. Net interest expense was $505 million, which was 12.6% lower than last year, primarily due to lower interest accruals on tax-related matters and reduced debt levels.", "Debt to total capitalization declined to 43.7% at the end of the quarter compared to 45.7% last year. Our improvement was driven by strong earnings performance, which also allowed us to reduce our outstanding debt balance.", "The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 was 32.8%, and we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 to be at the lower end of the previous guidance of 32.5% to 33.5%. You may see quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate that may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, tax law changes, audit results, discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. This leads us to income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart of $4 billion, an increase of 5.7% from last year's second quarter of $3.8 billion.", "During the quarter, we paid out $1.3 billion in dividends and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases. Since our Board of Directors approved the $15 billion share repurchase authorization in June 2011, the company retired $7.1 billion, leaving $7.9 billion for additional share repurchase.", "Free cash flow was $6.1 billion for the 6 months ended July 31, 2012, a 50% increase compared to $4 billion last year. The change was driven by the improvement in net inventory investment, changes in our 401(k) plan which affected the timing of accrued liabilities and improved operating results.", "Consolidated inventory grew 4.4% compared to last year, in line with our net sales increase of 4.5%. Recall that our corporate goal is to grow inventory at or less than the rate of sales. We are proud that we are making progress on this important goal, and this is an improvement in our previous trends. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 89%, which is in line with the 90% we reported this time last year.", "Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2012, was 18.1% compared to 18.4% for the previous year. Increased levels of average working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions affected ROI.", "Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the second quarter. During the quarter, we added a total of 6 million square feet through 120 net new expanded and relocated units.", "You will hear more from Doug on the changes in our capital plans for International, and Charles will update the total company forecast. Now let's turn it over to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?", "William S. Simon", "Thank you, Jeff. I'm very pleased to report today that Walmart U.S. had another strong quarter. We delivered positive comps and continued to grow sales. We leveraged expenses and contributed very strong profits to the company by growing operating income faster than sales.", "Now let's get into the specifics. Walmart U.S. generated a 2.2% sales comp, above the midpoint of our guidance of 1% to 3%. The momentum was continued throughout the quarter. In fact, July was one of our strongest months this year, delivering positive comps on top of positive comps last year.", "I'm particularly energized by these results and proud of this performance. It highlights the effectiveness of our strategy, which enables us to consistently deliver results for our customers and for our shareholders. We're focused and aligned, driving the productivity loop throughout our business. In the second quarter, we again leveraged expenses across our operation, invested in price and helped our customers save.", "Customers are responding to our continued focus on providing the right assortment at Every Day Low Prices. During the quarter, our average comp traffic increase was equal to serving, on average, 80,000 additional customers every day of the 13-week period. These visits represented a 0.4% increase in comp traffic in addition to a 1.8% increase in ticket for the quarter. When I think about our comp in terms of pure customer numbers, it's pretty amazing. Sales growth in the quarter was well balanced, with positive comps across all 3 geographic business units and in all of our store formats.", "Our 1.4 million associates did an outstanding job serving our customers, and I'm particularly pleased with the results we achieved during the key holiday events of Mother's Day, Father's Day and the Fourth of July. Despite a midweek holiday, July 4 sales, especially in key categories like food, significantly exceeded our expectations.", "As you know, price leadership is at the center of our strategy. Our marketing team is focused on ensuring the price message resonates with our customers and sets us apart from the competition. You've likely seen a few of our market basket challenge commercials. These ads are tailored for individual markets, but the message is always the same: Walmart wins on the overall basket of items.", "The TV spots are currently running in key markets and clearly show the price separation Walmart offers with competitors in grocery and drug. For those of you who haven't seen one of our commercials, I encourage you to visit the Investor portion of our company's website to see one.", "Customers are responding favorably to the message, which is running in 25 metro markets. We're proud that we do so well competitively on the basket challenges. Keep in mind, these are actual baskets the customer has purchased, not just a key item comparison. We're also pleased with the sales and traffic results versus the control markets. Our customers appreciate value, especially in uncertain economic times. We'll continue to lead on price through the back-to-school season and into the second half of the year.", "Now I'd like to discuss the details of our second quarter performance. Net sales were $67.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Adding an additional $2.5 billion in sales on top of a nearly $65 billion base is no small feat, yet our teams continue to do it quarter after quarter by simply focusing on serving our customers.", "Gross profit dollars were up 3% year-over-year to $18.6 billion. Similar to last quarter, the gross profit rate was down 20 basis points from last year. As we noted last quarter, you'll continue to see a decrease in our gross margin rate versus last year as we execute our strategic price investment.", "As you may know, in addition to their regular pay, we offer hourly associates a quarterly bonus. Our operating performance continues to result in historically high field incentives. For the second consecutive quarter, more than 80% of our eligible hourly associates will benefit from that near-record incentive payout. We're pleased to share this success with our associates and know they appreciate the immediacy of the payout.", "Overall operating expenses were up 2.5% in the second quarter to $13.6 billion, well below our sales growth. Even with the impact of these higher field incentive payouts, we leveraged operating expenses by 27 basis points this quarter.", "Operating income grew faster than sales, rising 5.3% over last year to almost $5.3 billion. We continue to increase efficiency throughout the business and drive additional dollars to the bottom line.", "Our inventory was up 3.6% versus last year, which was slightly below the rate of sales growth for the second quarter. We're refining our local assortment while focusing on back-to-school and the holiday season. We're excited about our plans, and we feel our inventory position will help us drive sales in the back half of the year.", "Most of our merchandising areas again delivered solid performance, though industry trends in electronics continue to impact the broader entertainment category. We're seeing market share growth across grocery and health and wellness. You can expect to hear more about market share and how we're using Nielsen data during our annual analyst meeting in October.", "Grocery, which includes food and consumables, delivered a low single-digit positive comp for the quarter. Our focus on winning key seasonal events paid off as we saw very strong food sales around Fourth of July holiday.", "Another big success this quarter has been our USDA Choice steak program. The program has helped drive sales to the entire meat department, which outperformed the overall food business by approximately 300 basis points in the second quarter. The unmatched combination of quality and value has resonated with a large number of our customers, including many who had not previously shopped our meat department.", "In consumables, sales remain strong as our continued focus on price and assortment drove positive traffic. For the third consecutive quarter, all departments reported positive comps as customers responded favorably to product innovation and value-driven pricing. Our health and wellness business also performed well, delivering a low single-digit positive comp.", "In OTC, our broadened assortment, particularly our focus on opening price point, resonated well with customers and drove growth through the quarter. As expected, our prescription business experienced an increase in brand-to-generic conversion as drugs such as Plavix and Lipitor were affected by new generic offerings. While this has had an impact on top line sales, we benefited in profitability. More importantly, these generic drugs provide an opportunity to help our customers live better by lowering the cost of their prescriptions. As generic conversions accelerate in the third and fourth quarters, we'll continue to actively manage through the transitions and deliver additional value for our customers.", "At walmart.com, our team is committed to making it easier for our pharmacy customers to shop. In conjunction with @WalmartLabs, we redesigned our pharmacy website and simplified the process of ordering prescriptions online. Since the relaunch in May, script comps have increased every month.", "Hardlines continued its positive trend with a low single-digit positive comp. A stronger and broader assortment is driving sales across all categories, and we feel good about the balanced growth of this business. Stationery and crafts improved significantly this quarter, while sporting goods, automotive and hardware also performed well.", "Within crafts, our reintroduction of fabrics resonated very well with our customers. We increased the assortment, doubled the footage of kids' crafts and added complementary merchandise. Our customers clearly noticed, and we achieved a double-digit comp in this area.", "Our entertainment business had a low single-digit negative comp. While industry dynamics continue to pressure media and gaming, demand for tablets and tablet accessories remains strong. Customers continue to seek out the exclusive Walmart Straight Talk offering and our expanded assortment of smartphones. Straight Talk prepaid phones posted strong double-digit comp growth in the second quarter. We also introduced a solutions-focused merchandising approach that drove stronger printer and ink sales.", "Home, including seasonal categories, had a low single-digit positive comp. Our continued focus on basics supported by strong item merchandising and a refined assortment drove strong performance in the quarter. Indoor living, led by cooking and dining, again performed well as most departments posted an increased comp versus the first quarter.", "Back-to-school and back-to-college shopping is well underway. Our stores were ready to serve shoppers early in the season, and we're pleased with the results. Season-to-date, key back-to-school apparel categories are up 7%. Within home, we're seeing strong performance in college essentials, like bedding and bath.", "We've stepped up our ability to serve students and teachers by integrating our stores with eCommerce. Classrooms by Walmart is a new online tool which digitized almost 55,000 school supply lists across the country. Walmart's the first major retailer to offer this feature, and it includes schools in all 50 states.", "We're using other online tools to drive sales through walmart.com and in our nearly 4,000 stores. Our online integration offers fun and affordable options for college living by inspiring customers to build their own rooms. It's driving sales in furniture, storage and home, and is getting strong attention through Pinterest. Our closets for less tool helps families mix and match basic outfits and has driven increased interest in our apparel departments.", "Speaking of apparel, our momentum continued in the second quarter. I'm proud of the work that the team has done, and I'm very happy to say that our focus on basics is working. For the quarter, we delivered low single-digit positive comp, our second consecutive quarter of positive comps. Our customers continue to turn to Walmart for their basics, a key element of our apparel strategy that is built around jeans, underwear, socks and tees. You see this executed in every store. In the second quarter, we had solid results in ladies' and men's department as well as positive comps in shoes, which benefited from the addition of new brands.", "We're pleased with the balanced growth we're seeing across the box. Our focus on assortment and pricing is resonating well, and customers are shopping the entire store. Overall, both the grocery and general merchandise business performed well and had positive comps.", "In the second quarter, we continue to see varying inflationary trends across the box. Within entertainment, deflation continues to impact sales growth in electronics. Total grocery inflation moderated slightly from what we reported in the first quarter. In categories with higher inflation, customers continue to trade down.", "We are also monitoring key commodities in the severe drought across parts of the country to gauge potential impact on food prices throughout the remainder of the year. Walmart is well positioned to serve our customers in this challenging market environment.", "We're gearing up for the second half of the year both online and in our stores. We also continue to grow through new stores. In the second quarter, we added 27 Supercenters, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. As we continue to accelerate our small format program, we opened 17 new Neighborhood Markets this quarter, the most small format growth we had in a single quarter. So far this year, we've opened 24 of our projected 80 to 100 small formats this fiscal year.", "Small formats continue to play a bigger part of our real estate strategy. Our Neighborhood Markets continue to provide strong performance with positive sales and traffic comps. We're excited about the strategic investments we're making in this format. Our first 2 California Neighborhood Markets opened this quarter and are exceeding expectations.", "Our first Express stores have now been open for a year and are generating positive comp sales. We will continue to monitor and expand this test format. In the coming quarters, we're going to begin refining our distribution and operations strategy with the opening of multiple Express stores in a single markets.", "During the third quarter, we expect to open between 95 and 100 total new units, which include both small formats and Supercenters, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. You'll hear more about our future capital plans in October during our annual meeting for the investment community.", "Within our distribution network, our logistics team again reduced cost per case shipped by 5.4% this quarter versus last year's second quarter, excluding the impact of fuel cost. We transported 65 million more cases and drove 5 million fewer miles, which lowered expenses and supported our sustainability initiatives. The logistics organization continues to be a key leverage driver for our business. Productivity improvements in this area of the business benefit both our gross profit rate and our expense leverage.", "Our store operations team has implemented a number of changes to drive productivity and enhance our customers' experience. We're further leveraging automation, like our My Guide tool, which helps managers with everything from resource planning to on-shelf availability. These types of investments that scale over our nearly 4,000 stores improve our efficiency.", "We're also excited about the return of our holiday layaway program, which will begin in the third quarter. Quite simply, this serves a key need for our customers, and we're happy to make it available again. We've put in a lot of hard work and are well prepared for the back half of the year.", "From a comp perspective, let me remind you that last year's third quarter comp was positive 1.3%. We're forecasting comp sales for the 13-week period from July 28 through October 26, 2012, to increase between 1% and 3%.", "I'm very pleased with our performance as we delivered strong, consistent results by executing our strategy. In the third quarter, we'll continue to leverage expenses and invest the savings in price to fuel the productivity loop. We'll continue to support our pricing message on TV and with other media. We have a powerful strategy, and our Walmart associates know how to drive results. I'm confident in our ability to deliver sustained strong financial performance.", "Now I'll turn it over to Doug for the International update. Doug?", "C. Douglas McMillon", "Thank you, Bill. Walmart International continues to drive sales growth and profitability. Net sales for the second quarter grew 6.4%, and operating income grew a little slower on a reported basis at 5.4%. On a constant currency basis, sales would have grown 7.2%, and operating income would have been up 11.9%. Every market delivered positive comps, and I'm pleased that our largest markets, the U.K., Mexico and Canada, collectively delivered stable growth, solid margins and expense leverage despite challenging environments.", "Let me take a moment to describe how we're driving growth in returns from the Walmart International perspective. As you know, we have a consistent purpose everywhere we operate: to save people money so they can live better. In addition to our purpose, our organizational culture is driving consistency. Our Walmart culture supports our expectations of the ways associates should behave in order to drive results.", "More recently, we've worked to strengthen the consistency of our operating principles. These principles include executing EDLP and EDLC, being merchandise driven, uncovering even greater opportunities for leverage across our markets and leading on social and environmental issues. And it's no surprise that when we implement these principles consistently, we get results.", "Driving our EDLP-EDLC business philosophy into our markets remained a key priority. Where we're doing it well, we're winning. For example, EDLP has progressed well in Brazil. And from a trend perspective, comp sales are better, and we leveraged operating expenses this quarter.", "Regardless of the market, customers want great merchandise at great prices. When we deliver that combination, we increase sales. In our Builders Warehouse format in South Africa, we recently launched a Great Value battery. As you know, Great Value is an important Walmart brand, and this battery retails for 35% less than the average national brand, and sales are going well. When we do this item by item, category by category, we can consistently grow comp sales and fulfill our purpose.", "In a business with the reach of Walmart, we can certainly leverage ideas and processes. We have teams with particular expertise on topics from managing inventory as it flows through a store to format development and from systems to training that can be perfected and exported to others. For example, the associate scheduling process refined in the U.S. is being implemented in some formats in Mexico, and this is expected to improve service and productivity in the future.", "Leading on social and environmental issues is consistent with our purpose and a key operating principle. And when we can meet sustainability goals and save money, it's a winning combination. One of our largest operating costs is for energy. In markets like Mexico and Japan, energy costs continue to rise. Now in Mexico, one wind farm is supplying almost 60% of the energy needs of the 348 stores. Our annual energy costs are now $3 million less than last year. By buying power at a set rate, we lower energy costs and mitigate cost fluctuations. Our goals are simple: drive growth and improve returns. We're creative in our execution but completely focused on ensuring that our foundation to achieve these goals becomes even stronger.", "Now let's get into more of the financial results. Please remember that in the following discussion, we use the term constant currency, as Carol specified earlier.", "On a reported basis, International net sales were $32 billion, up 6.4%. Currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales by approximately $2.2 billion. Operating expenses were up 4.1%, and the segment leveraged operating expenses. Operating income was $1.5 billion, up 5.4%. Currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased operating income by $110 million.", "On a constant currency basis, International's second quarter net sales would have been $32.3 billion, up 7.2%. Acquisitions generated $1.9 billion in sales. Our gross profit rate was flat with last year, and operating expenses grew slower than sales as the majority of our markets leveraged operating expenses for the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $1.6 billion, up 11.9% and growing faster than sales.", "On a reported basis, inventory was up 4.6% against our sales growth of 6.4%, but we always take a closer look at inventory on a constant currency basis. We haven't let up on our goal to improve inventory management, and there remains room for further improvement. But I'm pleased to report progress. Constant currency inventory would have grown 12% over last year, an improvement since the fourth quarter of last year. I'm very pleased that inventory days on hand were well managed in the U.K., Canada and the Asia markets. In our Latin America markets, inventory days on hand are higher than we would like, but I'm pleased to see improving trends since the challenges we had coming out of the fourth quarter.", "Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis. And unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal calendar basis.", "Let's begin with EMEA, which stands for Europe, the Middle East and Africa and which also includes Canada. The U.K. had a strong second quarter, growing sales and growing operating income faster than sales, excluding fuel. Despite a difficult consumer environment and the wettest weather on record, ASDA gained market share in the second quarter according to the Kantar Worldwide Panel Total Till Roll for the 12 weeks ending July 8. Excluding fuel, net sales grew 3.2%. Comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.7%, with ticket up 2.6%, and traffic decreasing 1.9%. The strongest performances were in grocery, apparel and electronics. In addition, our online business in U.K. improved its already strong performance with sales growth of 22.1% in the quarter.", "ASDA's continued commitment to EDLP was recognized by The Grocer magazine in June. ASDA's been named Britain's lowest-priced supermarket for the 15th year running and Britain's favorite supermarket for the second year in a row. In addition, the ASDA Price Guarantee continues to build a loyal following. In Q2, it attracted an average of over 600,000 checks per week.", "The U.K.'s gross profit rate has increased slightly from last year due to strong inventory control in nonfood merchandise. Second quarter expenses grew slower than sales as ASDA continues to develop sustainable efficiency savings through process improvements.", "Moving to Canada. Walmart Canada had good sales growth, and operating income increased compared to last year's results. Net sales grew 3.8% in the second quarter compared to last year, and comparable sales in the second quarter increased 0.5%. Walmart Canada's average ticket increased 0.9%, with traffic declining 0.4%.", "Walmart Canada had strong comp sales in food and consumables, health and wellness and home lines. Some of the seasonal business was pulled forward into the first quarter due to good weather, so apparel and home lines were below expectations in the second quarter. Gross profit rate increased slightly due to greater sales penetration in private label. Expenses grew faster than sales primarily due to investments in our more aggressive new store growth.", "As we have announced, this year marks the largest expansion program in Walmart Canada's 18-year history, with 73 projects scheduled. We will open the first of our Zellers to Walmart conversions this month. This first converted store, located in Ontario, will be almost 70,000 square feet and will include dry grocery merchandise.", "Turning to Africa. Massmart continues to deliver strong performance in Sub-Saharan Africa. As you know, Massmart is a publicly held company in South Africa with a June year end and announces results every 6 months. Massmart's next earnings release is scheduled for Wednesday, August 22. We reached the anniversary of our acquisition of Massmart, and in future quarters, we'll report comparable results of our performance in Sub-Saharan Africa as defined by Massmart's reporting schedule.", "For the 12 months ended June 24, 2012, Massmart's total sales grew 15.5%, and comparable sales grew 9.6% versus the same period in 2011. Inflation was estimated at 1.8%. Massmart provided a pre-earnings release on August 7 and expects to grow net earnings by 36% to 44% for the 12 months ending June 2012.", "We continue to be excited about the opportunities to share best practices and expertise with Massmart. We've worked with Massmart to implement unique Walmart-branded extended price cut promotions, which delivered significant savings to South African consumers. As part of these promotions, we partner with suppliers to improve lead times and forecasting, which is a driving factor behind our ability to provide lower prices.", "Moving on to Latin America. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reports its earnings under IFRS, so some numbers are different from Walmex reported numbers.", "Walmex had solid consolidated sales growth, and operating income increased from last year. Walmex's consolidated net sales for the second quarter were up 10%. Mexico's net sales were up 10.5%, and comparable sales were up 3%. Average ticket in Mexico increased 4.1%, and customer traffic decreased 1.1% over last year.", "Mexico's second quarter comp store sales for the self-service formats grew 2.7%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, grew faster at 4.5%. As a reminder, ANTAD is the National Association of Supermarkets and Department Stores and provides industry data and market share analysis.", "In Central America, overall sales increased 6.5%, and comp sales were up 0.4% on a constant currency basis. Second quarter consolidated gross profit rate for Walmex increased slightly from last year. Walmex leveraged consolidated operating expenses on store productivity initiatives, and operating income grew faster than sales.", "Now let me cover our store growth plans in Mexico and Central America. In late June, Walmex announced a number of changes to its expansion program that will result in a delay of some stores by as much as 90 days. The revisions to the expansion program are partially due to additional steps Walmex is adding to its real estate process that extend the average time required to open a store. These steps include reinforcing documentation that supports real estate projects and enhancing processes with our business partners.", "In addition, some stores that are scheduled to open in the latter half of December have been moved into January 2013 to allow our operations team to focus on the Christmas season. As a result of these changes, Walmex will add 5 million square feet and spend $1.3 billion in capital expenditures for fiscal 2013. By delaying our Walmex store openings, we have a decrease in our annual international square footage growth but will still spend the dollars in this year, ahead of the openings.", "Moving on to Brazil. Brazil grew sales in the second quarter but had a slight operating loss for the quarter. As you know, Brazil began the EDLP journey last year, and we believe we're on our way to setting a stronger foundation and operating model in this important market.", "Second quarter sales in Brazil grew 10.2% from last year, with comparable sales growing 5%. Average ticket grew 6.5%, and traffic declined 1.5% when compared to last year. The average ticket increase continues to be an encouraging sign that our customers see the value, and we will continue to demonstrate price leadership on a broad basket of goods.", "Our suppliers and customers are benefiting from the simplification and efficiencies that EDLP brings to our retail business. We have not implemented EDLP in our wholesale formats yet, but that work is underway. Food and consumables in our retail formats were the first categories to have EDLP, because they drive customer loyalty.", "Brazil leveraged operating expenses in the second quarter, growing them slower than sales. There's an ongoing focus on improving Brazil's operating income through expense management. Our in-country leadership continues to drive the productivity loop and invests the savings back into price to further drive sales growth. The sales growth and stability that they have already achieved from the adoption of EDLP have allowed them to focus on reducing operating costs. Brazil achieved cost reductions in areas including advertising, workforce management and freight optimization. And I'm pleased to tell you, Walmart Brazil ranked among the top 25 customer service excellence awards, a recognition given every year by Revista Exame, the most important business magazine in the country.", "As we mentioned last quarter, we decided to slow down our new store growth in Brazil to ensure we are building a solid foundation to grow comp sales and to have EDLP in place. We made this decision last year, and so this year's growth has been slower than it would have been otherwise. Accordingly, we expect to decrease our square footage growth from our original plan.", "Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile is also a publicly held company and will release second quarter earnings on August 30. For their previously announced first quarter results ending March 31, 2012, Chile grew first quarter 2012 sales 13.9%. First quarter operating income was lower than the prior year as prior year results were distinctively impacted by the gain on the sale of an investment.", "Moving to Asia. Walmart China grew sales during the second quarter and slightly grew operating income versus a prior year loss. Net sales for the second quarter grew 10.9% over the last year, and the comparable store sales growth was 5%. Average ticket grew 10% in China, but traffic declined 5%. Second quarter gross profit rate was flat to last year. Operating expenses grew slower than sales.", "Normally, at this time, I'd remind you that we're still working on closing the Trust-Mart acquisition. I'm pleased to say that during the second quarter, we completed the purchase of the remaining ownership in Trust-Mart and can now completely focus on running great stores in these locations.", "In China, as with the rest of our markets, our customers want stores that are easy to shop, easy to get into and out of and are convenient for their lives. To improve our site selection and store design, we made a decision earlier this year to moderate our growth. In the past, we may have been too flexible and accepted stores that were located on too many levels or had difficult configurations. We now will open fewer stores this year than our original plan with only about half the new store square footage than we had forecast. We want all of our new stores in China to exceed customer expectations. Our locations in China are leased, so there is no significant change in capital dollars, only in square footage.", "Turning to Japan. Japan's net sales, comparable sales and average ticket all grew in the second quarter in nominal terms, and Walmart Japan continues its market outperformance. Net sales grew 2%, with comp sales up 1.6%. Second quarter ticket grew 2%, and traffic was down 0.4%. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the second quarter declined by 1.9% from last year, indicating that Walmart Japan continues to outperform the market. Operating income increased from last year. Gross profit rate increased slightly, and Walmart Japan leveraged operating expenses from last year.", "Across all markets, we continue to expand our store base to serve more customers, and it's important to do so in a disciplined and targeted way. As I mentioned, in certain markets, we're making separate and distinct actions to adjust our store growth in those markets.", "Therefore, as a total division, we anticipate that the International square footage growth for FY '13 will be approximately 21 million to 23 million square feet and our CapEx dollars to be approximately $4.6 billion to $5 billion. Our previous forecast was 30 million to 33 million square feet and $5 billion to $5.5 billion. This forecast does not include future acquisitions, should we make any, but does include capital for Massmart growth. Let me remind you that our CapEx dollars do not decrease in direct correlation with the square footage due to the effect of leasing in China and the timing of construction costs incurred in Mexico.", "Let me summarize the key takeaways for International. We have momentum in our business and are prioritizing improvement in Brazil and China to position them for success for many years to come. We're progressing on further implementation of EDLP and EDLC in several markets. We're investing in our infrastructure and driving stronger foundations to ensure we are best positioned for the future. And we're integrating sustainability and social programs to help our communities and benefit our business. As always, we remain focused on helping our customers save money so they can live better. We serve our customers with passion and with purpose, and we'll continue to do our very best to serve them well every day.", "Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?", "Rosalind Gates Brewer", "Thanks, Doug. Sam's Club had another very impressive quarter. We grew the top line, delivered positive comps and most important, grew operating income faster than sales. We continue to deliver steady traffic to the clubs. We believe that the improvements in our quality and overall merchandise offerings are key to driving these results. In fact, member engagement scores continue to achieve record levels. We're also investing in price to deliver greater value on top of these quality improvements.", "Comp sales, without fuel, were up 4.2% for the 13-week period. Comp traffic and ticket for the 13-week period were up by 1.8% and 2.4%, respectively. This is on top of a 5% increase in the comparable period last year, indicating very strong member response to our business. Both Business and Advantage members helped drive increases in traffic and ticket.", "Net sales, including fuel, were $14.2 billion, a 3.8% increase over last year's second quarter. Fuel prices in the second quarter were down 5.6% compared to last year, and gallons sold were up 3.9%, thus creating a drag on overall comp sales of 0.8%. Gross profit rate was up 23 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased only 2 basis points, and operating income increased 10.1% to $535.8 million.", "Although fuel is an important traffic driver for the clubs, volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. Therefore, the remainder of our discussion today is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes, unless otherwise noted.", "Net sales were $12.5 billion, up 4.6% from last year. All geographic regions posted good comp performance, but the north division led sales performance for the quarter. This is the result of an intense focus by our operations team on improving the member shopping experience in our clubs. Gross profit rate increased by 17 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, driven by changes in merchandising mix, while gross profit increased 5.9%.", "Strategic initiatives to deliver greater value, as I mentioned earlier, led to consistent strong comp performance across the merchandise portfolio. We ran an extended eValues Savings Celebration this quarter in anticipation of the midweek July 4 celebration, which drove traffic into the clubs for the week.", "As multiple retailers across various retail segments, including the club channel, invest in price, there has been greater pricing pressure in the marketplace. While this is good for members and customers, it does pressure margin. However, as members have noticed exciting merchandise offerings in higher margin categories, mix has favorably impacted our margin rate.", "We have worked hard to balance our price investment with the impact of inflation. For the second quarter, Sam's retail inflation was between 175 and 225 basis points, primarily in food, versus 200 and 250 basis points in last year's second quarter. Cost inflation was slightly higher than retail inflation, putting pressure on margin. At the same time, deflation continued in certain categories, like dairy and electronics.", "Like Bill, we're monitoring the potential impact of the drought in the Midwest and the pressure it is expected to have on both corn and soybeans. We will continue to evaluate how this will affect food prices as we go through the year.", "Grocery, including fresh and consumables, remains key to driving traffic and attracting new members. It is a key differentiator for us in the marketplace, and as we continue to invest in price, it will remain so. We delivered high single-digit comps in grocery and mid-single-digit comps in both beverages and fresh freezer cooler despite deflation in dairy. Members continue to enjoy new products, including hybrids like pluots, a plum-apricot mix and new wine labels.", "In our consumables business, where we continue to focus on price, we had solid increases in unit sales. Tabletop and personal paper categories had mid-single-digit increases. Our recent launch of the new Member's Mark paper plate is outselling comparable branded items and is creating additional margin that allows us to price more aggressively.", "Tobacco sales, which remain important for our convenience store owners, were a drag on overall comp sales for the quarter, but that reduction helped drive a merchandising mix that was a positive to profit. Technology, entertainment and office achieved low single-digit comps. Performance was strong in portable electronics, including tablets but challenged by continued softness in video games, movies and books.", "Focus on product quality and ensuring that we have the right brands at a great value have driven results in discretionary categories. We achieved high single-digit comps in both apparel and home, with brands like Carter for infants, Nautica for men and Lucky Brand Jeans among our new product offerings.", "Health and wellness continues to be a key traffic driver as well and overall, delivered a mid-single-digit comp increase. Hearing Aid Centers achieved double-digit comps for the quarter. We had mid-single-digit comps in OTC and low single-digit comps in prescriptions. Like Walmart U.S., the recent availability of popular prescriptions that have moved from branded to generic status negatively impacted overall sales but drove profitability in unit volume. Rx script count was up mid-single digits, and we expect this trend to continue.", "With an eye toward driving growth in eCommerce, we upgraded our checkout processes and enhanced the Click 'n' Pull experience. Our members continue to accelerate their adoption of mobile and tablet technologies as a means of accessing the Sam's Club brand anytime, anywhere. During the second quarter, we had triple-digit increases in daily uses of our mobile applications versus last year.", "Membership and other income was up 4.6% versus last year. In other income, similar to the first quarter, we realized a financial benefit that is part of a profit sharing arrangement with our credit card provider. Last year, we recognized this benefit in full at year end. This year, however, we are recognizing this benefit each quarter.", "Membership income for the second quarter increased 1.6% versus last year. Remember, for reporting purposes, membership income is recognized over the membership period rather than when it is collected. Renewal performance from primary members remained steady. However, primary new member sign-ups were lower as we anniversaried a special promotional offer from Q2 last year. Plus membership continues to grow versus last year, and we were pleased with the number of members who upgraded to the Plus membership level during our July eValues Savings Celebration. Business add-on memberships remained soft as we continue to see small businesses manage their budgets tightly. While our paid primary membership base is increasing year-over-year, we have an opportunity to accelerate that rate of growth.", "Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 5 basis points in the second quarter. Our clubs continued to manage expenses and leverage wages. Productivity initiatives are well underway to continue to improve leverage.", "Through our upgraded scheduling system, we are focused on ensuring more associates are serving members during peak shopping periods. Our member engagement surveys continue to show that members are pleased with the manner in which associates are delivering value in the clubs, validating that we can be efficient without sacrificing service.", "Units per labor hour were up 2.5% versus last year. The wage gains were partially offset by investments in other areas. One of those areas was marketing. Compared to last year, we have stepped up our marketing activities, and expenses are higher in this area. During the quarter, we began testing new ways to better engage prospective and existing members. For example, we're testing a new communication campaign that includes television, radio, billboard and digital media in certain metro markets. As you know, Sam's has not historically used TV advertising, so this is a more integrated and aggressive approach. Our tagline is: more in savings, more volume and more excitement.", "We continue to innovate in our clubs with the expanded rollout of self-checkout and are on track to be in half of our clubs by the end of the third quarter. Clubs with self-checkout have higher member engagement scores around fast than those without self-checkout.", "We are very pleased with our inventory sell-through during the second quarter, particularly in such seasonal merchandise as lawn and patio. Inventories grew 8.5%, primarily due to inflation, early merchandise flow and new items in certain categories. Inventory growth, with fuel, was 8.4%. Clubs are clean and have transitioned from summer to the fall season.", "We finished the second quarter with strong profits. Operating income, without fuel, increased 10.8% to $512 million compared to last year. Our new club performance continues to exceed projections. During the quarter, we opened one new club in Denham Springs, Louisiana and relocated a club in Worcester, Mass. We also completed the expansion of our club in Monroe, Louisiana. I'm really excited that next quarter, we plan to open as many as 7 new clubs. It's been a long while since we opened that many new clubs in a quarter, and our team is energized about this rate of new growth.", "Looking ahead, we expect inflation to have less contribution to the top line, though we continue to monitor the impact of the drought on certain foods. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from July 28 through October 26 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 5.7% for the comparable 13-week period.", "Overall, Sam's Club is very well positioned for the rest of the year. We're investing in price and moving to even greater value for our members. We continue to add new brands, especially as we strengthen our offerings in apparel and home, and we remain focused on improving membership sign-ups.", "Now I'll turn the program over to Charles for a wrap-up and guidance. Charles?", "Charles M. Holley", "Thanks, Roz. As Mike said, sales and earnings were strong in the second quarter, and our associate morale continues to be strong as well. Customers and shareholders alike are seeing greater value from Walmart. Heading into the second half of the year, we feel very good about our momentum, especially in our Walmart U.S. business.", "Last quarter, I shared with you 4 key operating goals for having a successful year. Let me review each of these goals. The first goal, Walmart U.S. must continue its momentum. Walmart U.S. is delivering a broad assortment at the lowest price, and you heard today that customers continue to respond well. With the right mix of local relevance in every store, the breadth of assortment allows us to take better care of our customers. We have now delivered positive comp sales for 4 consecutive quarters. Our marketing is reinforcing our strong price positioning, and we believe this places us in a great position for the third and fourth quarters.", "Second goal, Sam's Club must continue the success it has experienced over the last several quarters. Sam's continues to deliver solid comp growth on top of last year's strong performance. Members are seeing greater quality, and we're providing superior value for the membership fee. Technology applications and operational initiatives, like self-checkout, are adding to an improved shopping experience.", "Third goal, we must improve profits and returns in Walmart International, especially for Brazil and China. Internationally, our more mature markets continue to generate the majority of our revenue and profit growth. We have seen the U.K., Mexico and Canada markets provide a solid growth foundation, and we expect that will continue through the rest of this year. We've shared that we still have challenges in Brazil and China, and results won't be quick. But with the leadership teams in place, along with our focus on Every Day Low Prices, we believe we're on the right path.", "Last goal, we must expand our capabilities and increase sales in our Global eCommerce business as we integrate multichannel offerings for customers across markets. We're making progress on these eCommerce efforts, and you will continue to hear more about these activities throughout the year. You heard some specific examples earlier in the operating segment discussions, and you will hear more at the annual investor meeting in October.", "On the corporate side, we continue to implement process improvements, like our SAP initiative, which allows us to manage our global business more efficiently. Like the operating segments, our corporate and shared service areas are just as focused on reducing cost and improving efficiencies.", "Overall, we've delivered solid comp growth in our U.S. businesses this quarter, having built on the success of the first quarter. All markets within International had positive comp sales. We grew earnings per share in the second quarter 8.3% despite significant currency impact to the top line and profits, and we leveraged operating expenses. We added 120 net new stores for 6 million new square feet of selling space.", "We were able to deliver these results because of our commitment to the productivity loop. It's not just about Every Day Low Price. Yes, we need that, but we can only drive EDLP because of our relentless focus on reducing costs. Recall that beginning this year, our goal is to reduce SG&A as a percentage of sales by at least 100 basis points over 5 years. We are off to a good start this year.", "We're taking pure cost out of the business, empowering our associates and investing savings back into price reductions or profitability. The result is we are more productive for customers across our markets and for shareholder value. A few examples would include: standardizing replenishment systems to improve inventory flow; expanding the store scheduling systems to better meet peak customer demand; using market and customer data from our Global Customer Insights Group to help merchants make better decisions on items and to gain sourcing efficiencies; and consolidating our Latin American financial shared services locations into a single center in Costa Rica to allow for less costly overhead and more efficiency in our back office. You'll hear more examples at the October investor conference.", "Let me comment on our returns to shareholders. We continue to prioritize dividends and share repurchase as key uses of our cash, and we have generated free cash flow of $6.1 billion so far this year. You heard the details earlier from Jeff on our dividend payout and share repurchases. We remain committed to providing strong returns to our shareholders.", "Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2012, was 18.1% compared to 18.4% for the previous year. I'd like to point out that the 18.1% is flat with the ROI we reported last quarter, indicating that we are moderating our normal seasonal decline. Looking forward, we will continue to strengthen our capital efficiency model in support of our growth.", "During the rest of the year, we will add a significant number of units in the United States. Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club are on track with their expansion plans, but you also heard earlier from Doug about changes in the International growth plans and the resulting impact. Our new corporate CapEx forecast for fiscal 2013 is $12.6 billion to $13.5 billion and 36 million to 39 million square feet for the total company.", "So how are we set up to deliver for the third quarter? Clearly, you should expect consistency as we execute our strategies. As Mike said, the paycheck cycle remains pronounced, and there continues to be a lot of uncertainty in the global economy. Despite this uncertainty, we feel confident in our ability to deliver for our customers and shareholders.", "Putting together our forecast requires a little bit of science, history and art. We look at an incredible amount of data, including macroeconomic information, global indices and the needs of our customers around the world. Currency will likely continue to impact our top line and operating income.", "For the Q3 period, Bill and Roz shared the comp forecasts, 1% to 3% for Walmart U.S. and 3% to 5% for Sam's Club. Our fundamental business assumptions are still in place, and we expect continued sales growth on a consolidated basis of around 5% for the full year. We expect gross margins to continue to decline slightly as we invest in price. We also expect to incur approximately $35 million to $40 million in expenses for the review of matters relating to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act during each of the remaining quarters for this fiscal year. In addition, as Jeff noted, we estimate our full year tax rate to be around the low end of the range we have previously provided of 32.5% to 33.5%.", "Taking all of this into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 to range between $1.04 and $1.09, and this compares to $0.97 last year. For the full year, based on the economy, currency and the current momentum of our businesses, we are increasing our full year EPS range to $4.83 to $4.93. We are also narrowing the range by 50%, and we remain committed to share repurchase as long as it continues to create value for our shareholders. This is factored into our guidance as well. We expect to continue delivering solid financial performance and value to our shareholders.", "One last thing before I close. Walmart, along with a number of other leading merchants, forms the Merchant Customer Exchange or MCX, a new company dedicated to offering consumers a versatile mobile commerce application. MCX is committed to providing a mobile commerce solution capable of seamlessly integrating a wide range of consumer offers, payments and retail programs. This solution will be available through virtually any smartphone and will reduce unnecessary cost, keeping with Walmart's mission to save our customers money.", "Thank you for your interest in our company, and I hope to see many of you at the annual investor meeting in October.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Then we'll cover the operating segments: first, Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; followed by Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club. We'll close the call with our CFO, Charles Holley. He'll cover growth, leverage and returns, as well as provide our outlook for the remainder of the year.", "A number of you have asked about the potential impact of a 53-week year on our business. Let me remind you that unlike other retailers whose fiscal year coincides with a retail calendar, Walmart's fiscal year ends always on January 31. Walmart only reports comp store sales on a 4-5-4 basis for the U.S. segments.", "During last year's Q4 call, we stated that we would report fiscal 2013 comp store sales on a 53-week basis with 4-5-5 reporting for Q4. But to align with our company's internal operating systems this year, Walmart will now report Q4 on a 4-5-4 basis, so we will not recognize a 53-week retail calendar this year.", "Next year, fiscal 2014, we'll report comp store sales on a 53-week basis with 4-5-5 reporting in Q4. We ask that you please adjust your models accordingly.", "Within Walmart U.S., we discuss layaway. The revenue and comp sales associated with merchandise put on layaway is not recognized until the merchandise is completely paid for and picked up by the customer. Therefore, the vast majority of third quarter layaway transactions will be recognized in the fourth quarter.", "In discussing our operating results, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates that we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion today, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, we're referring to our operating results without the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions until those acquisitions are included in both comparable periods. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results allows investors like you to better understand our underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.", "When we use the term gross profit, we're referring to actual dollars. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit rate, refers to the percentage obtained by dividing gross profit by net sales dollars. All comparisons are calculated as the change between the current quarter and the prior year quarter, unless we state otherwise.", "In all references to earnings per share, or EPS conversationally, we really mean diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.", "One last point before we get to the earnings details. Additional information regarding our company's review of certain matters related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is included in our Form 8-K dated November 15, 2012, regarding our earnings release. These documents are available on both the Walmart corporate site that I mentioned earlier and the SEC website.", "So let's get on to our results. Mike Duke will kick off the news for the third quarter. Mike?", "Michael Terry Duke", "Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our financial performance for the third quarter and the dedication and hard work of our associates serving Walmart customers and communities around the world.", "Earnings per share were $1.08, which represents an 11.3% increase over the third quarter last year.", "At our October Analyst Meeting, you heard me talk about our disciplined approach to operating the business, the productivity loop and making investments. That discipline enabled the company to deliver really good profitability and expense leverage in a quarter of continued economic uncertainty for our customers.", "Here are some of the highlights for the quarter. Net sales were $113.2 billion, a 3.4% increase over last year. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have been almost $115 billion, an increase of roughly 5%. Consolidated operating income was up 4% from last year, again growing faster than sales. Return on investment was 18% and among the best in the retail industry. These results are a credit to the operating segments that drive our bottom line performance.", "So now I'll get into their key takeaways. Walmart U.S. posted a comp sales increase of 1.5% and delivered approximately $2.3 billion in net sales growth. Back-to-school activities drove sales early in the quarter, and the mid-September launch of layaway was important in helping customers. Operating income outpaced net sales growth for the quarter and was a key driver of our overall company profit.", "Bill and his team are executing very innovative plans to drive traffic and to help America's families have a great holiday season. That's what our customers expect, and we will deliver.", "We announced our extended Black Friday program, and customers are already working on their shopping list. Price will continue to be a major factor for customers over the holidays. Our strong price position and broad assortment are clear competitive advantages in an economy where customers may still be cautious with their budgets.", "Sam's Club posted a comp sales increase of 2.7% for the quarter without fuel. I'm pleased that Sam's delivered a 12.7% increase in operating income for the quarter. As you heard from Roz at the October meeting, there's still more work to do to accelerate membership income. I like the test the team is conducting in our Texas clubs, and we will continue to evaluate the results over the next several months. Sam's has also launched its price investment strategy and you can expect to see more of that in the fourth quarter.", "Walmart International grew net sales 2.4% to $33.2 billion for the quarter despite a negative impact from currency and a challenging global economy. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased a healthy 7.6% over last year. International grew or maintained market share in its major markets except for China. We're maintaining our focus on improving profitability and returns, especially in Brazil and China. The focus that Doug and his teams have on driving comp sales through EDLP, lowering expenses and delivering leverage is moving us down the path to continue to grow and gain market share.", "Across all of our markets, we are seeing the same price consciousness as we do in the U.S. More and more of Walmart's customers are part of a growing global middle class. They're looking for quality, value and a better life, and our EDLP model reinforces our competitive positioning.", "I recently spent a week visiting 3 of China's major cities: Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. While China's rate of growth has slowed, it's clear that a new generation of consumers is creating an immense retail market, and that includes a significant opportunity in eCommerce. We recently completed our 51% investment in Yihaodian, which will enable us to serve more Chinese customers online. We are now well positioned to grow with Chinese consumers whether they shop online or in stores.", "Global eCommerce sales are growing, and we will continue to make the right investments to strengthen an already good business. We've made significant progress this quarter in enhancing our walmart.com site for U.S. customers. The walmart.com search engine is improving conversion. We are enhancing eCommerce opportunities for shoppers in the U.K., Brazil and China, including a global platform that increases the assortment on our key online sites. We will continue to build the anywhere, anytime relationship that customers want and that sets us apart from retailers operating only in the e-commerce space.", "I want to thank our associates for being there for our customers. When the superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast, our associates jumped into action. The Walmart trucks rolled in, delivering water, food, blankets and other needed items. We have pledged $2 million to help with relief efforts. We will continue to do our part in the recovery, and we appreciate the kind words and the recognition from New York Governor Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Christie.", "We also continued to demonstrate our commitment to lead on social and environmental issues. At a recent event in Beijing with government officials, NGOs, academics and suppliers, I announced new goals for how we will use the Sustainability Index to design more sustainable products, to make our global supply chain more socially and environmentally responsible and to incent merchants to make sustainability a bigger part of their day-to-day jobs. We will continue to drive sustainability deeper into our operations as this makes us a stronger business.", "Our fundamentals are strong, and we are well positioned for the fourth quarter. We expect a very competitive holiday season and we are ready for it. Our teams across all 3 segments have done a great job working with our suppliers around the world to ensure that we are well stocked and offering the broadest assortment at the lowest prices in our stores and online.", "On behalf of everyone at Walmart, I wish you happy holidays, Merry Christmas and a great New Year.", "And now, I'll turn it over to Jeff for the financial details. Jeff?", "Jeffery Davis", "Thank you, Mike. As Mike just mentioned, Walmart reported EPS of $1.08, which was within our guidance of $1.04 to $1.09 and compared to $0.97 last year. While the current quarter benefited from a 31.3% effective tax rate, this benefit was substantially offset by approximately $105 million in pretax charges, which are included in operating expenses. More specifically, they are an approximate $69 million for charges in estimated contingent liabilities related to employment claims in Brazil and an approximate $36 million for damages from superstorm Sandy, mainly in our Walmart U.S. business.", "Now let's cover the details on the third quarter's consolidated results. Net sales increased 3.4% or $3.7 billion to $113.2 billion for the third quarter. Our net sales included a negative impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $1.7 billion. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 4.9% to $114.9 billion.", "Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, were 1.7% for the 13-week period ended October 26. In a few minutes, Bill and Roz will discuss the comp performance for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club.", "Membership and other income grew 2.1% compared to third quarter of last year. Therefore, the combination of net sales and membership and other income, which we refer to as total revenue, was $113.9 billion, up 3.4% from $110.2 billion last year.", "Consolidated gross profit rate was 24.5%, a 13-basis point reduction compared to the same time last year. You will hear more from our segment CEOs regarding their price investment in just a few moments.", "Now let's move our attention to leverage. We have 2 stated goals with respect to leverage: first, to grow operating expenses at a rate less than net sales growth; and second, to grow operating income at a rate greater than the net sales growth.", "With respect to operating expenses, the company leveraged expenses by 17 basis points, which covered the 13-basis point investment in gross profit rate. We are pleased to have delivered operating leverage for the quarter despite the $105 million in pretax items I mentioned earlier.", "Other unallocated expenses grew 16.4% during the quarter. Recall that other unallocated has 3 components: core corporate, Global eCommerce and global leverage services.", "Now let's take a moment to review the overall increase. Within our core corporate, we recognized approximately $48 million in charges related to third-party advisors reviewing matters involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Please note that this amount is higher than our previously stated quarterly estimate of $35 million to $40 million. However, we expect these expenses to continue through the fourth quarter at our previously stated estimate of $35 million to $40 million. Excluding this item, core corporate would have decreased by approximately 1.9%, and I'm happy to say that year-to-date, core corporate would only be up 1% versus last year. We will continue to invest in Global eCommerce and global leverage services as these areas will contribute greater growth and improved leverage in the future.", "This brings us to consolidated operating income in our second stated leverage goal. Third quarter consolidated operating income was $6.1 billion, an increase of 4%, which is also greater than the rate of net sales growth of 3.4%.", "Debt to total capitalization was reduced to 43.7% versus 46.9% last year. This improvement was driven by strong operating cash flows, which allowed us to reduce our leverage.", "Our balance sheet and credit rating remain very healthy, and we continue to have ample access to debt capital markets.", "As referred to previously, we may experience quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate as it may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, tax law changes, audit results, discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. This was the case with our third quarter effective tax rate. The rate of 31.3% compares to last year's effective tax rate of 34.5%. However, we continue to expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 to be at the lower end of our previous guidance of 32.5% to 33.5%.", "This leads us to income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart of $3.6 billion, an increase of 8.7% from last year. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in the third quarter. During the quarter, we added approximately 13 million retail square feet through 173 net new, expanded and relocated units. You've heard us talk about capital discipline being an even greater priority. I'm pleased to report today that, year-to-date, capital expenditures are $8.9 billion versus $9.5 billion last year. Later on the call, Charles will provide an update on the total company CapEx forecast for fiscal 2013.", "Free cash flow was $7 billion for the 9 months ended October 31, 2012. Let me say that again. $7 billion, which was an increase of more than $3.5 billion compared to last year. The increase was primarily a result of timing of payments of accrued incentives, improved operating results and disciplined investment.", "Now let's move to returns. The company paid $1.3 billion in dividends to its shareholders for the quarter and $4 billion year-to-date. In addition, the company repurchased approximately 16.6 million shares for the quarter and 71 million shares year-to-date, totaling approximately $1.2 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively.", "Through the combination of dividends and share repurchase, Walmart returned $2.5 billion to shareholders for the quarter and $8.7 billion year-to-date.", "Consolidated inventory grew 7.1% compared to last year, and you'll hear more about inventory investments from each of our segment CEOs.", "And finally, return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2012, was 18% compared to 18.2% for the previous year. It should not surprise you that our capital discipline benefited ROI. However, this benefit was mostly offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations.", "Now, let's turn it over to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?", "William S. Simon", "Thank you, Jeff. Let me start by saying how pleased I am with the performance of our U.S. business. We've aligned the business around an effective strategy fueled by the productivity loop, and we continue to produce consistent financial results.", "During the quarter, we again delivered solid sales across the business. Comp sales increased 1.5% as we lapped a positive 1.3% comp last year. Year-to-date, we delivered almost $4 billion in comp sales growth. The earlier launch of our expanded layaway program generated approximately $300 million in additional third quarter volume versus last year, most of which we will recognize in the fourth quarter when the customers pay for and pick up the merchandise.", "With average fuel prices up approximately 6% versus this time last year, some customers are consolidating their shopping trips. Traffic was up approximately 0.1%, but we were particularly encouraged by the 1.4% lift in ticket given the continued downward inflationary trends in some food and electronics categories. We're also encouraged by the continued increases in market share across food, consumables and over the counter combined, with overall third quarter share in these categories increasing 50 basis points versus last year, according to Nielsen.", "We had positive comps across all geographies and store formats. During the quarter, we focused on being the destination for back-to-school and Halloween shopping. Our merchants and operators developed a strong cross-functional plan, and I'm pleased with our execution and the sales growth achieved this year. As a reminder, a slightly larger portion of Halloween sales versus last year will fall into the fourth quarter comp period given how the 4-5-4 calendar falls this year.", "Similar to other retailers, we were impacted by superstorm Sandy. We recognized approximately $35 million of expenses related to inventory damage, cleanup and other miscellaneous items. Our dedicated associates responded quickly to reopen about 75% of approximately 300 impacted stores within 24 hours of closing, with all stores now fully operating.", "In addition to our $2 million pledge in relief support, we partnered with the governors of New York and New Jersey to bring additional water, food and supplies to those on the East Coast. We take pride in our ability to aid our customers and their families in these difficult circumstances. I want to thank our associates for their relentless support during this time.", "I'm inspired by the work of our associates in the field who were behind all of our results. In our annual engagement survey conducted this summer, the Walmart U.S. associate engagement scores rose 400 basis points over last year. Our financial results drove another quarter of strong field incentive payouts for hourly associates. Year-to-date, our associates will have received over $550 million in quarterly incentive payouts.", "Also, we continue Walmart's long history of developing talent within our stores. During the last year, we promoted approximately 165,000 associates, affording them additional career advancement.", "Our teams are ready for Christmas and the holidays, and we appreciate their passionate dedication to serving customers. As you probably know, our associates receive a 10% discount on general merchandise bought at Wal-Mart Stores all year long. And each year, we provide our associates with an additional special holiday discount with 10% off most food items during the month of December. This year, we've expanded the program by starting 2 weeks earlier.", "In addition, many of our associates work tirelessly to execute our Black Friday event. This year, we're providing an additional 10% discount on an entire basket of goods for those associates who are giving up a bit of their Thanksgiving holiday to better serve their customers. We've started planning early, and we'll provide our customers with an efficient and enjoyable holiday shopping experience.", "Now let's turn to the financial details of the third quarter. Walmart U.S. delivered net sales of $66.1 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion or 3.6% over last year.", "Gross profit increased $443 million versus last year to $18.3 billion. During the third quarter, gross profit rate decreased 30 basis points year-over-year as we continued to reduce margin and execute the strategic price investments.", "We also continue to significantly leverage expenses. For the quarter, operating expenses grew only 1.8%, half the rate of sales growth. Even with the impact of higher field incentive payouts this quarter, our team leveraged operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 37 basis points.", "Solid sales performance and disciplined expense management helped us deliver $4.8 billion in operating income for the quarter, a 4.5% increase year-over-year and a growth rate 90 basis points higher than our sales growth rate.", "Inventory grew at 4.3% over last year as we prepare to serve our customers during the holiday season. As we said, we bought deep in areas that matter to our customers, and we'll have the products they want. We're in a strong inventory position and well prepared for the fourth quarter.", "Before I cover the results of our merchandise areas, let me remind you that the vast majority of layaway sales are deferred until the fourth quarter and are not reflected in our business unit comps discussed here.", "Our grocery business, which includes food and consumables, delivered a low-single digit positive comp. We continue to execute our strategic price investments, driving price separation versus our competition. Overall grocery inflation continued to moderate and was approximately 50 basis points versus approximately 400 basis points last year.", "In food, our broad and localized assortment is resonating with the customer as demonstrated by our continued strength in areas like dry grocery. In addition, strategic initiatives like our USDA steak program continue to produce encouraging results with mid-single digit comp sales over a 39-week year-to-date period exceeding the overall food comp by about 250 basis points.", "In the third quarter, our food business also delivered strong performance across the key seasonal events including Labor Day, back-to-school and Halloween.", "Customers also responded well to the consistent execution of our consumables strategy, driving all departments to positive comps for the quarter. Assortment refinements, such as an emphasis on larger packs, helped deliver additional value for our customers. For instance, value pack sizing and other assortment additions helped increase our market share in pets by about 100 basis points versus last year.", "Health & Wellness continued its trend, generating a low-single digit positive comp. Over the counter remained very strong as our broad assortment and continued focus on opening price point drove traffic gains and unit growth. Customers are finding value in our broader assortment of active nutrition products like whey protein and meal supplement bars. As expected, brand-to-generic conversions continued to pressure top line sales, but conversions of LIPITOR and other brands continue to improve pharmacy margins.", "Comp sales in Hardlines increased by low-single digits. We continue to see steady good performance in stationery, crafts and sporting goods. Sporting goods had strong performance due to expanded hunting assortment, including guns and ammunition. The addition of key hardlines categories to layaway was attractive to customers who also purchased items not on the layaway list.", "In discussing entertainment, it's important to note that layaway plays a big part in sales of this business as many customers look to our assortment of top brands across the categories. An early start to layaway and new items helped drive additional customers to the business. Within entertainment, the interest in layaway resulted in approximately $200 million of incremental layaway volume versus third quarter last year. Top items on layaway included 50-inch televisions, gaming consoles and tablets.", "The continued strong industry deflation led to a low-single digit negative comp for entertainment. Within wireless, a broader assortment resulted in double-digit comp sales growth as customers continue to look at Walmart as a wireless destination. In media and gaming, we're well positioned for a very strong release schedule throughout the fourth quarter. Top releases like Halo and Call of Duty drove customers into our store over the last several weeks.", "Layaway drove a great deal of interest in toys, including toy construction, educational toys, ride-ons and bicycles. We're well stocked in this season's must-have toys and will be able to delight our younger customers all season long.", "Our apparel business posted a low-single digit comp increase, making this the third straight quarter of positive comps. The consistency of our apparel business and focus on basics, especially in kids, ladies and men's continues to drive growth despite the impact of a warm October across much of the country. We have worked hard on improving item quality, focusing on the elements that our customers appreciate and are optimistic that our current trend will continue into the holiday season.", "Home drove a low-single digit positive comp, benefiting from item merchandising, innovation and assortment refinement. We're seeing consistent results across home, making this the fourth straight quarter of positive comps. Home is another area that's benefiting from our expanded offering this year with improved quality in virtually all categories. Our customers are asking for more layaway items, so we added a number of small appliances, including many customizable solutions like the Keurig and SodaStream brands.", "At Walmart.com, improved checkout capabilities and increased assortment continued to drive sales and strengthen the customer experience. Polaris, our search engine developed in-house by our technology teams, is improving conversions by 10% to 15%. In October, we announced our same-day delivery pilot in 4 cities with customers receiving their orders within hours of placing an order.", "Our broader dotcom business is also growing as price investment and other initiatives drove additional sales across several categories, including grocery, Hardlines, electronics and apparel.", "In mid-October, our financial services team launched an innovative checking and debit alternative called Bluebird. Designed from the ground up with our partner, American Express, Bluebird offers our customers premium features and benefits without additional fees. Bluebird is a simple and transparent way to manage your money and another example of how we're providing uniquely Walmart solutions to help our customers live better. We're encouraged by the positive reception and early adoption of Bluebird among our customers and are tracking above our plan in terms of new accounts and customer activity. We look forward to continuing our momentum together with American Express.", "As you know, we're proud of our productivity initiatives and our ability to continually improve our business through efficiency and innovation.

Our store innovations team also continues to develop and implement initiatives that will help ensure we reach our expense savings goals this year and into the future.", "We continue to have a robust pipeline of real estate as we execute our growth strategy across both large and small formats over the next few years. During the third quarter, we opened 59 Supercenters, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. Supercenters remain a strategic growth vehicle as we continue to develop our core markets.", "We also continue to accelerate growth in our small formats, which now represent approximately 250 units. In the third quarter, we opened another 33 Neighborhood Markets across the country. This is in addition to the 23 we opened in the first half of the year. The format's flexibility allows us to grow coast-to-coast with an eye towards localizing it for the particular community. This quarter, we opened 15 stores in California, as well as new units in Atlanta, Milwaukee, Denver, Colorado Springs, Seattle, Portland and Miami, just to name a few.", "For Neighborhood Markets, customer traffic in comp stores continued to drive growth, led by sales in Rx, over the counter, adult beverages, meat and consumable areas such as pets. We continue to see the Neighborhood Market format competing very effectively against multiple channels with a year-to-date sales comp in the mid-single digits.", "Our Express pilot also continues to perform well. We'll continue our density test into next year and we'll be actively applying these learnings as we continue to roll out small formats.", "We're on track to deliver approximately 125 Supercenters and approximately 80 small stores this fiscal year. During the fourth quarter, we plan to open 40 to 50 total new units, including 20 to 25 small stores.", "Walmart will be the #1 holiday destination this year. We started planning the day after Christmas last year to win this holiday season. In food, our Bake Centers and meal trains provide the capacity and convenience our customers need to stock up for entertaining all in one easy trip.", "Across our general merchandise departments, we're well stocked on the items that matter most, and programs like our Ad Match Guarantee ensure that customers will get the lowest prices at Walmart.", "We have a comprehensive marketing plan that's designed to ensure we have the #1 share of voice this season. We're increasing our presence across traditional media channels with big increases in TV and radio. We have some great holiday commercials lined up that will be fun, but more importantly, reinforce our price leadership. Additionally, we'll generate over 2 billion impressions across social media this holiday, more than 3x last year's total.", "Throughout the year, we worked closely with our suppliers to set our stores 3 weeks earlier than last year and engaged our customers and associates like never before. The layaway program is a great example. Our customers gave us great feedback, and we improved the program by eliminating the layaway fee, extending the time frame for payments and expanding the categories.", "We're so excited about our annual Black Friday event and how it will drive sales throughout the entire holiday season. Our customers asked for an earlier start time. So this year, the event begins at 8 p.m. on Thursday. The first event will have unbeatable deals for the entire family in key areas like toys, gaming, home and apparel. At 10 p.m., we'll highlight special deals in electronics that will excite our customers. And let me point out that we're far deeper on the quantities of those items than we've ever been before. We'll continue through Friday and into the weekend with more great prices on key gift items across the entire store.", "We know that one of the most important things for our customers is getting the items they want under their Christmas tree. That's why in addition to amazing prices backed by our Ad Match Guarantee, we're also offering an exclusive 1-hour guarantee for our Black Friday customers this year. This groundbreaking program ensures that our event shoppers who are in line between 10 and 11 p.m. that night will be able to buy one of this year's hottest gifts, including a 32-inch TV, a Blu-ray player and an iPad, all at our special low prices. This is just one more way we're delivering a great holiday season for our customers.", "We're excited about the fourth quarter and pleased with the performance of the business so far this year.

As a reminder, we'll continue to lap positive comps with last year's fourth quarter comp being 1.5%.", "Our business is strong, and we'll continue to deliver consistent core growth. We look forward to seeing you in our stores this holiday season.", "Doug is up next with an international update. Doug?", "C. Douglas McMillon", "Thank you, Bill. Walmart International had solid results for the third quarter. In some markets, we faced a more challenging economic environment than in the first half of the year. But with the exception of China, we grew share everywhere we operate. I'm proud of the good work our associates are doing to drive those results. They're managing costs and doing what is necessary to deliver value to our customers, and it's as clear as ever that they need it.", "For the International segment, net sales were $33.2 billion, up 2.4% over last year's third quarter. We're now reporting the results of Massmart and our purchase of the Netto stores in the U.K. in our comparative results. Currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales by approximately $1.7 billion. Operating expenses were up 3%, and we would have leveraged operating expenses without the expense for the estimated contingent liabilities relating to employment claims in Brazil that Jeff mentioned earlier.", "Operating income was $1.5 billion, up 4.8% compared to the third quarter of last year and grew faster than sales. Currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased operating income by $29 million.", "Let me go through the numbers on a constant currency basis. First, third quarter net sales would have been up 7.6% to $34.8 billion. Our Latin American markets made the strongest contribution to our net sales growth with all countries in the region delivering positive comp sales. Overall, third quarter comp store sales increased in 4 of our 6 largest markets. In general, we're delivering healthy average ticket increases, but comparable store traffic remains a concern and it declined in the third quarter in our major markets. We're focused on improving our customer communications in all of our markets, but we're especially focused on the markets where consumer spending is under the most pressure such as in Japan and the U.K.", "Second, operating expenses were up 8.3%, and without the employment claim contingency, we leveraged operating expenses.", "And third, on a constant currency basis, operating income was $1.5 billion, up 6.8%. Without the Brazilian employment claim contingency, we would have grown operating income 12.5% and faster than the 7.6% sales increase. So our underlying results were solid.", "Inventory was up 13.5% against our sales growth of 2.4%. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew 10.7% on sales growth of 7.6%. Inventory days on hand were well managed in Canada, China, Japan, Central America and Argentina. We weren't pleased with our inventory in relation to sales in our other major markets.", "Now let's get into the results for several of our largest markets. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis, and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a calendar basis.", "Let's begin with EMEA, our region that includes the U.K., Canada and Sub-Saharan Africa. The U.K. had a solid third quarter in a very challenging market. As others have reported, U.K. consumers remain hard-pressed economically. Petrol prices remain a factor with average fuel prices in the U.K. at GBP 1.38 per liter.", "In the third quarter, ASDA's sales rose 2.5%, ahead of the market. Comparable sales were down 0.4%, excluding fuel. Average ticket in the quarter increased by 0.9% while traffic decreased by 1.3%. Operating income grew slightly slower than sales.", "We increased our market share in the U.K. 10 basis points to 17.5% for the 12 weeks ended September 30 according to the Kantar Worldwide Panel Total Till Roll.", "During the quarter, we maintained our commitment to EDLP, investing in price reductions of key food commodities to provide our customers with much-needed relief from their financial pressures. At the same time, we've continued to drive strong multi-channel growth with a focus on improving the online shopping experience. Customers now have access to the full George and general merchandise offerings at the click of a button with next-day delivery available.", "We've also commenced the rollout of Wi-Fi in all stores, allowing customers free access. Online sales increased 16.2% in the quarter versus last year.", "We continue to leverage the We Operate for Less program, achieving savings within both SG&A and cost of goods sold. This helped deliver an increase in gross profit rate in the quarter from last year. However, operating expenses grew ahead of sales due to pressures in areas such as property taxation.", "Having been The Grocer 33 lowest priced supermarket for 15 of the last 20 weeks and with its best ever range of Chosen By You and Extra Special private brand products, we move into the holiday quarter with confidence.", "Moving to Canada. Walmart Canada had good sales growth and grew operating income faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.9% in the third quarter compared to last year. Comparable sales increased 0.7% with average ticket up 1.7% and traffic declining 1%. We had strong comp sales in food and consumables and Health & Wellness, but weakness in Hardlines and entertainment. Gross profit rate increased due to improved initial margins and lower markdown activity. However, expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to preopening costs associated with aggressive real estate expansion plans. We've completed 49 projects to date with 24 projects to be completed by year end. We now have 30 of our 39 Zellers to Wal-Mart Store conversions opened and the early results are encouraging. We're pleased with the way the Canadian leadership team managed this conversion process and it appears our new customers are, too.", "Canada is heading into the golden quarter with plans to make this a memorable season for Canadians. Canada will kick-start the season with Black Friday and Cyber Monday promos as we did last year. Our Top 20 Toy digest will give customers a best-in-class offering for the holiday season gift buy and Our Finest private brand selection, a new Walmart Canada brand that was recently named by Progressive Grocer magazine as Best New Product for a Mass Merchandiser, will be a favorite for festive celebrations.", "Turning to Africa. Massmart continues to deliver strong performance in Sub-Saharan Africa. Let me remind you that while Walmart is a majority shareholder, Massmart remains publicly traded and conforms to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange guidelines of reporting results on a 6-month basis.", "This quarter, we reached the anniversary of our acquisition of Massmart and now report comparable results for the quarter. For the 14 weeks ended September 30, net store sales increased by 16.6%, and comparable store sales increased by 7.8%. We continue to be excited about the opportunities with Massmart and Sub-Saharan Africa. We are leveraging best practices and scale advantages in everything from EDLP to supply chain and sourcing strategies.", "Moving on to Latin America. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reports its earnings under IFRS, so some numbers are different from Walmex reported numbers.", "Walmex delivered solid results with consolidated net sales for the third quarter up 10.7% and consolidated operating income growing 14.6% from last year. Mexico's net sales were up 11%, and comparable store sales were up 5%. Average ticket in Mexico increased 5.8% and traffic decreased 0.8% over last year. Comparable sales in Mexico for self-service formats grew 4.8%. ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, grew slower at 4.4%. As a reminder, ANTAD is the national association of supermarkets and department stores and provides industry data and market share analysis.", "In Central America, overall sales increased 9.4%, and comp sales were up 3.2%.", "Third quarter consolidated gross profit rate for Walmex increased by 49 basis points, primarily due to seasonal merchandise flow. Walmex leveraged consolidated operating expenses on store productivity initiatives, and operating income grew faster than sales.", "We are ready for the upcoming start of the Christmas season. This is the second year in which Mexico has its version of Black Friday, called El Buen Fin, and it starts tomorrow and runs through November 19. We're offering an attractive and differentiated value proposition for our customers across our different formats. Our stores and our people are ready to win during this season.", "Moving on to Brazil. Third quarter sales grew 11% from last year. Comparable sales increased 6.6% with average ticket up 9.8% and traffic down 3.2%. The average ticket increase continues to be an encouraging sign that customers see the value of our price positioning, and we'll continue to demonstrate price leadership on a broad basket of goods.", "Our customers are benefiting from the simplification and efficiencies that EDLP brings to our retail formats. We're focused on traffic for our retail stores and expected to see more improvement in this area by this time. We believe the full conversion to EDLP will be completed by the end of next year as we continue to roll it out in our wholesale formats.", "Brazil did not leverage operating expenses in the third quarter, primarily due to the employment claim contingencies discussed earlier. The ongoing focus that the management team has on reducing expenses is helping to improve Brazil's operating income. Brazil achieved cost reductions in areas including advertising, workforce management and freight optimization. And without the employment claim contingencies, Walmart Brazil would have been profitable for the quarter.", "Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile remains a publicly held company and will release third quarter earnings by November 30. For their previously announced results for the 6 months ending June 30, 2012, Chile had strong performance.", "Net sales for the 6 months grew 12.9% along with a comp store sales increase of 9.5%. Operating income was down as prior year results were impacted by the gain on the sale of an investment. We also continue to have success with our private brands in Chile, and our leadership team has excelled in incorporating a number of our global private brands into their merchandise mix. Great Value, which was launched 2 years ago in our Chilean stores, now is a well recognized value brand in the country.", "Moving to Asia. We're working on a number of areas in China to strengthen the foundation, centralizing our merchandising organization, developing talent and strengthening our compliance organization. We are focused on clearly establishing price leadership by driving simplicity, improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. A more disciplined approach to our real estate development and new store growth that we discussed last quarter is moving into place and will put us on a stronger path to have more ideal locations to drive sales, traffic and growth. EDLP is a long-term strategy that we know will work in China.", "Walmart China grew sales during the third quarter, but we had a slight decrease in operating income versus the prior year. Net sales for the third quarter grew 6.1% over last year, and the comp sales growth was 0.4%. Average ticket grew 8% in China, but traffic declined 7.6%. The traffic declines in China are not new, and we believe customer shopping frequency has shifted in the market. That said, we have room to improve our performance as our assortment and value offering strengthen.", "Gross profit rate was down in the quarter, and operating expenses grew slower than sales. In September, Walmart China was named as one of the Top 100 Most Trustful Brands and won the 2012 Seven-Star Award for outstanding contribution in food safety and public health by global food safety management experts of Ecolab and China Business News.", "As Mike mentioned, we successfully closed the transaction to own 51% of Yihaodian last month, which is excellent news for our eCommerce business initiatives in China. This transaction will help us to expand our presence in China. Yihaodian is accelerating growth in grocery and general merchandise sales and we're excited about how we can help them grow.", "Turning to Japan. After a strong first half, our business is experiencing additional challenges from the broader macroeconomic environment in the country. Simply, consumer sentiment is weakening. We continue to outperform the market in comp store sales through the strength of EDLP and the price gap that we've created over the last couple of years.", "Walmart Japan's net sales and comp sales were down 1.8% and 1.9%, respectively. Third quarter average ticket was down 0.2%, and traffic was down 1.7%. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the third quarter declined by 2.5%, indicating that Walmart continues to outperform the market. Japan had a slight operating loss for the third quarter and, given the tough sales environment, we did not leverage expenses in this market.", "Our corporate culture is built on a foundation of acting with integrity and the highest ethical standards. Recently, we made improvements to our compliance programs around the world and have taken a number of actions with respect to our processes, procedures and people. We aligned our corporate structure to have global compliance, ethics, investigations and legal functions under one organization. We also named a Global Chief Compliance Officer and a Chief Compliance Officer for Walmart International. We take compliance with all laws very seriously and we are working hard and dedicating resources to enhance our programs.", "The actions I've described are just a few of the things we're doing to make our programs even stronger and more effective where we operate.", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. Most of our markets also celebrate Christmas and we're ready to serve customers during this important holiday. As I mentioned, some countries have adopted various versions of Black Friday events to further drive sales and we believe these will strengthen our brands where they're executed.", "We'll experience some fourth quarter headwind in China due to a later Chinese New Year. So we're working to make the most of other holidays, including Three Kings, to drive sales as we finish the year. Our plans are in place, and we're excited that the holiday season is finally here.", "Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?", "Rosalind Gates Brewer", "Thanks, Doug. Sam's Club third quarter net sales and operating income continued to grow. Strategic price investments, the membership pilot in Texas and holiday preparation led the focus for the quarter. Seven new clubs opened, the most since the fourth quarter in fiscal year 2006.", "Comp sales without fuel were up 2.7% for the 13-week period. This was achieved on top of a very healthy 5.7% comp sales increase last year. Comp traffic was up 1.5%, and ticket was up 1.2%.", "Although we are pleased with the positive results, we are disappointed that comp sales were below our guidance. This miss was driven by several factors. The combination of inflation and deflation across multiple categories affected comp sales. Inflation in some categories led members to trade down. Deflation in other categories came faster and deeper late in the quarter with October being the lowest inflation we have seen in some time. Finally, our business members continue to experience economic pressure and uncertainty, which led to slower growth in business member traffic. We anticipate this softening could remain a headwind in the fourth quarter.", "This quarter, we accelerated price investments in traffic-driving categories, which led to strong unit growth. Because of timing of these price investments, we expect them to have a greater impact on our fourth quarter margin rate than they did in the third quarter.", "In October, we announced the introduction of our new membership benefit and fee pilot program to all Texas clubs, which account for approximately 12% of our club base. The pilot includes a fee increase, our first since 2006 and simplifies our cardholder and fee structure. It also provides instant savings and cash rewards for qualifying purchases.", "We are encouraged by the member response thus far in Texas.", "I also mentioned we opened 7 new clubs in the third quarter, totaling 9 new clubs this fiscal year. This is the most openings we've had in a single year since fiscal 2009. We opened our first new club in the greater Chicagoland area in 12 years in Elgin, Illinois. Together, all 7 clubs provide almost 1 million additional square feet for Sam's Club.", "So let's cover our reported results, which include fuel sales. Net sales were $13.9 billion, a 4.7% increase over last year's third quarter. Fuel prices were up 6% compared to last year and gallons sold were up 7.2%, thus creating a boost to overall sales of 1.1%. Gross profit rate was down 5 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 31 basis points. Operating income increased 12.7% to $435 million.", "Now the remainder of our discussion today is focused on our core business, which excludes fuel for comparative purposes, unless otherwise noted. Net sales were $12.2 billion, up 3.6% from last year. Our strongest divisional performance was in the West with our strongest regional performance in the Great Plains, Mid-South and Mid-Atlantic.", "Now I'd like to turn your attention to merchandising. There were 3 major themes during the third quarter: price investment, moderation of inflation and new product introduction. In line with our company's core mission, Sam's Club is stepping up investments to drive lower prices and values on key traffic-driving items. One example was rotisserie chicken, which has long been one of the most popular items of our home meal solutions. When there's a rotisserie chicken in the basket, ticket is larger, and we're seeing significant increases in units sold since we lowered the price.", "Additionally, we have reduced prices in several varieties of apples, multiple products in beauty and in baby. To help address the specific needs of our business member, we have lowered prices on products critical to them such as condiments, cooking oils and paper products.", "Inflation is quickly moderating across the club, and the effect was most pronounced later in the quarter. In last year's third quarter, we estimated retail inflation across the club was approximately 325 to 375 basis points while this year it was only 70 to 100 basis points. This was down significantly also from our second quarter estimates of 175 to 225 basis points.", "However, we have seen sharper inflation continue in some categories, most notably in meat. Because price increases for beef are inflating mid-single digits, members are switching to different proteins, particularly pork, which is deflationary. Protein-related trade down has impacted comp sales. Key categories like milk, cheese and eggs are also experiencing deflation, which is a headwind for our top line results. Although units are increasing, the deflation has proven to be challenging to overcome in these categories. Sugar and coffee prices are moderating as well.", "Freezer/cooler comp sales increased in the low single digits. Recent introductions in frozen confections and snacks generate excitement with our members. Fresh sales continue to grow low-single digit comps, with produce leading the way. Grocery and beverage comp sales were up low single digits. With the expiration of the K-Cup patent, Sam's private label version, Daily Chef single-serve cups, has been popular with our members.", "In consumables, the baby category is up double-digit comps with improvements in distribution. We are improving the assortment and investing in price for diapers, infant formula and baby wipes. Leveraging our marketing programs and communicating our strong assortment at a great value have been keys to success.", "Comp sales in technology and entertainment, which continue to experience deflation, were slightly positive this quarter. Wireless, up double-digit comps, performed well and benefited from both the Samsung Galaxy III and the Apple iPhone 5. Television and home theater comps are up low single digits, driven by unit movement and improved availability in large-screen televisions. Average selling prices continue to decrease for TVs, and our inventory position for the holidays is very good. Video games, music and movies continue to experience pressure in the current environment.", "Early availability of toys in our clubs has driven double-digit comp sales. Apparel was up low-single digit comps, and home achieved high-single digit comps. The continued introduction of new national brands and better assortment have driven sales growth.", "Recent innovations in mattresses are helping sales as well, and we continue to be a destination for this category.", "Health and Wellness remains a growth category, with comps up mid-single digits. Sales of over-the-counter products are benefiting from the introduction of new diet trend products.", "E-commerce continues to help members access Sam's Club anywhere, anytime. During the third quarter, traffic was up, and more members are utilizing our e-commerce solutions. Online sales of electronics and baby care are growing.", "Membership and other income was up 2.3% for the quarter. Sam's continues to recognize a profit-sharing arrangement with our credit card provider quarterly. Last year, we recognized this benefit in full at year end. Membership income is up 0.8%, and our renewal rate remains steady.", "Gross profit rate increased by 11 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. The rate improvement is due to shifts in merchandise mix. Pharmacy brand-to-generic conversions and shifts away from lower margin categories such as tobacco benefited margin rate. Nonmerchandise-related activities such as supplier funds received for the health and wellness magazine also drove the rate increase.", "As I mentioned earlier, we expect that as we step up price investments, there will be a greater impact on our margin rate in the fourth quarter. Our operations team continues to balance expense leverage with improving member service. Driven by in-club efficiencies gained through innovation, we reduced third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 24 basis points and have seen units per labor hour increase 3.6%.", "We completed fewer remodels this quarter, which led to expense reduction. Additionally, we received a credit related to overpayment of state excise taxes in prior years.", "Looking at the bottom line, our third quarter operating income increased to $427 million, a 14.2% increase over third quarter last year. We are pleased with this increase but recognize it is driven by both successful initiatives such as better expense leverage, as well as nonoperating benefits that I previously mentioned.", "Our members continue to raise their rating of us in the member experience survey, and we continue to benefit from the strong program put in place last year. Members love our self-checkout now in over half of our clubs. In these clubs, approximately 40% of our members have used these quicker lanes. Our new club in Kansas City represents a step change in the way we hope to operate our clubs in the future. This is our first club that will have all registers set to be fully convertible, meaning they can either operate in self-checkout mode or in cashier mode. This is the first test of this concept and will help us understand the member reaction, as well as our ability to manage shrink control and member service.", "Inventory increased 10.8% over last year. While we intentionally built inventory for the holiday season, we find this current level of inventory unacceptable to our business model. Because significant portions of this inventory are highly consumable, we feel certain that any exposure is at a minimum.", "Similar to Walmart and other retailers, we were impacted by superstorm Sandy. We were able to reopen 37 of our 41 impacted clubs within 24 hours and the remaining within 3 days. I'm proud of our associates and the work they are doing to help our members recover from the destruction left in the wake of the storm.", "Looking toward the future, we are excited about the long-term position for the clubs as we add new square footage, invest in price and learn from our membership pilot in Texas. The clubs are well positioned for the fourth quarter, and we announced our Black Friday details last week. Our holiday selling season starts the 2 weeks prior to Thanksgiving with our Holiday Taste of Sam's and an invitation-only event for select members.", "However, operating income growth will be challenged in the fourth quarter. Many of the initiatives that will benefit Sam's long term like price investment and the membership pilot will impact operating income in the short term. Additionally, the timing change in recognition of our credit card provider profit-sharing arrangement versus last year along with recent trends of moderating inflation and business member traffic are additional headwinds.", "We expect to deliver a club comp sales increase, without fuel, of 1.5% to 3.5% for the 13-week period ending January 25, 2013. Last year, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 5.4% for the comparable 13-week period.", "Now I'll turn the program over to Charles for a wrap-up and guidance. Charles?", "Charles M. Holley", "Thanks, Roz. We had a very good third quarter, once again highlighting both the value we offer our customers and the discipline we continue to drive in how we operate. Granted, the economies where we currently operate are still challenging, but our ability to drive productivity and Every Day Low Costs allow us to generate good returns in our businesses.", "Gross leverage and returns remain our consistent financial priorities. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide flexibility to invest in both growth opportunities and new initiatives like eCommerce. We remain steadfast in our drive to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of sales by at least 100 basis points over the next 5 years. We'll do this by reducing costs and improving productivity to invest in lower prices in Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club and to achieve greater profitability in Walmart International. And last, of course, we strive to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.", "Let's start with the details on growth. In the third quarter, we added approximately $3.7 billion in net sales. This growth includes a negative impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $1.7 billion. On a constant currency basis, our net sales growth would have approached $5.5 billion. Part of that growth came from the nearly 13 million retail square feet that we added for the quarter. Your takeaway should be that despite softness in the global economy, Walmart is still delivering very meaningful growth from a combination of stores and eCommerce.", "Year-to-date, net sales of $339 billion were 5.4% above last year. We remain on track to deliver consolidated net sales growth of around 5% for the full year. Remember, this includes a negative impact of approximately $5.2 billion from currency exchange rate fluctuations. We will grow through a variety of formats in all of our markets. And as you heard me say at our October Analyst Meeting, our capital forecast is between $12.6 billion and $13.5 billion for the current fiscal year.", "Now let's turn to leverage. We have now levered our expenses for over 2 consecutive years and we aren't done. We fully expect to lever expenses in the fourth quarter despite headwinds from growth and Global eCommerce initiatives, expenses related to FCPA matters and increased spending associated with our leverage activities.", "In fact, let me highlight some of the examples that Rollin Ford and his team are having success with. We are driving significant savings in goods not for resale by leveraging our global buys across the markets. We are increasing the volume of direct imports across markets, lowering our cost of goods sold and enhancing the quality of many products on our shelves. And we are standardizing a global replenishment system and improving inventory flow across our international markets.", "Let's move on to returns. Operating income grew 4% in the third quarter, which outpaced sales growth. This led to operating cash flow of nearly $16 billion. And earnings per share increased 11.3% over last year. The combination of our strong operating cash flow and our disciplined capital allocation resulted in about $7 billion of free cash flow at the end of the quarter, a $3.6 billion improvement versus the same period last year. The strength of our free cash flow allows us to continue to provide good returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2012, was 18% compared to 18.2% from last year and continues to be one of the highest in retail. As Jeff mentioned earlier, on a constant currency basis, the improvement in ROI driven by capital discipline was offset by currency rate fluctuations.", "Now let's talk about guidance. As I mentioned, we expect to finish the year with net sales growth of around 5%, which is about $20 billion on our sales base. Bill and Roz outlined their 13-week comp sales estimates for the fourth quarter, 1% to 3% for Walmart U.S. and 1.5% to 3.5% for Sam's Club.", "While we are optimistic about sales, we are also realistic. Current macroeconomic conditions continue to pressure our customers. The holiday season is predicted to be very competitive, but we are very well prepared to deliver on the value and low prices our customers expect. In fact, both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club are ready with excellent plans. And in our key international markets, holiday planning is expected to drive sales growth as well.", "When providing quarterly guidance, we normally consider a number of factors, including the macroeconomic environment and the competitive landscape. We expect currency exchange rates to remain at the current levels and our full year effective tax rate to be at the low end of our range between 32.5% and 33.5%. Our investments in Global eCommerce and global leverage services along with the FCPA-related expenses will continue to be headwinds.", "Based on these considerations, we expect fourth quarter fiscal year 2013 earnings per share to range between $1.53 and $1.58, which compares to $1.51 reported last year. However, let me remind you that last year, fourth quarter earnings per share benefited by $0.07 from certain items. Net of these items, the underlying comparison should be made to $1.44.", "For the full year, we are tightening our earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $4.88 to $4.93. This compares to our previous guidance of $4.83 to $4.93 and last year's earnings per share of $4.54.", "Our company delivers consistent strong financial results. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to invest in innovation and growth initiatives that will lay groundwork for an even brighter future.", "Thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company.

Thanks for joining us today for our our earnings call to review the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Our press release and full transcript of this call are is available on our website, www.stock.walmart.com.", "Mike Duke, president and CEO of Walmart Stores, Inc., will provide his thoughts about the quarter and some of his thoughts about his recent interactions with our customers.  Jeff Davis, EVP of finance and treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details.  Then we\u2019ll go to the operating segments: Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S. first; then Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart International; and then Roz Brewer, president and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, will round out that section.", "Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s CFO, will discuss our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns, and he\u2019ll also provide Q2 guidance. A quick reminder about our guidance conventions: We update our full year EPS guidance only when we release Q2 earnings, so you\u2019ll hear that information in August, not today. Today, we will provide you Q2 guidance for both EPS and our U.S. segment comps.", "Let me also remind you about our comp sales calendar. Our comp week begins on Saturday and ends on Friday. During fiscal 2014, we will report comp store sales on a 53-week basis, with 4-5-5 reporting in Q4. Because we didn\u2019t observe the 53-week retail calendar last year, our comp calendar for Q1 began on Saturday, January 26 and ended on Friday, April 26, 2013.", "Last year also included an extra day for leap year, so this year\u2019s fiscal calendar for Q1 includes one less day.", "Additional information regarding some of the terms we use at Walmart, including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, are available on our website. Please note that this year, we no longer have discontinued operations. But we do have one new term we\u2019d like you to make note of.  \u201cCorporate and support\u201d is now what we call our corporate areas, including core corporate, such as finance and legal, as well as global ecommerce and global leverage services. Previously, we referred to this as \u201cother unallocated.\u201d", "Our annual meeting of shareholders will be held at 7 a.m. central time on Friday, June 7 at the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville. The meeting also is available via webcast through our website - again, that\u2019s stock.walmart.com - or via Walmart\u2019s free IR app.", "So now, let\u2019s get to the results, Mike.", "Mike Duke", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone.  Walmart grew first quarter diluted earnings per share 4.6% to $1.14. In a quarter marked by considerable headwinds to top line sales, we delivered solid EPS growth.", "Frankly, we had a more difficult quarter than expected when we announced our guidance in February. It\u2019s important to note that Walmart U.S. continued to gain market share across several key categories. Sales were pressured primarily by delayed tax refunds, which caused customers to put off discretionary purchases. And though no one likes to talk about weather, it was a real factor across the United States. In fact, right here in Northwest Arkansas, we had the latest snowfall in the history of Arkansas reporting.", "I\u2019m pleased that Bill and his team managed through these headwinds to deliver almost $67 billion in sales and leverage. This disciplined expense management allowed Walmart U.S. to deliver solid operating profit, despite the pressure on sales. I share Bill\u2019s optimism about the remainder of the year and believe the underlying strength of the Walmart U.S. business will deliver positive comps next quarter.", "Now let me share some additional key metrics for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales increased 1.8% to $114.2 billion, which excluded $1 billion from currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat, and we are committed to achieving leverage for the full year. We are proud that our U.S. operating segments leveraged operating expenses. We generated $6.5 billion of consolidated operating income, an increase of 1.1%.", "As you know, I like to visit customers in their local markets around the world. I recently traveled to stores throughout South America and the U.S. It\u2019s gratifying to see how important EDLP is for our customers. Our mission is simple and focused: to help people save money so they can live better. ", "When we simplify and focus our execution against this mission, it\u2019s easy for our associates to prioritize what they have to do. Listening to our customers ensures we deliver the merchandise they want and the experience they expect. We also evaluate how our daily decisions support our EDLC and EDLP priorities. This is our opportunity to get even better at being Walmart.", "Our customers also remind me how they are integrating technology into their shopping occasions. Our goal is to make their shopping experience seamless, and we have fantastic talent delivering a number of innovative solutions to enhance their experience. ", "When I recently visited our ecommerce teams in San Bruno, California and in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I witnessed the tremendous quality of talent in our ecommerce organization. I have no doubt that we are making the right investments in this space to differentiate ourselves and become a better Walmart. And with ecommerce sales growing more than 30% in the first quarter versus last year, these investments are paying off.", "Turning now to Sam\u2019s Club, Sam\u2019s delivered a positive comp for the first quarter. You\u2019ll hear more from Roz about our nationwide membership fee increase rollout that was announced yesterday and how Sam\u2019s is also driving member value through improved merchandise assortment and in-club marketing.", "Walmart International\u2019s constant currency sales expanded 5.4%, while on a reported basis, net sales were up 2.9%. We grew market share in a number of our markets despite headwinds from difficult economic conditions across several markets and weather. Online sales in the U.K. and Brazil were strong. Our focus remains on bringing Walmart\u2019s low prices to customers in all of our markets, and the transition to EDLP continues in key markets like Brazil and China.", "We are, however, disappointed in our expense control in international. As you know, we have put a lot of emphasis on the importance of leveraging expenses as a company, and Doug and his team are taking actions in each country to improve our cost management and expand on a number of productivity initiatives. I\u2019m pleased that, overall, Walmart International made progress on managing inventory this quarter.", "Across our segments, improving new store productivity is a priority. We have a more diligent process for reviewing grand opening performance, and we\u2019re taking immediate actions to strengthen sales where they\u2019re needed. And, as we discussed last year, we slowed the pace of store openings within selected International markets.", "Our corporate and support costs increased this quarter due to investments in leverage initiatives and global ecommerce support, as well as higher compliance-related expenses. Jeff and Charles will provide more details on the financials behind these investments. ", "In the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our compliance programs around the world. We\u2019re working closely with third party anti-corruption compliance experts to review and to assess the programs in our international markets and to partner with us on anticorruption support and training. Beyond anticorruption, our comprehensive global compliance review continues in all of our markets to evaluate and reinforce our procedures and our programs applicable to 14 compliance areas, including licenses and permits, food safety, and ethical sourcing, among others.", "Walmart continues to make strides on the issues that matter to our customers. I was honored to stand with First Lady Michelle Obama recently to pledge Walmart\u2019s support of the \u201cJoining Forces\u201d initiative to benefit our U.S. military veterans and their families. On Memorial Day, we will begin a program to hire recent, honorably-discharged U.S. veterans. We\u2019re proud of this initiative and appreciate the partnership of other large companies that are joining us in providing employment opportunities to these worthy Americans.", "As I close my remarks, I\u2019d like to reiterate that I\u2019m confident about our long-term strategy and the direction that Walmart is headed. We didn\u2019t have the first quarter performance we wanted as a company, due partly to various external factors and also the comparison to last year\u2019s great first quarter. You\u2019ll hear the specifics about why we feel better about our U.S. businesses\u2019 performance for the second quarter. ", "This, coupled with more discipline in international and our investments in strategic initiatives, will allow us to improve our performance throughout the year. Our commitment to Walmart\u2019s mission to save people money so that they can live better benefits our customers and our shareholders alike.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff for more financial details.  Jeff?  ", "Jeff Davis", "Thank you, Mike.  As you just heard, Walmart reported first quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.14 versus $1.09 last year.  Recall last year end, we stated the company\u2019s continued investment in ecommerce initiatives would negatively impact our fiscal 2014 diluted EPS by an incremental $0.09. Consequently, our first quarter results were unfavorably impacted by these initiatives by approximately $0.02.", "Consolidated net sales increased 1% to $113.4 billion. I would like to remind you that the first quarter of last year included an extra day due to leap year and added approximately 100 basis points to net sales. Separately, first quarter net sales included $200 million from an acquisition and were also impacted by $1 billion of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales would have increased 1.8% to $114.2 billion.", "With respect to comp sales for the quarter, total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 1.2%. Bill and Roz will provide more details in a minute.  Membership and other income increased 1.6% compared to the first quarter last year. Please stay tuned to hear more from Roz regarding our recent advancements in club membership.", "Total revenue for the first quarter was $114.2 billion, a 1% increase over last year. This was on top of a strong 8.5% increase at this time last year.  Gross profit increased 1.2%, primarily driven by supply chain productivity and merchandise mix within our U.S. business segments. The gross profit rate was relatively flat to last year.", "Now, turning to expenses, our operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.1%, which is relatively flat to last year. As you heard from Mike, our U.S. businesses leveraged operating expenses for the quarter. And you\u2019ll hear more from Doug on the international team\u2019s focus to reduce expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "Now let\u2019s take a closer look at corporate and support expenses. Corporate and support is comprised of core corporate, global ecommerce support, and global leverage services.", "Total corporate and support expenses increased approximately $200 million or 44.4%. Our core corporate expenses increased 37.2%, including $73 million in expenses related to FCPA matters, which was above our forecasted range of $40 to $45 million. ", "Approximately $44 million of the expenses represent costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, while $29 million covers costs regarding the global compliance review, program enhancements, and organizational changes. Excluding the FCPA matters, core corporate increased by approximately 14.6%.", "The remainder of the corporate and support growth is primarily associated with global leverage services. This increase is the result of investments to enhance enterprise information management, build global capabilities, and leverage scale. Though we will continue to invest in these areas, we expect these expenses to moderate for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "This leads us to consolidated operating income, which grew 1.1% to $6.5 billion, slightly ahead of sales growth.  Net interest expense for the quarter decreased 0.9% to $530 million, as we continue to avail ourselves of low interest rate funding. And, consolidated net income attributable to Walmart increased 1.1% to $3.8 billion.", "Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was 33.4%, essentially unchanged from the first quarter of last year. Full year guidance for fiscal 2014 effective tax rate continues to be between 32% and 33%. As a reminder, our tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.", "Now turning to our balance sheet, consolidated inventory increased 4.5%, primarily driven by our U.S. operations. You\u2019ll hear more from the segment CEOs regarding the individual drivers of inventory growth.", "Payables as a percentage of inventory was 85.2%, which compares to 89.8% last year. This decrease was primarily the result of increased levels of inventory within our U.S. segments and the timing of disbursements.", "Our debt to total capitalization was 44.8% at the end of the quarter, compared to 44.2% last year. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow versus $3.1 billion last year. An increase in income tax payments due primarily to changes in federal bonus depreciation rules and an increase in capital expenditures contributed to the free cash flow decline.", "Moving on to returns, for the quarter, the company returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased approximately 30 million shares at a cost of $2.2 billion. As of April 30, we have approximately $1.5 billion remaining under our current $15 billion authorization.", "To wrap up, return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2013 was 17.8%, compared to 18.1% last year. This reduction was primarily the result of acquisitions and an increase in fixed assets within our base business.", "Now let\u2019s turn it over to our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Walmart U.S.  Bill?", "Bill Simon", "Thank you, Jeff. When we last spoke to you in February, we shared that the first quarter had gotten off to a very slow start, essentially due to the delay in tax refund checks. When we provided flat comp guidance for the first quarter, we had expected, among other things, to recover a reasonable portion of these tax refunds and had also assumed that customers would follow historical spending patterns with these funds. This did not materialize as we had anticipated.", "Similar to what you\u2019ve heard from companies in various industries that have reported earnings, top line revenue was challenged by a number of issues. These included a $9 billion reduction in IRS estimated tax refunds versus last year, and we cashed less in income tax refunds than the prior year. Additionally, the 2% increase in payroll taxes reduced inflation and some of the most unfavorable spring weather we\u2019ve seen in recent years across much of the country impacted our business.", "While we don\u2019t generally like talking about weather, it certainly had an impact. Weather sensitive departments like outdoor living, sporting goods, air movement and apparel were challenged, particularly from mid-March to mid-April, when weather was much less favorable than last year. However, there were bright spots. Where weather was fairly normal, in Florida for example, we had positive comps for the quarter.", "In addition, as we gave guidance last quarter, we expected an increase in the level of grocery inflation, but it did not materialize in a meaningful way. We experienced very modest inflation, much lower than last year, and in fact, we had some deflation in areas like dry grocery.", "We estimate that the factors discussed earlier affected our comp sales by as much as 200 basis points in the first quarter versus our expectations. Primarily driven by these factors, we ended the quarter with a lower comp than expected at a negative 1.4%, compared to a strong positive 2.6% comp last year. Traffic was down 1.8%, while ticket was up 0.4%. However, excluding the first two weeks of the quarter, comp sales were relatively flat and traffic improved.", "Despite sales being lower than expected, I\u2019m really proud of the work done by all of our associates during the quarter. The team did an excellent job managing the business, taking care of our customers and bringing in a solid profit result, with operating income increasing 5.9%.", "We also continued to gain market share across several categories. According to the Nielsen Company, we gained 20 basis points of market share in the measured category of \u201cfood, consumables and health and wellness/OTC\u201d during the 13 weeks ending April 27, 2013.  As of now, we\u2019re encouraged by the start of sales in the second quarter because we\u2019ve seen more normalized weather and we\u2019re getting past the main effects of the reduced tax refunds.", "Now let\u2019s cover the financial details of the first quarter. Net sales were up $220 million, or 0.3%, to $66.6 billion. Last year\u2019s leap day added approximately 100 basis points of net sales to first quarter fiscal \u201813. Gross profit increased 0.7% to $18.2 billion, with gross profit rate increasing 10 basis points from the previous year, partly driven by supply chain productivity and cost of goods savings initiatives. ", "We continued to leverage these initiatives, targeting specific areas of our grocery business, providing savings to our customers in the first quarter. These actions, along with our ability to leverage expenses, enabled us to further strengthen our position as the price leader in the market.", "Our commitment to the productivity loop is a long-term, sustainable strategy. We will continue to be strategic about price investments, monitoring competitor price gaps, market share, and other data to ensure we maintain an appropriate balance between price investments and margin.", "Our strategy is based on an everyday low cost structure. For the quarter, the team did a good job managing expenses, contributing 32 basis points of expense leverage. Although a large part of the leverage was driven by a decline in incentive expense versus historically high levels last year, every part of the organization was focused on operating for less, from our distribution centers and transportation fleet, to each one of our stores. Together, we reduced expenses by 1.3% versus last year, driving a 5.9% increase in operating income.", "For the quarter, inventory was up 4.6%, driven partly by an expanded assortment in some merchandise areas, in addition to challenging weather, which created headwinds for some seasonal categories. We feel good about our current inventory position as the weather improves and customers get ready for summer.", "Before I discuss the performance of our merchandising areas, I\u2019d like to spend some time covering a few things we\u2019re doing from an operational perspective that helped drive our quarterly performance.", "Our logistics team continues to be a key contributor to our results by generating savings that benefit our leverage goals and gross margin. In the first quarter, the team continued to improve processes within our supply chain. This enabled us to transport 3.1% additional cases per mile driven, helping us to reduce the overall cost per case shipped versus last year. Our results in logistics, quarter after quarter, are proof that our strategy is sustainable.", "Within our stores, we continued to fine tune our technology investments, including self-service checkouts and work assignment tools, like MyGuide. These initiatives drove another quarter of solid gains in productivity, as our management teams work toward continuous improvement.", "We continued to expand our self-service checkouts in the first quarter, with about 38% more stores in service versus last year. In general, customer response has been positive, with utilization across the chain up over 300 basis points year over year. ", "In the back rooms, projects like MyGuide and OneTouch also enabled improvements in stocker productivity by helping to facilitate the process of moving merchandise from the truck to the shelf and prioritizing work for our associates. In the first quarter, these initiatives contributed to an increase of over 3% in cases handled per work hour.", "We\u2019re focused on driving productivity by implementing initiatives that make work simpler for our associates and enhance our customer experience. As you might expect from Walmart, there are a number of metrics we monitor to ensure strong operational execution, including customer line lengths, customer experience scores, and merchandise in-stock levels. While we always strive to improve, we\u2019re pleased overall with our current performance against these metrics.", "Now let\u2019s review the performance of the various merchandising areas.  Grocery, which includes food and consumables, generated a low single-digit positive comp on relatively flat inflation, a much lower inflation rate than last year. ", "In food, we\u2019ve made great progress in the quality of our fresh departments, and I\u2019m particularly excited about the momentum in the produce area. We\u2019ve improved our process for handling and culling produce, allowing us to get the freshest assortment in front of our customers. In the first quarter, we started to see the positive results, evidenced by a mid single-digit positive comps in produce and market share gains for the 13 weeks ended on March 30, according to Nielsen.", "In consumables, we also continued to gain market share across most departments. And I\u2019m particularly encouraged to see customers respond to our price investment strategy, evidenced by the Nielsen data that shows noticeably higher market share gains in areas where we invested in price in the first quarter. Overall, our performance in consumables was mostly driven by the \u201ceveryday need\u201d categories.", "Health and wellness generated a low single-digit negative comp. While units were up, we experienced the largest brand-to-generic impact to date, coupled with an overall increase in generic versus brand sales. While our Rx business was pressured by the brand-to-generic impact, we continued to see strength in OTC, with solid comp sales and market share gains, according to Nielsen. Also noteworthy is our performance in the core, non-seasonal categories like vitamins, analgesics, and antacids, which delivered a mid single-digit positive comp for the quarter.", "Hard lines, which includes our seasonal business, posted a low single-digit negative comp. Weather significantly impacted sporting goods categories like fishing and camping in the first quarter, with non-weather impacted categories like stationery and crafts delivering positive comps.", "Stationery and crafts was driven by strong growth in needlecraft, paints, and other indoor categories. Our new assortment is resonating with the customer, evidenced by our gains in market share across several of our stationery categories for the three-month period ending April 6, according to The NPD Group. ", "Comps in our seasonal business were also positive, driven by solid growth in Valentine\u2019s Day and Easter, with strong results in gifts, d\u00e9cor and party ware. We continue to be a destination for the holidays, providing our customers with one-stop-shop solutions to stock up for the big events of the year.", "Entertainment, including toys, had a mid single-digit negative comp. Softer discretionary spending impacted entertainment and created even more significant headwinds for higher ticket electronics like TVs. ", "On the other hand, our wireless business again delivered a double-digit positive comp, with Straight Talk sales hitting a record high in the first quarter. Let me remind you how we are reporting sales of wireless. Reporting convention calls for sales of Straight Talk and third-party gift cards such as iTunes and restaurant cards to be included in sales, net of the product cost. In other words, we only account for a commission on sales. ", "We continued to make great strides for our customers in the wireless space, providing a broad selection of affordable solutions. According to NPD, Walmart became the number one retailer in handset unit share for the three months ending March 31, 2013.", "In toys, similar to the rest of the business, we experienced softness in outdoor categories like spring toys and bicycles, which was partly offset by strength in educational and preschool toys. ", "Apparel reported a low single-digit negative comp for the quarter, mostly driven by soft demand for spring categories. I\u2019m pleased with the work of the team in apparel and particularly encouraged by the performance of our basics offering, which delivered a low single-digit positive comp. Kids and accessories were also positive in the first quarter, benefitting from assortment improvements. We\u2019ve made great progress in this area and will continue to focus on quality throughout the year to drive results.", "In home, pronounced softness in outdoor living impacted the performance, driving the business to a mid single-digit negative comp. Our results were significantly better in areas of the country less impacted by weather. In the Pacific division, for instance, outdoor living delivered a high single-digit positive comp in the first quarter. ", "In indoor living categories, we continued to work on assortment, making national brands like Rachel Ray affordable for our customers and delivering a low single-digit positive comp in cooking and dining. Our customers are shopping our home aisles, evidenced by our gains in market share across the business, according to NPD.", "Other areas of the business where we\u2019re gaining momentum are walmart.com and mobile. We continue to drive integration with our stores to deliver a seamless customer experience. In the first quarter, we continued to test the mobile self-checkout option \u201cScan and Go,\u201d expanding it across more than 200 stores in 14 different regions. ", "We\u2019re encouraged by the early results, with the majority of \u201cScan & Go\u201d customers using the feature multiple times. The team is constantly making improvements, and we\u2019ll soon be testing digital coupons and gift cards with \u201cScan and Go\u201d. We also announced we\u2019ll be testing self-service lockers in select stores this summer. The goal of the program is to reduce the wait time for Site to Store orders, providing customers with an anywhere, anytime pickup solution.", "We\u2019re also very excited about the opportunity to grow the Ship from Store program. You\u2019ve heard us talk about the power of our physical footprint and how we plan to utilize our presence across the country as an additional asset in our fulfillment network. We\u2019re pleased with the initial results and are currently shipping certain orders from 35 stores straight to customers\u2019 homes. We expanded the pilot considerably in the first quarter and will continue to expand strategically throughout the rest of the year.", "Our e-commerce strategy complements a growing real estate portfolio. We\u2019re in a unique position to serve our customers whenever and wherever they want to shop, integrating our walmart.com capabilities with an expanding presence of supercenters and small formats.", "In the first quarter, we added 38 new units and converted 8 units to supercenters through relocation or expansion. These 46 units added 3.6 million incremental square feet and included 1 discount store, 24 supercenters, and 21 small formats, most of which were Neighborhood Markets.", "Neighborhood Markets continued their positive performance, delivering a low single-digit positive comp, primarily driven by solid traffic gains. The vast majority of Neighborhood Markets include pharmacies, providing an additional convenience for our customers and driving traffic to the store. Our optimized assortment and convenient shopping experience is resonating with the customer, evidenced by our positive comps across most of the merchandising areas.", "Walmart Express also continues to generate strong results, delivering another quarter of double-digit positive comps. In the second quarter, we\u2019ll begin testing various supply chain initiatives as part of the North Carolina density test, which will strengthen our understanding of supply chain strategies for smaller stores.", "During the second quarter, we\u2019re planning to open between 60 and 65 new units, including new stores, expansions, and relocations. Our second quarter forecast represents about 4 million square feet of retail space, which will put us well on our way to deliver our previous guidance of 15 to 17 million square feet of retail growth in fiscal year \u201814.", "This year started with many challenges for our core customer.  Nevertheless, I\u2019m confident in our position and in the ability of our teams to execute. We believe that our strategy works under any economic environment and our underlying business remains strong.", "From an operational perspective, we will continue fueling the productivity loop, improving every aspect of our operation so we can leverage expenses, invest in price, and drive results. Our price investments will be supported by a solid marketing program that will communicate our strong price leadership. Throughout the rest of the year, we\u2019ll continue expanding our local basket challenge campaign through TV and radio, covering 70% of our markets across the country.", "Most important, we\u2019ll continue to run our business with our customers, our associates, and our communities in mind. Earlier this year, we announced our veterans\u2019 initiative with the objective of hiring any honorably discharged veteran seeking employment within his or her first 12 months off active duty. On Memorial Day, we\u2019ll be ready to launch the program, and we believe the vast majority of applicants will be placed within 30 days.", "May is off to a good start, with positive comps. We continue to feel good about the underlying business, as evidenced by first quarter results in areas less impacted by weather, as well as by our market share gains. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the impact of the 2% payroll tax increase along with other factors, like fuel prices. Based on these factors, we forecast comp sales to increase in the range of flat to positive 2% for the 13-week period from April 27 through July 26, 2013.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Doug for an international update. Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Thank you, Bill.  I\u2019d like to start the update on international by reminding you of our priorities: balancing growth and returns. As you know, Walmart International is an important contributor to top line growth. During the first quarter, we delivered a respectable top line. We feel good about the net and comp sales, especially given last year\u2019s really strong first quarter, the loss of leap day, and weather issues. As a reminder, our first quarter last year was our strongest of FY 13, with international net sales on a reported basis up 15% and operating income up 21.2%.", "During this year\u2019s first quarter, on a reported basis Walmart International grew net sales 2.9% to $33 billion. On a constant currency basis, Walmart International\u2019s first quarter sales were $33.8 billion, up 5.4%. A stronger dollar against key currencies impacted international results more negatively than expected and decreased the top line by $1 billion. Our acquisition increased sales by $200 million.", "Our stores in the U.K., Africa, Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, China, and India delivered positive comp store sales. Comp sales declined in Canada and Japan. As mentioned, last year had an extra leap day for leap year and the comparison to last year impacted sales and customer traffic by about 100 basis points.", "From a relative performance point of view, we were encouraged with our market share gains around the world during the quarter. We grew our share in Canada, Africa, Chile, Argentina, Central America, China, and Japan. We maintained market share in the U.K. and Mexico. And although we did not grow overall share in Brazil, we did increase share in food and consumables.", "Like revenue growth, another important priority is improving our returns. We were disappointed with our operating income performance this quarter, which impacted returns. In fact, we had a decline in profitability versus last year. This was partially due to having one less day of sales in all markets, as well as specific drivers that I\u2019ll elaborate on as I review the markets.", "Operating income was $1.3 billion and decreased 4.7% on a reported basis versus last year. On a constant currency basis, operating income declined 2.4%.", "Our gross profit rate was slightly down, and operating expenses grew faster than sales. Several factors contributed to us not leveraging expenses: softer sales, wage inflation, higher indirect taxes, and strategic investments, including those in e-commerce.  These are investments beyond those covered in the corporate and support budget. ", "Unfortunately, in the international markets, we have less workforce flexibility than in the U.S. In many markets, it takes more time to introduce and implement productivity improvements that help us to adjust wages to sales realities. ", "Given our current headwinds, I expect second quarter expenses to remain under pressure. Let me assure you that all management teams are focused on reducing expenses throughout our operating segment, and we expect to demonstrate improvement in the second half of the year.", "Another priority has been inventory management. I\u2019m pleased to say we\u2019ve seen some improvement in this quarter that was aided by Easter being one week earlier for the markets that celebrate the holiday. Constant currency inventory increased 7.1% over last year, an improvement from the first quarter last year. On a reported basis, inventory was up only 3.6%.", "Now let\u2019s get into the results for our larger markets. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis and, unless otherwise stated, total sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal, calendar basis.", "Let\u2019s begin with EMEA. The U.K. had a solid first quarter in a challenging market. Personal income grew much slower than the cost of essential items, putting pressure on all consumers. According to Kantar Worldpanel, the market experienced stronger growth in the first quarter than in previous quarters, driven solely by inflation, while market volumes declined. ", "The U.K. market as a whole experienced significant supply integrity issues within the quarter related to meat. Asda responded by carrying out robust and rigorous testing and continues to focus on transparency for customers.  ", "In the first quarter, Asda\u2019s net sales rose 2.6%, and sales excluding fuel increased 3%. Comparable sales rose by 1.3%, excluding fuel, growing ahead of the market. Average comp ticket increased by 1.6%, while comp traffic decreased by 0.3%. Asda\u2019s market share was flat at 17.9% for the 12 weeks ended March 17, the latest data reported by Kantar\u2019s Worldwide Panel Total Till Roll. A bright spot continues to be Asda\u2019s online grocery sales, which grew more than 16%.", "During the quarter, Asda increased investment in reducing the price of key food essentials. As a result, Asda\u2019s internal inflation measures continued to be significantly below the market, and comparable food volumes were positive in the first quarter. Reinforcing this strategy, Asda also won the \u201cGrocer 33\u201d lowest priced supermarket for 12 of the 13 weeks in Q1.", "Strong price and value gaps, combined with events such as Valentine\u2019s Day, Easter, and Mum\u2019s Day drove food sales growth, with Easter categories such as lamb, salmon, and bakery significantly outperforming. A January clearance event and seasonably appropriate weather drove strong general merchandise sales.", "Asda\u2019s gross profit margin declined slightly in the quarter, driven by sales mix and price investment. Considering the impact of fuel sales, operating expenses grew slower than sales. The \u201cWe operate for less\u201d program continued to deliver savings, offsetting some of the cost headwinds across energy, property taxes, insurance, and environmental tariffs, along with some weather-related costs. Operating income decreased by 0.8% from the prior year.", "Moving to Canada, Walmart Canada faced a challenging quarter, as consumer spending weakened due to higher household debt levels. Our results were impacted by the unseasonably colder weather this year versus unseasonably warm weather last year and the leap year overlap. Net sales grew 6.1%, but Canada had a decline in operating income and did not leverage expenses.", "Comparable sales decreased 1.3%, with comp ticket up 0.7%, and comp traffic declining 2%. We had strong comp sales in food, consumables, and home lines, but continue to see softer sales in entertainment. The colder weather also impacted sales in hard lines and apparel. However, in the first quarter\u2019s challenging environment, we drove market share gains of 120 basis points and the Nielsen Company measured categories of \u201cfood, consumables, and health and wellness.\u201d", "Regarding profitability, gross profit rate increased due to improved initial margins from private label and direct import gains, as well as reduced shrink. However, operating expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to negative comp store sales, the lapping of costs related to the year-over-year growth in new store base, and investments in ecommerce.", "Moving to Sub-Saharan Africa, as you know, Massmart is a publicly held company in South Africa, and only announces results every six months. For the 14 weeks ending March 31, Massmart increased sales by 10.3% and comparable sales by 6%. ", "While these are good numbers, the trends are slower than we reported for Massmart at the close of fiscal 2013. The South African consumer environment remains cautious, and sales growth is forecasted to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. Also note that Massmart will hold its annual meeting on May 22nd.", "Now to Latin America. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reports its earnings under IFRS, so some numbers are different from Walmex-reported numbers.", "Walmex results for the first quarter were mixed. We had solid results in Central America and disappointing performance in Mexico that impacted the overall business. For the quarter, net sales grew 5.5%. Gross margin increased 60 basis points versus last year, driven by improvements in both Mexico and Central America. Operating expenses grew more than sales. Management is focused on reducing expenses and increasing productivity savings. Operating income for the quarter grew 7.5%, faster than sales, primarily due to strong gross profit margins.", "For the first quarter, Mexico\u2019s sales increased 5.6% over last year and comparable store sales grew 1.1%. Average comp ticket in Mexico increased 4.4%, and comp traffic decreased 3.3% over last year. Traffic was negative due to calendar effects and a general market slowdown in consumption. In relation to the market, we maintained market share on total sales, but Mexico\u2019s first quarter comp store sales for the self-service formats grew 0.8%. This was slower than ANTAD\u2019s comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, at 1.4%.", "In Mexico, gross margin was up 48 basis points. Expenses grew 8.8%, above our sales growth. The biggest increases in expenses were in physical infrastructure investments like maintenance, repairs, and depreciation. Operating income grew 5.5%.", "Central America is on track to deliver good results. Systems integration will conclude as expected in the second quarter, and markets that were lagging, like Guatemala, are improving. Central America increased net sales from the previous year by 4.9%. Comparable store sales increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin increased 124 basis points versus last year, as a result of better merchandising and EDLP execution. The transition to EDLP in our Central American countries is completed. Expenses grew more than sales. Operating income increased 40%.", "Moving on to Brazil, Brazil grew sales in the first quarter and had a slight operating profit. We continue our mantra of EDLC and EDLP, maintaining a 7% price gap in self-service formats and we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re gaining traction with customers.", "First quarter retail sales in Brazil grew 5.5% from last year, with comparable sales growing 3.7%. Ticket grew 7.2%, and comp traffic declined 3.5% when compared to last year. There was strong performance in consumables, food, and perishables as we gained market share in these categories. Sales of general merchandise were weak, as we scaled down interest-free credit offerings.", "Gross profit rate increased slightly, as a result of lower shrink and better markdown management, but we did not leverage operating expenses in Brazil due to our lower rate of comp store growth, specifically in our wholesale formats, and wage inflation. ", "Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile is also a publicly-held company and will release first quarter earnings on May 30.", "Moving to Asia, Walmart China grew sales and operating income during the first quarter. Net sales for the first quarter grew 5.4% over last year, despite a weaker than expected Chinese New Year. Comparable store sales growth was 1%. As more Chinese families own a car and other amenities for their home, there is much greater trip consolidation. Comp ticket grew 8.9% in China, but traffic declined 7.9%. Traffic declines are consistent with the overall market.", "First quarter gross profit rate was slightly down from last year due to our investment in price. However, Walmart China leveraged operating expenses, even with wage inflation. In China, we are near the end of our planning stage of our EDLP transition and have started to take a few steps. As in other markets, this is a multi-year effort, and we know it will take time for our customers to see and appreciate the value brought to them by EDLP.", "On to Japan, where the economy continues to slow, Walmart Japan\u2019s net sales and comp sales decreased 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively, reflecting cautious consumer behavior. First quarter comp traffic decreased 1.9% and ticket decreased 0.4%. ", "Traffic decreased due to an increase in competition in the convenience related formats. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade, and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the first quarter declined by 3.3% from last year, so on a positive note, we outperformed the market.", "Walmart Japan\u2019s gross profit rate decreased by 96 basis points, due to our increased investment in lower prices. Walmart Japan missed leveraging expenses by a slight margin due to the sales decline, but year-over-year operating expenses were down, even with higher remodeling costs. Accordingly, Walmart Japan had a slight operating loss this quarter, compared to positive operating income in the prior year.", "Turning to the opportunities in e-commerce, we are excited about the global capabilities we are strengthening and expanding in the key markets of the U.K., Brazil and China.  Asda\u2019s continued focus on offering a convenient shopping experience for customers drove strong online sales in the first part of 2013. ", "During Q1, Asda completed the rollout of Wi-Fi across our stores to enable a better smart device shopping experience. In addition, our Asda team added its grocery Click and Collect offer in approximately 100 stores. Asda also significantly expanded grocery home shopping capacity by opening a third dedicated online fulfillment center in Nottingham, providing increased accuracy, efficiency, and delivery options. Customers now can tap into 20,000 additional delivery slots per week.", "Over the last six months in Brazil, our walmart.com.br site has become the largest-traffic e-commerce site. For the first quarter, online sales in Brazil increased over 40%.", "In the previous year acquisition of Yihaodian, one of the fast-growing ecommerce businesses in China, we now have a platform to compete in a market with broadband penetration that has exceeded the U.S. Yihaodian provides consumer goods on a same-day basis in Tier 1 cities: Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou.", "We grew market share already this year in e-commerce in the U.K., Brazil, and China, and the integration of technology into our business is a key for future growth. We will expand our successes and learnings from the U.K., Brazil, and China into other markets such Mexico, Japan, and Canada.", "We are also focused on building a world-class compliance program across the globe. Our comprehensive program spans 14 different compliance dimensions that address areas from ethical sourcing to licenses and permits. We are strengthening what already existed in each market, adding subject matter expertise, significant investments in talent, process, systems, and training. ", "For example, we recently announced a $16.2 million, three-year investment in food safety in China. We are reinforcing Walmart culture based on our basic beliefs of respect for the individual, strive for excellence, service to the customer, and, as always, on a foundation of integrity. With our compliance program, we will operate more effectively in each market, and we are building a solid foundation for future growth.", "In closing, it\u2019s been a tough start to the beginning of the year, but we\u2019re focused in each of our markets and have tighter discipline in our execution. As Mike said earlier, we are simplifying, we are focused, and we are prioritizing. With our current outlook, we do not expect to leverage expenses in the second quarter, but we\u2019ve begun to take actions that will demonstrate improvement as we progress through the year. For example, we\u2019re working hard to accelerate the improvements that we will receive from working with our Global Business Process group.", "With that, we remain focused on the core tenets of our operating model and being the best Walmart we can be. Our global consumer is challenged with their household budgets and we need to continue to provide them with the price and value they need.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s.  Roz?", "Rosalind Brewer", "Thanks, Doug.  This year, Sam\u2019s Club celebrates our 30-year anniversary. It\u2019s been an exciting journey, ever since our first club opened in Midwest City, Oklahoma in 1983. I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of our associates over the past 30 years who\u2019ve delivered tremendous value to our members and made our business so successful.", "During the first quarter, we grew net sales, and comp sales were within guidance. We grew membership income by delivering superior value, responding to business member trends, and enhancing our membership offering. Combined with reduced operating expenses, we generated operating profits more than 7% ahead of last year.", "Comp sales, without fuel, were up 0.2% for the 13-week period, lapping a 5.3% comp sales increase last year. Comp traffic was up 1.3%, driven by our Advantage members, and ticket was down 1.1%, driven by Business members.", "Unfavorable weather this year created a headwind in our weather-sensitive categories. In geographies with more moderate weather, such as the west, members responded positively to our seasonal merchandise, indicating sales in these categories improve as the weather changes. ", "Additionally, inflation continued to moderate from Q4, impacting our top line results, as inflation this quarter was approximately 50 basis points. Inflation ran between 250 and 300 basis points in the first quarter last year.", "Our Business member is an integral part of our business, and comp sales and traffic patterns continue to indicate that they remain pressured. Small business optimism remains at historically low levels as businesses adapt to higher payroll taxes and cautious consumers. In response, we\u2019re focused on increasing awareness of the value Sam\u2019s Club offers. We\u2019re executing regional business expos and small business appreciation programs in May and June, in which our associates spend time working with members in their place of business.", "Despite these headwinds, I mentioned in the first quarter, we drove sales and profit growth. Net sales, including fuel, were $13.9 billion, up 0.1%. Fuel created a 40 basis point headwind to sales growth, as fuel prices were down 3.8% compared to last year. Gallons sold were up 1.3%. Gross profit rate was up 7 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved slightly. Operating income increased 7.4% to $525 million.", "Fuel is an important component of our strategy to provide more value to our members. Volatility in fuel prices, however, can notably impact our financial results. The remainder of our discussion, therefore, will be focused on the core business and exclude fuel for comparative purposes.", "Net sales for the quarter were $12.2 billion, up 0.5% from last year. During the first quarter last year, we gained one additional day due to leap year, resulting in one less day this year. The addition of leap day last year provided a benefit of about 100 basis points. Our strongest divisional performance was in the West, with our strongest regional performance in the Mountain, Mid-Atlantic and Southwest regions.", "Now let\u2019s move on to merchandising highlights for the quarter.  Fresh comp sales were up low single-digits, with strength in dairy and produce. Members responded positively to our new pack-size innovation in certain frozen food items. These items contain smaller bags within the main pack, increasing convenience for our members.", "Grocery and beverage sales grew low single-digits, driven by growth in dry grocery, partially offset by declines in our beverage business, due to both weather and business member softness.", "Sales of consumables posted a low single-digit comp. With the support of our strategic price investments, we delivered low to mid single-digit unit growth in areas like paper and tabletop. Our baby category continues to be a strong source of growth, with market share according to Nielsen growing by 20 basis points for the 13-week period ending April 27, 2013.", "Technology and entertainment posted a negative low single-digit comp. Pressures in office electronics and media were partially offset by compelling value in wireless, which posted double-digit comp and unit growth. According to The NPD Group, we gained market share in TVs for the 13-week period ending April 27, 2013.", "Sales in apparel and home were down low single-digits. Home saw modest gains, driven by domestics and mattresses. Apparel was down due to seasonal merchandise, but our core basic apparel business posted mid single-digit comps, indicating strength in our underlying business. Jewelry, where we have strengthened our assortment and our price points, gained momentum throughout the quarter. Members responded very well to our improved selection of high quality diamonds.", "Health and wellness, including pharmacy, experienced low single-digit comps. Over-the-counter merchandise continues to grow, especially diet products. We filled more prescriptions, but sales declined as the industry shifts more to generics. ", "The majority of our prescription business remains maintenance related, generating regular traffic to our health and wellness area. We continue to increase awareness of the services available at Sam\u2019s Club, such as pharmacist-provided immunizations and health screening programs. During the quarter, we increased the number of health screenings by almost 30% over the same period last year.", "Sales of ancillary categories negatively affected the quarter due to a decline in tobacco sales, driven by softness from our convenience store members as they see increased competition from dollar stores.", "Moving to online, innovation and collaboration with our global ecommerce team resulted in double-digit sales growth for the quarter, driven by categories like portable electronics, baby, and mattresses. These categories were not only strong online, but also in our clubs, demonstrating that our members are finding great values no matter what channel they shop.", "Gross profit rate remained relatively flat, as continued strategic price investments were offset by a more favorable mix, due to softer sales in lower margin categories like tobacco and beverages.", "Strong membership growth is critical to remaining a healthy club business and we\u2019re focused on innovative ways to reach new prospects. We collaborated with Living Social from March 4 through the 6th to reach new Sam\u2019s Club members. The offer included a base membership, $20 gift card, and a merchandise package that included a variety of take-home meal solutions, all for $45, a total value of roughly $80. In just 48 hours, we had more than 157,000 people sign up for this offer, and we were pleased with the significant social media buzz and deal share volume generated.", "Net membership income grew 2.4%, driven by Advantage member growth, offsetting slight declines from Business members. Membership and other income was up 6.5% versus last year, because of improved contract terms relating to our profit sharing arrangement with our credit card provider.", "Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 12 basis points. A driver of this leverage was a decline in incentive expenses versus last year.  Looking at the bottom line, first quarter operating income was $519 million, a 6.6% increase over last year.", "Inventory, including fuel, was up 6% year over year, as softer sales significantly affected our sell-through rate across several areas. Our management team is focused on actively slowing the rate of inventory growth to better align with the rate of sales.", "We continue to focus on creating member value by executing our real estate strategy, enhancing the membership offering, improving item merchandising, and offering members access anytime, anywhere.", "We are pleased with the performance of clubs opened within the last two to three years. During the quarter, we relocated one club in Texas City, which outperformed expectations. We plan to open 15 to 20 new and relocated clubs during the year, the majority of which we\u2019ve scheduled for the third and fourth quarter.", "Now I\u2019d like to provide more details on our overall membership strategy. We applied key learnings from the last months of our membership pilot in Texas to enhance the value of a Sam\u2019s Club membership. The Texas pilot represents 12% of our total U.S. club base. ", "As of yesterday, we increased our membership fee nationwide. The membership fee is now $45 for both Advantage and Business base memberships, reflecting a $5 and $10 increase, respectively. The fee for our Plus membership remains $100. ", "This is our first increase since January 2006, and we do not expect a significant impact to renewal rates or new sign-ups. We will continue to offer additional value to our members while driving strong membership income in the coming years, as the full benefit of the fee increase will be recognized over the next 24 months.", "Our first Instant Savings book, which is available to all members from May 15 through June 9, includes over $3,500 in savings on nearly 100 items, both in-club and through samsclub.com. Additionally, Plus members will continue to receive exclusive offers automatically loaded onto their membership card, which will now include fresh and private label items. ", "With the exception of the cash rewards program for Plus members, these changes are consistent with our Texas pilot. Initial response to cash rewards has been positive. We will continue testing this benefit in Texas throughout the year to gain a better understanding of the longer-term financial impact.", "You\u2019re also going to see a change in our merchandise strategy throughout the year. In the past, we\u2019ve had great success treating our clubs essentially the same, but we recognize our member base varies around the country. Moving forward, members will experience exciting merchandise, heightened by local brands, all displayed with a new level of visual excitement.", "We\u2019re also adapting to serve our members who are shopping online and in our clubs. Members are using their mobile devices, before, during, and after their shopping experience.  The Sam\u2019s Club mobile app is giving our members personalized ecommerce and the ability to shop anywhere, anytime. ", "Before visiting the clubs, members can build shopping lists and fill prescriptions. In the club, they can research merchandise information and compare costs. And alongside Walmart, we\u2019re piloting the Scan & Go app, which will be in 150 clubs by mid-June. Technology clearly enhances our members\u2019 shopping experience.", "The combination of our strategies positions us well for the second quarter, and we have a number of events to drive sales. We were pleased with the first two weeks\u2019 start to the quarter. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from April 27 through July 26 to range between 1% and 3%. Last year, for the 13-week period, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2%.", "The core business at Sam\u2019s Club is solid. We\u2019re confident that the combination of new club growth, membership improvements, exciting and locally relevant merchandise, as well as e-commerce and digital opportunities, will drive momentum. We\u2019re proud of what we have accomplished in the past 30 years and are confident that we are well positioned going forward.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Charles for our wrap up and guidance. Charles?", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Roz. To wrap up, let me provide some perspective on the quarter. First, we feel good about many aspects of our company\u2019s performance.  We delivered 4.6% earnings per share growth in a tough sales environment.  Both Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club levered expenses and grew operating income faster than sales.  ", "We generated solid cash flows from operations.  We grew our ecommerce sales more than 30% and grew market share in the U.K., Brazil, and China. We issued $5 billion of fixed income debt at record low rates on the strength of our balance sheet.  And, in February of this year, we announced an 18% increase in our dividend.", "The first quarter also presented some challenges.  As a company, our leverage ratio was relatively flat, and although we grew consolidated operating income faster than sales, the growth did not meet our expectations. Looking ahead, our financial priorities remain growth, leverage, and returns, and we usually talk about them in this order. But today, I\u2019d like to start with a discussion on leverage.", "The company\u2019s leverage in the first quarter was relatively flat, and the second quarter will be challenging as well. Our largest challenges are with International, as Doug spoke about, and our leverage services area, where we are investing in projects and programs that will save costs in the long run.", "Operating expense leverage is a critical piece of our business model, and we remain focused on delivering the five-year 100 basis point goal through fiscal 2017. Though expense leverage is not expected to be achieved equally across the quarters every year, we are committed to leveraging operating expenses for this year.", "Early investments to expand our leverage initiatives will initially have a short-term impact on expenses. However, these investments will benefit Walmart for the long term. Our leverage teams are focused on three key areas: best practice implementation, building greater sourcing capabilities, and back office efficiency.", "Under the \u201cbest practice\u201d umbrella, for example, our global business process teams continue to work on self-checkout expansion, auto replenishment systems, and associate scheduling systems.  Our sourcing teams are working to increase direct import volumes to deliver greater savings on cost of goods and transportation. We also continue to make progress on goods not for resale, especially in the refrigeration and energy areas.", "In our back office area, we completed the migration of work from four different finance offices in Central America to a regional center that is now serving most of our Latin American countries. Initiatives like this help us simplify, prioritize, and focus.", "In addition, we continue to invest in our international markets through new store growth and our compliance organization. Jeff provided details earlier on the expenses related to the ongoing FCPA matters, as well as the processes we\u2019re putting in place to continue to strengthen our global compliance organization.", "Now let\u2019s talk about growth. During the quarter, we added over 5 million square feet of retail space. Our total revenue growth was less than we expected, growing 1% versus last year. In addition, headwinds from currency impacted top line more than we anticipated. However, as you heard from Bill, Roz, and Doug, we feel confident about our growth in the second quarter and the balance of the year.", "One final comment on sales, ecommerce will continue to grow in importance for our company. During the quarter, e-commerce sales increased by over 30%, and we continue to make strategic investments in the markets that offer us the greatest growth opportunity. We\u2019re focusing this investment in key areas, including our global technology platform and next-generation fulfillment networks, as well as scaling additional markets around the world.", "We remain focused on four important markets in ecommerce. From a traffic perspective, we see over 45 million visitors each month in the U.S. on walmart.com, where growth and conversion are accelerating. In the U.K., we\u2019re the second largest online grocer, while in Brazil we were just named the number one trafficked ecommerce site. And, you\u2019ve heard us talk about our investment in Yihaodian, one of the fastest growing e-commerce businesses in China. We\u2019re excited about the potential for growth in this space, and Neil Ashe has assembled the talent necessary to achieve our growth plans.", "Let me finish our discussion on our financial priorities today by talking about returns. We deployed cash to grow our business and return value to shareholders. During the quarter, $3.8 billion was returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Walmart has a long history of delivering great returns for our shareholders, and we remain committed to continuing this trend.", "Let\u2019s move on to guidance. As we think about earnings per share guidance for the second quarter, there are a couple of specific items that we have included. First, we told you during the fourth quarter last year that investments in Global ecommerce initiatives would have an incremental $0.09 impact for fiscal 2014. During the second quarter, we expect an impact of about $0.02 per share. This is in line with the $0.02 impact we had in the first quarter.  Additionally, we believe costs associated with FCPA matters will be between $65 and $70 million for the second quarter.", "Taking these factors into consideration, along with current business and macroeconomic trends, including currency, we expect second quarter earnings per share to be between $1.22 and $1.27. Last year, Walmart delivered earnings per share of $1.18 in the second quarter.", "Thank you for your support of our company.

", "Such forward-looking statements include management\u2019s expectations and plans for the Sam\u2019s Club operating segment, regarding: improved sales in seasonal merchandise categories as a result of improved weather; opening a certain number of new and relocated clubs during fiscal 2014; the impact of increases in membership fees on renewal rates and new sign-ups; continuing to provide Plus members with exclusive offers through their membership cards; changes in merchandise strategy during fiscal 2014; the expansion of the pilot Scan & Go app; and the effect of new club growth, membership improvements, merchandise and e-commerce and digital opportunities.

Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call.", "Carol Schumacher ", "Hi, this is Carol Schumacher, vice president of investor relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. Our press release and transcript of this call are available on our website; that\u2019s www.stock.walmart.com.", "Here\u2019s today\u2019s agenda. Mike Duke, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will provide his thoughts about the quarter and the challenging retail environment we face in all of our markets. Jeff Davis, EVP of finance and treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial results.", "Then, we\u2019ll cover the operating segments. First up, Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S. Bill will be followed by Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart International, and then we\u2019ll complete our operating segment discussion with Rosalind Brewer, president and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club.", "Given the level of e-commerce activity in many areas of the company, we\u2019ve invited Neil Ashe, president and CEO of Global eCommerce, to join us today for a progress report on our strategies to integrate e-commerce sales within our stores. Neil will follow the operating segment reports. Then, Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up the call with an analysis of our financial priorities, as well as EPS guidance for the third quarter and the full year.", "We continue to receive questions from you about our comp sales reporting calendar for this fiscal year for our U.S. operating segments. This fiscal year, we will report comp store sales on a 53-week basis, with 4-5-5 reporting in Q4. As a reminder, our comp week begins on Saturday and ends on Friday. Our Q4 reporting period begins Oct. 26 and runs through Jan. 31. Therefore, week 53 will be compared to week one of the current fiscal year 2014.", "Additional information regarding some of the terms we use at Walmart, including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate are available on our website. Please note that year to date, we no longer have discontinued operations. But, we do have one term we\u2019d like to remind you about. We started with this term last quarter. \u201cCorporate and support\u201d is now what we call our corporate areas, including core corporate, such as finance and legal, as well as Global eCommerce support and global leverage services. Previously, we referred to this as \u201cother unallocated.\u201d", "Our annual analyst meeting is Tuesday, October 15 in Northwest Arkansas. Registration is open, and we invite you to join us for a full day of presentations and updates on our global business. The meeting also is available via webcast through our website, again, that\u2019s www.stock.walmart.com, if you can\u2019t join us in person.", "We have a lot to cover today. Mike will start us off with the highlights and a report card on our business at the halfway mark of the year.", "Mike?", "Mike Duke ", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone.", "Today, we reported a 5.1 percent increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.24 for the second quarter, which is within our guidance. Sales for the quarter were below expectations, but improved from the first quarter. We are executing plans to strengthen our top line performance for the rest of the year and expect sequential improvement in the back half.", "We\u2019re pleased that Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club leveraged expenses for the first half of the year. But, we didn\u2019t leverage expenses in the second quarter as a company. While it will be difficult, we believe the steps we\u2019re taking to control costs, especially in International, will bring us closer to our full-year leverage goal. We will continue to invest in leverage initiatives, compliance and e-commerce as we focus on future growth.", "So, let\u2019s take a closer look at how our businesses performed in the second quarter. Consolidated net sales and our Walmart U.S. comp were below expectations for the quarter. While the retail environment was challenging across all of our markets, the Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club businesses improved comp sales from the first quarter, and reported sales in International remained consistent. We expect to see improvement in all of our segments in the back half of the year.", "Walmart U.S. comp sales declined 0.3 percent in the 13-week period ended July 26. Traffic improved from the first quarter, and we gained market share in key categories. We continue to invest in price and we are focused on delivering positive comps during the next two quarters.", "Sam\u2019s Club comp sales, without fuel, increased 1.7 percent for the 13-week period. The improved merchandise assortment and Instant Savings program drove membership growth. Business member traffic also improved. I\u2019m pleased that Sam\u2019s new membership enhancements and fee structure contributed to bottom line improvement.", "Walmart International\u2019s constant currency net sales were up 4.4 percent. Operating income was substantially better in the second quarter than our first quarter, and increased 40 basis points year-over-year. We achieved expense reduction in some countries, but as we said in the first quarter on our earnings call, we didn\u2019t leverage expenses this quarter given that sales were below expectations.", "In February, I outlined six key areas that are critical to Walmart\u2019s long-term success. So, let\u2019s look at our report card at the halfway mark this year. First, I said we need to deliver a strong Walmart U.S. business. The underlying business strategy is solid, but year-to-date sales were below our expectations.", "Traffic trends improved throughout the second quarter as weather normalized and customers responded favorably to the improved quality in our fresh offerings, especially produce. Our apparel and home categories rebounded this quarter, delivering very good comp sales. The team\u2019s cost discipline delivered leverage and strong operating income in the first half of the year and I expect this will continue.", "We\u2019re also making it more convenient for customers to access Walmart on their shopping terms. Our mobile and online technology investments increased customer engagement and drove double-digit sales growth for walmart.com. This fiscal year, we\u2019re on track to increase our Neighborhood Market fleet by more than 40 percent, reaching new markets and filling in grocery offerings around supercenters.", "To improve International returns, our second key priority, we must drive expense leverage and lower our cost structure to align with a more challenging retail environment. In the first half, our sales growth was less than we expected. International\u2019s ability to leverage is important to the company\u2019s overall leverage goal and we are committed to improving through productivity and expense savings.", "Effective cost management is vital to improving returns in International during this low-growth cycle, and we\u2019re taking steps to accomplish this. For example, our China and our global leverage teams partnered to launch a new productivity initiative that is yielding positive results in China. In Mexico, we\u2019re implementing an on-shelf availability application to target and improve in-stock opportunities. And across many of our markets, we\u2019re utilizing workforce management tools to better align associate schedules with customer traffic. These actions, among others, will contribute to International\u2019s leverage goal.", "On our third priority, I said we must increase capital discipline. I\u2019m pleased with the stronger performance of our new stores, and a number of recent grand openings delivered sales ahead of expectations. We\u2019re making better real estate decisions and driving greater efficiency in our construction of new stores and remodels. Our real estate review meetings are focused on improving returns by reducing costs and increasing sales per square foot.", "Next is our focus on leverage initiatives. Our leverage teams are partnering with the operating segments to drive greater expense savings. Increased direct import volumes are lowering cost of goods sold. These are savings that we pass along to our customers. In our stores, we\u2019re improving customer experience and reducing costs through enhancements to hybrid and self-checkout register technology. And, we just finished the migration of eight countries in Latin America to our Costa Rican Shared Services Center, which we expect to lower back office costs and improve service levels.", "The fifth priority that I outlined is winning in e-commerce, and I\u2019m pleased with our progress. Sales globally grew more than 30 percent in the first two quarters, led by the strong performance from our acquisition of Yihaodian. I\u2019m confident that these are the right investments to position the business for long-term success, despite the short-term headwind that they create on financial results. We have ambitious goals, and you\u2019ll hear more from Neil shortly.", "Last, I told you in February that we would continue to strengthen Walmart\u2019s compliance organization. We\u2019ve enhanced processes and procedures, associate training and organizational leadership. We now have chief compliance officers in substantially all markets and regions, and anti-corruption directors in almost all markets. Together, they are continuing to implement compliance systems, conduct regular risk assessments and increase training for our associates.", "Walmart continues to focus on areas that help our customers and our associates live better. Bill and I recently visited stores in Tennessee, West Virginia and Georgia. I saw how our associates appreciated the focus on opportunity in our recent Shareholders Meeting and the programs we have in place to help them achieve their personal objectives.", "When Doug and I went to stores in Brazil, Japan, Argentina and Chile, it was gratifying to see how our focus on the customer translates globally. In every market, we have the most committed associates who display a passion for helping our customers to save money and live better. I\u2019m really looking forward to visiting more of our stores again this quarter.", "Before I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I\u2019m encouraged by our position to execute in the second half of the year, particularly with the steps we\u2019re taking to improve performance. There are areas of our business where we can do a better job, and we will. I\u2019m confident in our associates\u2019 ability to deliver for our customers with EDLP and for shareholders with improved sales and expense savings. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff for more financial details. Jeff?", "Jeff Davis ", "Thank you Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 14, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share of $1.24 versus $1.18 last year, a 5.1 percent increase. As we told you, we expect to invest an incremental $0.09 per share in ecommerce for the full year. This investment for Q2 was approximately $0.03 per share. In addition, EPS was impacted by approximately $0.01 due to a charge for a certain non-income tax matter recorded in operating expenses within Walmart International.", "Now, let\u2019s turn our attention to the detailed financial results for the second quarter. Consolidated net sales increased 2.4 percent or $2.7 billion, to $116.2 billion. The quarter included $216 million from acquisitions, which was offset by a negative impact of approximately $680 million from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 2.8 percent.", "With respect to our comp sales, total U.S. comps, without fuel, were flat for the 13-week period ended July 26. You will hear more details on our separate Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club comps from Bill and Roz.", "While Sam\u2019s Club delivered positive gains in membership, consolidated membership and other income decreased 4.3 percent, compared to the second quarter of last year due to Walmart U.S. and International. Total revenue was $116.9 billion, a 2.3 percent increase over last year. Our gross profit rate for Q2 was 24.8 percent, an increase of 19 basis points compared to last year.", "The increase was primarily driven by our Walmart U.S. and International segments. You\u2019ll hear more from Bill and Doug on the specific drivers. Now turning to expenses, operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.5 percent, which represents a 20 basis point increase versus last year.", "As always, let\u2019s take a closer look at Corporate and support expenses, which increased 31 percent and is comprised of 3 areas: Core corporate, Global eCommerce support, and Global leverage services.", "Our core corporate expenses increased 12.2 percent. Expenses related to FCPA and compliance matters were approximately $82 million, which was above our forecasted range of $65 to $70 million. Approximately $48 million of these expenses represented costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations. Approximately $34 million is related to global compliance programs and organizational enhancements. It is important to note that excluding these FCPA and compliance matters, core corporate expenses would have decreased approximately 2.2 percent.", "The remainder of Corporate and support expense growth is associated with our ongoing initiatives within global leverage services and Global eCommerce support. These expenses reflect investments for the future and remain a headwind for the remainder of the year. Neil will provide additional insights into recent developments and investments within eCommerce.", "This leads us to consolidated operating income, which grew 1.4 percent to $6.8 billion. Net interest expense increased 9.5 percent to $553 million. The increase was primarily the result of a prior year release of interest accruals on tax-related matters and higher debt balances. That brings us to consolidated net income. Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart was $4.1 billion, an increase of approximately 1.3 percent.", "Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 32.5 percent. As a reminder, we may experience quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate as it may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, tax law changes, audit results, discrete items and a mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. A little later, Charles will provide an update for our projected tax rate for the fiscal year.", "From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 5.5 percent, primarily driven by softer than expected sales within our operating segments and timing of receipts of merchandise. You\u2019ll hear more from the segment CEOs regarding inventory levels.", "Payables as a percentage of inventory was 85.8 percent, which compares to 88.9 percent last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased levels of inventory within our Walmart U.S. and International segments and the timing of payments.", "Our debt to total capitalization was 44.4 percent at the end of the quarter, compared to 43.7 percent last year. Free cash flow was $5.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2013 compared to $6.1 billion last year. The timing of tax payments and growth of capital expenditures were the primary drivers of the decline.", "Clearly one of our financial priorities is to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In Q2, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends. In addition, we repurchased approximately $1.9 billion of shares, representing approximately 24.2 million shares. This leaves us with approximately $13.9 billion remaining under our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced in June of 2013.", "Return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2013 was 17.9 percent, compared to 18.1 percent for the prior year. The reduction was primarily the result of acquisitions and an increase in fixed assets within the base business. Now, let\u2019s move on to the discussion of our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Walmart U.S.", "Bill?", "Bill Simon", "Thank you Jeff. I\u2019m proud of the great work the team did, leading us to a solid quarter in profit in a disappointing sales environment.", "Net sales grew 2.1 percent to $68.7 billion, with about $1.4 billion added in sales year over year. For the quarter, we delivered a negative 0.3 percent sales comp. Traffic decreased 0.5 percent and ticket increased 0.2 percent. The lack of meaningful inflation and the 2 percent increase in payroll taxes impacted our results; however our performance reflects more than a 100 basis point improvement over Q1.", "Nevertheless, I was encouraged by the improvement we saw, as traffic and comp sales increased throughout the quarter. We also saw some slight increases in inflation towards the end of the quarter. In addition, there were some key parts of the business, like produce, home and apparel, that were very successful. We\u2019ll talk about these in a bit.", "We also continued to gain market share across several categories. According to The Nielsen Company, we gained 14 basis points of market share in the measured category of \u201cfood, consumables and health & wellness/OTC\u201d during the 13 weeks ending July 20th.", "Year to date, we\u2019ve grown sales by $1.6 billion versus last year to $135.3 billion, leading to almost $570 million in operating income growth, and putting us at $10.9 billion in operating income for the first half of the year.", "Now, let\u2019s cover additional financial details. During the quarter, we continued working with our suppliers to drive cost of goods savings. These initiatives, along with more favorable merchandise mix and logistics productivity, benefited gross profit rate.", "Overall, our gross profit rate was up 23 basis points, leading to an increase of 2.9 percent in gross profit dollars. We continue to monitor the pricing environment in each market to ensure price leadership, which is the cornerstone of our business strategy.", "Our stores and operations team did a great job managing expenses, delivering solid operating income growth in a challenging sales environment. Operating expenses grew by only 1.7 percent to $13.8 billion, providing 7 basis points of expense leverage. This leverage helped us deliver a strong bottom line for the quarter, with operating income growing at 5.2 percent, twice the rate of sales growth. Year to date, operating expenses were only up 0.25 percent versus last year.", "Inventory was up 6.9 percent, primarily driven by softer than anticipated sales trends, the delay in summer weather and timing shifts in the receipt of merchandise for back to school and the upcoming holiday season. While we\u2019re not concerned about the quality of the inventory, it will continue to be an area of focus in the coming months, as we get ready for the key holiday season and continue to balance in-stock and an expanded assortment.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to some of our savings initiatives. We continued to fuel the productivity loop in the second quarter, maintaining competitive price gaps while delivering strong profit results. Merchants, operators and our logistics team continued to work together on key leverage opportunities.", "The logistics team reduced cost per case shipped year over year for the eighth consecutive quarter. Continuous improvement in trailer loading efficiency, as well as alignment and routing optimization, helped the transportation fleet produce another quarter of solid savings, with an increase of 3.7 percent in cases transported per mile driven.", "Our store operations team continued to leverage technology and innovation to drive productivity across all areas of the store. The investments we\u2019ve made in self-service checkouts are increasing the flexibility of our front-end processes and at the same time reducing operating costs.", "We expanded self-service checkouts across the chain, with 1,400 more lanes added during the second quarter. Our customers appreciate the added flexibility, and we experienced a 4 percent increase in the utilization rate year-over-year. We\u2019ll continue our planned installations of self-service checkouts across the country during the third quarter.", "Our associates work hard to serve our customers, and we continue to emphasize the overall customer experience, even as we achieve productivity improvements within the box. I\u2019m pleased to say that, during the second quarter, customer experience scores improved versus the previous quarter.", "We\u2019re also exceptionally focused on in-stock, and we\u2019re pleased that this metric continues to improve. Our goal is always to have the right product on the shelf when the customer wants it. During the second quarter, we placed additional emphasis on select, core items most relevant to our customers, and experienced in-stock improvements. Our operations management teams continue to focus on the bottom performing stores to drive better on-shelf availability. As we gear up for the back half of the year, we\u2019ll continue to monitor these key measures, maintaining a healthy balance between our expense leverage goals and customer experience.", "Now let\u2019s look at the performance of our merchandise areas in more detail. I\u2019m encouraged by the strong performance in such key areas as produce, home and apparel, where our focus on quality and value fueled growth.", "For the quarter, grocery sales, which includes food and consumables, grew by nearly $1 billion. We delivered delivered a slightly negative comp for the retail period. Our results were influenced by lower than anticipated inflation, even deflation in some areas, including dry grocery, frozen and snacks and beverages. Softer performance among these larger categories impacted our overall comp by more than 50 basis points. Adult beverages continued a solid trend of results, delivering a high single-digit comp.", "Our produce business also continued to gain momentum, delivering a strong mid single-digit comp. We\u2019re getting more efficient at transporting the product from farm to shelf. We\u2019re executing weekly store audits and equipping associates with additional skills and tools to ensure quality and freshness.", "We\u2019re also letting our customers know about it through our \u201cfresh over\u201d marketing campaign and our new \u201c100 percent money back guarantee.\u201d What\u2019s even more encouraging was that we saw consistently improving comps in produce throughout the quarter, with a high single-digit comp in July.", "We also gained market share across our consumables business. However, similar to last quarter, our overall performance was somewhat soft as customers traded down, particularly in the categories where product loyalty is not the primary factor in a purchase decision.", "As the quarter progressed, our seasonal categories improved, but not enough to offset the early declines. Pets delivered another quarter of low single-digit positive comps and close to 30 basis points of market share gains, for the 13 weeks ending July 20th, according to Nielsen. We expect our grocery performance to improve in the third quarter, driven by new and exclusive products and innovation.", "Health and wellness reported relatively flat comps, while improving significantly versus the prior quarter. The improvement was led by our prescription business, which lapped major generic launches last year and saw an increase in overall script count. Our over-the-counter business continued its positive trend, driven by a strong assortment in active nutrition and weight control.", "An area that I\u2019m particularly excited about is our diabetics offering. The team has worked diligently to provide high quality products for our customers in both over-the-counter and prescription, driving a double-digit comp in diabetics for the quarter.", "Hardlines, including seasonal, had a low single-digit negative comp. When average temperatures improved in the back half of the quarter, sales picked up significantly in sporting goods, which delivered a low single-digit comp. Sales in sporting goods partly offset softer sales in other weather related categories. In our stationery and crafts department, we overlapped the re-introduction of fabrics last year.", "Overall, we gained close to 60 basis points of market share in the stationery category for the three-month period ending in June, according to The NPD Group. The seasonal business also saw moderate sales growth during the quarter, driven by Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day and Fourth of July.", "Entertainment, including toys, posted a mid single-digit negative comp. Our performance was pressured by soft results in both electronics and media and gaming. Mid single-digit industry deflation and softer discretionary spending continued to be significant headwinds for these categories, while the anticipation of new video game consoles caused further delays in spending for gaming.", "Within electronics, we\u2019re disappointed at the performance of the TV category, as we lost market share for the 3 months ending June 30, according to NPD. Wireless again showed sales strength, gaining over 350 basis points in unit share over an already large base, allowing us to remain the number one handset retailer in unit share for the 3 months ending June 30, according to NPD.", "In toys, summer seasonal categories, including water toys and pools, improved consistently over the quarter. However, the progress was not enough to offset the declines we experienced earlier in the quarter when the weather was cooler. While warm-weather categories were challenged, the team delivered strong growth in bicycles and indoor categories.", "Apparel delivered a low single-digit positive comp, on top of a solid comp last year. I\u2019m really proud of the team. We\u2019ve raised the quality of our offering through improved fabrics and fit and introduced quality brands, driving traffic and sales.", "For the quarter, children\u2019s delivered a mid single-digit positive comp, driven by strong performance in active wear, shorts and knit tops. Men\u2019s posted a mid single-digit positive comp over a strong comp last year. The addition of brands like \u201cBen Hogan\u201d and \u201cAnd1\u201d is driving excitement and momentum in the men\u2019s department. Shoes and intimate apparel also reported strong growth. We expect the progress we\u2019ve made in our apparel business to continue through the second half of the year, as value, innovation and increased quality fuel results.", "Home also reported a low single-digit positive comp. Outdoor living had a slower start, but the business quickly picked up helping us deliver a high single-digit comp. The team was ready to capitalize on the warmer weather with new and expanded brands like Snapper mowers and Weber grills. I\u2019m also pleased with our progress in live plants.", "We\u2019re making great strides to ensure the freshness of our plants and our customers are noticing, evident by our double-digit positive comp during the second quarter. In indoor living, cooking and dining continued on its positive trend, driven by small electric appliances. Our bath and bedding category also improved consistently throughout the quarter, finishing the period with a low single-digit positive comp. Our relative success in the softlines business helped contribute to our favorable gross margin mix I spoke of earlier.", "The back-to-school season is well under way, and we\u2019re committed to helping customers save money in time for school this year. We\u2019ll have consistently low prices all season long, both online and in stores, helping parents and students shop however they want to shop. This year, we\u2019re carrying more than 250 different school supplies for less than $1 each. Our price gap on back-to-school supplies is evident when you read various news reports that name Walmart the price leader for the season.", "Now, let me now change gears and talk about the growth opportunity we have with our small formats. We continue to be excited about both the Neighborhood Markets and the Express stores, as we enter several new markets, optimize the assortment and improve the convenience.", "I\u2019m particularly pleased with the performance of Neighborhood Markets. We continue to roll out this format aggressively throughout the country, opening more sites in the second quarter than in any other quarter in our history. In fact, we opened 12 stores in just one day this quarter.", "The format continued on a solid trend of results, delivering more than 30 percent top line growth and consistent solid comp growth. Our comp growth was driven by strong traffic trends, as customers respond to our expanded assortment and focus on fresh foods, with produce, adult beverages and consumables setting the pace, and driving customers\u2019 intentions for return trips. What\u2019s also encouraging is that we\u2019re running these smaller stores the Walmart way, fueling the productivity loop, leveraging expenses and driving operating income growth in our comp stores.", "Our Express format also delivered strong results and continued to provide important insights into small format operations. During the quarter, stores opened more than a year achieved another quarter of strong double-digit comp sales growth.", "We continue to integrate our e-commerce platform with our stores to create a unique shopping experience. During the quarter, we launched the locker test for site-to-store in the Washington, D.C. area. While this test is still in the early stages, the initial read on customer satisfaction and acceptance is very encouraging, with 90 percent of the customers who have used the service providing positive feedback. On the mobile front, we continued testing our \u201cScan and Go\u201d pilot, improving the experience and expanding it to Android devices.", "You\u2019ve heard us talk about how our physical presence represents a significant competitive advantage for our walmart.com business. Last time we spoke, we announced the expansion of our Ship from Store program, and I\u2019m proud to say the momentum continued. A steadily increasing percentage of all items shipped to customers\u2019 homes are now fulfilled through the Ship from Store program. The majority of orders are delivered in two days or less and at a lower cost.", "In the second quarter, our real estate team added 49 net new units, or 4.1 million incremental square feet, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. The new units were composed of 29 supercenters and 35 small formats, most of which were Neighborhood Markets. Our growth over the first half of the year puts us at 7.7 million incremental square feet.", "In the third quarter, we\u2019re planning to open approximately 90 units, representing 7 million additional square feet. On Memorial Day, we launched the veterans initiative and received an impressive response from the veteran community. In a little over 2 months, we hired more than 3,200 new Walmart veteran associates and continue to process applications.", "Given the current economic environment, we expect our comps to be relatively flat in the coming quarter. We remain confident about the back half of the year, as we continue to execute on initiatives to drive our business, and in particular, our top line. The customer remains challenged, but I\u2019m confident in our position and in the ability of our teams to execute. Our strategy is sound, our pricing position is solid and our ability to leverage is strong, all of which bodes well as our comps continue to improve.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Doug for an International update. Doug", "Doug McMillon ", "Thanks Bill. Across our International markets, growth in consumer spending is under pressure. During the first half of the year, we saw consumers in both mature and emerging markets curb their spending, and we believe these trends will persist through the remainder of the year.", "While this creates a challenging sales environment, we are the best equipped retailer to address the needs of our customers and help them save money. We clearly have plenty of opportunities to drive further improvement going forward, though we have made improvements in some markets.", "We\u2019re focused on three key areas: First, as we focus on growth, we are delivering price leadership. We track the savings we offer customers on a basket of goods across our markets and invest where necessary to ensure value for them. We continue to move toward more of an EDLP approach across the entire division, because this is the most effective way to deliver value to our customers. Delivering on our core merchandising and pricing strengths is foundational.", "In addition to that foundation, we are expanding our capabilities to serve customers through e-commerce, home delivery and relevant store formats. Driving sales growth, regardless of the market environment, is a top priority.", "Second, we\u2019re focused on driving the productivity loop. The work we started over a year ago to transfer our best operational practices into several of our key markets is helping us. The softer than expected sales growth and wage inflation in some markets masked the improvements we\u2019ve made operationally, but I\u2019m thankful we\u2019ve made them, or our expense position would be more difficult. We need to continue down this path and improve sales to show the benefits more clearly.", "As Mike mentioned earlier, our leadership teams in International are collaborating with our Global Business Process team to improve productivity through a focus on process. I\u2019ll give you some specific examples in a few minutes that show you how we are getting stronger at the basics. It\u2019s obvious that we should spread our best operational practices to situations where it makes sense, and I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019re finally learning how to do that more effectively. I believe this is an important part of our future and, ultimately, a key lever for us to improve returns in this division.", "And third, we\u2019re focused on efficient use of capital. We\u2019re investing significant time and energy into our new store program to make sure that each approved project delivers against our forecast and that we use our capital dollars efficiently as the buildings are designed and constructed. We\u2019re finding new approaches to lighting and refrigeration, for example, that help us create stronger returns and reduce the impact on the environment. In addition, inventory management is a priority. I\u2019ll cover the numbers in just a second, but given our softness in sales, you\u2019ll see that many of our markets have reacted fairly well.", "Net sales grew 2.9 percent over last year to $33.0 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales were $33.4 billion, up 4.4 percent as currency exchange rates negatively impacted reported sales by $680 million in the quarter. Acquisitions added $216 million.", "Gross profit rate, on a reported basis, rose 29 basis points, and on a constant currency basis, increased 44 basis points. This was driven by rate improvements on a constant currency basis in Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Canada, the U.K., and Africa. We will cover some of the drivers of this change later in the country highlights.", "Operating income declined 1.3 percent on a reported basis and improved 40 basis points compared to last year on a constant currency basis. As Jeff mentioned, these results were impacted due to a charge for a certain non-income tax matter of $52 million on a reported basis. Without this charge, our operating income results for the quarter would have been up 2.2 percent on a reported basis and 3.9 percent on constant currency basis.", "As expected, operating expenses grew faster than sales. Expenses deleveraged by 40 basis points on a reported basis and 54 basis points on a constant currency basis. These results include the charge for a certain non-income tax matter mentioned previously. Without this charge, International operating expenses deleveraged by 24 basis points on a reported basis and by 38 basis points on a constant currency basis.", "While operating expenses grew, these results don\u2019t tell the whole story. The Asia region leveraged expenses during the quarter, along with Chile, Central America and Africa. Mexico also achieved substantial savings in key areas, but it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the weaker than expected sales.", "Like the first quarter, several factors contributed to us not leveraging expenses -- weaker sales, wage inflation, higher indirect taxes, and strategic investments, including e-commerce. In many of our International markets, labor laws and employment contracts mean it takes more time and is more complicated to introduce and implement productivity improvements that can help us adjust labor costs to sales trends. While our core expense story has improved, we expect third quarter expenses to be under pressure, also due to the same factors I just mentioned.", "We are working hard to leverage expenses in the back half of the year, and our Global Business Processes team is part of the answer to our expense challenge as we drive productivity in key markets. The China team\u2019s efforts resulted in productivity gains, enabling us to reduce store labor hours by 12.4 percent during the second quarter. Those improvements helped us offset wage growth of 11.2 percent over the same period, driven mainly by China\u2019s wage inflation.", "This, in a nutshell, serves as an example of what we have to get done across most of our markets. Beyond China, the Global On-Shelf Availability application is being rolled out in Mexico, improving in-stock and the ability to target and address issues with product availability for the customer. And finally, Brazil is rolling out best practices in fresh operations, ordering, and inventory flow to reduce throwaways and improve quality for the customer.", "We also are rolling out the workforce management system across many of our markets to better match work shift needs and personal schedules. Inventory grew 3.7 percent on a reported basis and 7.0 percent on a constant currency basis. And, on a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than sales in Brazil, Chile, China, Canada and India.", "Now, let\u2019s move on and discuss the results by market. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis and, unless otherwise stated, total sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal, calendar basis. In all of our countries except Brazil and China, our stores and e-commerce businesses are integrated and led by the same management teams. Therefore, our discussion of results is about the total operation. For Brazil and China, we will provide insights on the stores and e-commerce separately.", "In the U.K., we continued to grow both sales and operating income in the second quarter of the year. Net sales rose 1.6 percent, and sales excluding fuel, increased 1.1 percent. Operating income grew 7.5 percent, and we did not leverage operating expenses.", "Comparable sales declined by 0.4 percent, excluding fuel. Average comp traffic increased by 1.0 percent, but was offset by a decline in average ticket of 1.4 percent. Overall market share declined by 30 basis points for the 12 weeks ended July 7 according to the Kantar Worldpanel Total Till Roll.", "Our operating income performance in the U.K. this quarter was driven by three key themes: first, a significant price investment which is moderating comp growth; second, investment in and growth of convenient channels and formats; and third, cost savings delivered via the \u201cWe operate for less\u201d program to help offset some of the headwinds we\u2019re experiencing.", "The U.K. is an example of where we are leading with a core strength: investing in price on essential food items. The British consumer remains under pressure, with market inflation growing 2.8 percent, outpacing wage growth of 0.9 percent. Market product inflation is up, but our Asda basket is below market inflation. In addition, the UK is a market with unique competitive vouchering activity.", "Some of our competition provides a voucher for a discount on a future purchase. During the quarter, according to Kantar Worldpanel, the grocery market grew by 3.5 percent -- driven by inflation of 3.9 percent, meaning grocery volume declined in the market.", "Our price investment in key food essentials continued, especially in fresh produce, a key traffic driver. As a result, we grew market share in this category. The result was lower inflation across the overall basket for our customers. We continue to drive the \u201cwe operate for less\u201d program, achieving savings within both operating expenses and cost of goods sold.", "Our improvement of 67 basis points in gross profit rate helped operating income grow faster than sales despite the continued price investment and inflationary pressures in areas such as property taxes, insurance and energy. Our gross profit rate in Asda improved largely because we didn\u2019t repeat promotional activity from last year\u2019s Queen\u2019s jubilee event and the Olympic Games.", "Our Asda online grocery business is well developed and remains a model for us to leverage into other markets. Online sales, which are included in our net sales and comps, were strong in the quarter, growing over 16 percent. We continue to deliver an increasingly convenient, multichannel shopping experience for customers. In the second quarter, our first \u201cDrive Through Click & Collect\u201d site opened in York.", "We also connected our smart phone app to stores through a new shopping list feature that can search for products using voice recognition or barcode scanning technology. In addition, given the shift in online traffic from desktop to mobile, we\u2019re the first major U.K. retailer to launch a dedicated tablet website for non-food business.", "The quarter rounded off with some great awards showcasing our continued commitment to EDLP. Asda was recognized by The Grocer magazine in June, when we were named \u201cBritain\u2019s Lowest Priced Supermarket\u201d for the sixteenth year running and \u201cBritain\u2019s Favourite Supermarket\u201d for the third year in a row.", "Asda continues to make a difference in our local communities. During the quarter, we launched a market leading supply chain initiative delivering the equivalent of 3.5 million meals to local charities across the U.K. We partnered with the charity FareShare and more than 300 chilled food suppliers. This initiative alone will save more than 900 local charities 4.7 million British pounds, or $7.1 million, per year.", "As we look at Canada, we were challenged by unseasonably cooler weather that continued from the previous quarter, as well as flooding in Alberta. Despite these challenges, net sales grew 6.2 percent, supported by new store growth and expansion of existing stores. Operating income grew slower than sales at 2.3 percent as we invested in new stores and e-commerce.", "Comparable sales declined by 0.4 percent, with comp ticket up 0.2 percent and comp traffic declining 0.6 percent. We had strong comp sales in food, consumables and apparel, but continued to see softer sales in entertainment as industry-specific challenges persist. The colder weather negatively impacted sales in hardlines.", "On the positive side, we drove market share gains by investing in price on the items that matter most. In The Nielsen Company measured categories of food and consumables, Walmart Canada gained 110 basis points of share. We also drove a further 60 basis points in health and wellness.", "Gross profit rate increased 29 basis points due, in part, to cost savings from increased direct importing. Operating expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to negative comp store sales and costs related to year-over-year growth in our new store base, including the 39 Zellers stores we acquired last year. However, through EDLC initiatives, Walmart Canada has been able to offset some of the expense growth with various productivity initiatives.", "During the quarter, we opened one new supercentre, expanded four stores to supercentres and relocated one store. This includes our first supercentre in Atlantic Canada and provided us with a truly nationwide presence for our supercentre program.", "We responded to the floods in southern Alberta and the devastating explosion in Quebec through fundraising campaigns in partnership with the Red Cross. Cash and in-kind donations to support these victims exceeded $900,000.", "Turning to Africa, as you know, Massmart is a publicly-held company in South Africa and announces their results every six months. Massmart\u2019s next earnings release is August 22nd. For the 26 weeks ended June 23rd, net sales increased by 8.9 percent, and comp store sales increased by 5.5 percent. We remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us within Africa, and we\u2019re working to position ourselves for success in the future.", "Now, let\u2019s cover Latin America. As a reminder, the following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported its earnings on July 25th, under IFRS, so some numbers are different from the Walmex-reported numbers.", "Walmex results were solid in Central America, but growth slowed in Mexico, and this impacted overall performance. For the quarter, net sales grew 3.2 percent. Gross profit rate increased by 58 basis points versus last year, driven by increases in both Mexico and Central America.", "In Central America, the gross margin improvement was driven by both EDLC and EDLP execution and better inventory management made possible by the recent integration of Walmart systems. Operating expenses grew faster than sales in Walmex. Operating income for the quarter grew 4.2 percent, faster than sales, primarily due to strong gross profit margins.", "For the second quarter, Mexico\u2019s sales increased 3.1 percent over last year and comparable store sales decreased 1.6 percent, as they were negatively impacted by the Easter flip. Self-service and Sam\u2019s Club second quarter comparable growth was negative 1.8 percent, which is similar to ANTAD\u2019s comparable store sales reported for the rest of the industry at negative 1.6 percent excluding Walmex. Average comp ticket increased 1.4 percent, and comp traffic decreased 3.0 percent over last year. Traffic was impacted by the Easter calendar shift and a general market slowdown in consumption.", "In Mexico, gross margin was up 19 basis points. However, operating expenses grew faster than sales. As I mentioned earlier, we improved expense management, but it wasn\u2019t quite enough to offset the sales miss. Wages and utilities remain headwinds. Operating income decreased 0.7 percent, below our expectations. We are working hard to bring expenses more in line with sales.", "Central America increased net sales from the previous year by 4.2 percent. Comparable store sales decreased 0.1 percent. Gross profit rate increased 2.8 percent versus last year, as a result of better merchandising and EDLP execution. The transition to EDLP in our Central American countries is complete, and these results reflect the opportunity for growth through that strategy. Expenses grew slower than sales. Operating income increased 246 percent.", "Moving on to Brazil \u2026 second quarter net sales in Brazil grew 2.8 percent from last year, with comparable sales up 1.1 percent. Average ticket grew 6.6 percent, and comp traffic declined 5.5 percent when compared to last year. Sales were impacted by the Easter flip, a holiday which represents one of the biggest seasons for food sales in Brazil. Despite this impact, the retail formats showed positive comps, with good performance in consumables, food and perishables. Our results in the wholesale formats were below expectations.", "Gross profit rate increased 50 basis points, but we did not leverage operating expenses due in part to the lower comp sales growth and wage inflation. Operating expenses grew faster than sales during the quarter. The net effect of the sales shortfall and our expense performance was an operating loss for the quarter. We continue to focus on the productivity loop in order to invest savings back into price to further drive sales. Brazil is now taking steps to align expenses more closely to the volume of sales.", "We\u2019re pleased with the growth of e-commerce sales in Brazil. In fact, we grew from the #8 most visited site last October to the #1 spot now, according to comScore. Customers have responded well to the enhancements on the site, and sales are up more than 50 percent versus last year. 25", "Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile is also a publicly held company and will release second quarter earnings on August 30th. Earlier this year, we completed a merchandise training program in Chile focused on modular and buying strategies.", "Since that training, we have reduced the number of modular changes by 40 percent and reduced the number of price labels by 20 percent, while still maintaining strong price impression. This program is saving labor hours at the store level, but more importantly, it\u2019s improving trust with the customer through a more consistent set of modulars. This is another good example of where global experience can benefit a local market.", "Moving to Asia, in the second quarter, without the acquisition of Yihaodian, Walmart China\u2019 s net sales grew 6.3 percent over last year and comparable store sales growth was 2.5 percent. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, customers continue to shift from traditional daily shopping to larger consolidated shopping trips. Average comp ticket grew 9.3 percent in China, while traffic declined 6.8 percent.", "Our EDLP journey in China continues to move forward. We\u2019re building trust with the Chinese customer through our \u201cworry free\u201d program. Worry free pricing was launched last fall and continues to gain traction. The team in China continues to improve operations by focusing on optimizing the buying organization, investing in logistics and food safety and simplifying the supply chain. Gross profit rate declined 56 basis points compared to last year. We leveraged operating expenses despite wage inflation.", "As I mentioned earlier, Walmart China reduced store labor hours through various productivity initiatives and improved scheduling. Last year, we discussed our decision to moderate our growth in China and focus more on our store opening process and opening stores in more productive locations, an example of our commitment to simplifying and prioritizing.", "Our team in China is making progress with the customer and as a retail operator. I\u2019m really encouraged by the recent results in China and thankful for the strong leadership we\u2019re seeing from Greg Foran, Sean Clarke and the rest of the leadership team.", "And, a final comment on e-commerce in China. We\u2019re pleased with the acquisition of Yihaodian, with sales continuing to grow well in the double digits. The site continues to be one of the fastest-growing e-commerce businesses in the country.", "In Japan, consumer spending continued to be soft during the quarter. Walmart Japan\u2019s net sales growth remained flat and comp sales decreased 0.6 percent. During the quarter, we posted our first positive monthly comp since May of 2012. Our stores continue to create a better price impression for customers as they are shopping.", "Second quarter comp traffic decreased 1.1 percent, and average ticket increased 0.5 percent. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, overall supermarket comparable sales for the second quarter declined 1.3 percent from last year, so we outperformed the market.", "Gross profit rate in Japan decreased 13 basis points, due to our investment in lower prices. Compared to last year, Walmart Japan had higher operating income and increased operating margin 13 basis points. Walmart Japan also leveraged operating expenses versus last year due to tight cost control efforts.", "In Japan, we continue to leverage Walmart\u2019s global scale to improve customer assortment and deliver better value to our customers. Examples are beef imported from the United States, and cherries, wine and beer from the U.K., and we had great results from introducing \u201cGolden Ale\u201d beer in Japan. In just one month, it became Japan\u2019s second best-selling beer in the 500 ml beer category and the most profitable in the entire beer category.", "As you are aware, we have a significant effort and investment under way to enhance compliance. We\u2019re committed to compliance and integrity everywhere we operate. These investments are building a stronger, better Walmart for our customers, our associates and communities, and will provide a more solid foundation for future growth.", "Although I only mentioned a couple of examples today, we remain committed globally to improving the communities where we live and operate. In addition to responding to disasters and helping those in need, other programs create a better Walmart and a better shopping experience for our customers -- like developing local farmers and supporting the growth of women-owned businesses.", "We appreciate all the hard work of our international associates. The third quarter is well under way for our markets. In a global macroeconomic environment where the rate of growth is less than expected, we are well positioned to meet the needs of our consumers through our EDLC-EDLP approach. EDLP improves our ability to deliver against our purpose and better serve our customers who count on us to meet their family\u2019s needs.", "We expect the third and fourth quarters to be better than our results in the first half, and we\u2019re working hard to deliver operating expense leverage for Walmart International. Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Roz for a look at our Sam\u2019s U.S. business. Roz?", "Rosalind Brewer ", "Thanks Doug. Before I start, I\u2019d like to compliment both our management teams and our Sam\u2019s Club associates. They are so energized by the changes taking place in our clubs and remain aligned on driving member value through price leadership, differentiated merchandise and a compelling experience. We still have work to do, but I\u2019m pleased to report that Q2 comp sales were within our guidance, and traffic improved. We are delivering solid membership income growth, and our recent membership enhancements, including the Instant Savings Book (ISB), continue to receive a favorable response.", "Let me take a moment to provide more background on our Instant Savings program, now a cornerstone of Sam\u2019s Club membership. In fact, we have renamed our Advantage members to Savings members because of our mission to deliver savings made simple for all of our members.", "The second quarter marked the launch of our Instant Savings program. Members received two Instant Savings Books during the quarter. Each book runs for about three weeks and includes special savings from our top suppliers beyond our normal member-only prices.", "We were pleased to see over half of the members who shopped during the events purchased at least one Instant Savings Book item. The book not only drove traffic to our clubs, but also broader awareness of our extensive merchandise offering available at samsclub.com. For example, during the first few days of the May event, we sold more of the office chairs online included in the ISB than we had year-to-date!", "We believe that the investment we\u2019re making in price, both through core reductions and programs like Instant Savings, are key to sales growth, and this strategy will continue throughout the year.", "Now back to the results. Sam\u2019s Club generated a comp of 1.7 percent, without fuel, for the 13-week retail sales period. Our investment in the ISB program decreased our overall average selling price, resulting in a comp ticket decline of 1.0 percent. This was countered by comp traffic growth of 2.7 percent, driven by positive traffic for both our Savings and business members. We were pleased with our improvement in business member traffic, reversing the first quarter\u2019s decrease in business member traffic.", "Small business owners report through our monthly Small Business Owner study, that they are more optimistic about the upcoming months and perceive that the current economic climate is gradually improving. We believe their businesses are beginning to show signs of recovery, as evidenced by the improved traffic trends. As part of our commitment to this portion of our member base, Sam\u2019s Club recently launched the 25-city \u201cGrow Your Business Boot Camp\u201d series. It\u2019s a program that allows leaders at Sam\u2019s to support small business owners and entrepreneurs in their local communities.", "Now on to our core financial news \u2026 Net sales, including fuel, were $14.5 billion, up 2.6 percent over last year. Fuel prices increased 1.6 percent compared to last year and gallons sold were up 2.6 percent, thus creating a boost to overall sales of 22 basis points. Sam\u2019s gross profit rate declined by 15 basis points, and we leveraged expenses, improving operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 3 basis points. Operating income increased 3 percent to $551 million.", "Our goal remains to grow inventory at half the rate of sales, and we are pleased at the progress compared to the first quarter. At the end of the second quarter, inventory, including fuel, was up just 2 percent.", "Volatility in fuel prices can influence our financial results, especially profitability. Therefore, the remainder of our discussion today is focused on our core business, excluding fuel for comparative purposes.", "Net sales for the quarter were $12.8 billion, up 2.4 percent from last year. All geographic divisions had positive comps. Inflation, excluding fuel, was about 30 basis points. Inflation in fresh meat and dairy was coupled with continued deflation in electronics. Last year, retail inflation was between 175 and 225 basis points, primarily in food.", "Fresh posted a low single-digit comp, driven by strength in breads and produce. Lingering effects of unseasonably cold weather affected produce availability in some of our key summer fruit items, such as strawberries and watermelons.", "We overcame this headwind with exceptional quality in other seasonal produce items such as blueberries and apples, resulting in a mid single-digit produce comp. Unit sales of fresh meat remain strong; however, we have seen some trade-down from steaks to lower price point items, such as chicken and pork. \u201cBetter for you\u201d items continue to resonate with our members who are searching for healthier options.", "Our grocery and beverage category generated a low single-digit comp. Members responded positively to our dry grocery Instant Savings Book items. However, the growth was not enough to offset seasonal softness in beverages, as Q2 this year was cooler than last year. We continue to execute our strategy of bringing newness and differentiation to these categories, particularly in areas such as craft beers.", "Our efforts to reach families with babies continued to pay off, with market share gains in the baby category for the 13-week period ending July 6, 2013, according to Nielsen. Additionally, the ISB events contributed to the growth in consumables, resulting in a low single-digit comp for the quarter.", "Technology and entertainment posted a low single-digit negative comp. Positive Instant Savings Book event performance and continued strength in wireless was tempered by softness in the overall consumer electronics market, as shoppers continue to shift spending from TVs and laptops to mobile devices.", "In home and apparel, we were pleased that sales rebounded from the prior quarter, delivering a high single-digit comp in Q2. As the weather warmed, our offerings in apparel and seasonal categories resonated with members and generated low double-digit comps and mid single-digits, respectively. Home continues to be strong, as price leadership in domestics drove double-digit comp and unit growth.", "Health and wellness, including pharmacy, reported a mid single-digit comp, propelled by sustained strength in the over-the-counter products and growth in optical. During Q2, we lapped the branded-to-generic status change of several popular prescriptions, which should serve as a tailwind to pharmacy sales during the back half of the year.", "Tobacco sales growth was essentially flat. A nationwide price increase in June drove business members to accelerate tobacco purchases, providing a moderate benefit to the beginning of the quarter.", "Sam\u2019s Club online business continues to grow, driven by solid traffic and improved conversion rates. Merchandise strength came from outdoor living, portable electronics, baby care, and mattresses that offset some of the general softness in other electronics categories. Recently, the team has made enhancements to our mobile app, helping to increase the number of mobile orders, compared to the prior quarter.", "Now, let\u2019s continue with the results. Gross profit rate grew 6 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined by 2 basis points.", "Membership and other income grew 9.2 percent. On May 15, we took our first nationwide membership fee increase in 6 years. During the quarter, net membership income increased 4 percent. Our primary base continues to grow year-over-year, driven by Savings member sign-ups. Plus sign-ups and upgrades also showed strength, partially offset by softness in business member sign-ups. Remember, we recognize the full benefit of the fee increase over the 12-month membership period.", "Looking at the bottom line, our second quarter operating income grew to $552 million, a substantial increase of 8 percent over last year. As I mentioned earlier, the level of engagement among our club associates is very strong. In our annual engagement survey conducted this past spring, Sam\u2019s Club associate engagement scores rose 600 basis points over last year, with gains in each geographic division across the country. Over the past quarter, I\u2019ve visited several recently remodeled clubs. I\u2019ve been pleased with the disciplined progress the team has made to increase the consistency of our remodels.", "Next quarter, we will open 13 new and relocated clubs, the greatest number of clubs opened during one quarter within the past several years. The team is ready to continue growing the Sam\u2019s footprint, serving even more members in more communities.", "Last quarter, I mentioned that you will begin to see a change in our merchandise strategy. We\u2019ve begun this transformation, specifically in areas such as home and apparel. Our members look to us for great values on the best quality items, and we will continue working hard to deliver, striving to be a house of brands for our members. This transformation will continue, especially as we enter the holiday season.", "I\u2019m excited to invite you to our upcoming VIP event. Please join me, on August 18, as we open our doors exclusively to Plus members, appreciating them with exceptional values on an array of back-to-school items and unique, one-time buys. VIP events such as these are just one of the ways we have worked to strengthen our value proposition for Plus members. We will continue to stress seasonal offerings throughout the third quarter.", "We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from July 27 to October 25 to range between flat and 2 percent. Last year\u2019s comp, without fuel, for the period was 2.7 percent.", "The core business at Sam\u2019s Club is strong. I\u2019m confident that the things we\u2019re doing today to strengthen our value proposition will benefit Sam\u2019s over the long term. Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Neil for e-commerce. Neil?", "Neil Ashe ", "Thanks Roz. In eCommerce, we\u2019ve continued to deliver key capabilities, and we are growing sales, including acquisitions, at over 30 percent globally. Bill, Roz and Doug touched on some of the accomplishments from around the world, and I\u2019ll put those in the context of our overall eCommerce strategies.", "As a reminder, the four strategies we are executing are: Excelling in the fundamentals of e-commerce; innovating in new areas like big data, social and mobile; we\u2019re growing in key markets, namely the U.S., U.K., Brazil and China; and we\u2019re providing the tie to unite and expand the Walmart customer experience to do what no one else can do.", "We\u2019re building best-in-class e-commerce capabilities, and only we can combine those with the assets of the world\u2019s largest retailer. The result is a new approach to commerce that lets customers shop when, where and how they want across online, mobile and stores. To support the strategies, we\u2019re investing in three key areas: further developing our global technology platform; growing services and capabilities in our four key markets; and developing our next-generation fulfillment network that integrates dedicated online assets with Walmart\u2019s transportation fleet, distribution centers and stores.", "Before I jump into each of these, let me cover our progress in building talent density. We\u2019ve continued to bring on great people organically and through acquisitions. During the second quarter, we had a hiring blitz which ramped up our visibility in the Bay area and added nearly 200 associates. We saw an offer acceptance rate well over 90 percent. People in Silicon Valley are excited to come to Walmart.", "We also closed four acquisitions -- Tasty Labs, OneOps, Inkiru and Torbit. They brought us some proven innovators in Silicon Valley, and technical capabilities and expertise to contribute to the development of our global technology platform. We continue to develop and release elements of our technology platform, like search and the walmart.com home page. We\u2019re pleased with the progress to date and excited the experience for our customers is already improving as a result.", "The platform is also at the core of expanding our product assortment, especially in the U.S. We doubled the number of products on walmart.com in the first half of the year through our own inventory and through new marketplace sellers. We expect to double it again in the second half of the fiscal year.", "On the fulfillment front, we are optimizing how we use online fulfillment centers in conjunction with Walmart\u2019s shipping network, DCs and stores. Bill touched on how we are activating supercenters as part of our work to deliver a better customer experience, and we\u2019re seeing great results on that front. We are now using 35 stores as additional nodes in our online fulfillment network.", "As Bill mentioned, those stores now handle a double-digit percentage of walmart.com orders, and the majority of those are delivered in two days or less at a significantly lower cost. As you know, the Pick Up Today option gives customers the ability to buy an item online and pick it up in a store that same day.", "We have more than tripled the items available for Pick Up Today since the beginning of the year. And, we have developed a new capability that automatically searches our broader inventory for an item if that item isn\u2019t available in a customer\u2019s primary store. That has significantly improved our fill rate.", "We\u2019ve also talked about our plans to test lockers as another option for customers picking up online orders in stores. The test is successful so far, showing 90 percent customer satisfaction ratings.", "On the grocery delivery front, Asda is a leader in online grocery delivery, and we\u2019ve leveraged that experience in the U.S. pilot program. In the San Francisco/San Jose test, we\u2019ve proven we can successfully use a supercenter for online grocery delivery, and we\u2019re getting high marks from customers. Many of these are new customers. 75 percent of the customers say they would have purchased through another retailer other than Walmart. And, 83 percent would recommend Walmart grocery delivery.", "Roz talked about the e-commerce growth at Sam\u2019s Club, and we\u2019ve been working together to enhance the customer experience across online, mobile and clubs. We built a new mobile app for Sam\u2019s Club that helped increase the average basket by almost 25 percent over the last quarter. We also made enhancements on the mobile site that helped double the number of orders from the last quarter.", "As Doug discussed, we had several global successes as well. Continuing on the mobile theme, we\u2019re making great progress in China. Yihaodian saw 10 times growth in mobile sales in the first half over last year and won a Cannes Media Lions award for its boundless Yihaodian 2.0 app. Yihaodian overall continues to grow quickly. We are pleased that we have more than doubled the number of active site users in the past year, meaning those customers who made at least one purchase in the last 12 months.", "In the U.K., we just completed a major relaunch of the Asda site. In addition to a new experience, we made some foundational changes that allow us to enhance the site much more quickly and easily. Major redesigns like this one take a bit of time for customers to get used to the enhancements, so we\u2019re pleased to see initial site satisfaction is up 9 percent versus the previous site.", "Finally, we are excited about the opportunity we have in Brazil and the world-class leadership team we\u2019ve built there. During the quarter, we made several site enhancements to walmart.com.br, including streamlined navigation and check-out flow. We are the largest traffic consumer e-commerce site in Brazil and our revenue growth \u2013 led by electronics and appliances \u2013 is more than double the rate of the total Brazilian e-commerce market according to eMarketer. And, we were recognized by eBit as the top e-commerce site over 4,000 other sites.", "To wrap up \u2026 we are making great progress on our core strategies. We are continuing to invest for the long-term and are building the talent base, the technology platform and the fulfillment networks we need to serve customers around the globe seamlessly across online, mobile and stores in a way that only Walmart can.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Charles for the close. Charles?", "Charles Holley ", "Thanks Neil. Normally on our earnings call, I begin by talking about growth, leverage and returns and then conclude with our guidance. Today, I\u2019d like to start by providing our expectations for sales and earnings for the third quarter and the full year.", "Economic conditions in many of our markets around the world remain difficult. The U.S. retail environment remains challenging, with virtually no inflation in food and the higher payroll tax instituted earlier in the year. High fuel prices can impact spending as well. Our expectations for the back half of the year are through a lens of cautious consumer spending.", "Our mission to save people money so they can live better remains critical to customers and to our ability to drive stronger sales. Our plans are aggressive. We are going after sales and investing in price. And, we continue to focus on leveraging expenses. As Mike said, we are taking steps to increase our leverage potential for the full year.", "We are revising our consolidated net sales growth to range between 2 and 3 percent for the full year, versus our previous range of 5 to 6 percent. This revision reflects softer sales performance in the first half and our view of current global business trends, including a challenging retail environment, and significant ongoing headwinds from anticipated currency rate fluctuations. In fact, approximately one-third of the net sales revision is due to currency impact.", "We believe expenses for FCPA matters and for the work on enhancing our compliance program will be higher than originally anticipated for the rest of the year. Year to date, we have spent approximately $155 million. We\u2019re forecasting the run rate for the combined work on the compliance programs and the ongoing investigations to be between $75 and $80 million each in the third and fourth quarters.", "E-commerce is important to our customers and our company\u2019s future. Our forecasts also take into account that we will continue to invest in technology, talent and infrastructure, including fulfillment centers. Year to date, the incremental impact from e-commerce investments is approximately $0.05 per share. We anticipate the incremental impact to third quarter earnings per share will be about $0.02 per share.", "Taking all of these factors into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 to range between $1.11 and $1.16. This compares to $1.08 per share last year.", "For the full year, we are updating our prior earnings per share guidance to $5.10 and $5.30 per share. This guidance takes into account the challenging sales and operating environments. As we\u2019ve seen in the past, discrete tax items have had a meaningful impact on our effective tax rate and on our reported results in the back half of our fiscal years. We anticipate that a wider range of between 31 and 33 percent is now possible for our full year effective tax rate versus our previous range of 32 to 33 percent.", "What isn\u2019t changing is our continued focus on Walmart\u2019s financial priorities -- growth, leverage and returns. The company\u2019s growth during the second quarter included 98 net new stores and clubs, comprising 5.9 million new square feet of selling space.", "Now, let\u2019s talk about leverage. We told you during the first quarter call that achieving operating expense leverage during the second quarter would be challenging \u2013 and that proved to be true. The productivity loop is top of mind across the organization, and we remain focused on delivering leverage for the company by year-end.", "Long-term strategic investments by our leverage services area pressured operating expense leverage during the past quarter, but we believe the benefits of these investments to our customers and shareholders outweigh the near-term impact on expenses. Earlier, Mike covered a few examples of our leverage progress.", "We are piloting new programs in logistics to lower the cost of delivery and improve profitability for e-commerce orders. The modular excellence program for Walmart U.S. is helping to maximize holding power for key items in food and consumables. Modular planning processes created by the Global Business Processes team are helping to reduce labor hours in China and Brazil while improving associate productivity.", "Moving on to returns, we feel good about our earnings per share growth, especially in light of the retail environment. The company returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. We also generated solid cash flows from operations, and our free cash flow is now at $5.2 billion for the year. The company continues to deliver strong, consistent returns to shareholders.", "As I wrap-up the call today, let me leave you with a few key takeaways. First, we know we have to improve the top line. With our expense leverage, stronger sales will flow through our results. Second, our updated guidance reflects the current view of the business and difficult retail environment, but also considers the significant impact from currency, along with the ongoing investments in leverage, e-commerce and compliance initiatives. And, last, we continue to build on our long history of returning value to our shareholders.", "Thank you for your support and interest in our company.

Therefore, week 53 of this fiscal year will be compared to week 1 of the same current fiscal year 2014. Our fiscal 2014 Q4 reporting period began on October 26 and runs through January 31, 2014. This compares to the 14-week period last year from October 27, 2013 through February 1, 2013.

We have a lot to cover today. Mike will start us off. Mike?", "", "Mike Duke", "Thanks, Carol and good morning everyone. Today, I am pleased to report a 6.5% increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14 for the third quarter. Walmart delivered solid earnings growth that was also within our guidance range. Our most important priority is growing top line sales, including comps by providing quality merchandise at great prices to customers around the world. The retail environment, both in stores and online, remains competitive. At the same time, some customers feel uncertainty about the economy, government, job stability and their need to take care of their families through the holidays.", "Walmart has aggressive plans to help our customers enjoy the holiday season and find fantastic gifts for the loved ones while maximizing their budgets at the same time. There is no doubt that we plan to win for our customers and shareholders throughout the holidays. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at how our business performed in the third quarter. Consolidated net sales impacted significantly by currency were below expectations. However we had strong operating income across our segments, Walmart U.S. grew operating income almost 6%, Sam\u2019s Club was up more than 9% and International delivered an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis. Consolidated operating income was $6.3 billion, an increase of 3.6%. Walmart U.S. grew net sales 2.4% to nearly $68 billion in the third quarter. Comp sales declined 0.3% in the 13 week period ended October 25. Traffic continued to improve from the first half of the year and we gained market share again in some of our most important categories. Our neighborhood markets produced comp sales in-line with best in-class competitors. We\u2019re on pace to increase this small format fleet by almost 50% this year. And as you heard in our October Analyst Meeting we\u2019re utilizing our small formats to develop the market eco-system that is a critical part of our long term growth strategy. Bill\u2019s team continues to invest in price to drive sales utilizing savings from our supply chain, logistics and operational efficiencies to help fund these investments. We kicked off the holiday season already starting with some Walmart.com early bird specials on November 1st. We\u2019re excited about some incredible merchandise opportunities for Black Friday.", "Sam\u2019s Club comp sales without increased 1.1% for the 13 week period. Traffic increased for both business and savings members this quarter. Ross team had one of our strongest grand opening quarters in years with 13 clubs added this quarter. These clubs are well ahead of plan, an example of our greater discipline and focus on delivering higher capital returns. Like Walmart U.S. Sam\u2019s is well positioned for the holiday\u2019s and will offer members tremendous value during two instant savings books. Walmart\u2019s International\u2019s constant currency net sales were up 4.1%, operating income on a constant currency basis increased at nearly twice the rate of sales. Doug\u2019s team is progressing on lowering expenses to rate that\u2019s more in-line with sales and is improving our inventory performance. As you know last month we announced decisions to streamline our international business by actively managing our portfolio and being the best in class operator. International continues to be an important growth engine for Walmart and we will add stores that will position us better in the future for stronger returns. Global e-commerce continues to deliver impressive sales results, including sales from Yihaodian acquired last year, third quarter sales grew nearly 40%. We\u2019re investing in fulfillment centers like the facility recently opened in Fort Worth, Texas to be closer to our customers and to expedite the delivery of their merchandize and we\u2019re accelerating the integration of e-commerce with our business segments. I\u2019m really excited about the fantastic growth opportunities that lie ahead of us as Walmart serves millions of additional customers through our e-commerce sites in 10 countries. Throughout the company we constantly focus on effectively managing our cost so we can provide the low prices that our customers count on.", "During the third quarter we continue to make progress with expense leverage. On a consolidated basis we improved expense leverage 22 basis points from the second quarter. Walmart U.S. delivered strong expense leverage in the third quarter and international made progress in expense management. By taking advantage of opportunities in area such as technology, logistics, sourcing and workforce planning. We have reinforced our long term commitment to leverage on an annual basis. As you all know our five year goal is to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of sales by at least 100 basis points by 2017 and we are committed to that note. Today, one of the success areas that I am most proud of is our work on capital discipline. We have really made great strides. Our renewed focus on the productivity of our stores around the world is producing meaningful results. We are bringing down the cost to build, expand and remodel and we are able to open source more throughput. In fact, over the past two years, the cost per square foot for new construction of both super centers and small formats in the United States has come down by over 15%. And when I was in China last month, I saw firsthand, our great store layouts can dramatically improve customer experience and new store openings performance. Clearly, this type of capital discipline is critical to the future growth of this important market.", "Compliance is in the central part of our growth strategy. In the third quarter, we continue to invest in strengthening Walmart\u2019s compliance organization through enhanced processes and procedures, increased associate training and improved organizational leadership, we have become an even better company. Our progress with compliance makes us a stronger business for the long-term. Walmart has tremendous associates. They are passionate about serving our customers and we appreciate everything they are doing throughout this very busy fourth quarter. When I visit our stores in the U.S. and around the world, like I did recently in China, associates often tell me about their opportunities for building a career and expanding their skills. I love these testimonials.", "We want to see our talented and dedicated associates advanced to positions of greater leadership within the company. In fact, Walmart U.S. will promote more than 160,000 associates to jobs with higher pay and more responsibility this year. We are also pleased with the progress we made in our veterans initiative since Memorial Day when we kicked off this program Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club have now hired more than 20,000 U.S. veterans to our associate teams. As I close my remarks let me reiterate that Walmart is geared up for the holidays. We are focused on delivering a strong fourth quarter performance. We have the merchandise that customers want online and in the stores all at great prices. And our associates are energized to serve our customers and grow sales.", "On behalf of everyone at Walmart I wish you happy holidays, Merry Christmas and a great New Year. I hope to see you shopping in our stores and on Walmart.com in the weeks ahead.", "Now, I will turn it over to Jeff for more financial details. Jeff?", "", "Jeff Davis", "Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart $1.14. This was within our guidance of $1.11 to $1.16. This compares $1.07 last year and reflects a $0.01 per share from the VIPS restaurant business in Mexico. You should note that we reflected the operating results of VIPS as discontinued operations in our financial statements for the current and prior periods. The VIPS sale is subject to regulatory approval, but we expect it to be completed by year end. As you recall, our plan was to invest an incremental $0.09 per share in e-commerce for fiscal 2014. In Q3, we invested $0.03 per share bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $0.08 per share. However, we now expect the fiscal 2014 incremental impact to be approximately $0.10 per share.", "Now, let\u2019s turn our attention to the detailed financial results for the quarter. Consolidated net sales increased 1.6% or $1.8 billion to $114.9 billion. Net sales were impacted by approximately $1.6 billion from currency exchange rate fluctuations and we benefited $314 million from acquisitions. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 2.7% to $116.2 billion. The membership and other income increased 12.3% to $800 million primarily driven by a solid 8.1% increase in membership income at Sam\u2019s Club. Therefore coupled with net sales total revenue was $115.7 billion a 1.7% increase over last year.", "Our growth profit rates for Q3 was 24.5% an increase of 13 basis points compared to last year. The increase was primarily driven by Sam\u2019s Club and Walmart U.S. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 19.8% an increase of eight basis points compared to last year. However this represents a 22 basis point improvement from last quarter, we appreciate our teams across the globe for their collective hard work to reduce expenses. As we do every quarter we will review corporate and support expenses which increased 21.2% and are comprised of three areas. Core corporate, global e-commerce support and global leverage services. Core corporate expenses increased 15.1%, FCPA and compliance related expenses were approximately $69 million which is below our guidance of $75 million to $80 million. Approximately $43 million of these expenses represent a cost incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations. Approximately $26 million is related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements excluding these FCPA and compliance matters core corporate expenses would have increased approximately 10.4% are primarily due to the timing of charitable giving.", "Remaining areas, global levered services and global e-commerce support selective increased approximately 31.9% for the quarter. As a reminder global levered services includes investments for technology. We continue to invest in the global roll-out of our SAP enterprise systems across our finance, people and merchandising organizations. A little later you will hear more from Charles regarding our global e-commerce investments. This leaves us the consolidated operating income which grew 3.6% to $6.3 billion. On a constant currency basis consolidated operating income was up 5% to $6.4 billion. It is important to note that all three business segments through operating income at a faster rate than sales.", "Net interest expenses was up 6.2% to $580 million. Though interest expense increased slightly, interest income declined $32 million primarily attributable to the reclassification of certain international accounts payable discounts to cost of sales. That brings us to income from continuing operations attributable to the Walmart of $3.7 billion, an increase of 2.8% over the last year.", "Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 32.5% and Charles will cover our tax guidance for the year. Turning to our balance sheet, consolidated inventory increased 4.6% from primarily driven by increases within our U.S. operating segments to support our upcoming holiday plans.", "Payables as a percentage of inventory was 79% which compares to 85% last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of payments and higher inventory balances. Debt to total capitalization was 45.7% at the end of the quarter compared to 43.7% last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher short term debt balances and a slight reduction to shareholders equity.", "The reduction in equity is principally related to foreign currency translation losses and a fair value adjustment to redeemable non-controlling interest on our balance sheet. During September certain minority interest shareholders in Chile exercised their irrevocable put options to Walmart whereby Walmart\u2019s ownership of Walmart Chile will increase from approximately 75% to approximately 97%. As result of the exercise a redeemable non-controlling interest was mark-to-market on the balance sheet in the third quarter with a corresponding offset to capital in excess of par value. We expect this transaction should be completed in early calendar 2014. Free cash flow was $3.8 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2013 compared to $7 billion last year. Timing of payments associated with taxes and payables as well higher capital expenditures were the primary drivers of the reduction.", "As Mike and Charles affirmed during the Investor Meeting last month, we have a financial priority to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In Q3, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately 23 million shares of approximately $1.7 billion. This leaves approximately $12.2 billion remaining under our $15 million share repurchase authorization announced in June 2013. Return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2013 was 17.5% compared to 18% for the prior year.

These events featured core multi-pack consumables at a great value and helped offset additional consumer noise in the third quarter related to the government shutdown and debt ceiling discussions.

Pharmacy sales remained solid with pharmacy script volumes increasing. E-commerce traffic continues to grow at a double-digit rate increased mobile web and app usage. We remain focused on integrating our physical and digital resources providing a deeper relationship with members. For example, we recently enhanced a special order tire experience on samsclub.com. This service lets members order tires from our broad online assortment and have them shipped and installed at the club of their choice. This reverse showrooming service is enabling a seamless experience both in club and online at a significant value for our members.", "Now, let\u2019s continue with the financial results, excluding fuel. Gross profit rate increased 16 basis points driven primarily by merchandise mix shifts. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 23 basis points due in part to our increased investment in pre-opening expenses associated with the 13 club openings and a state excise tax refund credit we received last year. Membership and other income grew 16.9%. In other income, we realized a financial benefit from a profit-sharing arrangement with our credit card provider as new account growth and existing account performance were both above last year.", "Membership income grew 8.1%, up from 4% last quarter as the benefit of the fee increase implemented earlier this year accelerates. The benefit will continue to be a tailwind in the upcoming quarter and throughout the next fiscal year. In terms of membership, our primary base continues to grow driven by strong finance performance in the new clubs opened this quarter, plus renewals and upgrades also showed strength partially offset by soft business member sing-ups. Sam\u2019s third quarter operating income grew to $466 million, an increase of 9.4% over last year.", "I would like to transition to our strategy to enhance new club productivity. By increasing our upfront membership acquisition investment, we have been able to build a critical mass of members. In some cases, we have opened new clubs with a member base well beyond our average size. We have customized the approach by market to incorporate regionally relevant road shows and incredible one-time buys creating plenty of pre-opening buys.", "Throughout each club first year, we are engaging extensively with these new members demonstrating value and encouraging renewals. Given these results, we are accelerating this strategy to protect share in competitive markets while also investing in densely populated areas. During the fourth quarter, we planned to open two new clubs and one relocated club. At Sam\u2019s Club, the holiday season is well underway and we\u2019re investing in price for the fourth quarter. First our members will be rewarded with two instant savings books and an exclusive VIP events for our plus members at Sunday before Thanksgiving. Second, we've collaborated with the global e-commerce team to provide the best online program we've ever had.", "Finally in December alone, we will transition our club three times providing members with more than double the number of new general merchandise items versus last year before. Before I close I want to thank the entire Sam\u2019s team. We\u2019ve recently empowered our buyers to make more calculated risk. Their focus on newness and excitement has transformed our merchandise assortment. We have also invested to further develop our operators through the next generation leadership program. We\u2019re identifying and building talent in the field to serve our members and their community. Together our merchants and operators form a critical piece of the business, and I'm confident their efforts will translate into a great holiday season for our members. I hope to visit our clubs this holiday season. We have a comprehensive plan to finish the year and expect to deliver a club comp sales increase excluding fuel, a flat to 2% for the 14 week ending January 31, 2014. For the comparable 14 week period last year comp sales excluding fuel increased 1.8%. Looking towards the future we are excited about the long-term position of Sam's Club. We remain committed to delivering superior value to our members, through differentiated merchandise anytime, anywhere access and a compelling experience. With that I'd like to turn the program over to Charles.", "", "Charles Holley", "Thanks Ross. Last quarter I told you that our expectations for the back half of the year would be through a lens of cautious consumer spending and I believe that we\u2019re seeing that play out. In the third quarter we invested strategically in price across all of our segments and we made progress on expense leverage. Although it was a challenging quarter from a self-standpoint, we\u2019re encouraged that we continue to manage our business well and deliver consistent, solid returns for our shareholders.", "On the quarter, we added approximately $1.8 billion of consolidated net sales. On a constant currency basis we would have increased net sales by more than $3 billion, currency exchange rate fluctuations against the U.S. dollar have clearly been a headwind for us this year and if foreign currency rates remain where they are today I expect a similar impact for the fourth quarter.", "Around the world the company added approximately 11.7 million net new square feet of retail space during the quarter, bringing our net year-to-date additional square footage to 22.7 million. We\u2019re also pleased with the growth of our smaller formats in Walmart U.S. In fact we have close to 400 neighborhood markets by year-end. Our e-commerce growth was extremely strong, during the quarter we increased sales by almost 40% due in part to last year's acquisition of Yihaodian in China.", "Without Yihaodian we still grew global e-commerce sales by over 20%. The investments we\u2019re making or generating additional site traffic and sales particularly in our key e-commerce market of U.S., UK, Brazil and China. We expanded our fulfillment network around the world, including new facilities in Texas, Brazil and China across our four websites @WalmartLabs team made significant advances in personalization by building a new sophisticated recommendation engine that is a big leap forward from where we were previously. Our goal is to have a robust product offerings for our customers in every market and we continue to add assortment both through the core businesses and through our marketplace partners.", "The team also dramatically accelerated the deployment of Pangea, our global technology platform that runs every site around the world. This allows us to enhance the site experience by regularly releasing both the front end and back end capabilities. As we enter the fourth quarter it's important to note that we are laser focused on improving top sales in every segment and through our e-commerce channel. Now let's turn to leverage, as you heard from Jeff we made progress and expense leverage on a consolidated basis since the second quarter. While Walmart U.S. continues to lead the company and operating expense leverage. We\u2019re encouraged by the overall progress of international. Given the soft sales environment and our increased investments in e-commerce and compliance, we know that expense leverage for the company will be challenging for the full year. Two years ago, we committed to levering 100 basis points of our expense to sales ratio by fiscal year 2017. We made progress on this goal last fiscal year and while the road got a little bumpy this year, we remain committed to this goal.", "Moving on to returns. Our goal is to grow operating income at the same rate or faster than sales. And in the third quarter, we delivered on that objective. Year-to-date, we have generated operating cash flow of over $13 billion and free cash flow is now at $3.8 billion. The company returned $10.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases so far this year clearly reinforcing our commitment to deliver solid returns to shareholders.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to guidance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our earnings guidance today assumes several important factors. First, we anticipate continued pressure on sales as consumers face tough economic conditions around the world and the competition remains aggressive for every holiday purchased. Second, we anticipate that currency exchange rates remain at current levels meaning a continued negative impact on sales and profits. Next, our full year effective tax rate remains unchanged with our prior forecast and will range between 31% and 33%. Fourth, we expect the incremental impact of investments and global e-commerce to be approximately $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.10 per share for the full year. And last, expenses related to FCPA matters, including our compliance program enhancements and the ongoing investigations will be between $75 million and $80 million in the fourth quarter.", "Taking these factors into account, we are forecasting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 to range between $1.50 and $1.60. This range includes two items that I mentioned at the October Analyst Meeting. First, we are closing approximately 50 underperforming stores in Brazil and China. The impact of these closures will be dilutive to earnings per share from continuing operations by about $0.06. Second, the company will independently own and operate the wholesale format in India and will end its franchise agreement with Bharti for the retail business. This transaction is still subject to regulatory approval. We expect the impact to be in the fourth quarter and to be dilutive to earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately $0.04. Therefore, underlying diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter is expected to be $1.60 to $1.70.", "The last item I mentioned is the sale of our VIPS restaurants in Mexico, which is scheduled for the fourth quarter pending regulatory approval. The expected gain on this transaction will be accretive to earnings per share from discontinued operations by approximately $0.06. Now, when we look at the combination of all of these items, we believe diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart for the fourth quarter which takes into account the sale of VIPS and discontinued operations will range between $1.56 and $1.66.", "Let\u2019s move on to guidance for the full year. We are updating our guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2014 to a range between $5.01 and $5.11. Accounting for the $0.10 of certain items that will impact the fourth quarter, our underlying full year earnings per share from continuing operations will range between $5.11 and $5.21.", "Thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company.

Walmart U.S. was a key contributor to our overall profit growth, with operating income up 4%. ", "Walmart U.S. also added almost $5 billion in annual net sales. We were encouraged by our comp performance in the first half of the fourth quarter, including the holiday period. But, like many other retailers, weather got the best of us throughout the back half, resulting in a fourth quarter period comp decrease of 0.4%. It\u2019s a credit to Bill and his team that Walmart U.S. leveraged expenses and invested in price for our customers. ", "Sam\u2019s Club had the strongest annual membership income growth in many years, driven primarily by the fee increase. But, net sales grew more slowly than expected. Roz and the team have taken steps to rebalance Sam\u2019s operational structure and enhance merchandise offerings. We expect these actions to provide a foundation for future growth and further benefit our fiscal 2015 financial results. ", "Walmart International delivered solid constant currency net sales growth to reach almost $141 billion, including more than $39 billion of constant currency net sales in the fourth quarter. The team improved operational efficiencies to lower expenses and reduce inventory, and this will continue to be a priority.

Since joining the Walmart family over 15 years ago, Dave has been instrumental in strengthening our business, as well as gaining market share in our international markets. I\u2019ve seen Dave make tough strategic decisions to better position us for long-term success, and I\u2019m confident that his leadership will serve associates, customers and shareholders well. ", "Each operating segment strengthened its e-commerce platforms, and customers responded, driving annual Global eCommerce sales above the $10-billion mark, a 30% increase, including sales from our Yihaodian acquisition. We know that technology is changing how customers around the world shop, and we are changing with them. Under Neil\u2019s leadership and with company-wide support, we will continue to invest in this area that is critical to our success.

One of Sam Walton\u2019s fundamental principles that I really like is that we need to serve Walmart customers around the globe as if they\u2019re our boss, because they are. Listening to our customers and exceeding their expectations are the keys to our success. I will lead Walmart with a customer-centric focus.

We have a compelling customer proposition, but we can get better at running some of our core operations, and we will. ", "Walmart has a long history of embracing change. And this year, we\u2019ll certainly make some changes to improve our business. These changes will be made with a filter on increasing customer relevance. Customers\u2019 shopping habits are changing more rapidly than ever before. We must be more nimble and flexible as we operate our businesses to adapt to these changes. So, our focus is to invest in the capabilities that connect with customers on their terms. ", "We can accomplish this by accelerating our growth across the enterprise. This includes delivering improved comp sales by sharpening our EDLP focus and increasing merchandise innovation to drive more traffic. Comp sales improvement is a key priority, and we\u2019ll use a combination of price investment and enhanced service to accomplish this. ", "We will also continue to get closer to our customers and provide them with additional shopping options. In the U.S., we see a great opportunity to accelerate our small format store rollout to complement Walmart\u2019s core supercenter fleet.

I\u2019m also grateful for the opportunity I was given, starting as an hourly associate, to learn the business and what it takes to be a good merchant. And of course, we never stop learning. ", "In fact, when I was riding along with one of our trucks delivering a load to a supercenter on my first day as CEO, the driver, Rickey, displayed a personal passion for serving customers. I saw that same passion from Rosie, one of our department managers, in a Memphis store last week. I was reminded how each of us, regardless of our roles at Walmart, has an important responsibility to serve our customers to the best of our abilities. ", "And because of this, we will continue to invest in and develop talent that will move us into the future. This is really critical to our success. Before I close, I want to appreciate Mike Duke for his service and accomplishments as CEO over the past 5 years and throughout his 18-year career with Walmart.

He also broadened our company\u2019s commitment to lead on some of the most pressing social and environmental issues of our times. Under Mike\u2019s leadership, the company delivered strong financial results, and total shareholder returns improved dramatically.

As you\u2019ve heard these past few minutes, we have much to achieve this year, and this will inevitably include change. But things that won\u2019t change include our core beliefs, our winning culture and our purpose of serving customers so that they can save money and have the freedom to do more with their hard earned money.

We\u2019ll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?", "William Simon", "Thank you, Claire. In the fourth quarter, the U.S. retail business environment was challenging. It was marked by a shortened holiday season, severe winter storms, and reduced government benefits. While these factors impacted our business, they also brought out the best in our associates and have further cemented our customers\u2019 reliance on our commitment to price leadership. ", "Net sales grew by $1.8 billion or 2.4%. For the 14 weeks ending January 31, comp store sales were down 0.4%, with ticket up 1.3% and traffic down 1.7%. In the absence of a reduction of government SNAP benefits, which represented approximately 40 basis points of impact to comp sales, we believe the quarter would have been flat. Additionally, comps were pressured by winter storms, which forced the closure of over 200 stores at some point over the course of quarter. ", "While we\u2019re disappointed with comp sales, there are a number of things that made me particularly proud. We kicked off the season with a successful Black Friday event, led by strong customer response to the one-hour-guarantee program. We followed that with an excellent Cyber Monday, which marked the biggest sales day in walmart.com\u2019s history. ", "I\u2019m pleased with our event execution and coordination between our online business and our physical stores. Our commitment to price leadership, aggressive marketing and strong execution helped us deliver a positive sales comp during the 6-week holiday season ending December 27, 2013. ", "Due in large part to our holiday performance, we gained share across all of our tracked general merchandise categories, including entertainment, toys, automotive, stationery, home and apparel, for the 13 weeks ending January 4, 2014, according to The NPD Group. ", "In addition, we continue to be pleased with the strength of our small formats. These stores continue to deliver positive comp sales and traffic increases each quarter. In fact, comp sales, without fuel, for Neighborhood Markets grew approximately 5% for the 14-week period. ", "Now, let me share more detail about the financial results for the fourth quarter. We had modest year-over-year operating income growth to $6.4 billion. Gross profit increased 0.8%, with our gross profit rate down 41 basis points, driven primarily by a commitment to price leadership. ", "Our customers rely on us to deliver low prices on the items they want most. We believe our price investment was a material driver to accelerated share gains and positive comps during the holiday season. ", "We delivered 17 basis points of expense leverage. For the quarter, expenses increased only 1.4% in spite of headwind related to group health care costs. The operations team executed holiday plans extremely well and efficiently transitioned stores between a normal day-to-day business and holiday events to serve a record number of customers during the Thanksgiving week. ", "In fact, during the peak 4-hour period, our associates processed more than 10 million transactions. That\u2019s over 40,000 transactions per minute. We also benefitted from a $33 million gain related to the sale of real estate that was recorded in other income. ", "Q4 inventory grew 3.8%, moderating from prior quarters, but still higher than the rate of sales. We remain committed to disciplined inventory management and are well positioned for spring seasonal conversion. Now, let me cover some of the highlights from our merchandising areas. ", "Grocery, which includes food and consumables, gained 24 basis points of market share for the 13 weeks ending February 1, 2014 according to The Nielsen Company. Our overall grocery comp was in the low single-digit negative range, due in part to SNAP benefit reductions. ", "Excluding those impacts, we\u2019re encouraged by the underlying business. We saw strong mid-single-digit positive comps in produce and adult beverages, which benefitted from enhanced quality and price investments. Additionally, we had positive comps in other fresh departments, including meat, deli and bakery. ", "Health & wellness continued its momentum, delivering a low single-digit positive comp. Our prescription business was particularly strong, with a mid-single-digit positive comp due in part to inflation. This helped offset pressure from a soft flu season, which also adversely impacted our over-the- counter business. ", "Hardlines, including seasonal, had a low single-digit positive comp for the quarter. Our Christmas seasonal business performed well, with strength across the entire business, including lights, trees, and d\u00e9cor. Hardware and paint, as well as automotive, also delivered solid comps, with strong sales in cold weather categories, such as car care and heaters. ", "Entertainment, including toys, posted a mid-single-digit negative comp. However, we were able to grow market share. Our one-hour guarantee program, the \u201cChosen by Kids\u201d program and a strong Black Friday event performance led to share gains for the 13 weeks ending January 4, 2014, according to The NPD Group. While we were pleased with our share performance, we continued to face challenges related to ongoing entertainment industry contraction. ", "Our home business reported a low single-digit positive comp. Broad assortment helped both bath & bedding, as well as cooking & dining, deliver strong mid-single-digit positive comps. National brands such as Calphalon, Farberware, Keurig, and SodaStream also drove traffic and sales growth in home. ", "Our apparel business delivered a low single-digit positive comp, with strength across several categories. Sales of national brands, such as Avia and Russell, led the way during the quarter. Cold weather apparel and active wear posted particularly strong comps. ", "I\u2019m happy to report that our e-commerce business continued to perform well. For the fourth quarter, it contributed approximately 30 basis points to the total Walmart U.S. comp. As I mentioned, we had our strongest Cyber Monday ever. Customers are rapidly adopting mobile, and we\u2019re evolving quickly by enhancing the experience through improved apps. Continued enhancements of our e-commerce platform and fulfillment network are top priorities, and we invested strategically to strengthen these areas. ", "Our Texas dotcom fulfillment center processed more orders than planned, and our new Pennsylvania center opens within the next few weeks. The strategic location of these fulfillment centers complement others already in place and allow us to reduce the time to deliver merchandise. ", "Now, let me now cover the financial results for the full year. During the fiscal year, net sales increased $5.0 billion, or 1.8%, to $279.4 billion. Comp sales declined 0.6% for the 53-week period ending January 31, while operating income grew 4.0% \u2013 or more than twice the rate of sales \u2013 to $22.4 billion. ", "Gross profit for the year increased 1.8%, with a slight gross profit rate decline. Price investments were offset by cost of goods savings initiatives. ", "Expenses were up 0.9%. We successfully leveraged each quarter of the year. Within our supply chain, logistics utilized optimized routes and distribution center mechanization to drive efficiencies. Store operations leveraged technology investments, such as self-checkouts and MyGuide, to improve associate productivity. ", "We\u2019re proud of our ongoing commitment to expense leverage. Since fiscal 2010, we\u2019ve delivered 83 basis points of cumulative leverage. Those savings allow us to invest in price and fuel the productivity loop. ", "Despite improvements in overall operational efficiency, group health care expenses were a headwind for the year and will continue to be in fiscal 2015. As our health care plans already exceed the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, we didn\u2019t expect the implementation of ACA to materially impact our benefits costs. However, we\u2019ve experienced higher-than- anticipated enrollment. This has placed pressure on our benefits expense. We\u2019ve accounted for this in our financial guidance and will monitor it closely throughout the year. ", "With regards to real estate, our strategy is centered on providing customers access to the broadest array of products through a digitally connected, multi-format portfolio. To this end, we accelerated the growth of our small format stores. We added 105 new Neighborhood Markets this year, bringing our current fleet to 346 total units. ", "These stores delivered an approximately 4% sales comp for the year, driven by fresh and pharmacy. In fact, our Neighborhood Market fleet is performing comparable or favorable to leading grocers around the country. We also opened 7 Walmart Express units this year, bringing the total to 20. We continue to learn from these stores and are excited by the options this format offers. ", "Supercenters will also continue to play a role in our overall growth and are essential to the grocery stock-up and broader shopping trips. Including expansions, conversions and relocations, we opened 130 units this year. ", "Let me share with you some positive developments in our growth plans. Recall in October that we announced plans to build 120 to 150 new small stores for fiscal 2015. We\u2019ve been working to improve our speed to market and lower capital costs to allow us to move more aggressively. ", "I\u2019m very pleased to announce that we\u2019re further accelerating our small store growth and now anticipate opening between 270 and 300 this fiscal year. Our customers\u2019 needs and expectations are changing. I believe these stores will enable us to exceed their expectations by providing convenience and easy access to fresh foods, pharmacy and fuel. Through the intersection with walmart.com, we can connect our physical asset base to the broad assortment that is available online. ", "These increases will nearly double our small store fleet, driving retail growth as we enter the next generation of retail. Including expansions, conversions and relocations, we will deliver 385 to 415 new units versus our prior guidance of 235 to 265 new units. Total incremental square footage is anticipated to be between 21 and 23 million square feet, versus our previous guidance of 19 to 21 million square feet. ", "Given the small format acceleration, we are also updating our capital expenditure guidance, from a range of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion to a new range of $6.4 billion to $6.9 billion. ", "We currently have over 4,200 stores and will grow that significantly this fiscal year. Our full fleet will serve as the physical access points for our digital business, combining these two worlds in a unique way. Site to Store, Ship from Store, Pay with Cash, and Scan & Go are great examples of what we\u2019re currently doing to marry digital and physical experiences. ", "In October, we expanded the grocery delivery test to the Denver market, and we\u2019re getting a great response. Almost 90% of the customers rate the service above average or outstanding. And just last month, we announced an easy pick-up option for online grocery and general merchandise orders in Denver. We\u2019re leveraging our global learning from the Asda Click and Collect program, a highly successful model. And, we\u2019ll continue to innovate in this space and invest in meaningful opportunities. ", "Reflecting on the year, I\u2019m really proud of the impact we\u2019re having on our customers and communities. We launched our veterans hiring program in May and have since hired more than 30,000 honorably discharged veterans. We\u2019ve also made great strides in our domestic manufacturing initiative. ", "Our activity to date will lead to the creation of an estimated 58,000 new U.S. manufacturing-related jobs. We have strong commitments from suppliers and recently announced a $10-million, 5-year Walmart U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund to spur innovations that support America\u2019s growing manufacturing footprint. ", "For fiscal 2015, we\u2019re focusing on growth and returning to positive comps. We\u2019ll leverage what\u2019s already working well in areas, such as home, apparel, and produce, and continue to drive improvement in opportunity areas such as dry goods, snacks & beverages, consumables, and entertainment. ", "We\u2019ll also address underperforming stores. We recognize the need to win at the convergence of digital and physical, and we\u2019ll leverage our more than 4,200 stores as access points for our digital business to further spur growth through e-commerce. And, of course, we\u2019ll do this in the Walmart way \u2013 leveraging expenses and remaining true to our everyday low price promise. ", "In the first quarter, we expect the retail landscape to remain challenging. Comp sales were down at the beginning of the 13-week period, due largely to continued winter storms. However, we\u2019re encouraged by our underlying business trends and anticipate a positive sales comp for the balance of the quarter. Therefore, we expect a relatively flat sales comp for the 13-week period ending May 2. Last year\u2019s 13-week comp ending April 26, 2013 was down 1.4%.

I\u2019m proud to be part of such a strong leadership team that is committed to advancing our global mission of saving people money so they can live better around the world. ", "As we\u2019ve said for some time now, we\u2019re operating in a challenging global environment, with low inflation, relatively high unemployment and fragile consumer confidence leading to modest consumer spending.

This can come in many forms, but we will continue to focus aggressively on driving comp sales in each of our markets. This is the most efficient manner for us to drive top-line as well as returns.

", "We will build a platform for profitable growth in China. We\u2019re encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made here and will continue to make this a priority. We\u2019re focused on stabilizing Brazil. This has been a challenging market for a number of reasons, and we\u2019re working on many fronts to improve our competitive position here.", "I\u2019m very excited about our continuing growth in e-commerce globally. It\u2019s a big part of our plans going forward, and we\u2019re working closely with Neil\u2019s team around the world to ensure we\u2019re leading at the intersection of physical and digital. Just in the last year, we\u2019ve grown Yihaodian and Brazil ecommerce sales at nearly twice the market rate. ", "We\u2019re also seeing great progress in the U.K., Canada and Mexico. Let me remind you of our announcement on February 6 of the completion of our purchase of approximately 25% of the shares of Walmart Chile from certain minority shareholders. As a result of this transaction, Walmart now owns approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of Walmart Chile, and we recently launched a cash tender offer for the remaining shares. We believe in the potential of this market, and this purchase continues Walmart\u2019s growth strategy. ", "Let\u2019s now turn to our results for the fourth quarter.

Gross profit rate, on a reported basis, fell 53 basis points and on a constant currency basis, decreased 44 basis points.

Operating expenses increased 12.5% on a reported basis, and increased 18.8% on a constant currency basis. The discrete items impacted operating expenses by 13.2 percentage points. Excluding these items, operating expenses would\u2019ve grown 5.6%. ", "We are disappointed in our leverage performance for the quarter. As always, our teams are focused on operational efficiency and are making progress on several cost reduction initiatives. For example, in the U.K., plans are in place to roll hybrid checkout registers across 130 stores in early FY 15 and to expand on global scan and go initiatives. Mexico is improving associate productivity by optimizing modular, financial and promotional planning to drive improved layout accuracy and in-stock.

On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 4.6%. ", "This is the first quarter our Yihaodian acquisition is included in our constant currency numbers. During the first three quarters of the year, Yihaodian contributed $730 million in sales, which were not included in our constant currency results.", "We are especially pleased that in this tough environment, we grew market share in most countries and maintained share in a challenging Mexico market.

Gross profit rate was flat for the quarter, as sourcing benefits and efficiencies were invested into maintaining a strong price position. ", "The U.K. macroeconomic environment improved slightly in the fourth quarter with GDP growth of 0.7% and unemployment falling to a four-year low of 7.1%. However, the macro picture is masking a slower recovery from a consumer perspective, with staple item price inflation continuing to outstrip personal earnings growth. ", "In this tough economic environment and with inflation slowing, total market growth for the 12 weeks ending January 5 was relatively modest at 2.9%. With online growth and a growing discount sector, all major retailers, including Asda, had overall share declines. ", "Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose by 18 basis points. Headwinds in indirect taxation, employment costs and investments in e-commerce were offset somewhat by cost discipline across operations. We improved check-out efficiencies, procurement savings on supplies, supply chain efficiencies and energy savings, and we expect to deliver more benefits this year. Due to the expense headwinds, operating income decreased 1.5%. ", "Inventory was reduced 2.7%, driven by improved stock to sales control, as well as the conversion to the Global Replenishment System earlier in the year. ", "We recently announced a new strategy at Asda that we expect will redefine value retailing in the U.K. This will involve improving our core business by investing UK1.25 billion in price and quality over the next 5 years.

", "In Canada, fourth quarter net sales grew 0.4%, while comp sales decreased 1.7%. Comp traffic decreased 2.7% with ticket increasing 1.0%. The decrease in comp store sales was due to several factors, including exceptionally severe winter weather during December, declining consumer spending and price competition. ", "Although we saw solid low single-digit comps across the board in food and consumables, this was offset by our Walmart discount stores, which struggled particularly in electronics and hardlines. ", "Despite the soft comp sales, we achieved an overall increase of 45 basis points of market share according to The Nielsen Company\u2019s measured channels for the most recently reported 12-week period ending January 25. We remain excited about our e-commerce business. In fact, we had our best online sales day ever during our Black Friday event. For the quarter, online sales grew 145%. ", "Our gross margin rate decreased 88 basis points due to continued aggressive price investment. Operating expenses grew 0.9%. Higher costs for utilities, maintenance and repair, and investments in e-commerce were offset somewhat by store wage leverage. As a result of this, operating income decreased by 5.3%. Despite the sales softness, inventory was well managed, with total inventory flat to last year. ", "During the fourth quarter, we completed 9 new supercentres, 5 expansions and 7 in-box conversions in Canada. For the year, we added 10 net new stores, bringing our total count to 389 retail locations.

Walmex separately reported fourth quarter results on February 18, under IFRS, so some numbers will differ from the Walmex-reported numbers. Our Mexico results exclude the impact of the pending Vips sale, whose operations results are recorded in discontinued operations. ", "For the quarter, Walmex consolidated net sales grew 3.5%. Gross profit rate decreased 44 basis points, driven by a decrease of 77 basis points in Mexico.

As a result, labor productivity for the year increased approximately 7%.

In addition, Japan has been able to increase the price gap with the competition. ", "I also want to acknowledge the effort put in by the Japan team on controlling costs, leveraging full year operating expenses by 34 basis points as a percentage of sales, despite continued increases in energy costs. The benefit from insurance proceeds related to the 2010 earthquake helped offset operating expenses. Benefiting from a relatively small base, Japan ended the year with an operating income increase of 25.2%.

After extensive analysis, we rebalanced our field structure to better align our club resources with the current and potential sales volume of each club. While these decisions were not taken lightly, we believe these changes will allow us to be more agile, focusing on long-term growth opportunities within the club. Moreover, these changes will allow us to better develop our internal talent and improve service for our members, well positioning us for fiscal 15. ", "Let\u2019s begin with the Q4 results. Similar to other retailers, the unforeseen winter weather was a significant headwind to the quarter. There were a number of bright spots, however, such as positive savings member traffic and their strong response to our new merchandise. Let me walk you through the highs and lows of Q4. ", "Going into the quarter, we were solidly positioned to have a successful holiday season. Sales and club traffic accelerated at the beginning of Thanksgiving week, led primarily by our exclusive Sunday evening VIP Event, which posted a very strong high single-digit comp. ", "However, traffic slowed following Thanksgiving, as severe winter weather covered geographic areas where we are highly penetrated, particularly the Midwest and the Plains regions. This caused a rather pronounced sales lull prior to Christmas, disrupting critical holiday shopping weekends and cancelling many holiday functions. ", "This impact was further compounded by a shortened selling season, which limited our opportunity to recover sales, particularly in our food and beverage categories. While this boosted our online performance, we were disappointed to see that sales did not materialize as expected. ", "Our comp for the 14-week period ending Jan. 31, 2014, excluding fuel, declined 0.1%, comprised of a traffic increase of 1.2% and a ticket decline of 1.3%. ", "On a positive note, our new merchandise is resonating well with our savings member segment, or those shopping for their personal needs. However, the continued shortfalls in our business member segment, driven primarily by convenience store consolidation and a declining tobacco business, pressured our results. Business member traffic and ticket were both negative this quarter.", "If you\u2019re familiar with our business, it shouldn\u2019t surprise you that our business member base has been declining. Many of the small businesses we serve make a big difference to the economic environment that we all share. According to Gallup, micro-businesses \u2013 those with five or fewer employees \u2013 make up about 80% of all companies in the U.S. Clearly, the efforts of these businesses matter to the health of the economy, and they especially matter to us at Sam\u2019s Club. ", "To serve our business members, we\u2019ll be rolling out new member services this coming year, initially geared at supporting the needs of our micro-business members and strengthening renewal rates. You\u2019ll hear more about these services in the coming year. ", "Now, on to the financials \u2026 As Claire previously mentioned, there are two discrete items affecting comparability of our reported financials that represent an unfavorable net impact. During the quarter, we recorded operating expense charges of approximately $59 million related to the implementation of a new in-club staffing structure and the closure of one club. ", "Net sales, including fuel, were $14.7 billion, up 1.3% over last year. Fuel prices decreased 2.6% compared to last year, and gallons sold were up 4.5%, contributing 10 basis points to overall sales. Sam\u2019s gross profit rate decreased 18 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 82 basis points. Operating income decreased 15.3% to $425 million. Inventory, including fuel, was up 3.2%, largely a result of new club openings. ", "Volatility in fuel prices can influence our financial results. Therefore, the remainder of our discussion is focused on our core business, excluding fuel, for comparative purposes. ", "Net sales for the quarter were $13.2 billion, up 1.2% from last year. Retail inflation across the club was essentially flat. Cost inflation remained slightly inflationary. ", "Now let\u2019s discuss the merchandising results. Over the past year, we have worked to sharpen our merchandising focus around price, bulk, quality and excitement, with very positive results. Our home and apparel categories have done exceptionally well, as our merchants brought in new, exciting merchandise that really resonated with our members. In the coming months, we will roll out even more new merchandise to additional areas across the club. ", "There were three factors that affected our Q4 merchandising results \u2013 the winter weather I mentioned, the reduction in SNAP benefits and disinflation. Despite these headwinds, the majority of our merchandising categories reported positive comp sales. ", "We continue to place an emphasis on fresh, driving a low single-digit positive comp within fresh, freezer and cooler. A focus on newness and quality helped boost our Thanksgiving meal performance, with fresh sides and fresh meat both delivering low single-digit positive comps for the quarter. Deflationary pressures, specifically in dairy and cooler categories, tempered our growth. ", "Grocery and beverage reported an essentially flat comp. The combination of price investments and new SKUs drove unit growth in our snacks category. This growth was offset by sales declines in weather-sensitive categories, such as juice and water. ", "Tobacco performance was in line with prior quarters, with a low single-digit negative comp. Our Instant Savings events are driving awareness of our merchandise offering, resulting in market share gains in categories like table top, trash bags, and food storage, as measured by The Nielsen Group for the 13-week period ending January 18, 2014. This growth was offset by declines in our pet business, resulting in a flat comp for consumables. ", "We are optimistic about the growth opportunities in health and wellness. For the quarter, health and wellness delivered a low single-digit positive comp. Member response to our pharmacist-administered immunizations drove traffic and pharmacy script counts grew. Over-the-counter sales decelerated from the prior quarter, as we lap strong prior year performance in key diet and nutrition items. ", "Home, apparel and hardlines delivered a mid-single-digit comp. The merchants have really transformed this area, bringing in new items and driving excitement. In December alone, we transitioned the clubs three times, focusing on apparel at the beginning of the month, giftable items prior to Christmas, and then a home gallery vignette set on December 26, that performed exceptionally well. ", "Within technology and entertainment, our VIP event and cyber week delivered solid growth. Samsclub.com is becoming even more important, with member usage increasing. During non-peak times, however, sales were soft, especially in highly competitive categories like TVs, portable electronics, and wireless. ", "This ultimately led to a mid-single-digit negative comp. Technology and entertainment has been challenged over the past year, experiencing deflationary pressures and ever-changing member preferences. The team is actively working to reenergize our assortment, predominantly in mobile, driving sales with new and exciting technology. ", "As our eCommerce business continues to strengthen, Black Friday and Cyber Week offers led to another quarter of double-digit sales growth. E-commerce sales contributed approximately 40 basis points for the 14- week comp period ending January 31, 2014. Year-long site improvements have strengthened conversion, particularly in mobile transactions. ", "To continue supporting this growth, we\u2019ve named Jamie Iannone CEO of samsclub.com, fully integrating the Sam\u2019s Club eCommerce team with the Walmart Global eCommerce team. The integration allows us to build on our collective strengths and improve the member experience. ", "Now let\u2019s continue with the reported financials \u2026 Gross profit rate decreased 21 basis points. The gross profit rate was unfavorably impacted by an adjustment to our product warranty liabilities of $39 million, or 30 basis points. Excluding this adjustment, our gross profit rate increased 9 basis points due to the merchandise mix. Our merchants continue to invest in price leadership and have managed our gross profit rate well in a very competitive pricing environment. ", "Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up 91 basis points, due to changes in our staffing structure and sales challenges. The charge related to our new staffing structure and the closure of one club negatively impacted operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 45 basis points. Excluding this, operating expenses as a percentage of sales would have increased by 46 basis points. Expense reduction, improved productivity, and innovation are even greater priorities for us in this fiscal year. ", "Now, I\u2019d like to call out membership income, which grew 9.0%, making Q4 our strongest quarter of the year. Back in May, we took our first fee increase since 2006 and coincidently launched Instant Savings for all. Response to Instant Savings has been incredibly well received, providing a disciplined opportunity to demonstrate price leadership. Our members have welcomed Instant Savings, both in-club and online, and it will continue to be one of several ways we communicate value. ", "Investments such as Instant Savings and our new merchandise have strengthened our membership offering, growing our new sign-ups and improving our Plus level membership renewals and upgrades. While part of our growth is attributable to new clubs, we\u2019ve also utilized innovative ways to reach new prospects, such as leveraging social media campaigns. In November, we launched a social media initiative to drive new membership growth through compelling online offerings. This drove over 160,000 redemptions and helped grow our member base. ", "In other income, sales charged to the Sam\u2019s Club credit card reached record highs, resulting in a financial benefit from a profit sharing arrangement with our credit card provider. Additionally, we realized gains of $24 million for the sale of two real estate properties, increasing other income as a percentage of sales by 18 basis points. These factors contributed to our membership and other income growth of 23.4%. ", "Our fourth quarter operating income was $412 million, a 15.7% decline from last year. Excluding the charges for the new club structure, the closure of one club, product warranties and the real estate gains, which net to $74 million, operating income declined 0.6%. Let\u2019s turn to the results for the year. Our annual performance was solid, especially for the first half of the year. ", "With fuel, net sales were $57.2 billion, up 1.3% over last year. Our gross profit rate was flat. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 26 basis points. Operating income increased 0.8% to $2.0 billion. Net sales, excluding fuel, were $50.6 billion, up 1.6%. For the 53-week period ending January 31, 2014, comp sales increased 0.7%. Comp traffic was up 2% and ticket was down 1.3%. ", "Membership income increased 5.9%. This has been our strongest year of membership income growth in many years, driven by new member signups and the fee increase taken last May. ", "Gross profit rate was essentially flat. Operating expenses grew 3.8%. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 26 basis points. Operating income was $1.9 billion, a 1.9% increase over last year, growing slightly faster than sales. ", "The charges we took in Q4, along with the real estate gain, impacted our gross profit rate by 8 basis points, operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 12 basis points, and operating income by 3.9%. Excluding these items, gross profit rate increased 7 basis points, operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 14 basis points, and operating income grew 5.8%. That concludes our fiscal 14 discussion. ", "Fiscal 15 is now under way, and we are confident that we have the right strategy and the right structure in place to execute our growth plans. The investments we made in fiscal 14, such as transforming our merchandise offering, raising our base fee, rebalancing our field structure and accelerating real estate openings positions us well to boost our top-line performance. To accomplish this, we have three key areas of focus.", "First, we will continue to elevate our merchandise offering, building upon the success of home and apparel this past year. Our strategy of merchandise differentiation has resonated extremely well with our savings members, and we are excited to continue this transformation. When you visit our clubs this year, you should expect to see a strong merchandise assortment and unrelenting price leadership. ", "Second, we\u2019re committed to growing at the intersection of \u201cbricks and clicks,\u201d delivering anytime, anywhere access for our members. This includes two key areas of investment to propel our growth \u2013 samsclub.com and member personalization. We\u2019re going to utilize Big Data to serve our members better, and we\u2019re going to invest not only in samsclub.com, but the connection between our online presence and our clubs. ", "Finally, the importance of delivering member value has never been greater, as we strive to become an even more valued membership organization. We remain optimistic about our growth opportunities, and plan to open between 17 and 22 new, relocated, and expanded units this year. Most of our capital commitment goes to new clubs. We will, however, continue to maintain and improve our fleet by remodeling between 55 and 60 units this year. ", "Continued severe winter storms have resulted in a soft start to the quarter. Because of this, we expect comp sales, without fuel, for the 13- week period from February 1 to May 2, to be relatively flat. For the 13- week period last year, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.2%. ", "We remain optimistic about the growth opportunities at Sam\u2019s Club. The underlying health of the business is sound. The restructuring efforts implemented are allowing us to be more agile, focusing on the growth opportunities within the club channel.

Charles?", "Charles Holley ", "", "Thanks, Roz. Let me wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some thoughts on the company\u2019s performance last year. On the positive, we delivered over $473 billion in net sales. E-commerce sales grew over 30% to more than $10 billion, including acquisitions. ", "Walmart U.S. continued their excellent trend of leveraging expenses. International made progress on reducing inventory. Sam\u2019s Club had solid growth in membership income. And, despite tough, sluggish economies, we grew underlying operating income over last year. ", "Now, we did have some challenges. Currency negatively impacted consolidated net sales by over $5 billion. Our U.S. businesses faced several headwinds this past year, including the reversal of the two% payroll tax cut, the overhang of sequestration, a reduction in government food benefits, and severe weather in the fourth quarter affected sales more than we had anticipated. All of these negatively affected comp sales. ", "Sluggish sales, our stepped up investment in Global eCommerce, as well as ongoing investments in our leverage and compliance organizations, made it difficult to leverage operating expenses as a company. We also did not anticipate the 26 cents of discrete items in the fourth quarter. ", "Now, let me frame the remainder of my comments today around the areas where we need to focus. Our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns continue to guide us. I\u2019ll begin with growth. ", "As Doug said, Walmart needs to be more nimble and responsive to stay ahead in the fast-changing retail industry. We\u2019re very focused on driving better customer traffic and growing comp sales. You should expect that we will continue to invest in price and improving service. We will also continue to invest in growing our store base. ", "Small formats represent a great growth opportunity for us in many of our markets, including the U.S., Mexico and the U.K. You heard earlier from Bill about the opportunity for us to accelerate the rollout of Neighborhood Markets and Walmart Express, given their strong comp sales performance. ", "Customers appreciate the convenience and assortment these two formats offer, and today, we\u2019re expanding our capital allocation plan to increase the Walmart U.S. budget by approximately $600 million to accomplish this goal. It\u2019s an aggressive plan, considering that we are doing this in addition to our original forecast of large and small formats. ", "Walmart International will continue to grow, with new store square footage predominantly across some of our key markets, including the U.K., Canada, Mexico and China. And, Sam\u2019s Club will also open between 17 and 22 clubs in the U.S. this year, building on the 12 clubs opened in fiscal 2014. ", "Our company will continue to invest in and grow through ecommerce. We\u2019ve already made significant progress through site enhancements, search capabilities and fulfillment. We would expect this improvement to continue. We\u2019ll also continue to make strategic acquisitions to build out our technology, talent and capabilities, and we will increase our investment when the right opportunity or acquisition presents itself. The acquisition of Yihaodian, for example, has helped us build a strong e-commerce base in China. ", "We expect to grow Global eCommerce sales to over $13 billion this fiscal year, with continued focus on the U.S., U.K., China and Brazil. Our websites in Canada and Mexico are starting to gain even more customer traffic. We continue to step up investments in Pangaea, our global technology platform, which helped drive sales across our retail websites in the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. ", "This growth is enabled by investments we\u2019re also making in fulfillment and replenishment. Our online websites had their most successful year in fiscal 2014, and we continue to offer a great omnichannel experience for our customers. We launched a new fulfillment center in Texas in September, and it exceeded expectations during the busy holiday season. We\u2019re also launching two new fulfillment facilities in Pennsylvania and Brazil in the coming weeks. ", "Now, let\u2019s turn to leverage. The productivity loop is the basis on which we deliver on our promise of everyday low cost and every day low price. We\u2019re committed to operating expense leverage across our businesses. We will continue to focus on being best-in-class operators, which will allow us to invest heavily in price and deliver stronger top-line results. ", "We made significant price investments during the fourth quarter in Walmart U.S., along with all of our markets, and in this fiscal year, you should expect to see even greater investment in price leadership \u2013 whether you\u2019re a customer in London or Louisville. ", "We continue to receive great support from the Walmart leverage organization, and this is an area where we will continue to invest. The teams are helping us build better sourcing capabilities, implement best practices across the organization, and improve back office efficiencies. We are strengthening our ability to leverage Big Data and analytics to help us better understand buying patterns so we can put the right product on the shelf for the right time. This allows us to better anticipate and serve the needs of our customers. ", "Let\u2019s move on to returns. Return on investment for the 12 months ended January 31, 2014 was 17.0%, down from the 18.1% we reported at this time last year. Remember that our reported results included the discrete items we\u2019ve already mentioned. If you exclude these items that accounted for 40 basis points, return on investment would have been about 17.4% when compared to the prior period. As Claire has already covered, return on investment was impacted by the decrease in operating income, investments in fixed assets, and acquisitions. ", "Improved operating results and better management of working capital, including inventory, will drive stronger cash flow. We plan to be very focused on our working capital this year to ensure we maximize our free cash flow in the future. ", "Let\u2019s turn to guidance. We expect economic factors to have more negative than positive effect on our outlook. Now, you\u2019ve heard today about some of the factors affecting the U.S. business, including reductions in government benefits, and along with higher taxes and tight credit, these items will continue to weigh on our customers. ", "In October, we forecasted a 3 to 5% net sales increase for this new fiscal year. Additionally, all guidance provided today assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels. Now, if the currency rates remain where they are today, this would cause a negative impact to net sales of approximately $3.5 billion for fiscal 2015, when compared to actual exchange rates in 2014. Because of this, and the economic factors just mentioned, we expect to be toward the low end of that net sales guidance. ", "During the first quarter of this year, we will begin to anniversary the increased costs we\u2019ve incurred for FCPA matters, including compliance program enhancements and the ongoing investigations. These costs will remain in the Corporate and Support area, and we anticipate expenses to be between $200 million and $240 million for the year. As you heard from Bill, we expect to incur more expense than originally anticipated from higher health care benefit utilization by our U.S. associates, and this will impact fiscal 2015 earnings by approximately $330 million. ", "In addition, the increased investment in Global eCommerce will be between 2 and 4 cents per share over the 11 cents we invested in fiscal 2014. As of today, we would expect currency to have a negative impact on operating income of approximately $125 million for the year. ", "When you take all these headwinds into account, and we adjust for the lower government benefits impacting U.S. sales, we still expect to grow operating income, although it may not grow at the same or faster rate than sales. ", "With all this in mind, we expect first quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.10 and $1.20. This compares to $1.14 last year. We expect full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.10 and $5.45. This compares to a reported earnings per share of $4.85 in fiscal 2014, which included the discrete items we told you about. Underlying earnings per share for fiscal 2014 were $5.11. ", "Our EPS guidance is based on our forecast of the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate to range between 32 and 34%. Our tax rate will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items, and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. ", "As a reminder, the pending sale of the Vips restaurant business in Mexico remains subject to regulatory approval and is now expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The Vips results are recorded in discontinued operations and the estimated future gain from the sale is expected to be approximately $0.06 per share. ", "Now, let me take a minute to provide an update on our capital plans for this year. You\u2019re familiar with how we prioritize our cash and the first priority is organic growth. Accelerating the U.S. small format growth will require additional investments over what we announced in October. ", "So, first, we said total company capital expenditures were projected to range between $11.8 and $12.8 billion for the year. Today, we are updating this range to $12.4 to $13.4 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million for Walmart U.S.", "Next, we said the company would add between 33 and 37 million square feet of retail space for the year, including approximately 19 to 21 million square feet in Walmart U.S. We are now updating this range to 35 to 39 million square feet, including approximately 21 to 23 million square feet in Walmart U.S. Projected capital expenditures and square footage exclude the impact of future acquisitions. And, Bill covered the details on the change in unit counts for Walmart U.S. ", "Our second priority for capital deployment is for strategic acquisitions. We always evaluate available acquisition opportunities that will either add to our retail platform or support our operations. As Dave discussed, we completed the transaction in Chile and now own approximately 99% of the shares of Walmart Chile. ", "During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we paid approximately $1.5 billion to complete this transaction. Additionally, continued investment in e-commerce is critical to the future of our business, and we will be opportunistic in the e-commerce space as we evaluate potential acquisitions. ", "After growth organically or by acquisition, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We announced today that our dividend will be $1.92 per share for fiscal 2015, to be paid out quarterly. We\u2019ve now increased our dividend each year for 41 years. ", "As of January 31, 2014, the company had approximately $11.3 billion remaining under our current $15 billion share repurchase authorization. We will continue to be opportunistic at times with share repurchases. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity. ", "We\u2019ve provided a lot of information on today\u2019s call, and hopefully it helps in understanding where we are headed for this fiscal year. We are extremely focused on improving comp sales across the organization. Our investments in new stores and e-commerce will strengthen our market share position and allow us to better serve our customers. We will continue to drive expenses out of the operations and enhance productivity. And, as always, we will continue on delivering good returns for our shareholders.

Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone.", "Walmart\u2019s first quarter consolidated net sales increased to more than $850 million or 0.8% over last year. Like other retailers in the United States, the unseasonably cold and disruptive winter weather negatively impacted our U.S. sales and drove operating expenses higher than expected for the company. This, coupled with the higher than anticipated tax rate, resulted in earnings per share of $1.10.", "Our underlying business is solid, and I\u2019m confident in the company\u2019s long-term strategies. We\u2019re making progress on building a more customer-centric organization, with a foundation of everyday low prices. We\u2019re investing in technology and our multi-format portfolio to bring Walmart\u2019s value proposition to many more customers around the world. We have a tremendous opportunity to win with the integration of digital and physical retail, as customers have the resources from us to shop on their terms.", "Walmart U.S. added approximately $1.3 billion in net sales compared to last year. We delivered on our comp guidance despite the impact from severe weather several times during the quarter. Our sales increased during the back half of the quarter. Neighborhood Markets delivered approximately a 5% comp. This strong and consistent performance is exciting, as we accelerate their rollout this year to complement our core supercenter fleet. Of course, we always have room for improvement. We continue to focus on our execution, both in-store and online, to provide customers with the merchandise and the shopping experience they desire.", "Sam\u2019s Club had a tough quarter, with lower sales than anticipated. Membership income increased, driven primarily by last year\u2019s fee increase. I\u2019m encouraged by the work underway to elevate the merchandise assortment to highlight newness and drive sales. We\u2019re also launching new services next month to make a Sam\u2019s Club membership more rewarding.", "A bright spot this quarter was the performance of Walmart International. Net sales increased 3.4% on a constant currency basis. I\u2019m optimistic because of the improved sales trends, and the progress we continue to make on operational efficiencies. I was really pleased with our International segment\u2019s more than 5% growth in constant currency operating income this quarter.", "As we focus on customer relevance, I\u2019m excited about the progress that we\u2019re making on our e-commerce initiatives. We will create transformative growth through these capabilities. Our investments are focused on improving customer experience and fulfillment capacity to provide the options that customers expect.", "While I was in the U.K. last month, I saw how we\u2019re innovating to win the integration of digital and physical retail. Our team in the U.K. continues to expand convenient access to the merchandise customers want \u2013 from multiple pick-up points to grocery home delivery.", "Shortly after I returned from the U.K., I flew to Denver to see our \u201cWalmart to Go\u201d grocery delivery and pick-up operations. It\u2019s really impressive how our e-commerce and store teams are collaborating to deliver for our customers in ways they want to be served. We\u2019re sharing global best practices across our markets to serve customers", "more effectively.", "There are a lot of good things happening in e-commerce across the globe. In the first quarter, we grew sales approximately 27%. We\u2019re seeing double-digit sales growth from nearly all of our e-commerce and mobile commerce businesses around the world. Brazil e-commerce and Yihaodian in China continue to experience strong demand.", "I just returned from China on Friday and was excited to see our Yihaodian team and see some of the new ideas they\u2019re working on. We\u2019re also making great progress on our global technology platform, Pangaea, and we\u2019re confident that customers will appreciate the streamlined functionality it will provide when we begin its rollout later this year. The lines between digital and physical retail have blurred and this is all ultimately about meeting and then exceeding customer expectations.", "At Walmart, we welcome the opportunity to lead on sustainability, but we believe that all retailers, regardless of platform or presence, have a responsibility to invest in this area. Last month, we hosted our first Sustainable Product Expo, bringing together many of the key thought leaders on this topic. And, it was an honor to join the CEOs from a number of our key supplier partners in committing to promote initiatives that advance sustainable agriculture and ramp up recycling programs in U.S. cities.", "On June 6, we\u2019ll hold our Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, and it\u2019s great to hear from our shareholders. I also look forward to seeing so many of our associates who come from our markets around the world. I appreciate their dedication to our purpose, and I\u2019m inspired by their commitment to save our customers money and time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing to enable and empower our associates with the skills necessary to compete and providing them with the opportunity of a career with upward mobility.", "Looking ahead, we continue to concentrate on driving growth across the enterprise. We\u2019re laser-focused on delivering improved comp sales by sharpening our merchandising efforts, price leadership and service.", "Capital efficiency continues to be a priority, as we invest in our store fleet and our global supply chain. Also, as you\u2019ve seen with our 12 e-commerce acquisitions over the last 3 years, we intend to be aggressive in adding e-commerce and mobile commerce capabilities, such as the purchase of Adchemy earlier this month. As we view our business through the eyes of our customers, we\u2019re working to deliver a relevant, personalized and seamless customer experience across all channels to further grow sales.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire?", "Claire Babineaux-Fontenot ", "Thank you, Doug.", "Today, I\u2019d like to highlight items affecting the company\u2019s consolidated financial results for the first quarter and provide a bit of color around certain other items. Additional details from a consolidated perspective are available for reference in the accompanying presentation on slides 2, 3 and 4.", "Severe weather in our U.S. businesses negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.03. Additionally, the company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was higher than anticipated in the full-year guidance we provided on February 20. We continue to believe our full-year tax rate will range between 32% and 34%. We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate, as it may be impacted by a number of factors.", "The impact of currency fluctuations continued to weigh on our results, negatively impacting net sales by $1.6 billion. As you can see on slide 2, consolidated net sales increased more than $850 million, or 0.8%. Excluding the currency impact, net sales would have increased 2.1%.", "Let\u2019s move on to operating expenses. Corporate and support expenses, which include core corporate, global e-commerce support and global leverage services, increased 12.4%. As we take a closer look at the components, core corporate expenses increased 5.4%. FCPA and compliance-related expenses for the quarter were approximately $53 million.", "Approximately $34 million of these expenses represented costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, and approximately $19 million was related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. The growth in e-commerce support was driven by our investments to help expand our global technology platform to deliver an unparalleled customer experience.", "Our leverage services area includes investments we are making in technology, such as back office capabilities and risk and compliance management. In addition, we continue to invest in SAP to support our core operating segments, including productivity initiatives.", "Net interest expense increased 7.2%. The strength of our balance sheet continues to be a competitive advantage. We took the opportunity to participate in the historically low interest rate environment, issuing $4.6 billion in new debt during the quarter. We anticipate that our net interest expense will be higher for the full year than last fiscal year.", "Consolidated inventory increased 5%. The timing of Easter from the first quarter of last year to the second quarter of this year impacted inventory balances in many of our non-U.S. markets. You will hear more about inventory from each of our operating segments.", "Payables as a percentage of inventory were 80.2%, which compares to 85.2% last year, due to the timing of payments and higher inventory balances, including the timing of Easter. Improving inventory leverage is important, and each of our operating segments is focused on this priority.", "Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2014 was 16.7%, compared to 17.8% last year. ROI was impacted by a decrease in operating income, as well as investments in fixed assets. The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to timing of income tax payments and lower capital expenditure for the quarter.", "The last item I\u2019ll leave you with today is related to share repurchases. In the first quarter, the company repurchased approximately 8 million shares for $626 million. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity.", "As we examine the level of share repurchases for the first quarter, it\u2019s important to remember that in addition to our normal activity, the company also spent approximately $1.5 billion to purchase substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of Walmart Chile.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?", "Bill Simon", "Thank you, Claire.", "For the first quarter, we added approximately $1.3 billion in net sales, with relatively flat comp sales. As we indicated in February, we realized negative comp sales during the first two weeks of the fiscal year from severe winter storms. A solid start to the spring season and a strong Easter holiday drove positive comps over the remaining 11 weeks of the quarter; that\u2019s despite additional severe weather and about 50 basis points of continued SNAP-related headwind. Weather impacted Q1 comp sales by approximately 20 basis points. Overall, our comp sales were down 8 basis points, in line with our guidance.", "I\u2019m encouraged by the sales momentum in the back half of the quarter and with approximately 30 basis points of improvement in our comp versus Q4. I\u2019m also pleased we gained 23 basis points in market share across the key categories of \u201cfood, consumables & OTC\u201d for the 13 weeks ended April 26, 2014, according to The Nielsen Company. The entire team was focused on driving sales, launching multiple innovative initiatives that position us well in the second quarter and for the remainder of the year.", "Profit was challenging, down 4.3% versus last year. Severe weather-related profit impacts accounted for approximately $120 million in headwind versus last year. Additionally, health care expenses increased at double-digit growth rates, or more than $110 million, primarily from increased enrollment and medical cost inflation.", "We realized unanticipated double-digit percent growth in our maintenance and utilities expenses, associated with snow removal and higher utility rates and usage. Severe weather also created disruptions across our supply chain, causing freight backlog across much of the country. To keep our stores well stocked, we incurred incremental expenses for third-party transportation services and overtime wages. And, of course, we also continued to invest in price, resulting in a net 17 basis point decline in gross profit rate.", "Q1 inventory grew at 5.3%, primarily from new store growth and slower sales in weather-related categories such as outdoor living. We continue to monitor our inventory levels and to position ourselves well for the summer and the rest of the year.", "Now, let me cover the performance of our Neighborhood Markets and supercenters. Neighborhood Markets continue to perform well, delivering approximately a 5% comp sales increase for the quarter, driven by a nearly 4% increase in comp store traffic. We\u2019re seeing strength across the box, particularly in produce, meat, adult beverages, and pharmacy.", "Our Neighborhood Market fleet performed consistently well through the entire quarter, including throughout the periods of inclement weather. In fact, April marks the 46th consecutive month of positive comps for the format, further validating our strategy to accelerate the unit growth. Neighborhood Markets delivered solid comp sales performance regardless of the age of the store.", "In October, we communicated that 90% of our supercenter fleet was performing well. In Q1, these stores delivered a positive comp and improved over Q4 last year. For the remaining stores that require special attention, we\u2019ve developed unique, store-specific action plans and we\u2019re investing in leadership and additional staffing.", "Early indications show improvement in key metrics, with comp sales for this group up more than 200 basis points from Q3 of last year, and customer experience scores also showing consistent improvement. While we\u2019re encouraged with the early results, we anticipate this will be an ongoing work in progress.", "As we enter the third phase of our Walmart Express store test, we\u2019re exploring tethering this format to our larger supercenters. In this test, customers will be able to order supercenter merchandise at a rural Express store and receive it on the same day. On May 2, we opened the first fully tethered Walmart Express store in North Carolina. Customers are buying products, such as bicycles and swimming pools, which they can\u2019t traditionally get inside a 10,000-square foot box.", "During the quarter, we opened 13 Neighborhood Markets and 25 supercenters, including 16 new and 9 conversions. We\u2019re on track to deliver about 115 supercenters, between 180 and 200 Neighborhood Markets and 90 to 100 Walmart Express stores this fiscal year.", "We believe we\u2019re headed in the right direction. The team is diligently focused on improving sales by introducing increased innovation across the box. Just in the first quarter alone, we brought everyday low prices to the money transfer industry through our unique Walmart-2-Walmart service.", "We also rolled out Wild Oats, a new line of organic food products in nearly half of our stores. We launched a video game trade-in program. We expanded our Savings Catcher pilot to seven markets, and we introduced an online Walmart auto insurance comparison service. And finally, beginning Sunday, May 18, we will re-launch our Great Gas Rollback program.", "Now, I\u2019d like to review the performance of the various merchandising areas. In grocery, we\u2019ve seen a trend improvement despite approximately 90 basis points of headwind from the reduction in SNAP benefits. Overall grocery inflation is tracking at approximately 120 basis points. While our consumables business had a low single-digit negative comp, partly due to modest price deflation and overall industry softness, our food business delivered a positive comp.", "We\u2019re seeing the strongest results in areas such as meat, produce and dairy, where we\u2019re investing to keep our prices low for customers despite pressure from cost inflation. Additionally, food delivered strong Easter results, with double-digit sales growth in Easter candy and strength across other categories such as meat and eggs.", "Health & wellness improved more than 150 basis points versus Q4, led by our pharmacy business. Prescriptions delivered a mid-single-digit positive comp, driven by branded drug inflation and a strong increase in script counts. Script counts benefitted from new contracts in our Medicare business. Over-the-counter also improved, as a soft cough, cold, and flu season transitioned to robust allergy season.", "Overall, general merchandise remained soft, primarily from weather impacts and declining industry dynamics, particularly in entertainment. Our Easter seasonal business delivered high single-digit positive sales growth. However, it was not enough to offset softness within hardlines and entertainment, which had negative comp sales.", "In hardlines, inclement weather affected sporting goods and seasonal hardware, while entertainment continued to face challenges related to deflation. Despite industry deflation, we\u2019re encouraged by the early results of our new video game trade-in program, and we continue to focus on revitalizing our entertainment area. In the second quarter, we will re-lay our entertainment department, allocating more space and prominence to growth categories, while improving category adjacencies.", "Apparel continues to perform well, driven by a strong Easter and national brands. We\u2019re really pleased with active wear, and how it performed throughout the quarter with a double-digit comp, driven by our Danskin Now and Russell Athletic offering. Our shoe and children\u2019s apparel business also had positive comps, benefitting from a solid performance from national brands such as Avia, Child of Mine by Carter\u2019s, and Garanimals.", "Similar to apparel, home benefited from strong performance in national brands, such as Rachel Ray, Farberware, Magic Bullet, Keurig, and a broad assortment of basics. However, inclement weather drove softness in outdoor living, which includes patio furniture and live plants. Our stores are set and we\u2019re well prepared to meet customer demand as the weather improves.", "Overall, I\u2019m excited about the progress we\u2019ve made in both home and apparel. The team continues to enhance our assortment and expand strong, national brands to deliver value across categories.", "Our e-commerce business delivered double-digit sales growth and contributed approximately 30 basis points to total Walmart U.S. comp sales. Approximately two-thirds came from the walmart.com fulfilled sales and the remainder from store fulfilled orders. We saw particular strength in home, hardlines, toys & seasonal, and apparel, which was somewhat offset by softer results in electronics.", "Overall, we\u2019re continuing to increase our capabilities in this area. To further integrate our digital platform with our store fleet, we\u2019ve recently rolled out an e-receipts program. The initiative makes it easier for our customers to keep track of their purchases and, when combined with the Savings Catcher program, will provide an opportunity for our customers to save even more. We also recently updated our mobile pharmacy app, and we\u2019re seeing strong customer response with usage across the country.", "We\u2019re encouraged by the early results of our Denver grocery delivery and pick-up test, which has multiple pick-up points across 34 stores. Early sales are beating expectations and have already exceeded those of our San Francisco-San Jose pilot, which rolled out in calendar year 2011.", "We continued to gain momentum during Q1 in our U.S. Manufacturing initiative. To date, over 65 leading research institutions have applied for funding from our $10 million U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund. We expect the first awards to be issued by the end of calendar year 2014.", "Additionally, we announced that we will hold an \u201cOpen Call\u201d event in Bentonville on July 8. Current and potential suppliers can present items made in the USA to Walmart, walmart.com, and Sam\u2019s Club merchants. Registration is now open, and we\u2019re already seeing a tremendous response.", "We expect to find great new items we can offer our customers this holiday season and beyond. We have solid business fundamentals and anticipate our recently launched initiatives and continued price investment will resonate with the customer. However, given the challenging retail environment, we expect comp sales to remain relatively flat for the 13-week period from May 3 through August 1, 2014.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for an International update. Dave?", "David Cheesewright", "Thank you, Bill.", "Overall, I\u2019m satisfied with our performance in the first quarter. In a challenging global economy, our teams delivered solid sales and profit growth by focusing on expanding price leadership and providing great customer service. We remain focused on being in good businesses and running them well. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making against our strategic priorities, but there\u2019s still much to do. As I\u2019ve traveled around our markets, I\u2019ve been particularly impressed with the caliber of our associates. The passion and commitment in delivering our purpose of \u201csaving people money so they can live better\u201d is clear to see wherever we operate.", "We continue to invest in expanding price leadership in key markets. For example, in Mexico, Superama lowered prices on more than 5,000 items and put in place a quality guarantee. In Brazil, our new advertising campaign that kicked off in February explains and reinforces to our customers in Brazil our mission of \u201csaving people money so they can live better.\u201d The value-themed ads include real life experiences from customers, as well as innovative appearances in TV shows and feature Brazil\u2019s national soccer coach.", "To continue this pricing momentum across the globe, we\u2019re working with third party analysts, such as The Nielsen Company, to develop consistent market share reporting. The ability to have more timely access to data helps us react even more quickly to maintain price leadership and hold customer trust.", "Driving the productivity loop to be the low cost operator in each market is core to our business model. The \u201cWe Operate for Less\u201d programs in China and Brazil are allowing us to offset wage inflation in those countries. In the U.K., we further rolled out the hybrid checkout system which speeds up the checkout process. Now more than half of all U.K. transactions are processed through a self-checkout.", "Also, we delivered on our commitment to improve operational returns. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 5.3%, which outpaced our sales growth of 3.4%. On a reported basis, operating income growth also outpaced sales.", "We continue to innovate and grow our e-commerce business globally, and we are delivering on our strategy of winning the integration of digital and physical. I\u2019ll discuss this more later. I\u2019m also excited about recently announced key leader moves. We have tremendous bench strength, and our ability to attract talented leaders and develop them globally, positions us to lead in our markets.", "Scott Price will move from being CEO of Asia to our corporate support team, leading strategy, real estate, mergers and acquisition, as well as International leverage. Our International depth gives us the ability to promote a great leader like Greg Foran to head our Asia business, a key part of our growth. Sean Clarke will succeed Greg, leading our China business. Sean is one of our most experienced executives, having served in finance and operating roles in the U.K., Canada, Japan, Germany and now China.", "At Massmart, Kuseni Dlamini was appointed as our new non-executive Chairman of the Board for our Sub-Saharan African business. Kuseni is an outstanding business leader, with deep experience in emerging markets and a global perspective on management and growth.", "Additionally, Guy Hayward was promoted to President and Chief Executive Officer for our business in Africa. Guy has a wealth of retail and financial experience and has been an integral part of Massmart\u2019s success.", "Now, let\u2019s get to our first quarter results. As mentioned earlier, I\u2019m pleased that we grew operating income at a faster rate than sales on a reported and constant currency basis. However, we did not leverage expenses this quarter, primarily as a result of sales challenges in a few of our markets and the timing of Chinese New Year and Easter.", "We\u2019ve summarized our results as we always do \u2013 on a reported and constant currency basis. In all countries except Brazil and China, our discussion of results is inclusive of e-commerce. For Brazil and China, we discuss stores and e-commerce separately. Slide 8 of the accompanying presentation has all the details, but let me take a minute to provide some additional insights.", "Of our five largest countries, Brazil delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. With the one month lag in reporting for all countries except Canada, the timing of Easter from the first to second quarter affected comp sales in countries like the U.K. and Mexico. Although we\u2019re not including detail for other markets on the slides, we will briefly mention Japan this quarter, which had a very solid performance.", "On a relative basis, we were somewhat encouraged with our market share performance during the quarter for our largest markets. Based on the most recent data available for the quarter, we grew our share in Canada and Mexico. We lost market share in Brazil and China, where we closed stores. Share in the U.K. declined slightly, although we gained share relative to our largest competitors. We\u2019ll provide more details as we discuss the countries individually.", "On a reported basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 3.4%, or 10% on a constant currency basis. With the later Easter, inventory levels increased in quarter 1 ahead of the selling period in quarter 2. Having said that, we have work to do in inventory in a few markets and we\u2019re focused on managing this more efficiently.", "Key financial details are summarized on slides 7 and 8. I\u2019ll discuss performance insights on our five largest markets. All of these discussions are on a constant currency basis and, unless otherwise stated, total sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal, calendar basis.", "Our net sales and comp sales declined for the quarter in the U.K. However, against a tough market backdrop, first quarter growth relative to the market improved over last year, and Asda grew ahead of its three major competitors in the 12 weeks ending March 30, according to Kantar. Even with a sales decline, operating income grew 6%, benefiting from strength in gross margin from the merchandising mix changes related to Easter.", "Our strategy of \u201cRedefining Value Retailing in the U.K.\u201d is built around price investment to support our core mission. Sales of \u201cprice-locked\u201d products -- essential food items where prices have been permanently reduced, were more than 15 million units every week in the quarter. We launched a new George homewares range, and early sales were ahead of expectations.", "With the expansion of Click & Collect, online grocery home shopping market share reached a new high of 19.2% for the period ended March 30, according to Kantar, and e-commerce sales were up more than 19.0% for the quarter compared to last year. Overall, our U.K. business continues to operate well and innovate. We\u2019re optimistic about winning in a competitive market.", "Also in a competitive environment, Walmart Canada increased net sales, but comp sales declined. The excessively cold weather impacted retail sales throughout the market, particularly in seasonal categories such as apparel and outdoor. Health and wellness sales were negatively impacted by lower generic prescription reimbursement rates due to ongoing drug reform initiatives implemented by various provinces, as well as higher utilization of generics.", "Sales were strongest in food and consumables, and according to Nielsen, we increased market share 42 basis points for the 12 weeks ended April 19. Our continued price investment resulted in an increased price gap to competitors. We\u2019re pleased with online sales as well, which delivered 134% growth. Operating income grew ahead of sales.", "Now let\u2019s discuss performance in our Latin American markets. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported first quarter results on April 22 under IFRS, so some numbers will differ from the Walmex reported numbers. Our Walmex results exclude the impact of the sale of Vips, which results are recorded in discontinued operations. We received regulatory approval to proceed with the transaction and closed the deal on May 9.", "Walmex consolidated net sales grew 1.5% during the first quarter, impacted by the Easter calendar flip. Operating income grew 0.8%, mainly as a result of expense deleverage in Mexico, impacted primarily by the Easter flip and softer sales. Operating income was also aided by certain items.", "Mexico\u2019s self-service business, including Sam\u2019s Club, outperformed the market by 60 basis points in the first quarter, according to Antad. Aggressive price investments made in the Bodega Aurrera, Superama and Walmart Supercenter formats resulted in sales growth outpacing the market by 400 basis points. Our small formats, such as Bodega Aurrera Express and our stand alone pharmacies, delivered strong double-digit comps and outperformed their market peers on food and consumables.", "Sam\u2019s Club, which represents approximately 26% of our Mexico revenue, continues to perform below our expectations. The team is focused on reinvigorating our value proposition by providing an exciting assortment through treasure hunt and differentiated merchandise for our Advantage members, and by adding additional value for business members. In addition, we\u2019re leveraging best practices from our U.S. Sam\u2019s Club business. While we\u2019re confident about our long-term strategy, we expect Sam\u2019s Club to be challenged in the near term.", "Additionally, we continue to invest in and expand the Walmex e-commerce business, with additional general merchandise categories now online. Also, Superama\u2019s online grocery delivery is still growing, providing our customers with the opportunity to access via computers, smartphones and tablets. The Walmex team continues to drive the business, and in particular, we remain focused on improving our Sam\u2019s performance.", "Let\u2019s next talk about Brazil. I was recently in Brazil where I saw first-hand the team\u2019s alignment and commitment to stabilizing the business. We\u2019re implementing a number of initiatives to build a stronger foundation, including investments in price leadership and in improving our productivity.", "These investments are focused on both our retail and wholesale formats, and we\u2019re pleased with improved trends in food and consumables. We expect that as we continue to make progress, we will see similar trends in general merchandise, and will be able to drive sales growth going forward.", "The retail market in Brazil continues to decelerate, in line with the economy. Despite this and the Easter calendar flip, first quarter net sales and comp sales grew, and we leveraged expenses. As planned, operating income declined due to investments in key initiatives and pricing.", "While we still have a ways to go in Brazil, we further strengthened our talent base in key areas such as operations, finance, compliance, human resources and merchandising over the past year. Therefore, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about the improvement we are seeing.", "Moving now to Asia, Walmart China\u2019s comp sales were negative 2.5%. This year, Chinese New Year was slightly earlier than last year, so a greater proportion of pre-holiday spending was in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding this calendar impact, comp sales would have been about flat to last year. Sales in China also faced significant headwinds from government austerity programs, which continue to curb gift card sales. Additionally, price deflation in key categories such as edible oil, liquor and infant formula negatively impacted sales.", "Our business transformation program, now in its third year, continued to deliver improvements to margins and reductions in expenses. We\u2019ve been able to invest in further price reductions for customers, and we increased operating income by 26.2% for the quarter.", "Turning to Japan, we had a strong first quarter, with both net sales and comp growth. Sales growth was aided by pre-buying ahead of the consumption tax increase, which went into effect on April 1. Walmart Japan gained market share in the first quarter and the business has continued to perform nicely, even since the tax increase. Higher sales and expense control led to 111 basis points of leverage, resulting in healthy operating income growth. So, as you can see, there are some encouraging signs in our key markets, and we\u2019re committed to continuing this progress.", "Last, let me give you a brief recap of our e-commerce results. We believe that our e-commerce business is one of the most dynamic in the world, and this was another strong quarter. As an example of our innovation, we further expanded the Asda Click & Collect program at over 300 Asda stores and other locations. This quarter saw further innovation with a first-to-market initiative allowing same day pick-up in 89 locations, with plans to expand to all stores this year.", "We\u2019re pleased with our first quarter results in China and Brazil. We continue to see strong comp growth in our China e-commerce business. Site traffic at Yihaodian grew in the triple digits, and ticket was up as well. Yihaodian sells both food and general merchandise and SKU counts are double last year, with over 3 million items now available.", "Yihaodian sold over 1 million liters of imported milk and set the Guinness record for \u201cthe most milk sold on a single online platform in 24 hours.\u201d This is a testament to our ability to leverage Walmart\u2019s supply chain for the benefit of our online businesses. Our growth in mobile is also impressive, as we almost reached the same number of mobile sales in the quarter as we had in the entire business last year.", "In Brazil, we again saw sales growth of more than twice the overall e-commerce market, and we saw record traffic growth, driven in part by new affiliate agreements. Our \u201cConsumer Day\u201d in March drove sales nearly three times that of a normal day, with strength in computers and smartphones. We continue to see record sales by mobile users, with three times the mobile sales we had last year.", "As a global company, we have a responsibility to lead on compliance, social and environmental issues. Over the past year, we\u2019ve made major investments in compliance. We built better processes, increased training for our associates and strengthened our organizational leadership.", "I\u2019m also proud to see the impact our teams make by giving back to the communities in which we operate. For example, Walmart Chile rushed to help the victims of earthquakes and wild fires that recently impacted northern and central Chile. The company sent bottled water, blankets, diapers and personal hygiene products to meet the primary needs of the victims.", "In conclusion, we continue to execute on our strategy of being in good businesses and running them well. Throughout the world, we remain focused on several key areas, which we shared with you in February: drive strong comp sales by expanding price leadership, create a platform for sustainable growth in China, turn around Brazil, rejuvenate Mexico, accelerate growth in e-commerce, be the lowest cost operator, and build trust wherever we operate.", "We see momentum in our markets, and I continue to be optimistic about the future. We have the talent, strategy and commitment to achieve success, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz?", "Rosalind Brewer", "Thanks, Dave.", "The fiscal year started with several challenges for our core member, resulting in one of our more difficult quarters. The combination of severe weather and the reduction of public assistance represented an approximate 90 basis point impact to comp sales. In addition, Q1 was marked by a rapid acceleration in inflation, as cost inflation was approximately 160 basis points, compared to 30 basis points in Q4.", "Despite our efforts to combat these challenges, sales did not materialize as expected. Net sales grew 0.5%, without fuel, to $12.2 billion. Operating income declined 1.4% to $477 million. Our comp for the 13-week period ending May 2, excluding fuel, declined 0.5%, comprised of both decreases in traffic and ticket.", "In recent quarters, our Savings member traffic has helped to offset the softness in our Business member segment. This quarter we saw positive, yet lower Savings member traffic, coupled with slower ticket acceleration \u2013 primarily in our lower to middle income members. Business member traffic and ticket remained soft.", "Over the past year, our merchants have been elevating the value and uniqueness of our merchandise assortment. We\u2019re seeing positive results in areas where we\u2019ve introduced newness. These areas of growth mirror current member trends around \u201cfresh, fast and fit\u201d. Let me give you some examples.", "Within \u201cfit\u201d, our new assortment of snacking options, which includes exclusive \u201cbetter for you\u201d choices, is helping to drive double-digit unit growth. Also, our on-trend \u201cathleisure\u201d active wear helped deliver a double-digit positive comp in ladies apparel.", "We\u2019ve also enhanced our private label offering by introducing new, high quality items and consolidating the existing assortment into three main labels: Member\u2019s Mark, Daily Chef and Simply Right. The recent investments are being recognized. For example, Member\u2019s Mark Ultimate Clean laundry detergent received top rankings from a leading external rating agency.", "While our category level merchandising results this quarter were mixed, we remain confident in our strategy to deliver more newness, more often. We are monitoring our inventory levels, which grew 7.6%, driven in part by softer sales and build-ups for new items in categories such as home and health and wellness.", "Within fresh, freezer and cooler, cost inflation in meat and dairy outpaced retail inflation, pressuring units and leading to a low single-digit positive comp. The late arrival of spring, along with the increased cost of beef and pork, influenced the early grilling season \u2013 an area where we have historically been strong. Within produce, hard freezes caused citrus availability issues, which were partially offset by strong strawberry and watermelon crops.", "Dry grocery and beverage struggled this quarter, as the decreases in total box traffic contributed to the low single-digit negative comp. While our new sweet and salty snack offering performed well, it was not enough to offset unit declines in larger categories like beverages. Ancillary categories had a negative impact on the quarter, due to sales declines in tobacco and tires. There were fewer promotional events in a leading tire brand compared to last year.", "Health and wellness delivered a low single-digit positive comp. Member awareness and usage of our pharmacy continues to grow, contributing to a high single-digit positive comp. Over-the-counter however, pressured the entire category, as we lapped strong prior year performance in diet and nutrition items.", "During the transition to newness, we\u2019ve experienced slight declines in consumables, recording a low single-digit negative comp. Our merchants are actively looking for ways to differentiate, particularly in pet supplies and home care, moving to products with even greater value.", "Within technology and entertainment, supplier inventory issues caused disruption within TVs and tablets, contributing to a high single-digit negative comp. In addition, wireless was pressured by shifting industry dynamics, as carriers change the structure of their contract terms. With", "Walmart\u2019s acquisition of the assets comprising Simplexity LLC\u2019s wireless activation platform earlier this month, we will be able to more efficiently support wireless activations for our members. We expect the benefits of this acquisition to materialize for both the Sam\u2019s Club and Walmart U.S. businesses in the coming quarters.", "Home, apparel and hardlines reported a low single-digit positive comp. While this is a slight deceleration from prior quarters, we remain pleased with our elevated assortment in this space. In seasonal hardware and gardening, new, high quality items resonated extremely well with members. Our growth was tempered by mattresses, which underperformed in geographic areas most impacted by weather, resulting in unit declines year-over-year.", "Samsclub.com delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, contributing approximately 20 basis points to the total Sam\u2019s Club comp. One of the contributors to this growth was Click\u2018n\u2019Pull, a free service that lets members place their orders online or by fax, and pick them up the next morning. We\u2019re revamping Click\u2018n\u2019Pull to further increase convenience for our members, particularly those with micro-businesses.", "We\u2019ve also begun testing \u201cMy Subscriptions\u201d, a pilot service that allows members to order items like diapers online, with discounted shipping rates. Investments such as these demonstrate our commitment to the integration of \u201cbricks and clicks\u201d and represent an opportunity to appeal to more tech-savvy members.", "Now back to the reported financials, excluding fuel. For our financial results including fuel, please reference the supplemental presentation. Gross profit rate declined 29 basis points due to shifts in merchandise mix and rising commodity costs.", "The combination of increased labor costs and weather-related utility costs contributed to a modest deleverage of 3 basis points. You may recall that last quarter, our expenses were negatively impacted by a field organization restructure. We were able to place a larger number of affected associates in open roles within Sam\u2019s Club or the larger Walmart organization than we had originally anticipated. Because of this, our severance related costs were less than our Q4 accrual, benefitting operating expenses by 7 basis points.", "Our operational performance continues to exceed members\u2019 expectations. According to the 2014 Temkin Experience Ratings, Sam\u2019s Club received the top ranking for best customer experience in retail. This is the third consecutive year Sam\u2019s Club has been recognized.", "Membership and other income remains a bright spot, growing 10.5%. Membership income by itself grew 10.9%, due primarily to the fee increase taken a year ago. In addition, Plus member upgrades and Plus member renewals performed well. In regards to Plus member growth, the South Central region has outperformed the rest of the country over the past year, due to the Plus member cash rewards pilot launched in fiscal 13.", "Weather related traffic trends affected sign-ups and renewals, which were soft this quarter. You may recall that we had a very successful social media event during this time last year. The members acquired through this campaign are now beginning to renew their memberships, and recent renewal rates are exceeding internal expectations.", "As I close, I want to emphasize our confidence in the merchandising and membership enhancements we\u2019ve made over the past year \u2013 including the transformation of our merchandise assortment and the launch of our Instant Savings book, which was ranked the #1 member benefit in fiscal year 14.", "With the intention of growing our member base, both through acquisition and retention, I\u2019m excited to announce the national rollout of Sam\u2019s Club Plus Member Cash Rewards, which goes into effect on June 12, 2014. This new benefit provides $10 for every $500 spent on qualifying purchases. All members will continue to receive Instant Savings offers; however, the benefit of Cash Rewards will be exclusively for Plus members. Coupled with the right merchandise and an exceptional experience, we believe Cash Rewards will further differentiate us from mass retailers and help bring us to parity within the club channel.", "Furthermore, we will launch a new cash-back credit card with MasterCard on June 23, 2014, offering cardholders the opportunity to earn 5% cash back on gas, 3% back on travel and dining, and 1% on everything else. This simple, industry leading program rewards members for everyday spend, making it even more valuable to be a Sam\u2019s Club member.", "We expect that investments like these will create a clear path for sustainable sales and member growth for the long term, but these investments, along with continued gross profit rate pressure, will be an operating profit headwind for the near term. We expect flat comp sales growth for the 13-week period ending August 1. This compares to a comp increase of 1.7% last year.", "Now, let me pass the mic over to Charles for our close. Charles?", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Roz.", "Let me wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some perspective on the quarter. First, we feel good about several aspects of our business.", "We added over $850 million in consolidated net sales. This included a $1.6 billion negative impact from foreign currency. We delivered earnings per share within our guidance, albeit the low end. Our earnings per share were impacted by the quarter\u2019s severe weather, along with a higher effective tax rate than we anticipated. Walmart U.S. comp sales results were within guidance. We experienced solid net sales growth in 4 out of our 5 major international markets. And, e-commerce sales grew approximately 27% on a global basis.", "Looking at the rest of the year, our teams have a clear focus on driving comp sales and delivering on our other growth initiatives. We\u2019re also committed to growing our store base. Net square footage increased to 1.1 billion square feet at the end of the first quarter, which is up 4 million square feet from the end of fiscal 2014. Because of our large base, the increase is 0.4%; however, the additional 4 million square feet is still significant.", "We continue to be excited about our e-commerce businesses and the rapid growth we\u2019re experiencing in this area. We continue to make progress through site enhancements, search capabilities and fulfillment, and we expect these improvements to continue. In fact, during the quarter, we opened 2 dedicated e-commerce fulfillment centers -- one in Pennsylvania and the other in Brazil.", "We\u2019ll also continue to make strategic acquisitions to build out our technology, talent and capabilities. To put things into perspective, over the last three years, we\u2019ve acquired 12 companies, which today serve as the driving force behind the innovative work our e-commerce teams are doing. Our acquisition earlier this month of Adchemy is a great example of how we\u2019re adding talent to @WalmartLabs, as well as enhancing our capabilities in areas like semantic search, data analytics and web marketing.", "To be clear, our investments are not only intended to attract e-commerce customers, but also to help them navigate and shop our physical stores. With nearly 11,000 stores, over 2.2 million associates worldwide and a growing presence of highly skilled engineers in Silicon Valley, we feel we are uniquely positioned to offer a best in class e-commerce experience.", "Although we were not able to leverage our expenses this quarter, we remain committed to maintaining a rigid focus on everyday low cost within our operations. This will enable us to continue our price investment.", "The change in our working capital, specifically inventory and accounts payable, was negative. This was partly caused by a shift in Easter versus last year within our International segment. However, we do have work to do within all segments to improve our working capital performance in the future. This will be an important focus over the next few quarters.", "Now, you\u2019re familiar with how we prioritize our capital, and the first is organic growth. Recall in the fourth quarter of last year, we increased our capital allocation plan for Walmart U.S. by $600 million to support our accelerated rollout of additional Neighborhood Markets and Walmart Express. Small stores continue to represent a great growth opportunity for us in many of our markets, including the U.S., Mexico and the U.K. Given our plan, expect capital expenditures to be heavier in the back half of the fiscal year.", "Our second priority is for strategic acquisitions. We always evaluate available acquisition opportunities that will add to our retail platform, support our operations or strengthen our e-commerce capabilities. Last, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "As Claire covered earlier, we used $1.5 billion to acquire most of the remaining outstanding shares of our Chilean operations. This affected the share repurchase amount for the quarter. It\u2019s important to remind you that we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders, and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases throughout the year.", "Next, let\u2019s move on to guidance. Based on our views of the macro-economic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect second quarter fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to range between $1.15 and $1.25. These estimates assume currency exchange rates remain at the current levels. As a reminder, our fiscal 2015 earnings per share guidance assumes $0.02 to $0.04 per share of incremental investment in e-commerce. We began to anniversary the expenses related to FCPA matters this quarter, and we continue to anticipate these expenses will range between $200 million and $240 million for the fiscal year.", "In addition, it\u2019s important to remember the following with regards to our second quarter guidance. First, as you heard from Bill, in the first quarter, we incurred more than $100 million of costs from higher benefit enrollment and utilization by our U.S. associates, as well as cost inflation. While associate enrollment does fluctuate, we continue to expect these costs to be a headwind of more than $300 million for the full year.", "Second, we will not cycle through SNAP reductions until the end of the third quarter for our U.S. businesses, and we will continue to invest in price for our customers and members.", "Third, we expect headwinds for the remainder of the year from our increased investment in the Sam\u2019s Club cash rewards program and the cash-back credit card that will both launch in June.", "Fourth, we continue to expect our fiscal 2015 effective tax rate to range between 32% and 34%. For the second quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be at the high end of this guidance. It\u2019s also important to remember that our rate tends to moderate toward the end of the fiscal year. Despite these headwinds, we remain cautiously optimistic about the second quarter and the balance of the year.", "Thank you for your interest in Walmart.

Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased that Wal-Mart delivered solid earnings per share of $1.21, well within our guidance range, and that our consolidated net sales increased more than $3.2 billion over last year to $119.3 billion.", "As I look at our second quarter results in the context of our overall strategy, we\u2019re encouraged by the performance of our small format stores and e-commerce, areas where we\u2019re investing significantly this year. But, we wanted to see stronger comps overall in Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club. Stronger sales in the U.S. businesses would\u2019ve helped our profit performance in the quarter. We can get better operationally and we will.", "In an environment where customers have so many choices about where to shop and how to buy, and many of them are feeling pressure on their budgets, we have to be at our best. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to deliver a compelling customer proposition of low prices and quality service for every transaction. For many years, we\u2019ve stressed that we run this business one store at a time, and that\u2019s still true today. So, we\u2019re investing in our stores during the rest of this year to deliver positive comp sales through operational excellence.", "Now, let me review the second quarter results. Wal-Mart International turned in a very solid performance, with operating income up over 9% on a constant currency basis. I\u2019m pleased with the work that Dave and his team have done to manage expenses, improve profitability and drive sales. On a constant currency basis, net sales rose more than 5%, and comp sales were positive in all but one international market. I\u2019m especially encouraged by the healthy sales improvements in some of our largest markets.", "Our Wal-Mart U.S. business added approximately $1.9 billion in net sales and delivered a flat comp. I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019re gaining traction on our goal to have a positive comp by year end, but I\u2019m not satisfied. Customers are responding to Neighborhood Markets, which delivered approximately 5.6% comps in the quarter. Operating income was pressured by investments in additional associate hours and by higher healthcare costs. We\u2019ll keep working during the back half of this year to get the combination of price investments and store associate hours right to deliver improved comp sales and serve our customers in a way that exceeds their expectations here in the U.S.", "Last month, we named Greg Foran the new CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. I\u2019ve worked closely with Greg for the past few years, and his depth of retail knowledge will serve our customers and associates well. As our company evolves, we\u2019re focused on delivering a customer-driven retail offering that drives sales. Greg is the best person to execute this strategy in the U.S., and I am thrilled to have him leading this effort. I also want to thank Bill for his years of service to Wal-Mart. His passion for our mission, dedication to our associates and our customers, and innovative thinking pushed us forward. From his vision of lowering the cost of prescription drugs to the progress we\u2019ve made with our small formats, Bill had a meaningful impact on our company for which we are grateful.", "Sam\u2019s Club delivered a flat comp this quarter, with net sales lower than expected. Operating income was lower than last year, due to the anticipated investment in Plus member Cash Rewards. I\u2019m encouraged by the solid growth in membership income this quarter, but I\u2019d like to see a positive comp. During a recent visit to a Sam\u2019s Club in Omaha, Nebraska, it was great to see associates energized about the club\u2019s back-to-college merchandise. They were eager to show the treasure hunt of on-trend color in home and apparel. They also helped members find the electronics and small appliances to accessorize a student\u2019s apartment. We\u2019re taking the right steps at Sam\u2019s Club to improve sales, with new merchandise offerings and localized assortment. We expect that our investment in new membership enhancements, such as Cash Rewards, will increase the membership line. Roz will cover how these programs will impact our profit comparisons over the next year.", "You\u2019ll hear more details from Neil in a few minutes, but there are some exciting things happening in e-commerce and mobile. I\u2019m really pleased that sales continued to be robust, growing approximately 24% this quarter. We saw double-digit e-commerce growth from our four most important markets: the U.S., U.K., China and Brazil. We continue to add exceptional talent to our teams through organic hiring and small acquisitions. To improve our customers\u2019 online experience, we recently started the rollout of a global technology platform. U.S. customers will appreciate the site\u2019s streamlined search and navigation functionality that personalize the user\u2019s experience. A better checkout process is coming in the near future.", "From a supply chain perspective, we\u2019ve started construction on another new e-commerce fulfillment center, this one in Indiana. Investments like these will allow timely and cost-effective delivery of merchandise to millions of additional customers.", "All of these initiatives are about changing with our customer. Our enterprise strategy dictates that we move with speed and agility to serve our customers more effectively. We\u2019re pushing to save them time and money, both in store and online. Because the lines between digital and physical retail have blurred, we must be nimble to adjust so that we can exceed customer expectations. Customers are rational. They respond to low prices, innovative products and the service they expect. So, we must run stronger stores everywhere we operate, with better merchandising, in-stock levels and quality service. I\u2019m confident that we can improve comp sales as we deliver on these priorities, and I\u2019m bullish on our core business. Supercenters are still relevant around the world and will play an important role for us for years to come. At the same time, we\u2019re broadening our smaller store base globally, and expanding our digital capabilities everywhere we operate. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to serve so many more customers and drive growth across the enterprise. I believe we\u2019re making good progress, but we\u2019ll keep pushing to evolve faster. Our customers expect this and we won\u2019t let them down.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire?", "Claire Babineaux-Fontenot", "Thank you, Doug. I\u2019ll take a few minutes today to provide commentary on the company\u2019s second quarter consolidated financial results, along with certain other items. Further details are available for your reference in the presentation on slides 2, 3 and 4.", "First, the dollar growth in consolidated net sales exceeded $3.2 billion during the quarter: that\u2019s over $3.9 billion on a constant currency basis. Next, earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.21 were well within our guidance.", "Consolidated membership and other income increased 8.2% to $789 million, primarily driven by strong growth in membership income at Sam\u2019s Club.", "Let\u2019s move on to expenses. Corporate and support expenses, which includes core corporate, global e-commerce support and global leverage services decreased 1.6%.", "Core corporate expenses decreased 6.9% during the quarter. FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $43 million, which represented approximately $31 million for the ongoing inquires and investigations and roughly $12 million related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.", "The growth in e-commerce support expenses was driven by our continued investment in talent, technology and fulfillment. You\u2019ll hear more from Neil about the exciting work under way in the e-commerce space.", "Our leverage services area includes the investments we are making in technology, such as finance and HR back office capabilities and risk and compliance management, including productivity initiatives.", "Net interest expense decreased 2.5% over last year. A reduction in interest related to the reversal of certain tax contingencies more than offset an increase to interest expense related to higher debt balances. We continue to anticipate that our net interest expense will be higher for the full year than last fiscal year.", "Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory increased 6.2%. You\u2019ll hear more about inventory from each of our operating segments.", "Payables as a percentage of inventory was 81%, which compares to 85.8% last year, due primarily to higher inventory balances and the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important, and each of our operating segments is focused on this priority.", "I\u2019ll close today by providing a bit of color around returns. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to a decrease in operating income, as well as our continued capital investment in store growth and e-commerce. Free cash flow increased primarily as a result of the timing of income tax payments and capital expenditures.", "Although the second quarter presented a few challenges, we had a number of bright spots about which we are encouraged. You heard Doug mention a few of these, and you\u2019ll hear more about them on the remainder of today\u2019s call.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg?", "Greg Foran", "", "Thank you, Claire. Let me begin by saying how honored and excited I am to lead the Wal-Mart U.S. business. I\u2019ve learned a great deal in 35 years as a retailer and look forward to learning more about the U.S. market and from our leadership team, our customers, and our 1.2 million U.S. associates. Now, let\u2019s talk results.", "Q2 comp sales performance came in as expected. However, our operating income results fell short of expectations, due in part to investments in wages, as well as healthcare expenses, which were above last year\u2019s levels and above our initial expectations.", "Let me provide some additional detail. In Q2, net sales for Wal-Mart U.S. grew $1.9 billion. For the 13-week period ended August 1st, we delivered a flat sales comp; and this was despite a SNAP-related headwind of about 70 basis points. Ticket was up 1.1%, while traffic was down 1.1%, a 30 basis point improvement over Q1. Our e-commerce business, including store-fulfilled sales, delivered double-digit sales growth and contributed approximately 30 basis points to the total Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales growth.", "Our comp sales results reflect mixed performances across the business. While food was flat, health & wellness delivered positive comps. Overall grocery was aided by price investments and continued inflation. However, deflation in consumables and industry softness in entertainment created an offsetting comp headwind.", "Overall, I\u2019m encouraged by our solid performance during seasonal events, especially during the Fourth of July holiday. I\u2019m also pleased with the consistent strength in Neighborhood Markets and continued market share gains. In the key category of \u2018food, consumables, & OTC,\u2019 we gained 37 basis points of market share for the 13 weeks ended July 19th, according to The Nielsen Company.", "For gross profit, we continued to invest in price, particularly in the categories of meat and health & wellness. That investment, blended with sales mix, resulted in a gross margin decline of 7 basis points versus last year. From an operating expense perspective, the most notable headwind came from healthcare costs, which led to a 32 basis point decline in expense leverage.", "Healthcare costs increased approximately $180 million versus last year and were well above our initial estimates. As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, the primary drivers of expense growth were increased associate enrollment and cost inflation. While enrollment was higher than anticipated, we\u2019re pleased our associates and their families continue to take advantage of our affordable healthcare opportunities. Near term, we expect continued pressure from health care and anticipate over $500 million in year-over-year expense growth for this fiscal year.", "During the quarter, we also allocated additional associate hours to specific areas of the store, such as front end, deli, bakery, and overnight stocking to improve overall customer service. We also sustained incremental labor expenses related to major department re-lays in entertainment and sporting goods. In total, salaries and wages were up more than $200 million compared to last year.", "The combination of gross margin investment and expense deleverage resulted in an operating income decrease of 2.4% for Q2. We expect operating income to remain challenged for the balance of this fiscal year, given the increased healthcare costs and our commitment to price investment and customer service.", "Now, let me cover the performance of our formats. During the quarter, we opened 35 supercenters, including 24 new units and 11 conversions through relocation or expansion. We plan to open, relocate, or expand about 115 supercenters for the fiscal year. In Q2, our supercenter fleet had a comp decline of approximately 30 basis points. We recognize the need to improve the performance and standards of this format to meet customers\u2019 expectations, and I\u2019ll discuss more about our strategic priorities in my closing remarks.", "Neighborhood Markets continued to perform well and delivered an approximate 5.6% sales comp for the 13-week period. Sales were particularly strong in pharmacy, produce, meat, and adult beverages. Comp store traffic grew 4.1%. During Q2, we opened 22 Neighborhood Markets and remain on track to deliver 180 to 200 new units for the year.", "Additionally, we continue to learn from our Wal-Mart Express format test and have seen continued solid comp sales performance. We\u2019ll continue to roll out this phase of our test, with approximately 90 stores expected to open this fiscal year.", "As a reminder, the majority of Neighborhood Market and Wal-Mart Express units are planned to open in late Q4. We expect this will create operating income headwinds from pre-opening expenses. We also expect higher inventory balances for the back half of the year related to these openings.", "Across our network, inventory was up 5% at the end of Q2. Over half the increase was attributed to new store growth, while the remainder was due in part to inflation and carrying incremental inventory from recent department re-lays and modular updates. Better inventory management will be a key focus point of mine.", "Now, I\u2019ll review the performance of our merchandise areas.", "In grocery, overall inflation accelerated around 60 basis points from Q1 to approximately 1.8% in Q2. Food delivered a relatively flat comp, driven by price investments in targeted categories and regions, solid performance during key seasonal events, and inflation, which was particularly strong in deli, dairy, produce, meat and seafood. However, we continued to face SNAP-related headwinds of approximately 1.6% to food, which we will cycle in November. Looking ahead, we\u2019re continuing to adapt to changing customer needs and will launch our opening price point private label, Price First, nationwide in late Q3. With regards to the consumables business, modest deflation and industry softness led to a low single-digit negative sales comp.", "Health & wellness maintained its strong performance from the first quarter, improving comp sales growth approximately 1.8% from Q1. Pharmacy prescriptions delivered a high single-digit positive comp, due to strong script count growth and double-digit% inflation in branded drugs. Script count growth was fueled by new contracts in Medicare and expanded Medicaid coverage. Over-the-counter merchandise also performed well, reporting a low single-digit positive comp driven by a sustained allergy season. With respect to health services, we opened 4 health clinics as part of a new test concept. These innovative primary care clinics offer customers affordable healthcare services, including $4 basic checkups for our associates. We expect to have about a dozen clinics open by the end of the fiscal year.", "Our general merchandise business remains impacted by persistent industry softness, particularly in entertainment, where we had an overall double-digit negative sales comp across online and stores. The team is working to mitigate these headwinds. They recently introduced a used video game offering that complements our existing trade-in program. We also re-laid the entertainment department, placing more focus on growth categories and product innovation. In the short term, the significant scope of the re-lay created a temporary business interruption that impacted Q2 results. However, we\u2019re confident this investment is right for the customer and will benefit sales in the back half of this fiscal year. In wireless, we\u2019ve experienced recent comp declines due to a lack of innovation in phone technology and our delay in system upgrades needed to process new carrier installment plans. We\u2019re working diligently to resolve this matter. Our re-lay and wireless impacts overshadowed several favorable results in Q2, including TV comp sales, which were up low single-digits, and VUDU, which was up double digits. Also, toys delivered a low single-digit positive comp due to strength in movie-based merchandise and sports play.", "In hardlines, we reported a low single-digit negative comp. While our online business continued to deliver strong double-digit sales growth, our retail stores\u2019 comp sales were down due largely to lapping last year\u2019s strong sporting goods performance. With respect to back-to-school, we\u2019re pleased with our early performance and the response to our in-store teacher appreciation promotion. This program provided a 10% discount on school supplies.", "In our softlines business, I\u2019m encouraged by the overall performance of national brands and the growth of our softlines e-commerce business.", "Apparel delivered a low single-digit positive comp. This was driven by national brands and new offerings that are resonating with our customer. For example, national brands, such as Russell Athletic and Avia, drove strong performance in active wear. In addition, customers responded positively to new items and improved value in our ladies assortment. Shoes benefitted from broad assortment, including items at strong rollback prices in seasonal categories and national brands.", "Our home business had a relatively flat comp driven by strength in e-commerce and national brands such as Farberware, Shark, and Keurig. This was offset by outdoor living, where we lapped a high single-digit positive comp from last year.", "From an e-commerce perspective, we\u2019re continuing to expand our dotcom fulfillment network and recently announced plans for our third fully dedicated e-commerce fulfillment center. This e-DC will open early in 2015 and be located near Indianapolis. Additionally, last week, we rolled out Savings Catcher nationwide, which leverages our data analytics capabilities to automatically match competitors\u2019 ads and strengthen customers\u2019 confidence that they are receiving the lowest advertised price on like items.", "Let me shift gears for a minute and discuss our U.S. manufacturing initiative. Bill took me through the terrific work accomplished thus far. I\u2019m excited about the project and remain dedicated to our 10-year, $250 billion commitment. On July 8th, we hosted a Made in the USA open call, facilitating over 800 meetings with more than 500 suppliers. Suppliers heard from senior leadership and participated in an education series related to doing business with Wal-Mart. The results of the event were outstanding, with over two-thirds of our supplier meetings resulting in an immediate decision to purchase products, or to consider them for future buys. Later today, I\u2019ll be meeting with even more suppliers in Denver following our Wal-Mart U.S. holiday meeting to build on the work so many people have already done in our Made in the USA program.", "Now as we end the Wal-Mart U.S. portion of the call, I would like to speak briefly about my assessment of the business and priorities.", "Wal-Mart U.S. is a great business, with a deep and rich heritage in serving our customers with a smile, in clean, tidy, well-merchandised stores, with terrific low prices and value. A cornerstone of our success has been our wonderful associates, from our stores to our DCs, our Home Office and e-commerce facilities. They still are.", "At the core are the Wal-Mart stores, and my initial efforts will focus on the core. We will deliver against these key customer requirements: being in stock, clean stores, the right price, the right items, improved service, better productivity. I will be out in stores hearing directly from our customers and our associates and tracking our performance. I\u2019m a competitive person, so I will be visiting the market place as well. We will look to build momentum.", "Concurrently, we must return to growth. In the early years, a good portion of the growth will come from the current core. However, the market place is changing and we will change with it. We have substantial capabilities and assets that position us for future opportunities in the e-commerce market and in new formats. We have been experimenting for years in both the U.S. and in International. I am confident that with a disciplined approach, we will capture more than our fair share of this opportunity.", "While it\u2019s early in the quarter, I\u2019m encouraged by a strong start to Q3. However, we know we\u2019re in a challenging retail environment, and it will take some work to continue moving in the right direction. Given that, we expect comp sales to be relatively flat for the 13-week period from August 2 through October 31, 2014.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn over to Dave for the International update. Dave?", "David Cheesewright", "Thank you, Greg. We appreciate all of the contributions you have made to our International businesses, and we are confident the Wal-Mart U.S. segment is in great hands.", "Every day, our associates continue to execute our key strategic initiatives. I\u2019m pleased to say that in the second quarter we delivered solid sales and profit growth, gaining market share in the majority of our markets. As I visit the markets, I see that customers are busier and changing more rapidly than ever before. Busy customers are telling us how they want to shop, and that they want us to do two things: save them time and save them money. They\u2019re looking for faster and, more importantly, convenient ways to shop. I\u2019m encouraged by our progress in driving innovation and accelerating growth in e-commerce to improve our offering and add convenience for our customers.", "The global economy remains challenged, which means the customer is also stretched. Price remains a critical factor in our customer\u2019s buying decisions. As an example, during a recent visit to Chile, I saw first-hand how important price is to our customers. Just a year ago, Wal-Mart Chile rolled out a mobile app, which allows customers to compare prices between Wal-Mart and competitors. We had almost 200,000 item scans in this quarter alone. We believe innovations like this and price position will continue to set us apart in the market place.", "We remain focused on price investment across all our markets and expect to continue driving improved comp performance. I\u2019m pleased with the trends in many of our markets, driven by a continued focus on being the lowest cost operator.", "In all countries except Brazil and China, our discussion of results is inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 7 and 8 of the presentation summarize financial details.", "For the second quarter, we grew operating income at a rate faster than sales on both a constant currency and reported basis. We are pleased that we\u2019ve grown operating income faster than sales for the full first half of the fiscal year. These results include the charge for certain non-income tax matters of $52 million disclosed in the second quarter of last year. Even excluding this charge, operating income grew faster than sales.", "Net sales grew 5.3% on a constant currency basis, or 3.1% on a reported basis. Sales benefited from the Easter shift, strategic price investments, improved assortment and e-commerce growth. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 9.3% and 8% on a reported basis, as most markets leveraged expenses.", "On a relative basis, we were encouraged by our market share performance. Of our five largest countries, only China didn\u2019t deliver positive comp sales. We also saw strong sales growth in Argentina, Chile, Japan and Africa.", "Inventory grew faster than sales this quarter and remains a key focus area. While a portion of the increase is related to World Cup promotional items or initiatives to drive sales in the back half of the year, I am disappointed with our position. Each market has a specific plan in place to address inventory.", "Now, let\u2019s discuss some market specifics. As you can see in the slide, net sales, operating income and comps are presented on a constant currency basis only.", "I will begin with a recap of our EMEA region, where we recently promoted Shelley Broader as the first female Regional President and CEO. Shelley brings a wealth of merchandising and operations experience and has already hit the ground running in this important region.", "The U.K. had a solid quarter, growing both net sales and comp sales despite a challenging market backdrop. Comp sales were up 2%, excluding fuel, and 0.5% including fuel. Despite aggressive price investments from competitors, we accelerated our performance and grew share ahead of the total market in the 12 weeks to June the 22nd, according to Kantar.", "In addition, The Grocer magazine designated Asda as \u201cBritain\u2019s Lowest Priced Supermarket\u201d for the seventeenth year in a row.", "During the quarter, operating profit declined slightly due to the lower margin mix, which was offset by strong cost control and productivity improvements.", "To satisfy the evolving shopping habits of customers, we introduced a more flexible management structure across all stores in June. The change places a greater emphasis on areas such as e-commerce and puts more associates on the shop floor, whilst removing historic back-office administration tasks.", "Strong e-commerce growth continued during the quarter, with sales up double digits. The rollout of Click & Collect to additional Asda superstores and collection sites, and the extension of store hours offer greater convenience for our customers.", "Next to Canada. With Shelley Broader\u2019s promotion, we are pleased to announce that Dirk Van den Berghe joined us August 1st as President and CEO of Wal-Mart Canada, bringing with him more than 30 years of international business experience and expertise in food retail.", "In the second quarter, Canada produced solid results in a very competitive environment. We were encouraged by our performance in food and consumables, driven by supercenter expansions. Canada net sales grew 2.9%. Comp sales were positive and improved over the first quarter, as Wal-Mart Canada\u2019s 20th Anniversary event in June favorably impacted results. Health and wellness sales also improved this quarter, with strong comps in OTC. Additionally, fresh offerings drove strong sales in food. We gained 50 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12 week period ended July 19. During the quarter, Wal-Mart Canada restructured its store associate management team to improve customer service and drive savings. Even with the impact of the restructuring charge, Canada leveraged expenses, continuing its strong focus on driving the productivity loop. However, operating income declined year over year due to headwinds in margin, from mix and price investments.", "Moving next to Latin America, we\u2019ll begin with Walmex. The Walmex summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported second quarter results on July the 23rd, under IFRS, so some numbers will differ from the Walmex reported numbers. The Walmex results discussed here exclude the impact of the sale of Vips, for which we recorded a $267 million gain in discontinued operations.", "Consolidated Walmex sales grew 5.0% and operating income grew 5.7%. Mexico alone grew sales 5.4%, with a comp sales increase of 1.2%. Sales were driven by a favorable Easter calendar flip and strong growth in self-service formats. The net result of the World Cup was relatively neutral overall, with solid sales in electronics prior to the event, but softer sales during the 4 weeks of the World Cup. Mexico leveraged expenses for the quarter. However, operating income continues to be impacted by challenges at Sam\u2019s Club and grew at a slower rate than sales.", "Mexico\u2019s self-service business plus Sam\u2019s Club, grew market share by 20 basis points, according to ANTAD for the quarter ending June the 30th. This performance was driven by our self-service formats, gaining 240 basis points. It\u2019s important to note that our small formats, such as Bodega Aurrera Express, and our stand-alone pharmacies continued to deliver strong double-digit comps and outperformed their market peers on food and consumables by 12.3%. We have a solid price position, and we will continue to invest thoughtfully in price throughout the second half of the year.", "To address challenges in Sam\u2019s Club, on May the 30th we announced organizational changes to simplify the structure and strengthen the business. Todd Harbaugh, who has more than 20 years of experience with Wal-Mart, including 11 years in the Sam\u2019s Club U.S. business, leads the club business, reporting directly to Scot Rank. The merchandising division for Sam\u2019s Club in Mexico was restructured into two areas, grocery and general merchandise, both led by seasoned executives. Our team is laying the groundwork for a more aggressive strategy to win back members and acquire new ones. We expect continued near-term challenges, but improvement in the longer term.", "Turning to our Mexico e-commerce business, we celebrated the first anniversary of the Wal-Mart.com.mx site launch. We are investing to double distribution capacity in time for the holiday season, and we\u2019ve completed online technology investments with the new mobile apps for both iOS and Android. We continue to integrate our e-commerce platform with stores to create a unique shopping experience. We added 116 kiosks for customers who feel more comfortable ordering and paying at the store. We\u2019re also accelerating the growth of our grocery home delivery business, leveraging the Superama experience to expand the offering to supercenters during the third quarter.", "Our efforts to rejuvenate performance in Mexico delivered positive results in the self-service formats during the quarter, and we have the right plans in place to continue to improve the overall business.", "Next, let\u2019s talk about Brazil, where we remain focused on turning around the business. Second quarter net sales rose 9.1%, with comp sales growing 9.7%, driven by a positive impact from the Easter flip and strong World Cup sales. We were encouraged by the sales performance of the food and consumables businesses and saw an improvement in general merchandise sales, largely driven by the World Cup. According to Nielsen, our market share declined for the quarter ending June 30 driven in part by store closures within the last 12 months. However, we grew comp sales faster than our largest competitor.", "We continued to invest in store integration in Brazil and converted an additional 80 stores this quarter to the new systems. Integration efforts simplify and standardize operational processes, giving better visibility to business results and reducing compliance risk. We are on track to have all stores fully integrated by the end of next year. Despite these integration costs, we leveraged expenses for the quarter, as the team is doing a great job focusing on operational productivity. Operating income was positive.", "Moving to Asia. Wal-Mart China\u2019s net sales grew 1.1%, although comp sales declined 1.6%. We continue to face significant headwinds from government austerity programs, as well as price deflation in some key categories. Despite the top line challenges, market share increased in the hypermarket category for the quarter ended June 30, and we maintained market share compared to all modern trade in China, according to Nielsen.", "China\u2019s business transformation program continues to deliver substantial operational benefits, allowing us to invest in price and improve our competitive position. We grew operating income significantly over this quarter last year.", "Wal-Mart China introduced a home delivery service in 383 stores, and customer feedback has been very positive. Average ticket for home delivery was significantly higher than the average store visit for the quarter. We are building a platform for sustainable growth in China, and we\u2019ve been working on innovative ways to deliver the best experience for our customers.", "Now, let\u2019s talk more specifically about our e-commerce sales. We are very excited about the innovation and growth in our e-commerce businesses around the world. As I mentioned earlier, Mexico celebrated the first anniversary of Wal-Mart.com.mx in June. Traffic grew to nearly triple last year\u2019s volume, positioning Wal-Mart.com as one of the fastest growing e-commerce retail businesses in Mexico and the third most visited, according to comScore. In the U.K., same day grocery Click & Collect is now available in most Asda superstores and 188 Click & Collect sites, and total U.K. e-commerce sales were up over 20% from a year ago. Admittedly, off a low base, Canada grew e-commerce sales by triple digits, with an expanded merchandise offer and improved customer experience. Additionally, in July we launched e-commerce sales in India to supply wholesale goods to small local businesses. The initial read in India was good, and we launched ahead of our competitors.", "Yihaodian, our e-commerce platform in China, grew traffic again this quarter by triple digits, and ticket growth remains strong. Net sales grew double digits. Strong sales growth in wireless and appliances drove favorable results in the quarter. In Brazil, we again saw double digit e-commerce sales growth, with very strong growth in wireless and games.", "Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the first half results. Despite continued economic challenges and a stretched consumer, we remain well positioned in our markets for the back half of the year. We continue to be optimistic about the future and our teams around the world remain focused on our key initiatives.", "So, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz?", "Rosalind Brewer", "Thank you, Dave. Performance at Sam\u2019s Club improved this quarter, with approximately 50 basis points of comp acceleration versus Q1. Our business is foundationally solid and over the past year, we\u2019ve been transforming Sam\u2019s Club, with new membership enhancements, elevated merchandise, increased multichannel access, and a heightened use of data and analytics. There is still work to do, but we remain confident that these efforts will serve as a catalyst for our business, increasing the long-term value of being a member.", "Our top priority at Sam\u2019s Club remains growth \u2013 growing our member base and growing sales. While our top line sales growth of 1.7%, without fuel, was modest, membership income grew 11.9% in the second quarter, with Plus member renewals a primary driver. This growth is more impressive considering we have now lapped the fee increase initiated last year in May.", "As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re taking steps to increase the value of membership. This includes our investment in two new membership enhancements, Plus member Cash Rewards and Sam\u2019s Club cash-back MasterCard, both launched a little over a month ago. This new MasterCard comes with chip-enabled technology, making the card more difficult to duplicate and providing additional security from fraudulent activity for our members.", "It\u2019s still early days, but member response has been positive. But, what I\u2019m most proud of is how the associates have rallied behind these programs by building relationships with members and communicating the combined value of both programs.", "As Doug indicated, these investments help lay the groundwork for future comp sales growth; however, they also pose an operating profit headwind over the next 12 months. The impact of recent investments, such as Plus member Cash Rewards, can be seen in our financial results, reducing both our gross profit rate and operating income. Further, we expect that this headwind may accelerate in the coming quarters as our Plus penetration grows.", "Now, a few thoughts on our performance during the second quarter. When we spoke last, I shared that Q1 got off to a slow start, as members were hindered by poor weather, and our clubs were impacted by higher utility costs. Our lower income Savings members were most impacted, and traffic slowed across the country.", "In Q2, however, Savings member traffic improved, progressing towards more historical levels of low single-digit positives. Their growth helped support the 50 basis point comp improvement that I mentioned earlier. The Business member remains pressured, delivering negative comp growth this quarter. Overall, comp traffic growth of 0.3% was offset by a comp ticket decline of 0.3%, netting out to a flat comp for the 13-week period.", "So, let me walk you through the financial results, excluding fuel. For results with fuel, please reference the supplemental presentation.", "Net sales grew 1.7% to $13.0 billion. Operating income declined this quarter by 10.2% to $466 million, due to a decrease in gross profit rate and an increase in operating expenses. Operating income, with fuel, declined 4.6%.", "Our gross profit rate declined 50 basis points this quarter, with 23 basis points of the decline attributable to our investment in Cash Rewards. We planned and prepared for this cost; however, the additional rate pressures from mix and price investments intensified the decline.", "Operating expenses grew faster than sales this quarter by 18 basis points. Several factors contributed to our inability to leverage, including higher healthcare benefits costs versus last year and increased real estate expenses associated with opening 5 new clubs this quarter, versus 1 new club during this time a year ago. Membership and other income grew 10.5%, driven by upgrades and Plus renewals. Late in the quarter, we launched a social media initiative to drive new membership growth. We had almost 130,000 people respond to the offer, which ran from July 21 to August 1. While the majority of the offer redemptions will cross into the third quarter, we have been pleased by the number of new members who have already come into the club to officially activate their memberships.", "Inventory management remains a priority for us, with inventory increasing 4.7% this quarter. Builds for new clubs and an earlier set for fall seasonal merchandise contributed to the growth.", "Now on to our merchandising results. Our buyers have been working hard to elevate our merchandise assortment, procuring new items at incredible values for our members. We\u2019ve seen good results in areas of the business where we have introduced these new items, such as \u201chealthy-for-you\u201d snacks and apparel. Some of our core categories like tobacco, wireless, and candy, however, remain pressured.", "Fresh / freezer / cooler delivered a positive low single-digit comp, led by solid performance in dairy, fresh meat, and cooler areas. A competitive pricing position and successful 4th of July holiday weekend boosted our fresh meat comp, as members responded to our high-quality assortment of steak, ground beef, and chicken. We continue to see inflation in dairy; however, unit growth was minimally impacted.", "Grocery and beverage posted a negative low single-digit comp. The snacks category continues to perform well, driven by \u201chealthy-for-you\u201d indulgences within nuts, trail mixes, chips and popcorn. We are pleased with our recent efforts to assort clubs based on member preferences within wine and spirits, representing over 100 basis point improvement in comp performance over the prior quarter. The growth was tempered by declines in candy and beverages, which were hindered by the deceleration in Business member traffic.", "Ancillary, which includes tobacco, declined low single-digits. Tobacco comp sales decelerated, despite a May price increase, with units down mid-single digits.", "Health and wellness delivered a positive low single-digit comp. The overall category was lifted by the high single-digit comp in pharmacy, as investments in member value and awareness over the past several quarters continue to drive growth. Within optical, an increased focus on opportunistic buys resulted in a strong assortment of new \u201cfashion sun wear\u201d items \u2013 all at a great value for our members. Over-the-counter is a focus area, as we continue to lap extremely strong prior year performance in diet and nutrition items. We have recently introduced several new items in OTC, including new nutrition bars for our health-conscious members, and initial results are promising.", "Some of the consumable categories, such as pets and laundry, struggled this quarter, as we continue the transition to newness. This transition period resulted in a negative low single-digit consumables comp. However, our long-term focus on higher quality, better pack-size value and newness continues to accelerate results in the disposable tabletop and paper goods categories, leading to double-digit share gains over the 52-weeks ended July 19, as measured by The Nielsen Company.", "While still a negative high single-digit comp overall, we are beginning to see comp improvement within our technology and entertainment subcategories. Our merchants have been surrounding core items, like TVs, with new and exciting tech items, and the results are beginning to show. For example, we\u2019ve added new SKUs within the portable audio category, which had a positive effect on the quarter. We\u2019ve seen comp declines in wireless, as system upgrade delays have affected our ability to provide new carrier installment plans. Home, apparel, and hardlines reported a positive mid-single-digit comp this quarter, led by a strong double-digit comp in kitchen electrics and a high single-digit comp in mattresses. You may recall that mattresses struggled last quarter, underperforming in areas of the country most impacted by weather. Our merchants worked hard to change their approach this quarter, adding a new king size SKU to our assortment with a strong price-point. Member response was clearly positive! Apparel and jewelry continued their exceptionally strong track record \u2013 delivering their fifth straight quarter of positive comps.", "Samsclub.com delivered another solid quarter, contributing approximately 30 basis points to the total segment comp. Double-digit sales growth was seen in both direct-to-home and Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull formats, and conversion rates improved across all access points.", "This quarter, we re-launched all four mobile platforms, providing easier access and simplified shopping for our members. This includes a completely new iPhone app launched in June, with features that allow Plus members to check their Cash Rewards balance on-the-go. Based on member insights, the mobile team is now releasing new enhancements and updates every 4-6 weeks to ensure the best possible experience.", "Speaking of experience, our operations team recently launched a new in-club initiative to provide \u201clegendary member service.\u201d At Sam\u2019s Club, our members have a higher expectation of service because they pay to shop our clubs. The \u201clegendary member service\u201d concept is simple \u2013 we want to ensure that our members are engaged and have a memorable shopping experience with us.", "We continue to be optimistic about the future of Sam\u2019s Club, knowing that we have laid the groundwork for success. We expect comp sales to be slightly positive for the 13-week period ending October 31. This compares to a 1.1% comp increase last year.", "Just one week ago, we hosted our annual holiday meeting with our field management teams here in Bentonville, Arkansas. Let me tell you, the teams left feeling energized and ready to serve our members. At every level of the organization, we\u2019re laser-focused on 3 key priorities: continued elevation of our merchandise assortment, growing our member base, and strengthening e-commerce, which includes mobile. We\u2019re building momentum at Sam\u2019s Club and remain confident in our ability to deliver positive comp sales during the second half of the year.", "I\u2019ll now pass it over to Neil. Neil?", "Neil Ashe", "", "Thanks, Roz. Our e-commerce businesses made significant progress on our strategies and delivered a number of customer-focused enhancements in our core markets. Globally, e-commerce sales grew approximately 24% in the second quarter. I\u2019m excited about the capabilities we\u2019ve delivered and how we are integrating the digital and physical worlds to offer customers easier and more convenient ways to shop. We\u2019re working closely with the operating segments around the world to make all of this happen.", "Looking at Wal-Mart U.S., we saw double-digit sales growth, and we continued to outpace the e-commerce market overall. The major highlight was that we started to roll out a new Wal-Mart.com site experience. To the consumer, it\u2019s simpler, it\u2019s faster and it\u2019s easier shopping experience. But, it also represents a major technical feat that involves a top-to-bottom rebuild of our entire global technology platform. I\u2019m also really excited about the rollout of Savings Catcher. It\u2019s a perfect demonstration of how we are integrating digital and physical experiences to do the work for our customers, and it reinforces their trust in Wal-Mart\u2019s low prices.", "The Sam\u2019s team is moving aggressively on enhancing the digital and physical experience for members. The new iPad app is getting rave reviews from the members, going from 3.7 stars to 4.5 stars in the app store. We\u2019re also seeing great momentum in the office category and with the Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull program that allows members to order online and pick up in a club.", "We had double-digit sales growth in Brazil, in Mexico and Chile, and triple-digit growth in Canada and Argentina. Of course, we saw a lot of TV sales leading up to the World Cup, but the pleasant surprise was the sales lift in games as a result of good demand for consoles.", "In China, Yihaodian delivered high double-digit growth rates in sales for the quarter, and its focus continues to be on the quality of the customer experience. To support these efforts, we completed 40 projects in the quarter, including Customized Message Services for customer support. And, our customer satisfaction reached a new high of 97.7%. Yihaodian\u2019s marketplace business 1Mall also more than doubled.", "In addition to the successes in each market, we\u2019re seeing great progress on building out a world-class e-commerce organization and delivering on our strategic initiatives.", "On the talent side, we continued to strengthen our Global eCommerce leadership team. Fernando Madeira, who was our President of Latin America eCommerce, became President and Chief Executive Officer of Wal-Mart.com, with responsibility for the U.S., Latin America and further growth of Wal-Mart.com.", "We also created a new Chief Operating Officer role for Global eCommerce and are thrilled that Michael Bender, formerly president of the West for Wal-Mart U.S., is now in this role. He will drive operational excellence as we scale our e-commerce businesses and will oversee the expansion of our next-generation fulfillment networks.", "With these additions and others, I feel great about the depth and breadth of experience at the leadership level, as well as throughout our organization. We\u2019ve continued to have great success in hiring some of the best technologists in Silicon Valley and around the world. And, we supplemented our hiring with small, targeted acquisitions, including Adchemy, Stylr and Luvocracy this past quarter.", "Our talent density is helping us deliver best-in-class technology. We\u2019ve talked about our global technology platform and how it is a top-to-bottom rebuild of everything that powers our e-commerce sites and businesses around the world.", "We\u2019ve been delivering a lot of elements of the tech platform this year, but most of those have been technology that customers don\u2019t see, sitting under the hood. What they will now start to see is a new site experience for Wal-Mart.com in the U.S. We previewed the site at a mom blogger day at our Sunnyvale office, and they loved it. One of them, Leticia, was saying how visually appealing the site looked and how much easier it was to find products. Input from customers helped us design the site and will help us continue to make it even better.", "The tech platform gives us much greater speed and flexibility. Changes to the site can be made in minutes versus days, so we can innovate, test, iterate and deploy new capabilities in real time. The site has much more personalization, and each customer\u2019s experience is always changing with fresh content that helps them discover new items. We\u2019ve built our own personalization engine to customize the experience. Customers now receive relevant options and recommendations, while they are on the site, and via email and text messages. And, given that more 30 than half of traffic to Wal-Mart.com is coming from mobile devices, we designed the site to adapt to any size device, particularly tablets. In addition to the new global technology platform, we\u2019ve been focused on building our next-generation fulfillment networks around the world to deliver orders faster and more efficiently. We have a new large-scale fulfillment center under construction in Indiana, which will complement those we\u2019ve opened in Texas and Pennsylvania in the past 12 months. We also enabled 20 more stores to fulfill online orders during the quarter, and 20% of units ordered on Wal-Mart.com are now shipped from stores. Our algorithms are helping to determine the optimal shipping point, whether from an online fulfillment center, a store DC or a store. And, in Brazil, we opened a new fulfillment center in Cajamar that is now fully operational. We will announce additional fulfillment centers around the world over the coming months.", "We\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making on our strategic goals, and our investments are delivering for Wal-Mart\u2019s customers. We are pleased that we are growing faster than the market. And, this growth is coming during a time that we are rebuilding almost every aspect of our e-commerce businesses \u2013 building out our team, new global tech platform and next generation fulfillment networks. We expect to see fluctuations as we go through this work, and we\u2019re keeping our eye on the long-term. We started the year with a goal of 30% full-year sales growth. We\u2019re expecting that growth to be in the mid-20s. And, we expect higher growth in our third-party marketplace businesses.", "The opportunity for e-commerce is clear and we are stepping up our investment in our e-commerce businesses for the rest of the year.", "I will now turn it over to Charles for guidance. Charles?", "Charles Holley", "", "Thanks, Neil. We are now half-way through this fiscal year, and while we have some challenges, we are encouraged by several aspects of our business. Let me cover those examples. During the quarter: Consolidated net sales increased more than $3.2 billion, with Wal-Mart U.S. contributing $1.9 billion of the increase. Wal-Mart International delivered a solid performance, with positive comp sales in all but one market and strong operating income. Earnings per share of $1.21 were well within our guidance. Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the quarter and the year were flat, an improvement over the prior year\u2019s string of negative comps. We\u2019re also pleased that traffic improved. And, e-commerce sales grew approximately 24% on a global basis.", "The challenges that we face are reflected in our revised guidance, and I will go through those now. In addition to continuing global macro-economic challenges, there are several specific items that will continue to be headwinds for us in the back half of this year.", "First, during the quarter, our U.S. healthcare costs increased $180 million versus last year and were well ahead of our initial estimates. This increase is a result of higher enrollment by our U.S. associates and families, as well as healthcare cost inflation. Enrollment does fluctuate with our hiring. As a result of this increased expense, we now anticipate the impact to be approximately $500 million for the fiscal year, which is approximately $170 million higher than our original estimate of approximately $330 million provided in February. That estimate was included in our full year earnings per share range of $5.10 to $5.45. Second, as you just heard from Neil, e-commerce is particularly important to both our customers and our company\u2019s future, and we will continue to invest in areas such as technology, talent, and fulfillment. As a result, our fiscal 2015 earnings per share now assumes $0.05 to $0.07 of incremental investment versus our prior guidance of $0.02 to $0.04. I would like to add that, although we are slightly revising our e-commerce sales growth to 25% for this year, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress we are making on our strategic goals.", "From a tax perspective, the estimate of our full-year effective tax rate remains between 32 and 34%. For the third quarter, we expect our rate to be around 34%. While historically our rate tends to moderate toward the end of the fiscal year, it\u2019s important to remember that assessments of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits and the impact of discrete items could affect our rate. We are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2013, which if not passed, could drive our effective tax rate towards the high end of our estimated range for the full year.", "As we shared with you last quarter, we are investing in Sam\u2019s Club this year. We will continue to support our two new membership enhancements at Sam\u2019s with investments in the Plus member Cash Rewards and the cash-back MasterCard, which both launched in June. As Roz indicated earlier, while these investments will position the business better for the long term, they do pose an operating profit headwind over the next year.", "Taking all of these factors into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the full year to range between $4.90 and $5.15 per share, versus our prior guidance of $5.10 to $5.45. This assumes third quarter EPS to range between $1.10 and $1.20 versus $1.14 last year. Our estimates assume that currency exchange rates remain at current levels.", "Now, before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I would like to address a few additional items. Returning value to our shareholders is clearly one of our financial priorities. In the second quarter, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $307 million of our shares. Our operating results heavily influenced our share repurchase activity. As we look at the level of share repurchase for the first half and the remainder of this year, it is important to remember that we spent $1.5 billion to acquire most of the remaining outstanding shares of our Chilean operations, and that we committed an additional $600 million to accelerate small format openings in the U.S.", "The change in our working capital, specifically inventory and accounts payable, negatively impacted our cash from operations. Improving our working capital performance is a priority for all of our operating segments.", "With that, thank you for your continued support and interest in our company.

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2015. The date of this call is November 13, 2014. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way.

Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call.", "Our press release and a transcript of this call are available on our corporate website stock.walmart.com. Additionally, a supplemental presentation that summarizes our key financial results should be used with this call. That presentation appears at the end of the transcript. We believe the presentation provides a more streamlined approach to reviewing our financial performance and prior year comparisons. Unit count data, which is updated monthly, is posted separately on the investors\u2019 portion of the website, under Financial Reporting. It is worth noting that last Wednesday, we opened our 5,000 unit in the United States, a Neighborhood Market in Greenbriar, Arkansas.", "In the Walmart U.S. discussion today, we refer to traditional Neighborhood Markets, which are grocery stores that average 43,000 square feet and include a pharmacy. The smaller Neighborhood Markets we refer to are those ranging in size from 12,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet and are what we formerly called Walmart Express stores. As we previously announced, existing Express stores are being rebranded this quarter to Neighborhood Market. Going forward, the Neighborhood Market brand will be used for the grocery small format, regardless of square footage, unless otherwise noted in our financial releases. In Walmart International, we provide results and commentary primarily on our five largest markets by revenue.", "For fiscal 2015, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar, with our Q3 reporting period from August 2 through October 31, 2014. A week-by-week comp reporting calendar is available under the comp sales link on the investors\u2019 portion of our website. We will report a 13-week comp for this fiscal year\u2019s fourth quarter versus the 14-week comp period we reported last year. For information regarding terms used in today\u2019s release including EPS, constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, refer to our website. Throughout the discussion of our e-commerce performance, we also are referring to results on a constant currency basis.", "We announced our earnings reporting calendar for next fiscal year and those dates are posted on our website as well. So let\u2019s get to our agenda for today\u2019s call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will cover key results and provide his thoughts about our enterprise strategy and the business. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer will cover the financial details for the quarter. Then we will cover our segment results. Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. will kick things off. He will be followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International, and then Roz Brewer, our President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s CFO will wrap up with a focus on our guidance for the fourth quarter and the full-year.", "Now, I\u2019m very pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon to kick off the call. Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Walmart reported solid earnings per share of $1.15 in the third quarter, and our consolidated net sales increased $3.2 billion over the same period last year to $118.1 billion. I\u2019m encouraged that Walmart U.S. reported a positive comp for the quarter and that our Neighborhood Market stores continued to show strong sales. Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s and International\u2019s operating income grew faster than sales growth, and global e-commerce sales increased about 21%. But we need to continue to improve the customer experience both in our stores and online to deliver stronger sales growth and strengthen our bottom line performance.", "Now, let\u2019s review our third quarter results in more detail. Walmart U.S. added $2.3 billion in net sales. Since the beginning of this year, you\u2019ve heard me say that our focus was on delivering a positive comp by year-end. I\u2019m encouraged that comp sales were positive in Q3, but we are still not satisfied. We have areas to improve, including in the customer experience and in our price leadership position and we are taking the steps necessary to fix these areas. Greg and the leadership team are intensely committed to driving short-term improvement through the urgent agenda items and he will share an update on this important work.", "Operating income declined due to increased healthcare expenses, investments in e-commerce, and investments in price. Walmart U.S. appeals to customers across all income levels, and they all want to get the best value. Our Savings Catcher program continues to help us reach more of these value-driven customers. The cost relief from lower fuel prices presents a potential benefit for customers and could continue to help them during this holiday shopping season in addition to helping our own business.", "Sam\u2019s Club delivered strong operating income growth this quarter, due primarily to an increase in membership income and expense leverage. We would like to see stronger sales, but I\u2019m encouraged by the progress in membership and the strong pace of renewals by our Plus Members. Members are responding to our ongoing investments in merchandise and in services, as well as the overall membership value proposition.", "Walmart International turned in a solid performance, growing operating income faster than sales, one of our key metrics. I\u2019m especially pleased by the sales improvements this quarter in Canada, both sequentially and over last year. The investments we\u2019ve made to remodel our stores and drive supercentre expansion are resonating with customers. During the quarter, I traveled to Asia to see how things are progressing in China and Japan. In a supercenter in Beijing, customers shared how they appreciate the quality of our fresh meats and produce. I got a kick out of watching our associates show our Chinese customers how to use avocados to make guacamole. The world is shrinking right before our eyes.", "While our customer feedback in China is improving, one customer when asked what we could do better, mentioned she can sometimes find diapers and formula cheaper online. Customers all over the world are integrating how they shop. They don\u2019t see the same lines of separation some of us might focus on and this is a great opportunity for Walmart. Increasingly, we are seeing it just how they do. In Japan, our customers are responding to value. It\u2019s clear why our comp sales have been better when you walk these stores and see the items and prices. Our fresh food in Japan looks great.", "Last week, I dropped into some stores in Chicago including a new Neighborhood Market in an urban area. A customer stopped me to thank us for the value we\u2019ve brought to his community and it was interesting for me to see some of the similarities and differences of our fresh food offer compared to what I\u2019d seen in Japan. We are learning across markets and can do even more of that to improve our fresh offering in all of our markets. It\u2019s a key point in our enterprise strategy going forward. In that same store, another customer strongly encouraged us to add more organic produce. She was right; we needed more. We\u2019re seeing opportunities large and small to get better.", "Interactions like this often remind me how similar our customers are around the world. Everyone is interested in getting quality products at a value. Walmart makes a difference in people\u2019s lives. From a customer perspective, the lines between digital and physical retail have blurred. For me, it was another reminder of the great opportunity we have to use our 11,000 stores and digital capabilities globally to save our customers money and time. With our goal of greater access and an improved customer experience, we are strengthening our e-commerce and mobile capabilities. This is an investment period for Walmart, which can create short-term turbulence in service and impacts our e-commerce sales.", "This quarter, we saw solid e-commerce growth from our key markets and we are pleased with the progress in markets like Mexico and Canada. We continue to roll out our new global technology platform to provide streamlined search and navigation functionality. And, construction continues on our new fulfillment centers in the U.S. and Brazil. I\u2019m excited about all the opportunity we will have to serve customers in new and better ways as we get these global e-commerce capabilities fully installed.", "As you heard at our Annual Investor Meeting last month, we are focused on an enterprise strategy designed to deliver a seamless shopping experience for our customers. It\u2019s what they want and we will give it to them. This strategy includes four customer dimensions: price, assortment, experience and access. Being the price leader across a broad basket of goods is important because value conscious customers from all income demographics around the world want to save money. We\u2019re also focused on having the right assortment, both in store and online.", "Our customers want to be able to buy just about anything from us, so we are expanding our e-commerce assortment to give them that opportunity. In the area of service, we\u2019re investing to provide a shopping experience at Walmart that exceeds customer expectations. For access, we are developing the capabilities to save our customers time and give them the choices they want by integrating digital and physical retail in ways that are convenient for what they want at that moment.", "The way these four dimensions come together represents our plan to win. We\u2019ll be able to give customers what they want and how they want it. We\u2019re thankful to be able to continue our progress addressing challenges in key areas of global responsibility. We have a great team of associates. Walmart creates a ladder of opportunity for each of us. We promote a lot of associates each year to jobs of greater responsibility and higher pay. Whether your job is to serve customers in Beijing, Tokyo or Chicago, you can grow in your role and build a career at Walmart.", "In our communities around the world, I\u2019m pleased that both our customers and associates will help make the holidays and the New Year brighter for those less fortunate. Through partnerships with organizations like CARE, Salvation Army, Feeding America and Operation Homefront, Walmart is giving back to the communities we serve. As I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we made in the third quarter. Saving people money and time drives our decisions. The future looks bright for Walmart. We\u2019re making the necessary changes and moving with appropriate speed to exceed our customers\u2019 expectations.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire?", "Claire Babineaux-Fontenot", "Thanks, Doug. I\u2019ll cover results of the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation released today as a part of the earnings transcript. Total revenue for the quarter exceeded $119 billion, as consolidated net sales increased $3.2 billion, or 2.8% along with membership and other income growth of 13.9%. Consolidated operating expenses increased 3.5%, primarily due to continued investments in wages and higher U.S. healthcare-related expenses. FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $41 million, which represents approximately $30 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and approximately $11 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $69 million for the third quarter. Through the third quarter of this year, we have spent $137 million on FCPA and compliance-related costs versus our guidance of between $200 and $240 million. We expect to be near the low end of the guidance for the full-year.", "As you may see on Slides 2 and 3, net interest expense increased 13.1% for the quarter. This is primarily the result of the reclassification of certain store leases from operating to capital. Additionally, the company\u2019s effective tax rate was 31.8%, below our previous guidance of around 34% due to certain discrete tax matters. So while we benefited in the quarter from a lower tax rate than anticipated, this benefit was offset by a number of discrete charges. In addition to the capital lease interest charges, we had some unique operating expenses in the quarter, which include organizational restructuring charges in the UK and Hurricane Odile losses in Mexico. Dave will discuss those later.", "From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 3.7%. Later in today\u2019s call, you will hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 77.0%, which compares to 79% last year due primarily to higher inventory balances and the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important, and each of our operating segments is focused on this priority. I will conclude today with a comment about returns. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to a decrease in operating income, as well as our continued investment in store growth and e-commerce initiatives. Free cash flow increased primarily as a result of timing of income tax payments and capital expenditures.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg. Greg?", "Greg Foran", "Thank you, Claire. Over my first 100 days, I\u2019ve been visiting our stores and competition across the country and evaluating the U.S. business landscape. I\u2019ve spent time with our frontline associates and leadership teams, and I\u2019m encouraged by what I see. There are some areas where we really are excelling and our performance reflects this. However, I still know we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. To summarize the U.S. business as I see it today, comps have improved, but sales and operating cost headwinds remain, impacting both top and bottom line performance.", "We will partially offset these headwinds in the fourth quarter by making progress on the urgent agenda items that I presented at the Investor Meeting last month. We have opportunities to become better shopkeepers, to execute the everyday business better. And finally, we are developing long-term plans for the business. These actions will take time, but I believe they will make us a stronger business, and allow us to sustainably grow beyond our fair share of opportunity.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to this quarter\u2019s performance. Net sales grew $2.3 billion, or 3.4%. For the 13-week period ended October 31, comparable sales were up 0.5%. This is the first positive comp for the Walmart U.S. business in seven quarters despite approximately 70 basis points of impact from SNAP-related headwinds. Ticket was up 1.2%, while traffic declined 0.7%. Note that traffic improved 40 basis points from Q2 and 70 basis points from Q1. Within the business, we\u2019ve had several areas driving top line growth. First, we\u2019re encouraged by sales performance during key seasonal events. We started the quarter with a strong back-to-school program across categories in apparel, home, and traditional back-to-school supplies. And we ended the quarter well, executing a strong Halloween event. This led to positive performance in seasonal categories, including costumes, seasonal d\u00e9cor, and candy.", "Throughout the quarter, we experienced comp sales growth in home and apparel, driven by newness across the categories. We have a strong good/better/best strategy, accented by strong brands, which translated into positive results. Health and wellness continued to be a bright spot for us driven by double-digit branded drug inflation and script count growth, due to the more preferred Medicare plans. OTC was also strong in categories, such as pain management and seasonal allergy.", "Within store formats, we are pleased by the Neighborhood Market performance particularly in our traditional format, which reported approximately a 5.5% positive comp for the quarter. Pharmacy and consumables continued to produce strong growth, as we focused on in-stock and optimizing the store with relevant offerings for the customer. In our e-commerce business, we are being thoughtful about sustainable growth in this channel. E-commerce, including store-fulfilled sales, contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp. Whilst our comp performance shows some progress, we still have opportunity to improve.", "Our overall grocery comp, which includes food and consumables was relatively flat. Net inflation increased approximately 210 basis points versus last year, primarily led by meat and dairy. Offsetting the majority of this inflation were SNAP-related headwinds and customers trading down in high-inflation categories. In the key category of food, consumables, and OTC, we gained a small increase in market share for the 13 weeks ended October 25, according to The Nielsen Company.", "Entertainment had a high single-digit negative comp. This was driven by industry softness and deflation and further compounded by lapping major releases last year in video games and movies. Additionally, a delayed launch in our wireless systems capabilities impacted our ability to offer mobile handset installment plans. We expect these systems to be in place in Q4. We are, however, encouraged by early results from the recent relay of the entertainment department and have seen quarter-over-quarter improvements in key categories.", "Overall, I would characterize the quarter\u2019s sales performance as mixed. Whilst I\u2019m encouraged by several emerging trends and I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about our Q4 top line performance, I know we have additional work to improve down our side counters and within our everyday business. Shifting to the remainder of our financial results, gross profit rate declined 22 basis points. This was driven primarily by pharmacy cost inflation and reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates. Additionally, we\u2019ve continued price investment in key categories such as meat and preferred Medicare plans in pharmacy.", "Operating expenses were primarily impacted by higher healthcare- related costs versus last year. Additionally, we were purposeful not to overextend wage leverage, while focusing on improving customer service. Overall, operating expenses deleveraged 10 basis points and coupled with the decline in gross margin rates and ongoing investments in e-commerce led to a 1.2% decrease in operating income.", "Let\u2019s move next to inventory, which was up 5.2% at the end of Q3. More than half of this was due to new store growth and a conscious decision to flow inventory through our diversified import network early for the upcoming holiday season. This allowed us to minimize risk of delays and mitigate impact to our holiday business. We\u2019ve taken recent actions with respect to reducing inventory, but it\u2019s too early to see any significant impact. However, we are reasonably confident that we will see an improvement in inventory levels over the next year.", "Now, let me discuss our real estate actions this quarter. We opened 49 supercenters, including 33 new and 16 conversions, as well as 28 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets in Q3. In Q4, we will shift to a heavier mix of small formats, opening over 100 traditional Neighborhood Markets and 70 smaller ones. Given the significant number of Q4 openings, we expect headwinds related to pre-opening expenses, as well as higher inventory balances from these openings.", "Shifting gears now, I would like to talk a little about Q4. I\u2019m encouraged by our momentum on the urgent agenda items. We\u2019re already seeing improvements in how we execute markdowns related to damaged merchandise, particularly in produce, as we focus on improving freshness for our customers. Plans are emerging to deliver a strong in-stock position, while simultaneously managing inventory levels appropriately. Though profit will remain challenged, we are working to partially offset some of the expressed headwinds.", "For the holiday season, I\u2019m excited by what I see in our stores. Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and we are prepared to make it a great day for our customers and their families. As we revealed this week, we are excited for The New Black Friday at Walmart. This year, we\u2019ll have five days of fantastic deals and tailored events, including the return of our industry-exclusive one-hour Guarantee program. We have the most popular toys, thanks to our Chosen by Kids program, and we continue to provide customers with easy ways to purchase everything they need for the holidays, including ordering online for pick up in store and a free layaway program with no opening fees. We will also have exciting offers both in-store and online for Cyber Monday, as we deliver an integrated digital and physical experience.", "I\u2019d like to personally thank all of our 1.2 million strong associates, who are engaged and energized for the season. This year our associates will be easy to spot, as they wear their Walmart vests with pride. Additionally, we will hire more than 60,000 additional seasonal associates to help provide great customer service, and we will implement our Checkout Promise, ensuring more registers are open than ever before. All of these actions will reinforce the levels of service our customers need and appreciate.", "As we enter the fourth quarter, we see both opportunities and challenges ahead of us. We lapped the approximately 6% reduction in SNAP benefits on November 1. Additionally, gas prices are considerably lower this year than a year ago, which may give customers a little more discretionary spending power in the coming months. And as I just discussed, we are enthused by our holiday plans across the box and online. However, we expect this holiday season to be highly competitive, and we are mindful that the entertainment business, which comprises a larger percentage of overall Q4 sales is up against continued deflation and a lack of new product innovation. We\u2019ll continue to see pressures to the bottom line as we balance wage leverage with higher customer service standards.", "We recognize we have opportunities to improve the business, but we also know that these things will take time to ensure that they are executed properly and in the best interest of our customers. We continue to work hard on longer-term plans, and I know that by being purposeful in our actions, we will come out stronger, gaining more than our fair share of the opportunity. For these reasons, we expect comp sales in the fourth quarter to be between flat and positive 1% for the 13-week period ending January 30, 2015. Last year, Walmart\u2019s comp sales declined 0.4% for the 14-week period ended January 31, 2014.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for the International update. Dave?", "David Cheesewright", "Thank you, Greg. Overall, we had a solid third quarter, once again growing operating income faster than sales and gaining market share in most of our largest markets. While sales growth slowed some on a constant currency basis compared with the first-half of the year, sales trends improved in the latter part of the quarter in markets such as Canada and Mexico. Customers remain challenged across most of the globe, but our teams continue to do a great job of serving these customers by helping them save time and money.", "The team is aligned on key strategies that we discussed in the October Investor Meeting. We\u2019re making significant progress on driving price leadership and widening or maintaining our price gap across key markets. We\u2019re excited about steps we\u2019ve taken this quarter to accelerate growth in e-commerce, including the launch of additional online offerings in Mexico and China and collection points for online customers in the U.K. and China. We also remain focused on being the most trusted retailer wherever we operate. For example, Walmart China recently launched a Worry Free Fresh program starting with 49 stores providing our customers with a money-back satisfaction guarantee when buying fresh produce and meats.", "On October 30, we announced the future closing of around 30 underperforming stores in Japan that will allow us to continue to focus on the key elements of the business, such as e-commerce, price leadership, and fresh. While these decisions are never taken lightly, we will continuously assess our portfolio of businesses to ensure that we are focusing our efforts on the things that matter most to our shareholders and customers.", "Though there is always room for improvement, we feel good about our third quarter results. Net sales grew 2.9% on a constant currency basis or 1.7% on a reported basis. Operating income grew faster than sales at 5.2% on a constant currency basis and 3.7% on a reported basis. We did not leverage expenses for the quarter in part due to continued investments in e-commerce and other initiatives, but leveraging expenses remains a key priority. On a relative basis, we were encouraged by our market share performance in most countries, which we will discuss further in the individual market sections.", "Of our five largest countries, Canada, Brazil and Mexico delivered positive comp sales, but comps declined in the U.K. and China due to retail deflationary pressures. Net sales and comp growth were strong in some of our other markets, including Africa, Argentina, Central America, Chile, and Japan. We made some progress in reducing inventory levels during the quarter, dropping from 11.2% year-over-year growth in Q2 to 7.2% in Q3. While we are encouraged by the improvements made in some of our key markets, we still have work to do.", "Now, let\u2019s discuss individual results for key markets. Net sales growth and comp sales are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details. The UK market remained challenging throughout the quarter. Aggressive competitive activity resulted in an overall market decline over the 12 weeks ended October 12, according to Kantar. In this environment, Asda continued to perform relatively strongly and was the only one of the big 4 grocers to gain share this quarter. Comp sales declined 1.8%, excluding fuel. Supermarkets performed ahead of expectations, and we saw success in George home categories and Click and Collect which we continue to expand aggressively.", "Operating income grew ahead of sales due to favorability in margin and other income. We did not leverage expenses due to lower sales and some organizational restructuring costs taken during the quarter. In Canada, we accelerated growth versus the first-half of this year, with comp sales growing 0.6% and net sales up 3.3%. Fresh performed particularly well, with double-digit growth due to our increased grocery presence via new and converted stores. General merchandise sales also improved versus Q2 driven by entertainment. In an increasingly competitive environment, Canada gained 20 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12-week period ended October 18. Canada grew operating income 3.5%, outpacing sales growth. We leveraged operating expenses 9 basis points through continued focus on lowering costs.", "Moving next to Walmex, which released their quarterly results on October 17. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP; thus some numbers will differ. Consolidated Walmex sales grew 4.2% with positive comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Walmex operating income decreased 10.4% due to approximately $25 million in expenses related to the effects of Hurricane Odile in August.", "Mexico sales grew 4.2%, and comp sales were up 0.6% for the quarter outperforming the industry. Excluding Sam\u2019s Club, self-service outperformed the market by 250 basis points and gained share across our main store divisions according to ANTAD. Grocery comps exceeded the market by 340 basis points, and general merchandise increased 150 basis points. In addition, our small format, Bodega Aurrera Express, outperformed its market peers with a 12.6% comp for the quarter. We maintained a solid price position and attractive assortment, which we believe will help us win in the fourth quarter.", "We remain focused on turnaround efforts in our Mexico Sam\u2019s Clubs. Our success will depend on building our membership base and establishing a strong foundation for the future. This quarter, I\u2019m happy to report progress against some of our key objectives with positive member base growth each month of Q3, and reduced inventory. We still have a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m pleased that we are seeing some progress.", "As mentioned earlier, the Baja region of Mexico was significantly impacted by Hurricane Odile. I\u2019m extremely proud of how the Walmex associates and Walmart de Mexico\u2019s Foundation stepped up to support the local community providing 60 tons of food to the Mexican Red Cross and opening collection centers in our stores in several states of Mexico. Walmex also provided support to affected associates.", "Next, let\u2019s talk about Brazil. Despite an overall economic deceleration in Q3, comp sales grew 0.8%, with net sales down 0.7%, as a result of closing underperforming stores last year. Despite the overall sales decline, the management team continued to make great progress on reducing operating expenses, resulting in operating income improvement. We remain focused on strengthening the business in Brazil by building a business model that is simple, scalable and profitable. We restructured leadership teams where necessary and enacted process changes in merchandising to leverage local market knowledge when making decisions. Store integration progress continued, with the recent completion of the conversion of all stores in South Brazil to unified systems and processes. These actions helped drive the comp sales growth, expense savings, and profit improvement so far this year.", "Moving to China. Walmart China\u2019s Q3 net sales declined 0.8% and comp sales declined 2.3%. Sales remain challenged as we, along with all retailers, continue to face significant headwinds from government austerity, reduction in gift card sales, and deflation in key categories such as dry grocery, liquor, and consumables. Despite the top line challenges, Walmart China grew sales at a faster pace than the market in the hypermarket category for the quarter ended September 30, according to Nielsen.", "Walmart China also made great progress in strengthening the core of the business. Initiatives to increase supply chain centralization by adding fresh and grocery distribution centers will be completed by the end of this year. Centralization reduces shipping costs, enhances quality of fresh products, improves inventory management and delivers goods to stores more timely. Walmart China\u2019s operating income was flat with last year. We anticipate continued sales pressure in China for the fourth quarter from deflation and government austerity measures, as well as from the timing of Chinese New Year, which will fall nearly three weeks later than in the current year.", "Finally, let\u2019s discuss our progress in e-commerce across the globe. Accelerating e-commerce growth is a key priority and future growth will depend on innovation and driving grocery home shopping. The third quarter marked the launch of online grocery delivery sales in the greater Mexico City area, and the pilot of a third-party online OTC pharmacy site in China that\u2019s part of Yihaodian\u2019s offering.", "In the UK, e-commerce sales were up 20%. We provided more convenience for customers through the Click and Collect rollout, with a record 148 new locations opening this quarter, including six additional London tube stations. Ongoing price investments drove strong grocery home shopping sales growth of 18.6%, despite annualizing against significant growth last year. Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China had strong sales growth. Traffic increased more than 40% and average ticket improved as well. Consumer electronics drove growth with strong performances in wireless and appliances, and the third quarter was highlighted by Yihaodian\u2019s Anniversary Sale with sales increasing more than 50% compared to last year\u2019s event.", "In Brazil, e-commerce sales grew strongly again. As a result of closer partnerships with key suppliers such as Sony PlayStation and Electrolux appliances, sales in games and home nearly doubled. In addition, focused marketing on new moms in the baby categories contributed to strong consumables growth. The August Black-Out Event, a Black Friday-like promotional event was a great success. The event was more than twice as large as last year with six TVs, seven mobile phones, and one Xbox 360 sold every minute.", "We were also pleased with e-commerce results in Mexico, as online sales grew 66% over last year albeit off a fairly low base. The new grocery delivery option offers 30,000 items from 14 categories, including fresh, dry grocery, consumables and pharmacy, and caters to customers of 75 stores in and around Mexico City. Orders can be picked up in store or delivered. We\u2019re also making significant investments in talent, marketing, technology and fulfillment. We saw encouraging results in general merchandise, where almost 20% of our sales are done through 150 kiosks at Walmart Supercenters, giving customers who feel more confident ordering and paying in stores an attractive alternative to paying online.", "We remain committed to our key initiatives in order to deliver a solid fourth quarter performance. The market teams have exciting plans in place to serve our customers better than ever. For example, in Mexico, where we have a very strong presence in toys, we are offering a double price guarantee on toys sold during the Christmas season. In Japan, we will stock the shelves with popular Fortune Bags, similar to grab bags, in preparation for the New Year holiday, giving customers a surprise for a great value. We remain optimistic about our ability to serve our customers around the world, and in continuing to deliver solid results.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz?", "Rosalind Brewer", "Thanks Dave. Sam\u2019s Club delivered strong profit growth this quarter with operating income up 5.3% without fuel and 12% with fuel. We\u2019ve continued to execute strategic investments in membership, merchandise newness, and the intersection of digital and physical. Sam\u2019s posted a comp increase without fuel of 40 basis points for the 13-week period ended October 31. We\u2019re pleased that this growth represents a cumulative improvement of 90 basis points over the 39-week period.", "Although we have lapped our fiscal year 2014 fee increase, our third quarter membership income growth remained strong at 10.1%. Clearly, our members have continued to respond positively to our efforts to enhance membership value. Since June 2014, the launch of Cash Rewards has improved our Plus penetration by about 4 percentage points. Additionally, our operators have really gotten behind our 5:3:1 cash-back MasterCard, which is not only chip-enabled to protect our members from fraud, but also stands as the best cash-back program in the market today. Along with instant savings, these programs speak to our commitment that a Sam\u2019s Club membership is the most valuable card in the members\u2019 wallets.", "Now, let me review our financial results and highlights from the quarter, excluding fuel. For results with fuel, please reference the supplemental presentation. In Q3, comp sales increased 0.4% driven by relatively balanced growth in traffic and ticket. Traffic remains up among the Savings members, with pressure from fewer trips within our Business members. Retail inflation across the club averaged low single-digits with inflation higher in certain areas such as dairy and meat, offset by deflation in other areas, including technology.", "Net sales grew 2.3% to $12.7 billion, and operating income grew 5.3% to $455 million. Our gross profit rate declined 43 basis points this quarter with a significant portion attributable to our investment in Plus Cash Rewards. This pressure will continue as Plus member penetration grows. Similar to Q2, mix also contributed to the decline. We leveraged this quarter, as operating expenses grew slower than sales by 35 basis points. This has been largely due to lower remodel costs and pre-opening expenses with four clubs, including expansions, opening this quarter compared to 13 during last year. However, healthcare-related expenses were higher year-over-year.", "Membership and other income grew 9.9%. Plus member renewals and upgrades were strong, offsetting softness in the business member base. Lower oil prices contributed to higher fuel profit of $38 million. Consistent with industry trends, Sam\u2019s Club sees fuel profits increase as oil prices fall, and decrease as oil prices rise. In both scenarios, we provide significant member value through our gas stations, not only giving members the best price per gallon, but also an additional 5% off all gas purchases through our Sam\u2019s Club MasterCard. This year, we\u2019ve been working to bring inventory growth in line with sales growth and we saw results. An increase of 1.3% with fuel, an improvement since last quarter reflects better inventory flow. Bringing in on-trend newness in key categories has brought our merchandise to life this quarter.", "Let me give you a few examples. There is great work in newness going on across our food business. Both areas grocery/beverage and fresh/freezer/cooler delivered positive low single-digit comps. We have significantly expanded our organic portfolio this quarter, and plan to more than double it by the end of the year. Other new items such as Chia Seeds, breakfast bars, and squeezable fruit pouches hit on key trends, healthy, on the go, and exciting, and members have responded.", "In freezer, convenient frozen meats, fruits, seafood, and vegetables have shown strength as well, appealing to our members\u2019 desire to save both time and money. Similar to last quarter, inflation in dairy and meat remained particularly in red meat, where we\u2019ve seen members shift to value items such as chicken and ground beef. Additionally, produce results have been mixed due to a stone fruit recall, deflation in potatoes, and weather shocks that pressured various items in the category.", "For our members, newness is also about excitement. In home, apparel, hardlines, which posted a positive low single-digit comp, we have updated the calendar to fill in some of the gaps between major seasonal events. Our home event in August and early set of holiday merchandise in September impressed members and reinforced Sam\u2019s Club as a holiday shopping destination. Apparel, including our exclusive active wear brands, children\u2019s wear, and fall outerwear continued to generate excitement as well. Health and wellness accelerated this quarter delivering a positive mid single-digit comp driven by both script growth and inflation from the brand and generic mix. Members truly see Sam\u2019s Club as a trusted source for healthcare needs from pharmacy to health screenings to healthy-for-you products.", "I\u2019m particularly delighted that our pharmacy teams have been recognized by an industry research firm as the number one provider of pharmacy services amongst mass merchandisers. Our continued momentum in pharmacy is clear evidence of this well-deserved recognition. Over-the-counter was boosted by healthy-for-you protein products, including protein powder and protein drinks, which appeal to our members\u2019 active lifestyles. So as you can see, newness is working across categories and we are working even faster to infuse newness in other areas of the business as well.", "Comp sales of consumables, which declined low single-digits is an area where we are working to improve results. While tabletop and bags continued to perform well due to pack size expansion and strategic pricing. The consumables category was pressured by inventory issues in our private label pet business, as well as a recall in baby wipes. Technology, entertainment and office comps declined high single-digit comps, but showed improved performance in the wireless category, compared to last quarter. Specifically, a strong Apple 6/6+ launch, and the implementation of new technology to process members\u2019 wireless contracts supported this improved wireless performance. Our merchants are focused on consumer electronics, which will keep our momentum going through the holiday season.", "Ancillary, which includes tobacco was essentially flat for this quarter. While still down year-over-year, the improvement from Q2 is due to unit growth in tobacco driven in part by shifts in the competitive landscape. Our online business continued to perform, demonstrating our progress in furthering the integration of digital and physical. Samsclub.com contributed approximately 20 basis points to the total segment comp by means of its double-digit sales growth in both direct-to-home and Club Pickup, as well as improved conversion rates from across most access points.", "I\u2019m proud of the progress our teams have made to integrate the digital and physical. This October, we launched Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull, rebranding it as Club Pickup, to make it that much easier for members to shop with us just in time for the holiday season. It\u2019s a service that our Business members have always loved and now we are expanding it to appeal to all members. From the online Easy Reorder tool to new check-in kiosks at all clubs, members can complete a trip to Sam\u2019s Club in a matter of minutes. What\u2019s more, Club Pickup is yet another touch point for our members to experience legendary member service both in-club and online.", "What I find really encouraging is our reengagement with the Business member through a suite of services that help our small business members save money and time on vital day-to-day business needs. For example, we know that only a small fraction of microbusinesses is able to fund employees\u2019 healthcare insurance, instead relying on outside benefits or paying out-of-pocket. Now, our small business members can provide employees with affordable health care plans through the Aetna Marketplace for Sam\u2019s Club.", "Furthermore, they also have a trusted source for legal solutions from LegalZoom as well as payroll services, merchant payment processing, and travel booking. And we believe that savings members will also take advantage of some of these services, especially the travel. The digital foundation supporting this is the Samsclub.com platform. Our team released significant new features this quarter. Desktop site enhancements, unit price visibility, and smooth integration for third-party services have further improved the platform\u2019s ability to migrate members online, and guide them through the browsing and purchasing process.", "I\u2019m proud of our recent accomplishments at Sam\u2019s Club and even more thrilled about the growth to come in our clubs and online. In the fourth quarter, we will lap last year\u2019s headwinds from SNAP reductions and severe weather impacts. We expect comp sales to be between flat and up 2% for the 13-week period ending January 30, excluding fuel. This compares to a decline of 0.1% last year. When you come visit us in the club this holiday season, you will see our focus on delivering newness across the box. Our merchants and operators are excited about our holiday plan and poised to deliver strong results to close out the year. It all begins in just two days with our November 15 Holiday Savings Celebration, so I hope to see you out in the clubs.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charles. Charles?", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Roz. Overall, we are encouraged by the progress we made in the quarter. We continued to focus on driving stronger sales and improving customer service. Let me summarize the key takeaways from the third quarter. Earnings per share of $1.15 were at the midpoint of our guidance. Walmart U.S. delivered its first positive comp in seven quarters. Consolidated net sales increased $3.2 billion, with Walmart U.S. contributing $2.3 billion of the increase.", "Walmart International once again grew operating income faster than sales, and we gained market share in most of our largest markets despite the economic conditions in those markets. Sam\u2019s Club delivered operating income growth of 5% without fuel, due to stronger membership income. E-commerce sales grew approximately 21% on a global basis and we made initial progress on working capital management an ongoing priority for all of our finance teams.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to guidance for both the fourth quarter and the full-year. Our earnings guidance today assumes several important factors, including the economic conditions in several of our largest markets and a highly promotional holiday season, especially in the U.S. As a reminder, our full-year earnings per share guidance includes the four factors we discussed last quarter, which were higher than anticipated healthcare costs in the U.S., incremental investments in e-commerce, ongoing investments in Sam\u2019s Club, and our effective tax rate, which we expect to range between 32 to 34%.", "Last quarter, we shared that the incremental investment in e-commerce for fiscal 2015 is expected to range between $0.05 and $0.07 per share. Year-to-date, we have incurred approximately $0.04 per share of the incremental investment. On October 15, at our Investor Meeting, we also shared with you that we plan to step up our investments again next fiscal year given the priorities we have for digital and mobile commerce in our enterprise strategy.", "As I indicated last quarter, while historically our tax rate tends to moderate toward the end of the fiscal year. It\u2019s important to remember that assessments of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits and the impact of discrete items could affect our rate. In particular we are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2013, which if not passed could drive our effective tax rate towards the high end of our estimated range for the full-year.", "Taking all of these factors into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the fourth quarter to range between $1.46 and $1.56. This range includes approximately $0.03 per share related to the previously announced closure of underperforming stores in Walmart Japan. In addition, remember we will have continued headwinds from healthcare expenses as well as the remainder of our incremental investment in e-commerce. As a reminder, last year, Walmart reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.34, which included a negative impact of approximately $0.26 from discrete items. Therefore last year\u2019s fourth quarter underlying earnings per share were $1.60.", "With that, let\u2019s move on to guidance for the full-year. As we indicated at the recent Analyst Meeting, we now anticipate net sales growth for fiscal 2015 to range between 2% and 3% versus our prior guidance of being at the low end of our stated range of 3% to 5%. And as of today, we would expect foreign currency to have a negative impact for the full-year of more than $4 billion. In addition, today we are updating our guidance for full-year earnings per share to range between $4.92 and $5.02. This revised guidance includes approximately $0.03 per share of charges related to the closure of underperforming stores in Walmart Japan. This compares to our prior guidance of $4.90 to $5.15.", "Last year, we reported full-year earnings per share of $4.85, which included the $0.26 of discrete items I mentioned earlier. Therefore our full-year underlying earnings per share last year were $5.11. We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We paid $1.5 billion in dividends this quarter and spent approximately $82 million to repurchase our shares. It is clear that our operating results influence our cash flows. Our cash position will improve as we have better performance from our U.S. operations and improve working capital management.", "Our entire team is focused on being disciplined in delivering for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company. And on behalf of the management team and our associates worldwide, we thank you for your support this year and wish you a happy, healthy and safe holiday season.

For this fiscal year, we updated our press release to a new more contemporary look, with a very visual presentation of our core financial results. We recommend that you review the earnings press release in conjunction with the transcript of this call and the accompanying slide presentation that\u2019s in PowerPoint format. We welcome your feedback on our materials.", "As a reminder, for fiscal 2016, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar. For this year, quarter-to-date and year-to-date comps will be based upon 13 and 52-week periods, respectively. Our Q1 reporting period ran from Friday, January 31 through Friday, May 1, 2015.", "Please mark your calendar. Our Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on Friday, June 5 on the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville. The meeting starts at 7:30 a.m. central time and is also available for viewing via webcast through our website, stock.walmart.com, or via Walmart\u2019s free Investor Relations app. We look forward to seeing many of you at the meeting. And on October 14, we will hold our annual meeting for the investment community in New York City, not in Northwest Arkansas.", "Now, we\u2019ll get on to today\u2019s call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover key results and provide an overall assessment of our enterprise strategy and our business. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will provide context for the financial details not included in the accompanying slide presentation. For our three operating segments, we\u2019ll begin with. Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International, and then Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. Last, Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s CFO, will wrap up with details on guidance.", "Please note that it is standard procedure during today\u2019s news for Walmart to provide EPS guidance for the second quarter, and update the full year earnings per share guidance next quarter.", "Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to kick off the call. Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone.", "Overall, we had a solid first quarter. Walmart generated nearly $115 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share within our guidance range at $1.03. I\u2019ll cover the results for the quarter in just a minute, but I\u2019d like to start with an update on some of our larger strategic choices and the progress we\u2019ve made to bring them to life.", "Our objective is to make changes to improve our short to mid-term performance while, at the same time, position the company for the long-term. By position, I\u2019m referring to how we set ourselves up to serve customers for years to come and the strategic choices we\u2019re making are in two critical areas, people and technology.", "In April, we launched a comprehensive set of store and club initiatives that I discussed in last quarter\u2019s call. These are intended to improve our short to mid-term performance in the United States. As you\u2019ll remember, we\u2019re investing in our starting wage rates, an improved store structure, including adding department managers, and wage increases for most positions within our stores and clubs in the U.S.", "We have pilots under way that will improve our scheduling process and improve our training. This set of initiatives is designed to improve the customer experience and translate into higher comp store sales over time. The rollout of these changes happens throughout this year. We know that we won\u2019t see it overnight, but we\u2019re confident these are the right things to do for our business and our team.", "I\u2019ve recently visited stores and clubs in the Detroit and Seattle markets and I\u2019m encouraged with our associates\u2019 level of ownership in the business and understanding of the plan. As we improve the experience in our stores, we continue to invest to deliver a stronger mobile and e-commerce experience. In U.S. we\u2019re rolling out a more simplified checkout process on walmart.com, which is based on our global technology platform, Pangaea. An important part of this platform is that it delivers a better experience on mobile devices. Mobile is increasingly the driver of our e-commerce business.", "A few weeks ago, I visited stores and clubs in Beijing and Shanghai. I really enjoyed listening to our Yihaodian customer focus group and following one of our associates around as we delivered orders to apartments in Shanghai. There are new, exciting developments happening in retail and I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019re in the thick of it. But, I was also reminded that the same basic tenets of our business, like value for money, a great assortment and customer service, are what they\u2019re after. Those customers we delivered to in Shanghai were quick to praise our associate in his service during deliveries. They liked our prices, but asked for items that we don\u2019t yet carry. I was pleased to hear from them that we didn\u2019t need to open the cases of merchandise because they trusted our delivery associate. That\u2019s a big deal. The week before being in China, I walked stores in Mexico and saw a growing business in grocery home shopping there, too. The associates I visited with in Mexico were sensing a momentum in their business and it was good to see them leaning forward.", "So, we\u2019ll make these investments in our people, we\u2019ll give them the opportunity to move up so that they\u2019re engaged in our business and happy to serve customers. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue making progress with digital, mobile and e-commerce. And, we\u2019ll bring it all together in a seamless way that delivers value for customers. We\u2019re moving on a lot of fronts and picking up some speed. Around the world, our associates are focused on running great stores, empowering their teams, developing technological solutions to solve customer problems and integrating it all together.", "Now, let\u2019s get into our first quarter results in more detail. Walmart U.S. again delivered positive comp sales, and I\u2019m encouraged by the customer traffic trends. I\u2019m particularly pleased by the customer response to our Neighborhood Markets, driving strong comps again this quarter.", "Based on recent surveys, we know that many of our U.S. customers are using their tax refunds and the extra money from lower gas prices to pay down debt or put it into savings. They\u2019re also using these funds for everyday expenses like utilities and groceries. That\u2019s where we can be their destination of choice. We\u2019re not where we want to be in every store, but I\u2019m pleased with the progress that I\u2019m seeing.", "Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales growth this quarter. Mexico and Canada had really good sales results. In Mexico, the Sam\u2019s Club business is where we\u2019ve seen our most dramatic improvement, due to improved merchandise and stronger in-club operations. And one of the more encouraging signs for me is that this execution is happening over multiple store formats in Mexico, including Bodega. In China, we\u2019re doing a better job of managing inventory and building customers\u2019 trust with the quality of our fresh offering.", "Sam\u2019s Club had lower comp sales and profit than expected. Membership income was up more than 7%, indicating the emphasis on winning over more members to Plus status is progressing. Sam\u2019s recently launched new services that have promise for improved member acquisition and retention, and investments in Club Pick-up and e-commerce are starting to pay off. However, we need more consistent progress, and I\u2019m confident that the strategic plan the Sam\u2019s Club team is working on will lead to longer-term improvements in our club business.", "We\u2019re investing to win the future of retail, and I\u2019m excited about the possibilities that our improved e-commerce capabilities will provide. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re making progress on rolling out our global technology platform to make e-commerce and mobile shopping easier for customers. Walmart\u2019s worldwide e-commerce sales grew approximately 17% in the first quarter. Asda\u2019s this grocery home shopping continues to drive double-digit growth, and we\u2019re sharing this expertise around the world to test delivery and pickup services in more locations. To meet our growth projections, we recently announced a new fulfillment center in Brazil, which will be our second one there dedicated solely to e-commerce. We will open two new mechanized fulfillment centers this quarter in the U.S. and two others will follow later this year.", "At Walmart, we operate our business in a way that adds value to communities. We recently published our annual Global Responsibility Report. I\u2019d love for you to take a look at our ongoing initiatives to create economic opportunity for our associates and others in the retail industry; to enhance the sustainability of our operations and product supply chain; and to strengthen communities in the places where we operate. It\u2019s real and meaningful work, and something we\u2019re really proud of.", "On Friday, June 5th, we\u2019ll hold our Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. It\u2019s always a great opportunity to hear from our shareholders and interact with so many of our more than 5,000 associates who come from our markets around the world. I always leave this meeting energized after spending time with our associates.", "Looking ahead, I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making and the plans in place for the future. Our priority is to drive growth across the enterprise. Globally, we\u2019re working to exceed customer expectations by helping them save time and money and have a great experience as they interact with us in store, online or on their phone. We\u2019ve made progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. We\u2019re pushing to change faster as we continue down the right path to deliver long-term value to both customers and shareholders.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire. Claire?", "Claire Babineaux-Fontenot", "Thanks, Doug. Today, I\u2019ll highlight some items in the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript.", "For the first quarter of fiscal \u201816, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart EPS were $1.03. This compares to last year\u2019s EPS of $1.10, which was negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 from severe weather. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a greater than anticipated impact on this year\u2019s first quarter results. Fluctuations in currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $3.3 billion, and similarly impacted EPS by $0.03. As a reminder, our incremental investment in e-commerce was approximately $0.02 per share, and the investment in U.S. associates impacted EPS by approximately $0.02. These investments were also the primary contributor to the 2.8% increase in consolidated operating expenses.", "Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $33 million, comprised of $25 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $53 million in the first quarter.", "The company\u2019s consolidated operating income decreased 8.3%. Excluding the impact from currency, operating income decreased 6.1%. The company\u2019s continued investments in e-commerce, as well as wages and training for our U.S. associates, were headwinds on our operating income during the quarter. As you will see on slide two, net interest expense increased 45.1%, primarily due to the cumulative impact of an immaterial accounting correction that I will explain in a moment. Without this cumulative adjustment, interest expense would have been flat.", "We consolidate a number of entities into our financial statements for which there are minority, or non-controlling, interests. In one of these entities in Canada, we determined that certain historical sales of properties did not qualify for sale accounting, due to the company\u2019s continuing involvement in the sold properties. As a result, under U.S. GAAP, these properties should have remained in our financial statement as assets, with a corresponding financial obligation recorded equal to the properties\u2019 sales proceeds. The assets and financial obligation are amortized over time.", "During the first quarter, we recorded the correction to our balance sheet to increase assets by $1.1 billion and liabilities by $1.4 billion. With respect to the income statement, the correction included $254 million of cumulative interest expense, offset by a related tax benefit of $53 million, and $173 million attributable to non-controlling interest. The correction had a de minimis impact on our operating income and on earnings per share, as EPS is based on income attributable to Walmart.", "From the balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 2.2%. Later in today\u2019s call, you\u2019ll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 80.4%, which compares to 80.2% last year. Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2015 was 16.6%, which compares to 16.7% last year. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The decrease in free cash flow was due to lower income from continuing operations and impact of timing of payments for inventory, as well as timing of income tax payments.", "The last item I\u2019ll leave you with today is share repurchases. The company repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for $280 million during the quarter. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influenced our share repurchase activity. We have approximately $10 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg. Greg?", "Greg Foran", "Thank you, Claire. Back on April the 1st in New York, we provided an update on the Walmart U.S. business. We discussed what was working well, and what needed improvement in order to meet, both the expectations of customers and the goals of the company. We laid out a multi-year plan that includes several large and specific projects, all of which fit within our broader strategic focus on assortment, price, access, and customer experience. As we discussed, we\u2019re not only interested in reaching our goals, but reaching them in a way which is sustainable for the long-term. This requires a steady execution, a pace that is fast but calculated, and one that allows us to get it right.", "This quarter we began executing this plan. We took the initial steps in April towards a stronger investment in our associates by raising the minimum starting wage for all hourly associates to $9 per hour. As a part of our $1 billion investment in our associates, we also raised the floor and ceiling on pay bands in our stores, creating raises for many full and part-time hourly associates at every level. More than 500,000 associates benefited from this change. We\u2019re also restructuring the management teams in the stores, adding back almost 8,000 department managers. These department managers will have responsibility for a smaller area of the store ensuring that they have the knowledge and the time to engage with both the customers and store associates driving an overall better experience. The $1 billion investment in our associates this year includes training programs as well.", "Also included in our wage investments we\u2019ve continued our Checkout Promise initiative we began over the holidays ensuring more registers are open during peak times to drive a fast and friendly experience as customers are completing their shopping trips. Finally, we continued to make steady progress against the other initiatives we\u2019ve discussed, including our urgent agenda items, assortment discipline, pricing, and in-stock goals. These actions require a significant investment, which is included in our financial plan for the year. It\u2019s an investment we believe is imperative to providing customers with the unparalleled shopping experience they expect and deserve, and our associates with more opportunities to build a successful career at Walmart.", "With these steps in mind, let\u2019s move on to our first quarter results. Net sales grew $2.4 billion, or 3.5%, versus last year. For the 13-week period ended May 1st, comparable stores were up 1.1%, which was within our guidance. Comp sales were driven by solid growth in traffic, which was up 1%. Customers continue to see the benefit of lower gas prices versus last year and are responding favorably to some of our new assortments for the spring and summer selling seasons.", "All formats had positive comps for the quarter, including our traditional-format Neighborhood Markets, which posted approximately a 7.9% comp. A focus on customer service and in-stock position drove strong traffic in this format. Customers continue to see the benefit of Neighborhood Markets to meet their everyday needs, including convenient access to services such as drive-through pharmacies and fuel stations.", "Merchandise comp performance was similar to last quarter. Customers responded to the new spring and summer assortments in apparel and continued growth in active wear and strong brands across the category helped meet customers\u2019 assortment needs. Indoor home categories with key items and investments in opening price points drove momentum. We also saw customers transition outside driving sales in outdoor, lawn and garden, and toys. Last, health and wellness posted strong comp sales with momentum in both OTC and optical driven by recent product launches, as well as continued growth in pharmacy scripts.", "Within general merchandise, we continued to feel pressure in media and electronics, resulting from industry contraction, the shift from physical to digital media, and lapping last year\u2019s release of the movie Frozen. Additionally, in-stock positions in categories such as TVs suffered as a result of the port congestion on the West Coast. That said we now believe the majority of this disruption is behind us.", "Moving to grocery, we were pleased by the operational improvement we saw in fresh. As we mentioned in April, this is a key area of focus, and getting fresh right is critical to the customer experience. We\u2019re taking the right steps towards reducing the time to bring fresh product to our customers, and training associates to ensure the best offering is on the shelf. We still have a lot more to do in this area, but we\u2019re steadily improving. One key headwind we faced in grocery during the first quarter was moderating inflation in meat, and deflation in both dairy and produce. While partially offset by inflationary trends in dry and frozen foods, we estimate the moderation in fresh foods impacted our overall comp performance by almost 70 basis points this quarter. Overall, net food inflation negatively impacted our comp by approximately 20 basis points.", "Finally, e-commerce, driven by strong traffic and price leadership, saw double-digit comp growth across many departments. E-commerce plays a key role in our focus on access for the customer, which is fundamentally around convenience. We\u2019re launching the final phase of our new platform related to cart and online checkout capabilities. Our customers are using their mobile devices to access our site on the go. Mobile traffic was up over 100% for the quarter, and we saw higher conversion rates as well. We continue to learn from our grocery home shopping tests where we recently added another location to the Huntsville, Alabama market. And, we\u2019re working towards a better customer experience in our Walmart Pickup program formerly called Site to Store. The program includes improved email communication, a new signage package that makes it easier for customers to understand the program, and a focus on a faster pickup experience in the stores. It will roll out to all stores by October 1st. For the quarter, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp performance.", "Moving on to the remainder of our financial results. In the first quarter, gross profit rate declined 13 basis points, driven primarily by a headwind from shrink, half of which was in food. We are addressing this increase immediately, bringing a high level of focus and visibility to this concern by adding it as a key urgent agenda item this year. In addition to shrink, the ongoing mix shift in pharmacy, incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion, and cost inflation in consumables contributed to the decline. Somewhat offsetting this was a continued focus on the urgent agenda items laid out last year, including managing throwaways in fresh and reducing inventory that is no longer active in the stores.", "As expected, operating expenses increased 6.6% versus last year. This was driven by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year and the investments we\u2019re making in our associates, including the increase in minimum starting pay rates, the restructure of store management roles, and the continuation of our Checkout Promise initiative. Finally, ongoing investments in e-commerce and technology were a headwind to the quarter. Given these investments, along with the reduction in gross profit rate, operating income declined 6.8% or $336 million for the quarter.", "Inventory grew 5.4% in the first quarter. Almost half of this growth was related to the significant number of new stores added in the past several months. The remainder of the growth was related to congestion clearing in the West Coast ports, and some conscious replenishment decisions we made to drive improvements in our in-stock position. We continue to make strides against our goal of strong working capital management. We grew inventory in comp stores below the rate of sales, and our in-stock position continued to improve throughout the quarter.", "This quarter, we opened 20 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 15 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets, and 9 smaller-format locations, including one campus store location.", "We\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the past several months truly understanding what it will take to succeed over time in a rapidly-changing retail environment. This quarter, we made some improvements, taking the right steps at a steady pace, ensuring we stay on track towards the long-term goals of the business. We continue to monitor our fast, friendly, and clean performance in the stores, and based on customer feedback, we are making good progress.", "I\u2019m out walking our stores every week, visiting our associates and talking to our customers in markets across the country. Additionally, Judith McKenna, our Chief Operating Officer, has visited with over 750 store managers in recent weeks, gathering their thoughts on how we can improve. We are pleased that our customer service scores have steadily increased this quarter with all geographic areas and formats showing positive results. We know, though, that we\u2019re not where we want to be yet. It will take time to achieve our goals, but we\u2019re fully committed to providing our customers with a shopping experience they can love, and associates who see their efforts leading to broader and better careers.", "For the second quarter, we expect traffic to remain strong supported by sustained low gas prices and our efforts to improve customer service in our stores. This will be offset, in part, by a continued decline in food inflation rates. For the 13-week period ending July 31, we anticipate a comp sales increase of around 1%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were flat.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?", "Dave Cheesewright", "Thank you, Greg. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to visit the majority of our markets, and I continue to be pleased with the progress I see. Overall, we\u2019ve had a solid start to the fiscal year financially and continue to make progress on our key strategic priorities. As a reminder, these key priorities include, actively managing the existing portfolio; driving comp sales; accelerating e-commerce; delivering market priorities, particularly in China, Brazil and Mexico; and finally, strengthening key enablers such as being the lowest cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust.", "Before we discuss the financials, here are a few highlights from the first quarter. First, I\u2019m particularly pleased with our overall performance in Mexico, which not only had its strongest net quarterly sales growth in over two years, but also grew operating income faster than sales. Our results in Mexico were due to better comps in all key formats, including Sam\u2019s Club. Also, I want to call out our performance in Canada, which had a positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition to Canada and Mexico, we achieved comp growth in most of our other markets, as we remain committed to delivering positive comp sales across the board.", "I\u2019m energized by the execution I\u2019ve seen from our teams. In addition, I\u2019m excited about our efforts in accelerating e-commerce. In the UK, grocery home shopping continues to report double-digit comps, and we\u2019re leveraging our UK experience in other markets across the globe. Earlier, Doug mentioned some of our change initiatives that we\u2019re working on across the enterprise. One of these initiatives is built around this experience in grocery home shopping. We have a newly created International Acceleration Team based in the UK that is building close partnerships with our markets to speed up the adoption of grocery home shopping processes and technologies. We\u2019re now working towards a common technology platform to better position us for the expansion of grocery home shopping.", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at our first quarter results. In the first quarter, net sales grew 3.4% on a constant currency basis, partially benefitting by the timing of Chinese New Year and Easter. The U.S. dollar has remained at historically high levels, leading to a considerable currency impact of $3.3 billion, which led to a 6.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were favorable across four of our five top markets, with the UK driven by continued deflation in food and aggressive competition, being the exception. We also had negative comps in Japan, lapping last year\u2019s benefit of accelerated consumer spending ahead of the April 2014 consumption tax hike. We grew comp sales in our remaining markets. As expected, operating income grew slower than sales at 0.1% on a constant currency basis, impacted by planned strategic investments in our e-commerce businesses and ongoing economic and competitive pressures in certain markets. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 11% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 8.2%, driven by slower sales in the UK and inventory build-up leading up to the Easter holiday. On a reported basis, inventory declined 5.4%.", "Now let\u2019s discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and changes in various metrics are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides eight and nine of the presentation summarize financial details.", "Let\u2019s start with the UK. The market remained highly competitive and promotional. Hard discounters continued to gain share, though at a slowing rate, and all major supermarkets stepped up aggressive investments in price. As a result, grocery deflation persisted at record levels, leading to low market growth. Grocery prices were down 2% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended March 29, according to Kantar.", "UK sales declined 2.9% and comp sales declined 3.3% excluding fuel, primarily driven by deflation in fresh. Operating income declined, negatively impacted by lower sales and margin. Heading into Q2, the team is focused on improving sales and operating performance through price investments in branded goods, maintaining aggressive price points on key items, and continuing to invest in the highest quality fresh offering. Asda\u2019s five-year strategy of investing \u00a31 billion in lowering prices remains on track this year, our second year of the program.", "In Canada, we maintained solid growth amid a dynamic, competitive environment. Sales were up 3.7%, and comps were up 1.8%, driven by solid Easter sales, strong performance in seasonal and improving strength in our overall food business, including fresh. We continue to enhance our value and price offering, especially with private brands, where we saw significant growth. Market share increased in food, health and wellness, consumables, and infant categories, for the 12 weeks ended April 18, according to Nielsen.", "Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. We remain focused on our low cost operating model and continue to seek out opportunities to drive efficiencies to reduce expenses. I\u2019m pleased with performance overall and expect the positive trend to continue, as the competitive landscape evolves.", "On May the 8th, we announced the acquisition of 13 stores, 12 leased and one owned, and one distribution center from a former competitor. While these transactions are subject to bankruptcy court approval, we look forward to bringing additional supercentres to more provinces in Canada. These stores are in addition to the 29 supercentres we announced as part of our current fiscal year expansion program.", "Next, let\u2019s turn to Mexico, which released their earnings on April the 21st. Please note that the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ.", "Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.3%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Operating income growth was also favorable, up 10.4% year-over-year. Mexico net sales grew 7.1% and comp sales increased 4.9%. Self-service gained 80 basis points of market share during the quarter, according to ANTAD. Performance was strong in food and consumables, the largest contributor to the comp sales momentum. Sam\u2019s Club comp sales grew 6.8% in the quarter, benefitted by improved merchandise assortment and initiatives to grow the membership base. I\u2019m excited about the momentum and outlook, as the team continues to launch initiatives and price investments that will resonate with the customer. In addition to top line performance, Mexico did a good job managing expenses, delivering over 30 basis points of leverage compared to last year, driven by lower utility, supplies, and advertising expenses.", "Now, on to Brazil, market conditions worsened this quarter due to continued inflationary cost pressures. In addition, the retail grocery sector had its worst first quarter growth in the last six years at 2.2%, according to Serasa Experian, a global information services company. Despite the continuing economic slowdown, I was pleased to see another quarter of steady growth in Brazil. Both net sales and comp sales were up 3.0%. Sam\u2019s Club and Maxxi formats outpaced retail market growth, with double-digit comp sales increases. Brazil continues to invest in price, particularly in general merchandise, in an effort to improve sales trends in retail formats.", "Brazil did not leverage expenses for the quarter, largely due to the inflationary pressures that I\u2019ve just mentioned. Management remains focused on turnaround initiatives to deliver profitability in the back half of the year.", "Moving on to China, Walmart China\u2019s Q1 net sales grew 1.9% and comp sales grew 0.4%, as sales for Chinese New Year improved year-over-year. Recall that Chinese New Year was January the 31st last year and February the 19th this year, so some sales shifted from Q4 into Q1 this year. According to China UnionPay Data, our gift card loading outperformed the market in the high volume months of January and February. Nielsen also showed that Walmart increased market share in fast moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel, and maintained share in the Modern Trade channel, which includes smaller format stores, for the 12-weeks ended March 29.", "While there are ongoing market headwinds from government austerity and slightly slower economic growth, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll continue to deliver growth in China. Part of this growth will come from the planned opening of 33 stores and clubs this year, with expansion focused in the southern regions where we have strong market presence. Additionally, we aim to provide better services and widen our customer reach through greater expansion of our omni-channel platforms, including online and mobile. We\u2019re focused on driving efficiency, cost reductions and strengthening our portfolio in China. Operating income grew 23.5%, up due to expense leverage and gross margin improvement from higher sell-through with Chinese New Year. We leveraged expenses this quarter in our core business through \u201cWe Operate for Less\u201d and \u201cWe Buy for Less\u201d initiatives and will continue to pass those savings onto customers.", "Finally, let\u2019s discuss e-commerce performance. Accelerating e-commerce is one of our strategic objectives this year, and we\u2019re making significant strides in providing convenient access for shoppers as we continue to invest globally in e-commerce capabilities. In Mexico, we\u2019re launching an improved Sam\u2019s Club website in the second quarter and an app in the third quarter. In China, we\u2019ll launch a new app later this quarter for our stores that will enable customers to shop from their local Walmart store and choose to pick up their order in store or have it delivered to home. And in Canada, our e-commerce business continues to perform strongly with a comp of greater than 40%.", "Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, benefited from the Spring Festival promotion to support Chinese New Year, with strong sales of imported items in milk products, shampoo, and other categories. Orders drove most of our growth and our conversion rate improved nearly 100 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Mobile contributed more than 40% of orders.", "Brazil e-commerce had another strong performance this quarter, with comps up double digits and outpaced the Brazilian total e-commerce market growth rate. Phones, auto and tires, and baby categories helped drive this growth. Above average summer temperatures drove strong sales in fans and air conditioners. On Consumer Day, a national event in March that\u2019s similar to a Black Friday event in the U.S. we also delivered strong sales growth.", "In addition to our solid financial performance, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in strengthening our key enablers of being the lowest cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust. One way we deliver on being the lowest cost operator is by reducing our total energy required to power our buildings. For example, in the UK, we\u2019re migrating to a new energy monitoring system that provides daily energy alarms, analytic capabilities and reporting.", "In addition, we remain committed to programs that develop talent. We began providing retail training to women in emerging markets last year and have now trained women in several countries, including Argentina, Chile, Mexico, South Africa, and India, and are focused on scaling projects throughout this year. By the end of next year, we plan to have trained 200,000 women for their first jobs in retail in our emerging markets.", "As we look forward to the rest of the year for the International business, we anticipate some headwinds, particularly in Latin America, where in the second quarter we lap last year\u2019s World Cup. We also expect similar trends in the UK to continue given market conditions, and anticipate ongoing currency pressure with the strength of the U.S. dollar. At the same time, though, we have strong momentum in markets like Mexico and Canada, and expect to see solid growth continue in these markets. The global landscape remains challenging and the retail industry is highly competitive. However, I believe we\u2019re headed in the right direction and are making progress towards our strategic objectives, which is setting us up for long-term growth and success.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz?", "Rosalind Brewer", "Thank you, Dave. Our first quarter results were disappointing, as comp sales missed guidance, and we delivered softer net sales and profit than last year. We continued to invest in our initiatives to drive growth, and while we made progress in some areas, we still have upside opportunity in others. This year is one of investment and testing, and we\u2019re very focused on strengthening our foundation for business improvement in the longer-term.", "We\u2019ve been focused on four initiatives designed to improve our foundation. The first initiative is improving our merchandise assortment, where we are driving newness and differentiation. For example, we increased our organic offerings by 20% since the beginning of the year, and these are important to various demographic groups, including millennials.", "Our second initiative is focused on membership and decision sciences. We created a new Chief Member Officer, reporting to me, that will own membership data and analytics. This role, which was put in place at the beginning of the quarter, oversees a new team of data scientists, marketing and insights professionals. I\u2019m pleased that the team\u2019s recent new targeted membership efforts give us optimism for the rest of the year.", "Our third initiative is launching new programs to enhance member value. One example is a groundbreaking new pharmacy program called \u201cFree/4/10,\u201d which provides Plus members with free or discounted prescriptions for five costly diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, mental health, vitamin D deficiency, and prostate health. This program contributed to a number of Plus upgrades since its rollout.", "Our fourth initiative is a significant long-term investment in our e-commerce business. We re-launched Club Pickup in every club in the country, resulting in a 37% sales increase in the Club Pickup Program. Members love the convenience benefits of online ordering and easy pickup at the club. I am encouraged that our investments will pay off in the near future.", "Now, on to the numbers. With fuel, operating income declined 10.9% to $427 million. The fuel business has experienced significant pricing volatility within the quarter, and as a result, our fuel business lost $9 million this quarter. For additional results with fuel, please reference the accompanying presentation.", "In Q1, net sales, without fuel, grew 1.2% to $12.4 billion. Comp sales were 0.4%, driven by ticket increases of 60 basis points and by a traffic decline of 20 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, offset by a decline in business member traffic. E-commerce contributed 40 basis points to the comp for the 13-week period. Our gross profit rate declined 15 basis points compared to last year, attributable to our investment in Plus Cash Rewards. We will continue to invest in Cash Rewards as Plus penetration grows.", "Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 33 basis points, due to investments in new clubs, e-commerce, and technology. Membership and other income grew 4.9%, with membership income up 7.4%. Operating income declined 8.6% to $436 million.", "Our merchant teams continue to work on bringing newness and trend-right merchandise into the clubs. We still have opportunities for improvement, and we continue to invest in price to drive value for our members. Comp sales in fresh, freezer, cooler were up in the low single-digits. Meat and deli categories performed well, but our overall food comps, including dairy and produce, were impacted by deflation in these fresh categories. We grew comp sales in dry grocery. This is an area in which we will continue to invest to improve both assortment and member value.", "Consumables were led by private brand table top programs, offset by ongoing supply issues within baby care. Overall, home and apparel comps were up in the low single-digits. Women and children\u2019s apparel was strong, delivering double-digit comp performance. Patio and seasonal items were down, due to the slow start to spring in key geographies, but mattress and houseware categories grew double-digits in comp sales.", "In our technology and entertainment business, comp sales were down. TV sales were challenged due to the West Coast port delays, but did pick up later in the quarter once the delays decreased. Our audio sales were strong due to new headphones and soundbars. This category has been part of our initiative to streamline our offering to provide the latest advancements in the technologies that matter and to improve our offerings online.", "Our health and wellness category benefited from our pharmacy\u2019s introduction of the newly launched Free/4/10 program that I mentioned earlier. This program is being merchandised at our pharmacies and contributed to a number of Plus upgrades since its rollout. We are optimistic about its ability to continue to drive membership growth. As we continue to enhance and improve our offerings, we are managing our inventory appropriately. Inventory, without fuel, grew 1.9%, primarily attributable to new clubs. Beyond these merchandise areas, membership growth is our number one priority, and we see opportunities to better serve both the Business and the Savings member.", "Turning to membership, we were encouraged by the momentum in April in both acquisition and renewal counts. This will be a constant focus for us. We see consistent growth in our Plus membership, driven by our national rollout of Cash Rewards last year. We have added over 1.6 million new Plus members since a year ago. Members that have upgraded to a Plus membership are highly engaged, both in clubs and online, and their spending is up over the previous year in the mid to high single-digit range. In addition, the 5-3-1 MasterCard program we launched last year continues to receive industry accolades, but more importantly, receives tremendously positive feedback from our members.", "When I\u2019m out walking in the clubs and talking with members, they consistently tell me how much they enjoy the benefits of our Cash Rewards program, and our 5-3-1 MasterCard. This is especially true for our small business members as the rewards really add up. Together, these two initiatives continue to meet our expectations in providing membership value.", "For the long term, we continue to see success in some key strategic areas and will build on these. The integration of digital and physical is a key enabler for our growth. E-commerce delivered a double-digit comp this quarter, contributing 40 basis points to the segment comp. Growth in traffic, ticket, and conversion was driven by strong double-digit Club Pickup comps. We are also leveraging our digital capabilities to drive targeted member growth and renewal. Utilizing our data analytics, we used digital media to reach current and prospective members, but can now align it with system enhancements and better visibility of members\u2019 shopping behaviors. For example, our recent Groupon offer clearly communicated the value of the Sam\u2019s Club membership card and generated more than 220,000 new members in less than two weeks.", "Ultimately, we know we will attract and retain members by creating irresistible value in our membership. While our business member numbers continue to be challenged, we\u2019re maintaining our focus on turning that trend around. To help them grow, we\u2019ve expanded the value we provide to small business members with the addition in the first quarter of five new or enhanced services through third-parties, identity theft protection; accounting; business lending; payment processing; and online marketing.", "With these new services, we\u2019ve broadened the portfolio of new business services we launched in the fall, and we will continue to do so throughout the year. The primary purpose of these services is to help our small business members be successful, and create additional membership value from their Sam\u2019s Club card. Although it\u2019s still early, we\u2019ve had positive feedback on our new services.", "We are intensely focused on addressing top line sales and membership. We expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 31 to be between flat and up 2%.", "Now, I\u2019ll pass it over to Charles. Charles?", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Roz. I will wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some thoughts on our performance. As you heard, currency exchange negatively impacted our sales by $3.3 billion and earnings per share by $0.03, which was more than we anticipated. Even though our Walmart U.S. comp sales were around the bottom of our guidance, we are pleased with our earnings per share coming in at $1.03, in the middle of our range.", "Before I move on to our second quarter guidance, it\u2019s important to reiterate that we continue to execute our enterprise strategy, which we feel is creating a stronger foundation for the future. It\u2019s still early days, but it\u2019s important to note, we are managing our capital in a very disciplined way, seeking the right balance between sales growth and profitability as we integrate digital and physical. Based on our views of the global macro-economic environment, and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $1.06 and $1.18.", "Our second quarter guidance includes the impact of approximately $0.04 per share from our previously announced investments in both associate wages and training, as well as $0.04 per share from currency.", "Now as a reminder, our full year earnings per share guidance assumes the impact of approximately $0.20 per share from our strategic investments in both associate wages and training, as well as an incremental $0.06 to $0.09 per share in e-commerce investment. In our first quarter, we incurred approximately $0.02 per share from our investment in associate wages and training and an incremental $0.02 per share from our e-commerce investments.", "In addition to the impact from these two significant investments, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind for the year. Assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on full year net sales would be approximately $14 billion. Now, this compares to our guidance in February of approximately $10 billion. Again, assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on our earnings per share this year would be approximately $0.13 per share, compared to our prior guidance of $0.10 per share.", "We continue to expect our effective tax rate to range between 32% and 34% for this fiscal year. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items, and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. In February, we indicated that we expected our first quarter effective tax rate to be the highest of all four quarters this year. However, given the fluctuations that I just mentioned, we were below that initial forecast.", "Before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I would like to address a few additional items. You\u2019re familiar with how we prioritize our capital, and the first is organic growth. In this fiscal year, we added approximately 4.1 million additional square feet of retail space around the world.", "Additionally, when there are opportunities that can increase our ability to serve customers and add shareholder value, we will invest beyond our capital plan that we shared in October. Our recent announcement in Canada regarding the acquisition and renovation of specific real estate locations from a competitor for approximately $290 million is a great example of such an opportunity. Our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. It\u2019s important to remind you that we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders, and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases throughout the year.", "Before I close, I would like to reiterate that working capital management remains a very high priority for us. We acknowledge there\u2019s more work to do across our business, but our leadership teams are committed to further improvement throughout this year.", "With that, thank you for your support of our company. We hope to see all of you at Shareholders this year.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "This call included certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

Doug?", "Doug McMillon ", "Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone.", "Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Wal-Mart U.S. holiday meeting in Denver. As you may know we gather all of our store managers and market managers to talk about the plan for the holiday season and take stock of where are as a business. I can tell you that the feeling in the room was as good as it\u2019s been in years. Our stores in the US are getting better, our associates are happier and our managers are leading it.", "I talked with our managers about how our company has always changed to serve customers. And we are in another period of change right now. I shared an article from Fortune magazine that I keep in my office titled \u201cCan Wal-Mart get back the magic.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty strong indictment of our future. And the fun fact is that, it was written in 1996. Just as it was in 1996, we will win the future of retail if we make the right choices as a business. We have a strong point of view on what that future will look like.", "Through technology, data and mobile we have incredible new ways to serve customers today and the opportunities are only growing. We believe the winners in retail will be those who can bring together the best of the offline world with the best of online to serve customer however they want to shop and we believe Wal-Mart has unique competitive advantages in this race.", "We\u2019re moving forward on our enterprise strategy to position ourselves to win, playing offence, which is the only way to play in retail. This is true around the world, it is not just U.S. opportunity. The changes we need to make require investment and we\u2019re pleased with the steps we\u2019ve taken. We made continued progress towards our plan this quarter. Even if it\u2019s not as fast as we would like, the fundamentals of serving our customers are consistently improving and it\u2019s reflected in our comps and revenue growth.", "Our strategy starts with running great stores and clubs. In Denver, we talked about the choices we\u2019re making as a business, as you know in the first quarter we initiated a comprehensive multiyear plan to increase starting wages and training for associates in our U.S. stores and clubs. During the second quarter, we implemented the next phase of changes to our Wal-Mart U.S. store structure including adding department managers.", "Our focus on running better stores that are clean and well stocked have friendly associates and an efficient checkout is resonating with customers. They have always counted on Wal-Mart to have great prices, now we are building their trust with better in stock and delivering an enjoyable shopping experience. As a result, Wal-Mart U.S. delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales as overall net sales grew nearly 5%. ", "Customer traffic was strong again this quarter. Lower gas prices helped. I continue to be encouraged by the sales momentum that we are seeing especially in general merchandize and I\u2019m confident that customers are benefiting from the investments we\u2019re making in our stores and associates. Obviously, we would like to see it ramp higher and faster, we also recognize it won\u2019t be a linear path up into the right but we like the trend line.", "Although we grew top line sales, we did fall short on managing the bottom line, during the quarter, operating expenses were higher than expected and our gross margin was lower than planned. We are not pleased or satisfied. For the back half of the year, we will manage these items closely with the continued commitment to efficiency, cutting cost where appropriate even in a period of investment. ", "Similar to the first quarter, Wal-Mart International constant currency sales growth was solid this quarter with Mexico and Canada delivering strong comps. We are also excited about the opportunities we see in China despite slower economic growth and currency pressures. Our position is improving, we are gaining market share in the hypermarket category, Sam\u2019s Club continues to perform well and we have great opportunities in eCommerce.", "Brazil and UK remain challenging markets but for different reasons. I\u2019m pleased that our U.S. Sam\u2019s Club comp sales improved this quarter and membership income was up close to 6%. Members are recognizing the enhanced value in our plus memberships, which drove continued growth this quarter both in club and online. Another piece of our plan to win is to build and run great eCommerce; we have made a lot of progress improving our mobile and eCommerce capabilities this year with several important milestones in the second quarter.", "You will hear more details from Neil shortly about the investments that we have made in Pangaea, our global technology platform and the progress on opening our four new fulfillment centers in the United States. These investments are designed to give customers the ability to find what they want more easily and get what they want faster while enabling us to fulfill orders in a more cost effective manner. Another important milestone in the quarter was our acquisition of the remaining stake of Yihaodian, our eCommerce business in China.", "We are extremely excited about the growth potential of Yihaodian and the opportunity it presents over time to deliver for customers in a seamless manner. In the second quarter, Wal-Mart\u2019s worldwide eCommerce sales grew approximately 16% on a constant currency basis led by solid results in both of our U.S. businesses Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s Club. The third leg of our strategy is to innovate the future retail by bringing online and offline together. Here we can see the pieces starting to come together. In the U.S., the response to our grocery home shopping offering [has] [ph] been strong, I\u2019m particularly pleased with the number of repeat customers we have and the strength of our average ticket.", "Anecdotally, I can share that customers have told us it\u2019s changing their perception of the shopping experience at Wal-Mart. In stores, we have been aggressively pursuing store pickup options and pickup while on a very small base in Wal-Mart terms is growing very quickly. At samsclub.com, we are also seeing stronger sales as members appreciate the convenience of our club pickup. We are also focused on leveraging data to bring exciting member relevant merchandise to our clubs and online with an eye towards to growing our share members from the higher income household demographic.", "Internationally one of the encouraging signs we are seeing in Mexico and Canada is that customers are not only purchasing more in our stores, but also driving sales through eCommerce and mobile commerce. In China, we are expanding our Omni-channel offerings with the new test of in-store pickup of online orders in a number of Shenzhen stores. Chinese customers increasingly value the choice of both picking up their online orders in a local store and having it shipped to their homes. And we have started integrating our digital and physical offering for these customers. ", "Winning in the future requires change.

These impacts coupled with higher wage investments impacted EPS.", "Wal-Mart U.S. is the driver of our bottom line results. With the headwinds I just mentioned continuing the rest of the year and the level of investments we have our operating income will continue to be pressured.

As a quick recap, we have re-platformed both our technology and physical distribution network for eCommerce.", "The technology platform Pangaea is consistently improving the customer experience and conversion for Walmart.com, which has led to solid sales growth.

GMV or gross merchandise value grew approximately 18% on a constant currency basis. The highlight was solid growth in the Walmart.com and samsclub.com U.S. businesses while international was soft due to economic challenges in several of our key markets. Because of the softness in international we are resetting our Global eCommerce sales growth forecast for this fiscal year from the mid 20s to a range in the mid to high teens. As I mentioned both businesses in the U.S. are going very well. ", "A great example of how everything came to life with our Walmart.com Dare to Compare event that we kicked off in July. This event created a perfect opportunity to highlight that customers can trust us to offer them the assortment they want at low prices everyday, not just during a one day sale. We were able to use our technology platform and sophisticated pricing algorithms to help us track and deliver lower pricing than competitors. Given that we\u2019ve tripled our assortment in the past three years, we had more items for customers to shop. Customers could then choose how to get their purchases in the most convenient way for them.", "We offered customers the option to get orders shipped to their door or to a store with same day pickup. In fact, it led to our biggest day of the year so far for same day pick up. The flexibility of our new platform allowed us to move very quickly and the new site delivered a better, faster shopping experience to customers. And those customers who are shopping on mobile devices had an improved experience, thanks to the responsive design we rolled out in the quarter. We are using eCommerce to bring both new customers to Wal-Mart, as well as to deepen our relationship with our existing customers. On the largest day of our Dare to Compare event, we saw more than double the number of new customers to Walmart.com than a typical day.

We are growing sales faster than the market and we are continuing to see growth in GMV. Our team has used this opportunity to build a lean and nimble operating model that can succeed in any market condition.", "As Doug mentioned, we acquired the remaining shares of Yihaodian in China. In 2012, we became 51% owners and we have seen strong growth since that time. Yihaodian now has about a 100 million registered customers, more than twice as many as when we first invested.

Greg?", "Greg Foran", "Thank you, Neil. As Doug mentioned, we are encouraged by our top line growth particularly traffic. Our bottom line came in substantially below what was planned, three major factors contributed to our underperformance, a decline in gross margin primarily related to lower than expected pharmacy reimbursements and accelerating pressures as well as higher than planned investment in store house, which was essential to improving the customer experience.

We know we can do better and we will.", "For the Wal-Mart U.S. business doing better means staying focused on an aggressive strategic plan to improve the customer experience in our stores and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth for the long-term.

Finally we have increased the amount in associate will receive upon being promoted into higher levels of responsibility. These changes gauge pay raises to an additional 150,000 associates who are critical to improving the in store experience. Alongside wage improvement and to support career development we are rolling out new training programs designed to help associates grow their careers at Wal-Mart and provide a better experience for our customers. These programs, which will be, rolled out this fall hands on structured and tailored specifically to a position ensuring that training is relevant to an associate\u2019s current role or to a future role they inspire to achieve.

Every day a sample of customers in every store right us across a number of matrix including providing a faster checkout, friendly service and clean store environment based on the writings from the surveys we can see that our stores are making significant improvement from the baseline and we expect that trend to continue. Improving the customer experience is fundamental to our success.", "Finally, we are proud of the impact these decisions have had on our associates. Nearly 80% of about 1.2 million US store associates participated in our annual associate\u2019s survey administered during this quarter.

New products particularly in chemicals drove additional momentum; more noticeably continued pressure in food from declining inflation negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 60 basis points.", "Moving to the reminder of our financials, gross profit rate declined 41 basis points this quarter. As I said before, this was driven by a handful of key issues. Let\u2019s talk about pharmacy. Reflecting industry wide trends, we are seeing reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, which is negatively impacting gross margin. We are also seeing a lower mix of higher margin cash transactions reflecting a marketplace shift in which more customers are now benefiting from greater drug insurance coverage. While we are taking a number of actions to listen the impact we expect to have pressure on pharmacy for the rest of the fiscal year.", "Additionally, inventory shrinkage was meaningfully higher than planned for the quarter.

Additionally, we continued our focus on clearing our backroom of inventory improving operational efficiency in the stores.", "These actions along with better management of seasonal inventory and reducing modular changes and future shipments to the stores allowed us to reduce comp store inventory while improving both in stock levels and sales.

Additionally, we opened 22 traditional format neighborhood markets and the final six of our smaller format neighborhood market test locations.", "As we think about future store openings, we will continue to focus on quality versus quantity. Having opened more than 350 neighborhood markets in the past two years, we have a better understanding of what customers value most from the choice of location to the size of the box to the product offerings. Based on these learnings, we have decided not to pursue a number of potential locations as they would not provide the type of quality experience customers expect from a neighborhood market. We now expect to open a total of 160 to 170 neighborhood markets in fiscal 2016 including the 51 locations already opened.", "Our previous forecast was to open between 180 and 200 neighborhood markets; we are still on track to do approximately 60 to 70 supercenters this year, which was our original forecast. We know that we still have a lot of work to do to achieve the long-term goals we have set in business, the investments we\u2019re making along with the headwinds we\u2019ve mentioned will weigh more heavily on operating income than initially forecasted.", "Amidst the pressures we are thoughtfully evaluating every decision and use of company resources as we go through the back half of the year. But we are confident in the direction we are headed. We are seeing improvements everyday from sales and traffic growth to increased customer satisfaction to more engaged associates.

The international business had a fairly solid quarter given tough economic environments in certain markets and ongoing currency impacts.

Our Mexico team has done an excellent job reenergizing that business driving strong performance across all formats. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in Mexico along with the improving core business.

Operating income grew faster than sales. The sale of that banking unit in the second quarter along with the Whips restaurant divesture last fiscal year helps us focused on our core business, which is our strength.

Since the launch of this program last quarter for plus members we see that those who utilize the program transfer on average two thirds of their scripts to Sam\u2019s Club.", "We are optimistic that these trends will continue to drive traffic. Our fresh freezer cooler business was softer than expected due to deflation and key dairy commodities such as milk and cheese along with higher costs in areas such as meat. Grocery and beverages delivered low single-digit comps with dry grocery delivering solid comp sales. The consumables business also delivered low single-digit comps driven by laundry and tabletop categories.", "Our technology, entertainment, and office businesses I\u2019ll be at posting negative comments saw improvement from Q1 levels. We thought acceleration in certain key categories such as tablets that was offset in part by a wireless business which is been negatively impacted by the industry shift to installment plans. We continue to make progress in eCommerce to build the most convenient club in the industry.", "We are pleased with her ongoing integration of digital and physical. ECommerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to our club comp performance during the period and traffic to our site was up just over 20%. We delivered the new club pickup options that make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club. Prepay club pickup rolled out across the country and we started testing mobile check-in and drive through in several clubs. ", "The number of members trying it for the first time during the quarter exceeded our expectations and we expect ongoing acceptance of the service. We have also improved the assortment and pricing online knowing that members love the treasure hunt we launched shocking values they give members access to special items at outstanding prices for very limited time. Shocking values products are carefully chosen based on member\u2019s interest top trends and items from the company\u2019s most popular shopping categories.", "In addition, our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience and drove double-digit growth in traffic. Membership income was up versus last year with growth driven by social media campaigns as well as strong plus renewals and upgrades due to the benefits of cash rewards. We also continue to emphasize our award-winning Sam\u2019s Club 531 MasterCard which allows members to save inside and outside the club.", "We have received very positive feedback from our members on this program. We recently hosted our annual supplier Summit here in Bentonville and we were pleased with the excellent attendance and engagement our suppliers are very interested in the work we\u2019ve done to ensure their grade items are getting in front of our member base. They are supportive of the innovation and merchandising transformation we have in place. We have great items coming for the holidays.", "We are focused on further progress in the Sam\u2019s Club business for the back half of the year. For the 13-week period ending October 30, 2015 we expect comp sales without feel to be between flat and up 2%. ", "Now I will turn things over to Charles. Charles.", "Charles Holley", "Thanks Ros. I will start with the top line. We are pleased with the sales increase as we saw in the U.S. as well is in our international businesses when considering cost of currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Wal-Mart U.S. show we are on the right track with their investments.", "Wal-Mart U.S. now has had positive comps for four straight quarters. As expected these investments impacted both operating expenses and profits. In addition, Wal-Mart U.S. experienced gross margin pressure from pharmacy and shrink that we had not expected. Looking forward at the rest of the year operating profit will be pressured more than we originally planned this is primarily driven by the headwinds to Wal-Mart U.S. gross margins that I just mentioned. ", "We will continue to scrutinize and evaluate how we manage our capital in order to optimize both the customer experience and returns.", "Before I turn to guidance, let me cover some other items. You may have read in our earnings release, that we are reviewing leases across all of our segments. This is part of a comprehensive ongoing lease review. One item that we are focusing on and may need to be corrected relates to leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lesser construction of the leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. This results in capitalizing these leased assets on our balance sheet. We don\u2019t know the impact of our financial statements but believe it mostly to be a balance sheet issue at this time. We will provide more information once the review is complete.", "Turing to cash, during the quarter we spent approximately $760 million to acquire the remaining shares of Yihaodian. A strategic acquisitions for eCommerce growth in China. In addition, we continued to provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases and then a second quarter we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $1 billion of shares. This represents our larger share purchase activity in the last four quarters.", "As always, we will remain opportunistic with repurchase throughout the year, as of the end of the second quarter we had approximately $9 billion remaining under our current $15 billion authorization. Membership and other income increased 13.9% to $899 million. Other income primarily benefited from the gain on the sale of the bank operations in Mexico. FCPA and compliance related costs were approximately $30 million comprised of approximately $23 million for the ongoing enquires in investigations and approximately $7 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.", "Last year, FCPA and compliance related costs were $43 million in the second quarter. We expect FCPA related expenses to continue to turn down so we now expect our full year FCPA related expenses to range between $130 million and $150 million. This compares to our guidance in February of $160 million to $180 million. Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2015 with 16.2% which compares to 16.7% last year. The decline in our ROI has primarily been due to continued capital investments as well as our decrease in operating income.", "Earlier, Greg mentioned that as part of our commitment to EDLC, we are working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our Wal-Mart US suppliers. To drive simplicity and consistence across our business. We began this effort in June and discussions will continue over the coming months. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than sales. While we are pleased with the progress in managing our inventories, working capital is still an opportunity for us to generate stronger free cash flow.", "Now let\u2019s turn our attention to guidance. In February, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. Today, we expect our fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.40 and $4.70 including a range of $0.93 and a $1.05 for the third quarter. This new range includes the following updated assumptions. First, the impact from our investments and wages, training, and additional hours in our stores will be approximately $0.24 including approximately $0.80 in the third quarter. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.10 of the expected full year impact, this compares to our original guidance in February of approximately $0.20.", "As you heard from Greg earlier, our decision to increase associate hours beyond our February plan to areas of the store such as front end and stocking positions are intended to drive the most benefit for our customers.", "Next the incremental investment in global eCommerce will range between $0.06 and $0.09, this is unchanged from our guidance in February. In the third quarter, we expect the impact to be approximately $0.02. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.04 of the expected full-year impact. Third, we expect the full-year impact of approximately $0.11 including approximately $0.03 in the third quarter for unplanned headwinds that I discussed earlier. The headwinds are primarily in Wal-Mart U.S. pharmacy margins as well as higher than expected stream continuing through this fiscal year. Assuming currency exchanges remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full-year impact to be approximately $0.15 up $0.02 from last quarter\u2019s revised guidance of $0.13.", "Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 32% and 34% unchanged from our guidance in February. Now as a remainder our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and maybe impacted by number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances.", "Changes in law, outcomes, the administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations and in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year. We will host our annual investment meeting in New York on October 14. As we have in previous annual investment community meetings, we will provide an update on our capital plans at that time.

The date of this call is November 17, 2015. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Wal-Mart shareholders and the investment community.

Last, Charles Holley, Wal-Mart's CFO, will wrap up with details on guidance for fourth quarter and the full year.", "Now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug?", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our third-quarter earnings, as well as the strategy we shared at our annual meeting to the investment community last month.", "Overall we had a good quarter. We delivered earnings per share well within our guidance range, recorded our fifth straight quarter of positive comps at Wal-Mart U.S. and had solid international sales and profit growth on a constant currency basis. At the same time, we still have plenty of work to do and there are areas of our business that must perform better. Our earnings per share were $1.03 and we posted total revenue of $117.4 billion. I want to highlight that on a constant currency basis, our total revenue would have been $122.4 billion. That's growth of $3.4 billion or 2.8% on a constant currency basis, which is solid growth.", "Even if the percentage doesn't sound high because we have such a large denominator, not many companies grow by this amount in a quarter. I call this out because I don't want the currency impacts to obscure the strength of our business. We are a growth company and we're growing.", "As we expected, operating income continued to be pressured by our decision to invest in our frontline associates. To improve the store experience for our customers and create a bridge to our future where digital capabilities will play an increasing role in our stores, we're making a $1.2 billion planned investment in our people this year that we understood what impact near-term operating income. This is by far the biggest driver of the decline in consolidated operating income.", "Before going into the details, I want to take a step back to talk about our strategy. At our investor meeting last month, we shared more detail than usual about the next three years of our growth plan. We've never been a company that manages only for the short term and that's certainly true during this period of change. Although investments in our people and technology impact near-term earnings, they will help us deliver sustainable growth and returns to shareholders over time. We're confident these are the right steps because we know where and how we're going to win. We will be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. No matter how you choose to shop with us, through your mobile device, online, in a store, or a combination, it will be fast and easy. Online retailers are testing physical store experiences because they recognize the same [audio gap] network of stores supported by a supply chain and systems like ours with an emerging set of digital capabilities to win with customers.", "As we create this seamless experience we're positioning for growth in five key areas. First, we will continue to win on value. We've won on value in the past and that won't change. Second, convenience is increasingly important as customers want to save both money and time. Third, we will always work to be great merchants whether in stores or online. Fourth, we're focused on the key geographies for customer growth which are North America and China.", "Finally, we want to appeal to a blend of income levels the way we're approaching e-commerce, neighborhood markets, Sam's Club, grocery pickup and other areas we'll appeal to value conscious customers of all demographics. We already serve customers from all income levels around the world but we have an opportunity to get even stronger. By taking these steps we will grow the company faster. We will add between $45 and $60 billion of revenue to the company in the next three years. That's a lot of growth. It just happens to be on a big base.", "Returning to this quarter's results, one of the most important takeaways is that U.S. stores continue to improve with total net sales up nearly 4%. In addition to positive comp sales, Wal-Mart U.S. had its fourth straight quarter of positive traffic. We're now lapping positive comp sales and building on our progress. Our customers are telling us that our efforts around clean, fast and friendly are resonating. Neighborhood markets continued to show strong sales led by newer stores and have posted positive comps for 19 consecutive quarters. A key part of creating a seamless shopping experience is to have great stores and we feel good about where we're headed.", "We also made strides in the U.S. on adding critical capabilities to our supply chain. In the third quarter, we opened a new e-commerce fulfillment center in Atlanta with more than 1 million ft\u00b2 of space. This is our fifth next-generation fulfillment center. As we build out our e-commerce capabilities we are deepening our digital relationships with our customers. We've accelerated our expansion of online grocery pickup and we've seen that customers who start using online grocery spent nearly 50% more than similar customers who shop only in stores. This is the customer we're going after. The shopper in our sweet spot who accesses Wal-Mart in multiple ways. We also began the chain-wide use of a mobile service that can tell us when a customer is coming to pick up an online general merchandise order before they even walk into the store. We launched a new digital wish list that you can build at home or simply by scanning items in a store. We expect more than 210 million visits to our app in November and December up from 18 million in 2012.", "Last month, we told you about our longer-term plans to grow e-commerce sales and GMB. That plan anticipates ebbs and flows along the way but we are confident in our targets. We continue to expect to grow mid to high teens for this fiscal year. During the third quarter, global e-commerce sales and GMB growth both came in at around 10%, this was due primarily to continued economic challenges in our major international markets including Brazil China and the U.K. In the U.S. where we've seen good growth for the year, we continue to make progress on key initiatives. But we know we have more work to do. I was pleased that SamsClub.com continued to deliver strong growth.", "In Wal-Mart International we're pleased with the solid 3.2 sales growth on a constant-currency basis. Operating income grew faster than sales at 8.5% excluding currency. Our North American markets delivered strong performance and Mexico in particular is starting to fire on all cylinders. I'm pleased with our momentum in these markets we continue to face specific challenges in the U.K. and Brazil.", "China remains a huge long term opportunity. We started in China in 1996. We've grown the business, reached profitability years ago and grown our level of profitability. We obviously learned a lot about Chinese customers and the market and that's an asset. A few weeks ago I was back in Beijing and Shanghai walking stores, clubs and visiting our e-commerce offices. We now have a total of 12 Sam's Clubs open and they're performing very well. Our stores have clearly improved operationally in recent years in particular and now they're supported by a supply chain that positions us to win. We see that e-commerce, online grocery and convenience are critical in the dense urban areas that make up so much of the Chinese opportunity. That's why our Yihaodian acquisition is of such strategic significance.", "We also recommitted to our work on food safety, environmental sustainability and empowering women during my visit, announcing another investment in the China Women's Development Foundation. With the improvements we've made to our stores and clubs and the full acquisition of Yihaodian we have a unique opportunity and a plan to put it all together to win in China.", "While positive, our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales without fuel were at the low end of our guidance. We were pleased with the growth of membership income but we can do better with our overall results. Sam's Club did take important steps this quarter to deepen digital relationships with our members through club pickup, expanded mobile check-in capabilities and extended drive-through or curbside options. Roz will share more about our strategy going forward in a moment.", "In addition to releasing earnings, today is a big day at our home office. We're holding a sustainability milestone meeting to celebrate 10 years of progress on sustainability since our then-CEO Lee Scott delivered a landmark speech titled 21st-Century Leadership. In those remarks, Lee laid out three big bills for Wal-Mart: to be powered by 100% renewable energy; to create zero waste; and to sell products that sustain people and the environment. It was a defining moment for our company. By looking through the lens of sustainability, Lee realized we could think about problems in creative ways, make our business more efficient and bring renewed passion to our work. It was and is inspiring to be part of this journey.", "Today we'll mark how far we've come and what we've achieved. For example, the savings we've generated from reducing waste, running our truck fleet more efficiently and pursuing energy efficiency has been good for society and good for our shareholders. We're getting excited to take the next steps in this journey early next year. In true Wal-Mart fashion we're looking at ways to make a difference in the world, serve our stakeholders and drive our bottom line.", "Let me reiterate that we are excited about the unique opportunity we have to create a seamless shopping experience for our customers and ensure sustainable growth for the business. We're making critical investments to better serve our customers, associates and shareholders, and we are on the right path.", "As I close I want to pause to thank Charles Holley for his years of outstanding service to Wal-Mart. As you know, he's made the decision to retire. He's been a huge asset to the company and a great partner to me and the leadership team. This is his last earnings call and he will be missed. Thank you, Charles.", "Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?", "Claire Babineaux-Fontenot", "Thanks, Doug. Today I'll provide commentary on the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript. Prior to discussing our results, let me talk about an item that, although immaterial, impacts comparability against last year.", "As we disclosed in the second quarter, we conducted a global review of the accounting treatment for leases, which included a focus on leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lessor's construction of the leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. In the third quarter, we finalized this review and recorded an immaterial cumulative adjustment.", "On a consolidated basis, the immaterial adjustment increased total assets by approximately $1.7 billion, which was primarily an increase in property under capital lease and financing obligations; increased total liabilities by approximately $1.6 billion, which was primarily an increase in current and long-term capital lease and financing obligations; and it positively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.04.", "Let's now move to our results for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart EPS were $1.03, which includes the items mentioned above. Additionally, there were significant items that negatively impacted EPS including investments and wages and training, in the U.S. of approximately $0.10 and currency exchange rate movements totaling $0.04. Last year's EPS was $1.15. Total revenue reached $117.4 billion. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $5 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $122.4 billion.", "Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 91 basis points compared to last year. Primarily as a result of investments in store wages and labor hours in the U.S. Additionally, as CPA and compliance related cost were $30 million. Comprised of $22 million for ongoing inquiries and investigation, and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year FCPA and compliance related costs were approximately $41 million.", "The company's consolidated operating income decreased 8.8% to $5.7 billion. Excluding the impact from currency of approximately $214 million, operating income decreased by 5.4%. Primarily related to the factors that increased our operating expenses.", "I'll close today's discussion with a few comments on returns. At Wal-Mart we remain committed to providing good returns for our shareholders. During last month's meeting for the investment community, we announced a new share purchase authorization of $20 billion, and said that our intention is to utilize this authorization over a two-year period. The company repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares for $437 million during the third quarter.", "Return on investment ROI for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2015 was 15.9% versus 16.4% for the prior comparable period. The decline in ROI was primarily due to our decrease in operating income as well as continued capital investments.", "Thank you for listening. And now I will turn it over to Greg. Greg?", "Greg Foran", "Thank you, Clair. Last month at our annual meeting for the investment community I spoke in detail about how Wal-Mart U.S. will execute our part of the plan to be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience of scale. We will drive growth and deliver shareholder returns by winning with stores, delivering value, being great merchants, and providing our customers with the convenient shopping experience that is fast and easy. Although we are in the early stages of our journey we are confident in our plan and we are executing against it.", "Now let's talk about our Q3 performance. As we've said before, we continue to measure our success in terms of traffic, in-stock and customer experience. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the top line. Net sales increased $2.7 billion or 3.8%. Unit sales picked up, and traffic strengthened improving 40 basis points from Q2 to 1.7%.", "This is now the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic growth for Wal-Mart U.S. Our comp sales growth of 1.5% was solidly within our guidance despite minimal food inflation. In-stocks improved while comp store inventory declined.", "Our customers told us they are happy with the improvements we're making in the shopping experience as reflected in our customer experience scores. To date, 70% of our stores have achieved the initial goal we set for them. And we will raise the bar for next year. We also saw some progress this quarter in gross margin with the work we've put in on pharmacy markdowns and shrink. However, as we've discussed before, the investments in our stores and our associates are significant and will continue to pressure the bottom line.", "All formats in our portfolio had positive comps this quarter. We are happy with the progress we've made in our Supercenters which saw continued traffic growth and positive comps across all areas except entertainment.", "Our traditional format neighborhood markets delivered an approximate 8% comp in the third quarter. A 70 basis point acceleration from our Q2 comp and aided by strong performance in our less mature stores.", "New technology and processes are improving end stocks and we're working hard on providing the best associate coverage to most effectively serve our customers. Most importantly, Fresh remains a key focus. We're encouraged by our newest prototype, which features better sightlines and displays. We've seen Fresh penetration expand in the store relative to its peers. We've made solid progress this year but we still have a ways to go to ensure we're creating the best experience for our customer while simultaneously improving the profitability of this format.", "In e-commerce, we made strides on deepening the digital relationship with our customer. This quarter we accelerated our online grocery pickup offering to 85 additional locations. We now have almost 140 locations across 25 markets that offer the customer the ability to order their groceries online and conveniently pick up at a time of their choosing. We also launched a new mobile service which alerts us when a customer is coming to pick up their online general merchandise order even before they walk into the store. And just in time for the holidays, we introduced a digital wish list that can be built at home or by simply scanning items while at the store. E-commerce sales and traffic were softer than we would like. We'll continue to strive to balance sales growth and profitability. Overall, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 15 basis points to our comp.", "From a merchandise perspective, we saw growth across most of the store, particularly in our apparel, hardlines, home and seasonal businesses. While warmer weather somewhat slowed performance in October, solid back to school and Halloween seasons, along with new launchers such as Pioneer Woman and STAR WARS drove mid-single-digit comps across each of these departments. Continued growth in prescription count and branded drug inflation drove mid-single-digit comps in Health and Wellness. As you see, it was also strong as better end stocks, particularly in Vitamins, helped drive sales.", "In Food, we saw our best top line results of the year despite minimal inflation, which negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 90 basis points. Momentum from a solid Labor Day weekend continued through to Halloween. We're particularly pleased with the results in Fresh, where we brought in new products, developed strong price leadership through strategic buys and promoted locally sourced and organic products.", "While most of the box continued to grow, we still have considerable headwinds in Entertainment. A slow adoption of new technology in televisions and the shift from post-paid to installment wireless plans contributed to disappointing sales results. We're working on improving our operating model in this area both in terms of service to our customers and in the layout of the department. We've made some progress this year, including the recent remodel of the Rogers Akinsource [ph] supercenter we showed you last month, but it will take time to get this department where it needs to be.", "Moving on to the remainder of our financials, gross margin increased 32 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in Food, General Merchandise and Consumables but was somewhat offset by declines in Health and Wellness. Reimbursement levels continued to pressure pharmacy profits; however, we've made some strides across several initiatives that improved margins in this department versus Q2. Additionally, we remain focused on our urgent agenda items, including better management of markdowns to zero. Finally, while only just beginning to show in our results, we are pleased with our efforts thus far on addressing shrink, which has been a significant headwind for us this year.", "As we've said before, our top priority this year is to provide a better customer experience in our stores. We're committed to actions that help accomplish this goal as we have invested this year in our associates and in improving our stores. These investments are substantial and continue to reflect in our bottom line performance. Specifically in the third quarter, we intentionally added store labor hours above our initial plans and incurred significant maintenance expenses related to the customer-facing areas of the store. These investments, along with the wage increases and the store structure changes implemented earlier this year, drove the majority of the 116 basis point deleverage in operating expenses.", "As the store experience is being addressed and efficiencies are created through new tools, technology and processes, we've begun calibrating labor hours against these improvements. Over time, as the productivity loop begins turning faster, we know we can create a strong balance between experience and profitability.", "We did benefit this quarter from the immaterial lease accounting cumulative adjustment that Claire mentioned in her earlier remarks. Which favorably impacted operating expenses by $74 million.", "As a result of our focus on improving customer experience, along with our ongoing investments in e-commerce, and somewhat offset by the lease accounting adjustment I just mentioned, operating income declined 8.6%. Excluding the impact from the lease adjustment, operating income declined approximately 10%.", "Moving on, in the third quarter, total inventory grew around 1% which was less than half the rate of sales. Inventory declined approximately 1.9% from comp stores as new processes in technology have reduced inventory across the store while simultaneously improving in stock levels. We are proud of the progress we've made this year on improving inventory levels across our network, but we have room to improve and we remain focused on these efforts.", "Finally, on the real estate side, we opened 15 Supercenters in the third quarter including relocations and expansions, and 35 traditional format neighborhood markets. We are working hard on improving both of these formats to ensure we have the best customer offering alongside strong operating efficiency. We'll continue to test ideas honing in on the best options for each of these formats.", "Shifting now to the fourth quarter, the holiday season is upon us. Our associates have been working hard all year to prepare. And we ready. We have the best value on great merchandise for the entire season without gimmicks. Our merchants have done a terrific job of listening to our customers on what they are looking for this season. We are excited about programs such as Chosen by Kids and our exclusive one hour guarantee event. This holiday, we're working to bring our customers an improved shopping experience. Whether they are in the store, online or using our mobile app.", "We know the holidays will be competitive. Additionally, we expect food inflation to remain low relative to last year, and will lap last year's significant drop in the fuel prices, which will make the comparison for the fourth quarter more difficult. But we're confident in our strategy and the actions we have taken, and believe they will help offset some of these pressures.", "Therefore, for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, we expect the comp sales increase of around 1% which would represent a 50 basis point improvement in our two-year comps stack from third quarter. Last year's fourth quarter comp was up 1.5% our strongest comp performance for fiscal 2015. And for last quarter an operating income growing faster than sales, both on a constant currency basis. Comp trends in Mexico and Canada continue to be strong which more than offset weaker performances in the U.K. Brazil and China. Where we continue to experience various competitive and economic challenges.", "Our markets remain focused on the strategic priorities discussed earlier this year, which include, actively managing the existing portfolio, delivery balanced growth, including e-commerce, being the lower cost operator, and building solid foundations in terms of talent, trust and technology.", "Let me touch on some of the progress we've made. We continue to take action this year to drive simplicity and focus in our portfolio. We sold a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner in Canada. And exited our Bank operations in Mexico. We are currently pursuing the sale of a portfolio shopping centers in Chile. And we are closing our business-to-business sales operations in the U.K.", "At the same time, we've looked for ways to enhance our portfolio in core markets which we've done by taking full ownership of Yihaodian in China, and acquiring 13 stores in 1 DC from a former competitor in Canada.", "We'll continue to review our portfolio to simplify our operations and help our teams stay focused on running great businesses. Our markets continue to invest heavily in price, quality and service aimed at driving comp sales.", "Our overall trend is improving, as seven of our eleven markets have now delivered positive comps for six straight quarters. We're delivering value and providing convenience that is attracting customers to our stores, clubs, websites and apps across our markets. I'm pleased with the innovation we're driving in e-commerce, led by online grocery, and I'm excited about the potential we have to access a broader customer segment. We continue to learn from our online grocery business in the U.K. as we test and roll out similar initiatives in Mexico and Canada and build a strong platform for growth in China.", "As Doug mentioned, the continued economic challenges in some of our major markets impacted on our overall global e-commerce sales growth this quarter. We still have work to do but I'm confident we're executing against this key strategic priority.", "Now let's discuss our overall results. In the third quarter, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis. Reported net sales declined 11.4%, impacted by an approximately $5 billion currency impact from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact our reported results, so it's important to emphasize that our business on a constant currency basis is maintaining steady growth. We had strong positive comp sales in Mexico and Canada. The U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps, although the comps were slightly better in Q3 versus Q2. In each of our other markets, we had solid comps of at least 3%.", "Operating income grew faster than net sales at 8.5% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by excellent performance in Mexico and Canada. In addition, as Claire mentioned earlier, there was an immaterial lease accounting adjustment this quarter which favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $49 million on a constant currency basis. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 6.4%. On a constant currency basis inventory grew faster than net sales at 7%, primarily driven by our decision in Mexico to flow inventory through our import network early for the upcoming holiday season. On a reported basis inventory declined 10%.", "Now let's discuss market results, presented on a constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Let's begin with the U.K. Challenging competitive conditions persisted throughout the quarter as the market continues to experience rapid structural change. Customers have now benefited from more than 12 months of continually falling prices and the market has grown by less than 1% for six consecutive months. Despite a healthy overall economy, according to Cantar, the big four grocers continue to lose share to the discounters.", "U.K. net sales declined by 3.2% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 4.6%. Large store traffic and food remain the primary challenges, while online grocery continues to grow. The online business is focused on improving its core service offering and is performing above target on key internal performance metrics. Operating income increased, driven by reduced expenses as well as lapping some organizational restructuring costs from last year. The U.K. is focused on rebuilding momentum in this core business. Last month we launched Project Renewal, an 18-month project that reaffirms the direction set out in the five-year strategy but prioritizes investments more clearly on price, quality and service in large stores while putting non-core expansion, such as remote petrol stations, on hold. Greater focus on driving out inefficiencies across both buying and operations will enable the U.K. to build on its well-established value credentials and strengthen its competitive position.", "Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on October 27. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ. Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.4% with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.6% and comp sales increased 6.3%. Driven by solid comp growth in both self-service and Sam's Club. In self-service we achieved mid-single digit growth in groceries and high single digit growth in GM and apparel. Self-service continues to gain share and delivered a 220 basis point improvement in market share according to ANTAD. Sam's Club is maintaining a steady improvement in comps aided by ongoing events and campaigns to drive traffic and grow membership. We leveraged expenses in the quarter and grew operating income significantly faster than sales.", "Our e-commerce business in Mexico is growing in line with the market driven by strong growth in general merchandise. Under the Wal-Mart banner we're significantly expanding our assortment of ship-from-store items. We're rapidly growing store coverage for online grocery and customer orders are increasing. At Sam's Club we soft launched our new website while maintaining healthy growth with our existing platform. In Canada we continue to maintain solid growth and gain share in a competitive and low-growth environment. Net sales grew 5.7% and comps were up 4.3% driven by strong performance in the core grocery business as well as stronger performance in the GM business.", "In the quarter, Canada saw share gains in food, health and wellness, consumables and infants for the 12 weeks ended October the 29th according to Nielsen. In addition to strong top line performance, the team continues to focus on our low-cost operating model to drive a sustainable price advantage. Canada grew operating income faster than sales.", "We continue to invest in expanding customer access. We recently began a partnership with 7/11 and a piloting, grab-and-go lockers at some of the convenience stores in the greater Toronto area. We are pleased with the progress with our online grocery business has made since our pilot launched in July. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and I expect reliable growth to continue. In Brazil, the economic challenges are largely unchanged as high inflation and unemployment continue to impact consumer confidence and consumption levels. Net sales were down 0.4% and comps were down 0.6% driven by decline in hypermarket format mostly offset by strong sales growth in our wholesale business General merchandise primarily electronics accounted for the largest portion of the hypermarket sales decline. These economic challenges are impacting both our store and e-commerce sales. Operating income declined faster than sales due to increased labor claims, continued high utility costs, and higher markdown activity which helped us improve our inventory position going into the fourth quarter.", "Let's now shift to China, a key growth market. This quarter sales grew 2.9% driven by new store openings. Comp sales declined 0.7% in slower consumption growth. In the hypermarket channel, we gained share for an 11th consecutive quarter. We'll continue to invest in physical and digital to deliver a seamless shopping experience. We continue to drive efficiency in stores and at the home office. Operating income grew faster than net sales. We operate for less productivity initiatives remains a focus allowing reinvestment in labor and customer experience particularly in fresh.", "Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China is focused on further leveraging Wal-Mart's global and local assets. The business improved margins and balanced marketing spend and their intense competition on price. While I'm not satisfied with recent results, I'm confident in the actions we're taking in China that position us to achieve success for many years to come.", "Now let me recap. We had a good quarter with solid sales momentum in our underlying business driven by healthy comp sales in the majority of our markets. In addition, we delivered a relatively high level of constant currency operating profit. Our strategy remains focused and our priorities are clear and we're well-positioned for future growth.", "Now I will turn it to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?", "Rosalind Brewer", "Thanks, Dave. Today I'll share details about our third-quarter performance along with comp guidance for the fourth quarter. Members are at the center of the decisions we make and I'll talk about our ongoing efforts this year to deliver value for them. I'll also share with you specifics around our strategy, which is based on an in-depth review of the business that we've conducted this year.", "Before I get started, let me recognize Charles Redfield for his many contributions to Sam's Club over the last three years as our Chief Merchandising Officer. His passion for merchandising was experienced throughout the organization. We are excited for Charles as he takes on his new role as Head Merchant for Food in the Wal-Mart U.S. business. With Charles's transition, we are thrilled to have John Furner back at Sam's Club as our new Chief Merchandising Officer after having served as the Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer in China for nearly three years.", "Let's move on to a few specifics around our third quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.", "Comp sales for the third quarter were at the low end of our guidance. In key food categories we faced comparisons to last year's steep inflationary environment, and in our Wireless business we continued to experience headwinds from changing industry dynamics. We saw positive results in areas of the business that introduced more newness such as Health and Wellness and Consumables. Net sales grew 1.6% as comp sales increased 0.4%. Slide 10 provides the components of our comp increase. Ticket grew 70 basis points during the period. Positive momentum in traffic from savings members continued, but softness from our business member negatively impacted our results.", "Our gross profit rate increased 46 basis points from last year due to a disciplined focus on product acquisition costs, a favorable mix and logistics benefits. Operating expenses deleveraged during the quarter as we continued to invest in people and technology. We are confident that these are the right choices to make for our business and the benefits of these investments will help us deliver sustainable growth over time. Earlier you heard Claire talk about an immaterial item related to the company's accounting for certain leases, which resulted in a benefit to operating expenses of approximately $27 million for Sam's Club. We were pleased with the growth in membership income during the quarter, which increased 5.4%.", "Investments in the cash rewards program for Plus members resulted in improved Plus renewal rates and Plus penetration is at an all-time high. The impact of social media campaigns was also a contributing factor.", "Turning to our merchandising categories, let me talk about a few areas that had the most impact during the quarter. Please see slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories. Our Fresh, Freezer, Cooler business faced significant headwinds as deflation in key areas, including fresh meat and dairy weighed on our comps. We were pleased with our performance in produce.", "Technology and Entertainment was pressured during the period, led by a decline in Wireless. The industry shift to installment plans continued to negatively impact the category. In Electronics, Imaging and Audio performed well and we continued our efforts to refine the assortment. Health and wellness and Consumables benefited from innovation and newness. In Pharmacy, the free $4/$10 prescription program continued to drive growth in script count. New items in OTC led to a solid performance in the quarter and products like protein powder drove good results, further supporting our initiatives around Healthy For You.", "Our Consumables business benefited as several new items were launched and we continued to gain share in Tabletop as the focus on private brands and quality resonated with members. In e-commerce we continued to make progress with integrating digital efforts to transform how members shop and interact with our clubs. Business members have enjoyed the convenience of pre-ordering merchandise for pickup at the club for more than a decade. Now, through advances in technology along with innovation from the e-commerce team, all of our members can enjoy similar access with an improved digital experience. This year's rollout of club pickup to all of our clubs has been well received and represents the fastest-growing area of our business.", "Sales in the space increased to 50% during third quarter. We have also added features along the way. During the quarter, we completed the implementation of mobile check-in capability to provide members with a better experience and shorter wait times. We introduced yield sensing technology that alerts our associates when members drive onto the parking lot.", "We extended drive-through or curb-side options to more clubs, and members love the convenience. These new features build on earlier advances in club pickup, including easier reorder and a prepaid option. Now let me move on to guidance for the fourth quarter.", "As we move into the quarter we will face last year's inflationary environment and a tough comparison. As a result, we believe comp sales without fuel for the 13 week period ending January 29, 2016, will be flat to up 1%.", "Members are at the center of the decisions we make. We've worked diligently this year to deliver on what we know they want. They expect offerings that are relevant and convenient. They want excitement and newness. They want a seamless shopping experience that integrates the best of digital and physical.", "We see success where we are delivering on these expectations. For example, you've heard us talk about the expansion of organics in our assortment. Members ask for an improved selection, and we are delivering.", "Over the summer we launched shocking values online, which has helped to instill a treasure hunt mentality with members. And the innovative free $4/$10 prescription program is providing real savings to plus members and helping to lift the overall health and wellness category.", "I am pleased with the steps we've been taking throughout this year to deliver for members. We know we must do more with member relevant merchandise and new member growth. Today, I'm excited to share with you the plans we've developed as we look ahead.", "We have been focused on developing a strategy at Sam's Club that will deliver our business into the future and build long-term sustainable growth. The four key elements of our strategy include, growth through higher household income members in high-value business segments. Relevant merchandise and increase value for our members. Acquiring and retaining the right members and increasing the spend. And lastly, integrating digital to transform the club experience.", "In order to better align the businesses as we move forward, we made organizational changes and enhancements. John Furner is returning to Sam's Club as Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. John has rejoined the team after nearly three years of Chief Merchandising and Chief Marketing Officer of Wal-Mart China. Where he led merchandising, procurement, marketing supply chain, financial services and mobile commerce for the hyper-market division.", "Prior to moving overseas, John was Senior Vice President of Home and Apparel Merchandise in Global Sourcing for Sam's Club. In addition, we've reallocated resources pertaining to merchandising, and have created new positions in critical areas including data and analytics, fresh food, regional buying and proprietary brands. We also created a new leadership position dedicated to business member merchandising.", "Moving forward, we will continue to serve both savings and business members. We have clarity around the categories of members we will target. Data will drive our decisions, and we are confident we are focused on the right opportunities.", "As I close let me summarize today's thoughts. As we look back at the third quarter we acknowledge that we need to improve our sales. Where we introduce new merchandise, we deliver strong results. We continue to make strategic investments in people and technology as these are critical enablers of our strategy. We are also pleased with our efforts to further integrate digital and physical retail. Our members are at the center of all of our decisions. We are making progress across the club and through online and mobile commerce capabilities to deliver value for them.", "Whether it's saving them time with club pickup or saving them money on their prescriptions with free $4/$10 we continue to find new ways to innovate. And we are confident the strategy and enhancement to our organizational structure will propel her business into the future. Now, I will turn the call over to Charles. Charles?", "Charles Holley", "Thanks, Roz. I'd like to start by highlighting that we are pleased with the sales increases we experienced at Wal-Mart U.S. as well as in our international business when considering constant currency. Stronger traffic in our Wal-Mart U.S. stores and a fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales indicate that we are taking the right steps to win with customers, grow sales and deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. From in e-commerce standpoint we have long-term plans in place to grow our business. We are making progress on several of our key initiatives and recognize we have more work to do. As expected, the investments we are making in people and technology impacted both operating expenses and profits in the quarter. However, we delivered earnings per share well within our guidance and remain confident that these investments will better position Wal-Mart for the future.", "Now let's turn our attention to guidance for the fourth quarter and the full-year. Last quarter we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings-per-share to range between $4.40 and $4.70. Today we are narrowing our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range between $4.50 and $4.65 including a range of $1.40 and $1.55 for the fourth quarter. These ranges include the assumptions we provided in the second quarter which consists of the impact of our investments in wages, training and additional labor hours in our stores, the incremental investment in global e-commerce and the headwinds in the U.S. from pharmacy margins and shrink.", "Currency remains a significant headwind for us. As I indicated at our analyst meeting last month we expect our total net sales growth to be relatively flat for fiscal year 2016. It's important to note that if we were to exclude the impact of currency our total net sales growth would be around 3% for the year. Now, assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full-year impact to earnings-per-share to be approximately $0.16 up $0.01 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.15. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 31% and 33% for the full year. As we've indicated in the past, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year.", "Now as I've mentioned at our analyst meeting last month, we are monitoring progress in congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2014. If the legislation is passed we'll end up closer to the lower end of the updated range that we provided. As I mentioned at the October analyst meeting, we will continue to review our portfolio including stores and clubs. As in prior years, we may have charges related to closing businesses or stores and clubs. These charges would not be included in our guidance.", "This is my last call as the Chief Financial Officer as I will be retiring effective January 31. I feel fortunate to be a small part of the Wal-Mart story. I've enjoyed working with all of you over the past few years.

This is Pauline Mohler, Senior Director of Global Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Incorporated. Thanks for joining us today to review the results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016. The date of this call is February 18, 2016. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Incorporated and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way.", "This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking information provided by that act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Brett Biggs' remarks later in this call.", "Today, in addition to the earnings release, we announced our annual dividend for fiscal year 2017 and you will hear more about that in today's call. Information regarding today's news is available on the Investors portion of our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. At this site, we also post earnings terminology, which includes our definition of adjusted earnings per share, our global unit counts and a slide presentation that we recommend you should review in conjunction with this call and the earnings press release.", "The slide presentation has been updated to include the FCPA and compliance-related costs which we have typically discussed in the transcript. As a reminder for fiscal 2016, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. For this year, quarter-to-date and year-to-date comps will be based upon 13 and 52-week periods, respectively. Our Q4 reporting period ran from Saturday, October 31, 2015, through Friday, January 29, 2016.", "Now, let's move on to today's call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Incorporated, will provide his thoughts about our results for the quarter and year in the context of our overall strategy. Then, we'll cover the three operating segments, starting with Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International; and then Roz Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club.", "Next, Neil Ashe, President and CEO of Global eCommerce and Technology, is joining us this quarter to share insights regarding our investments in e-commerce. And last, Brett Biggs, Walmart's CFO, will wrap up with context around the financial results, along with guidance for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2017.", "Now, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug?", "C. Douglas McMillon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our fourth quarter earnings, year-end results and progress against our strategy. We had a solid fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.49. It's important to note our numbers reflect some discrete items this quarter, including the impact of store closures and certain tax items. And Brett will share more details in a minute.", "For fiscal year 2016, adjusted EPS was $4.59. And excluding the $17.2 billion impact of currency, we delivered revenue of $499.4 billion, up 2.8%, which is $13.7 billion of growth. We continue to be pleased with the fundamental trends. We're making progress with customers and associates and feel good about where we're heading. We're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening our digital relationships with customers as we work to become the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We'll save our customers not only money but time, and shopping with us will be simple, convenient and fun.", "I also want to call out our continued commitment to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we were able to return $4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In fact, today we announced a dividend increase. Our annual dividend was $1.96 and we've increased it to $2 per share. This is the 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases for Walmart.", "Overall, this past year has been a year of investment, operational improvement and change, even while we delivered solid growth. We do see an underlying strength in our Walmart U.S. business that wasn't there a year ago.", "I want to share a few highlights. As you know, our biggest investments have been in people and technology. On this call one year ago, we announced our investment in higher wages, better training and more department managers to make Walmart U.S. a better place to work and shop. We can only be successful with customers with engaged and empowered associates.", "A few weeks ago, we announced the second part of the wage increase. And it's awesome to give a raise to more than 1 million people on the same day. We also announced a simplified paid time-off policy that will mean no waiting for associates to use their time off. These and other changes in the business are making a difference. Our customer satisfaction scores have risen significantly this year and we now have had six consecutive quarters of positive comps and five straight quarters of positive traffic at Walmart U.S.", "In the technology and e-commerce space, we continued to innovate with a focus on the customer. We have developed a new platform that we can scale across the business. We have improved our fulfillment capabilities with new fulfillment centers that are helping us get orders to customers' doors faster and more efficiently. And we continued to see growth in store pickup for online orders.", "We also expanded online grocery shopping to over 150 locations across more than 20 markets in the U.S. Customers are ordering online and on their phones and then picking up their groceries on our parking lots without ever leaving their cars. Customer satisfaction for those who use our free pickup service is in the high 90s.", "We are learning some interesting things along the way. We've found that 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. is one of the most popular times customers order groceries online, usually once the kids go to bed. We also see a healthy number of orders in the middle of the night. These may be parents comforting or feeding infants and ordering more diapers or formula to pick up the next day. While it's been awhile since my kids were that age, I remember those days well. And I absolutely love that we're able to offer convenience and blend into our customers' lives when they need us most.", "I'm also excited about the introduction of Walmart Pay. And I was very proud of how different parts of our company worked together on it with a relentless focus on the customer experience. I look forward to us rolling it out this coming year. We recently aligned our technology teams because we want more speed and more customer-centric and cost-efficient innovations like this one. We will deliver one Walmart experience to our customers.", "Additionally, we took steps this quarter to sharpen the focus of our portfolio. As part of this continuing portfolio review process, we looked at all of our stores from both a financial and strategic standpoint. One of the key takeaways for me was how strong our portfolio really is, in that we only closed stores representing less than 1% of our global revenue and square footage. I'm pleased, but not surprised, that we have already found open positions for more than half of the impacted associates in the U.S., and we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations.", "So we're doing what we said we'd do, and we're on the right path. Still, we know we have a lot more work to do. And there are areas of the business that are not where they need to be.", "Let's look more closely at each of the segments. Walmart U.S. is on firm ground. We had comp sales of 0.6% on top of last year's 1.5% comp for the fourth quarter. As we lapped positive comps, we accelerated on a two-year stack basis. We also had continued strong performance from Neighborhood Markets.", "In addition to our investments in our associates, we're getting better at the fundamentals of retail and managing the business better. We are reducing comp store inventory and improving our in-stock performance. We also had a sound plan for the holiday season that ensured customers could rely on us for low prices throughout the season, not just at big moments.", "Walmart International again delivered solid financial performance. Nine of our 11 markets delivered positive comps for the quarter, and I'm very encouraged by the results overall. Walmex, in particular, is in a good groove again. And Canada delivered strong performance. Although we face near-term headwinds with the economy in China, our business there is on track. Brazil, however, is proving to be an increasingly challenging economic environment, and the competitive intensity in the UK continues to increase.", "As we review and act on our portfolio, we also announced that we were exploring selling both our clothing chain, called Suburbia, in Mexico and a property company in Chile. Our International business is healthy and growing.", "Global eCommerce sales and Gross Merchandise Value, or GMV, globally grew approximately 8% in the fourth quarter. For the year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. The holiday season gave a good preview of how all the pieces we're putting in place will come together. We saw strong online sales in the U.S. on the big days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, and nearly half of our customers bought their online orders on a mobile device. We also saw growth in store pickup and online grocery.", "We have faced specific challenges in our largest e-commerce markets outside the U.S. Economic softness in Brazil and China continued to weigh on growth and we have been in a transition phase at Yihaodian since acquiring full ownership. As mentioned before, the environment in the UK remains extremely competitive and it's important to remember our e-commerce business in UK is a food delivery and pickup business.", "In the U.S., we plan to build on the foundation we've built by delivering a significant assortment expansion and faster delivery at a lower cost this year. We need more GMV growth from our e-commerce businesses.", "Sam's Club is in the early days with its new strategy. Comps for the quarter were below what we anticipated. And Food, in particular, underperformed outside of the holiday periods. We're pleased with the work so far to address the fundamentals of the business, to improve merchandising and drive new membership, but we have more to do. There are encouraging signs in our membership numbers. As we address issues with the core business, we're excited by growth in new areas. For example, Club Pickup continued to be the fastest-growing part of the business.", "Finally, even as we focus on our customers and our associates, we were reminded a few weeks ago about the opportunity we have to lead in our communities. Walmart, Coca-Cola, Nestl\u00e9, and PepsiCo announced we will collectively donate water to meet the daily needs of over 10,000 school children in Flint, Michigan, for the balance of the calendar year. Whether it's hiring veterans, supporting U.S. manufacturing, or driving new renewable energy production, we have strengths that can help others in important ways. During the first quarter, we will release our annual Global Responsibility Report, alongside our Annual Report, to share more on how we're making a difference. Leading on social and environmental issues is good for our business, for our shareholders and for the world, and we will continue to move the needle this year.", "In summary, we continue to believe we are putting the right foundation in place to better serve customers, deliver stronger sales growth and ultimately strengthen bottom line performance. As we begin this new year, I'm focused on continuing the momentum in our U.S. stores, getting all the ingredients in place for stronger growth in e-commerce and the strategic choices related to how we put them together. I'm also mindful of the need for balance. Improving productivity as we grow is important.", "Brett will talk through our full-year forecast, with the first quarter being the most pressured from an earnings point of view due to the timing of the incremental wage investments. This will be another year where we digest foundational investments, and it's important that we build on what we've started as we go through the year.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Greg.", "Gregory S. Foran - President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S.", "Thank you, Doug. Over the last 12 months, we've laid out our plan to win in the U.S. now and in the future. We are executing against it and have taken several steps towards delivering on our commitment of growing the top line, increasing market share and delivering shareholder value. We've still got a lot of work to do, but I'm pleased that our fourth quarter results demonstrated solid progress against this plan.", "Across the key metrics we track to measure our progress, we're right where we expected to be. Comp sales were positive for the sixth straight quarter and driven by our fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. Our customers are increasingly pleased with the changes in our stores. And they're letting us and others know through improvements in the Net Promoter Score and improved customer experience feedback. In fact, at the end of this fiscal year, more than 75% of stores had met or exceeded their customer experience goals set back at the beginning of the year. This was a significant improvement over the 16% that were meeting this mark at the beginning of the fiscal year.", "Additionally, our associates are more engaged, and turnover is lower. Department managers have been hired in key areas of the stores, and our new training programs are underway. New technology is in our associates' hands, and better processes are creating efficiencies in the stores, driving higher in-stocks and a continuing decline in comp store inventory. As we have discussed, there will be more investments necessary to further deliver on our plan, but we have remained on task and we're seeing progress.", "Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I want to address two announcements we've made recently. First, we announced the second phase of our two-year, $2.7 billion investment in our associates. Just two days from now, on February the 20th, we'll raise the starting wage to at least $10 per hour for hourly associates hired before January 1, 2016.", "Additionally, we're continuing to simplify our business and enhance our benefits package by shifting to a paid time-off policy for all associates. These changes, along with our previous announcements around training programs and store structure, are exciting for all our associates. We are providing our people with a ladder of opportunity to build a career with Walmart and to provide great service to our customers.", "Secondly, in January, we announced the closing of 150 U.S. stores, including all 102 of our Express format locations. Closing stores is never an easy decision, but it's necessary to ensure we are positioned to deliver our long-term plan.", "Strengthening the Supercenter and Neighborhood Market formats, while simultaneously delivering a seamless experience with e-commerce, will require our full attention. In fact, we expect to open more than 135 stores in fiscal 2017 alone. While we know that closing stores affected a number of our associates, I'm proud to say that more than half of these associates have already received offers or have been placed in open roles in nearby stores. And we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations.", "Due to the financial impact of the store closures, our reported results differ significantly from the adjusted results and the underlying business performance. As reported, we incurred $729 million in charges related to these store closures. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude the impact of store closures for purposes of comparability. For reported results including the impact of store closures and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.", "Moving to our fourth quarter results, net sales grew $1.9 billion, or 2.4%, and comp store sales were up 0.6%. We're pleased with the continued growth in customer traffic, which improved 0.7% this quarter on top of last year's 1.4% traffic gain. On a two-year stack basis, our fourth quarter comp sales improved to 2.1%.", "While customers benefited from lower gas prices, we experienced significant headwinds from deflation in meat and dairy products. Additional sales pressure came from warmer than normal temperatures early in the quarter and delays in IRS tax refund checks impacted the very end of the quarter.", "Neil will cover our e-commerce initiatives in more detail in this call, but for this quarter, e-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp.", "Overall, we were pleased with our performance over the six-week holiday season. We made a strategic decision to sensibly pull back on short-term, deep price investments as we looked to simplify the experience for both our customers and associates, and shift back towards a more EDLP focus.", "Investments in e-commerce fulfillment centers allowed us to extend the shipping cut-off date. And customers took full advantage of Pickup, ordering their gifts online and conveniently picking them up alongside their grocery trips. As we approached the end of the season, customers transitioned from online to in-store, and we delivered, driving strong performance across the box as customers stocked up on last-minute gifts and food for their holiday meals.", "The Supercenter format delivered its sixth straight positive comp in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our traditional-format Neighborhood Markets continued their strong performance, delivering a 7% comp. We're seeing steady progress in our efforts to improve each of these formats, with a focus on fresh offerings, clean stores, fast check-outs, friendly associates and better in-stocks.", "We're pleased with our progress in Grocery, which saw a positive comp this quarter, led by improvement in Consumables. As I mentioned earlier, we experienced substantial deflation in both meat and dairy, which resulted in slight deflation across all of Food. We estimate this deflation negatively impacted our segment comp by approximately 100 basis points, relative to last year's comp. Our Grocery business delivered positive comp traffic growth, even while lapping positive comp traffic from last year.", "We continue to push forward with our Win in Fresh initiatives, including testing new layouts, reducing inventory while improving in-stocks in both Food and Consumables, and exceeding expectations in our urgent agenda items such as reducing waste and throwaways. We still have work to do in our Fresh area, and many things we want to accomplish in the upcoming year, but we remain on track.", "In our General Merchandise areas, Apparel improved throughout the quarter, after a slow start due to warmer-than-usual temperatures. On-trend assortments, particularly in active wear, drove results in this area. In Entertainment, we continued to experience soft wireless sales and a slower adoption of new technology in televisions.", "We're continuing to make progress in this space by focusing on our operating model, including service to our customers, assortment and department layout, but it will take time to get it right. Across the rest of the General Merchandise and Home categories, solid performance came from better in-stocks, assortment updates and new products.", "Finally, Health & Wellness remained a positive comp driver for us, with growth coming from branded drug inflation and better in-stocks in OTC. However, a slower flu season created a headwind to our Cold, Cough and Flu business this quarter.", "Moving to the remainder of our financials, gross margin was up 69 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in Food, General Merchandise and Consumables. This was somewhat offset by declines in Health & Wellness, although we're still focused on providing better visibility and tools to help combat ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressures.", "Transportation costs were helped by lower fuel rates. Additionally, our intentional pullback on deep price investments during the holiday season meaningfully improved margins in Entertainment. Lastly, we made additional progress on our urgent agent items, focused on reducing costs both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise, and remained diligent on improving processes related to shrink.", "As expected, expenses increased 129 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by our investments in associates and stores, including transitioning to a new paid time-off policy, along with building out our e-commerce capabilities. However, we did a better job of aligning store labor hours with customer traffic by leveraging efficiencies gained from new processes and technology. The increase in expenses was partially offset by the improvements in gross margin, which resulted in an operating income decline of 5.3%.", "We continued to make progress in managing inventory. Overall inventory grew 0.9%, or approximately 25% the rate of total sales growth. Comp store inventory declined 2.9%, as we remained focused on cleaning out our back rooms and using processes such as CAP and top-stock to ensure better in-stocks for our customers. Inventory will remain a key focus area for us in this new fiscal year.", "Fiscal 2016 has been a year of redefinition, redefining our goals, redefining our focus and redefining our future. We've been intentional in our design and in our actions, and these actions have resulted in steady progress.", "To recap our performance for the year, net sales increased by $10.3 billion, or 3.6%. Comp store sales grew 1.2%, driven by a 1.2% growth in comp traffic. E-commerce contributed approximately 25 basis points to our comp performance. Gross margin improved 14 basis points for the year, helped by our ongoing focus on urgent agenda items and lower transportation costs, partially offset by headwinds from shrink and pharmacy reimbursement pressures. However, the investments in our associates, stores and e-commerce drove expenses up 8.3% versus last year, which resulted in an operating income decline of 7.1%.", "We opened 69 Supercenters this year, including relocations and conversions, and 146 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets. In FY 2017, we expect to open 50 to 60 Supercenters, including relocations and conversions. We'll also open 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets.", "Additionally, we plan to further expand our online grocery program to more markets this year. As we have discussed in the past, we are committed to growth, but we'll do it sensibly, with the customer in mind as we select the right locations, products and service offerings for each store.", "We know the decisions we've made this year to improve our business pressured the bottom line, but we're confident they were in the best interest of our customers, our associates and our shareholders. We believe in our long-term plan. And we remain on track to achieve these goals.", "In the new fiscal year, we're continuing to march down the path we've laid out. Our initiatives across the box are gaining steam. And we'll look forward to drive improvements in assortment and pricing, while focusing on building a seamless shopping experience across all channels.", "We've just held our annual Year Beginning Meeting in Indianapolis, with nearly 7,000 of our operations and merchandising associates. I told the team that I was proud of their hard work and progress last year, and this year, we would build upon that as we work to execute with excellence. In fact, we have raised the bar higher with new annual goals in our stores to drive an even cleaner, faster and friendlier customer experience as the year goes on.", "We expect these efforts, along with the ongoing investments in our stores and our associates, to drive continued growth in the top line. Lower fuel prices will also provide some tailwinds. However, food deflation, which has accelerated in the last six weeks, will remain a challenge.", "Given these factors, for the 13-week period ended April 29, 2016, we expected a comp sales increase of around 50 basis points. Last year's 13-week comp ended May 1, 2015, increased 1.1%. As a reminder, the investments in our associates will be an expense headwind this year, most significantly in the first quarter, as we implement phase two of these investments prior to lapping last year's phase one implementation, which started in April. However, we will continue to focus on lowering costs through better buying and operating a better business.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?", "David Cheesewright - President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart International, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.", "Thanks, Greg. I'm pleased with our progress this quarter in a challenging global economy. We're delivering our strategy, seeing comp sales improve, and bringing in profit ahead of our expectations. Whilst our performance was driven by Walmex and Canada, our results reflect broad achievement. Nine of our 11 markets had positive comps this quarter and seven of our markets have now maintained positive comps for at least seven quarters in a row. We continue to see headwinds in the UK, China and Brazil, which I'll discuss more in a moment.", "We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, which are to: actively manage the existing portfolio; deliver balanced growth; be the lowest cost operator; and build strong foundations in talent, trust and technology.", "In terms of the portfolio, we announced the closure of 115 small, underperforming stores in Brazil and other Latin American markets. Whilst these are difficult decisions for our markets and associates, it better positions us for growth in the right formats and geographies.", "Recently, we also announced that we're pursuing the sale of our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico and we're in the process of selling our shopping centers in Chile. These are successful businesses, but aren't a core part of our portfolio strategy. These changes would help drive greater simplicity to our operations and an increased focus on our strategic priorities.", "For balanced growth, I'm pleased with our comp trends and look forward to opening between 200 and 240 stores this year across our portfolio, while at the same time expanding our reach in e-commerce. Our lowest cost operator initiative is focused on two key areas, cost of goods sold and overhead reductions. On cost of goods sold, we started a cost analytics program that provides improved tools and cost visibility to our merchants, which enables them to lead fact-based negotiations with suppliers. We're pleased with early results from this program in Canada and the UK and will expand the program to additional markets later this year.", "Now, let's discuss our overall results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than last quarter. Reported net sales declined 9.7%, impacted by a $4.7 billion currency headwind from continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As mentioned, we had a strong quarter for comp sales. In our five largest markets, Mexico, Canada and Brazil reported positive comps, while the UK and China reported negative comps. All other markets had solid positive comp sales.", "Operating income declined 7.8% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by $215 million in charges, $153 million on a reported basis, related to previously-announced store closures. Excluding this and certain other charges this year, such as restructuring costs, as well as last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. On a reported basis, operating income declined 19%.", "On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than net sales at 4.2%. This increase was driven primarily by China, where inventory increased in preparation for Chinese New Year. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10.2%. For the full year, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis, with improved comp sales on top of 3.6% growth last year. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a significant impact of $17.1 billion on our reported results, by far the largest one year impact in our history, resulting in a net sales decline of 9.4% on a reported basis. Full year operating income declined 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by store closures this quarter. Excluding this and last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. On a reported basis, operating income declined 13.4%.", "Now, let's discuss fourth quarter results for our largest markets, presented on a constant currency basis. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce.", "Let's start with Mexico, which was the biggest driver of this quarter's results. Walmex released its earnings on February 16 under IFRS, while results here are under U.S. GAAP, so some numbers may differ. Walmex net sales increased 9.3%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico net sales grew 9.7% and comp sales increased 8.6%, driven by increased customer spending and solid execution from our stores. Self-service was particularly strong, with comp sales of 8.8%, while the rest of the market, according to ANTAD, grew only 4.9%.", "Sam's Club also had its best performance of the year, delivering comp sales of 7%, driven by strong sales from Advantage, or non-business, members. Operating income declined versus last year, driven by a planned reduction in our gross profit rate.", "Let's next discuss Canada, which had another strong sales quarter. Net sales grew 5.8%, benefiting by strong customer traffic as a result of our improved Fresh offer, continued price investments and improvement in operational standards. Comp sales were 4.3%, our seventh consecutive quarter in positive territory. I'm especially pleased with our sales in Canada, given the economic pressures in the oil-producing provinces.", "We had positive market share gains in Food, Consumables and Health & Wellness, for the 12 weeks ended January 23, according to Nielsen. Our online sales continue to grow and perform well. Operating income was down versus last year, due to certain land impairments and pre-opening expenses for 13 previously-announced stores acquired from a former competitor. Excluding these impacts, operating income would've been positive.", "Let's talk now about the UK, which continues to face challenging market conditions. Grocery market sales fell 0.2% in the 12 weeks ended January 3, according to Kantar. This was driven by price deflation of 1.8% as a result of intense competition, and was the 17th consecutive period with deflation. The big four grocers remained under pressure as discounters continue to grow and gain share.", "In the UK, we're striking a balance between investment in the customer offer, profit and cash flow. Overall, net sales declined 4.4%, and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.5%, driven by declines in our large store format and in our Food business, partially offset by continued growth in online grocery. We decided not to participate in Black Friday discounting, which impacted our comp sales, but helped profitability and allowed greater focus on operational standards and the customer offer in the core Food business. We delivered strong cash performance as a result of disciplined management of CapEx and working capital.", "Asda is focused on repositioning its business through Project Renewal, which will simplify operations, lead to substantial reduction in costs and allow for significant investments in customer value. As part of this project, we're deploying a new cost analytics program to aid with buying. We're also joining EMD, a European buying alliance, and we recently completed the purchase of two meat processing businesses. These actions will help increase buying efficiencies and remove costs from the supply chain, particularly for private label products.", "The UK has also completed a restructuring of its home office aimed at increasing focus and improving operational agility. In addition, the UK will invest an additional \u00a3500 million in price during the period of its five-year strategy, on top of the \u00a31 billion previously committed. We're taking aggressive actions and we're focused on repositioning our offering to meet the changing needs of our customers.", "In China, despite ongoing economic challenges and slower GDP growth, we continue to gain share for the 12th consecutive quarter in the hypermarket channel, according to Nielsen. Net sales grew 0.3%, driven by new store openings and improved performance from completed remodels. Comp sales fell 3%, in part, due to warmer weather and disappointing sales in winter seasonal categories.", "We continue to make progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China. We're benefiting from our earlier actions to centralize our buying offices and build out our supply chain. We've improved our gross margin rate and have realized benefits from productivity initiatives, while investing in labor and customer experience. We can see momentum building as performance in Fresh has improved in recent quarters in both sales and margin. Operating income continues to grow faster than sales.", "The team in China is focused on delivering a trusted shopping experience through both physical and digital channels. We're starting to see the benefits from tighter collaboration with Yihaodian. In Shenzhen and Guangzhou, Walmart now leverages Yihaodian's last mile network for online orders, which has led to greater delivery capacity. Overall, we're excited about the actions we're taking in China that are setting us up for long-term growth.", "In Brazil, we continue to face political and economic instability. The deterioration in the macro environment, combined with persistent high inflation, continues to put a strain on customers. Net sales grew 1.2% and comps grew 0.8%, in a retail market that contracted by 5.7%, according to Serasa Experian. We were encouraged by another quarter of double digit growth in our wholesale business, mostly offset by continued softness in the hypermarket format.", "Operating income was down versus last year, driven by the cost to close the 60 stores announced earlier. Excluding store closure costs, operating income would have been relatively flat to last year.", "We're seeing positive results from some of our transformation initiatives, such as repositioning the customer proposition in our wholesale business, but there's still work to be done. Brazil's focus for the year ahead will be to finalize store closures, revise and reposition the customer proposition for our hypermarket format, and complete the integration of systems and processes in our stores. We are committed to turnaround efforts in this important market.", "As I wrap up, I'd like to recognize the efforts of our dedicated international associates operating in 28 countries around the globe that helped us achieve consistently good results throughout the year. I'm confident in the management teams we have leading our markets and the strategic priorities we have in place to drive further growth in the year ahead.", "Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?", "Rosalind Gates Brewer - President & Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.", "Thanks, Dave. I'll start today's call with details around our fourth quarter performance. I will also provide an update on how we have begun to execute against the strategy that I detailed during our third quarter earnings call.", "At Sam's Club, we remain laser-focused on our members. Through investments we've made and will continue to make in people and technology, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across our app, our site and our clubs.", "Let's begin by talking about our fourth quarter results. It's important to note that our reported results were negatively impacted by certain charges totaling approximately $77 million. This amount includes a charge of approximately $57 million resulting from our decision to close underperforming clubs. The remainder of the charges includes a policy change related to paid time-off as well as severance and other costs associated with recently-announced organizational enhancements. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.", "Comp sales for the fourth quarter were below our expectations. Severe winter storms significantly disrupted approximately 200 clubs toward the end of the quarter, which resulted in a negative impact to the comp of approximately 30 basis points. That said, we know that our core comp performance can improve, and it will. The work we have underway, which I'll talk about in just a bit, is designed, in part, to improve the fundamentals of our business, specifically membership and merchandising.", "Broadly speaking, trends that we saw throughout the year were again prevalent during the quarter. Among the most notable items were: softness in Food, primarily as a result of a minimal level of inflation or, in some instances, deflation in key categories; an impact to Grocery as we began to evolve the assortment; and challenges in the Technology and Entertainment area from a deliberate transition in space reallocation along with pressures in wireless. Yet, we know that where we have seen innovation in the assortment and in service offerings, we have seen success. I'll talk more about our merchandise categories in a moment.", "Net sales decreased 0.1%, as comp sales declined 0.5%. Slide 10 of the financial presentation provides the components of our comp sales. We were pleased with the performance of our Savings members, as positive momentum in traffic continued, but softness from our Business members negatively impacted our results.", "Gross profit rate decreased four basis points from last year. We continue to invest in membership value through price and our Cash Rewards program. Operating expenses deleveraged during the quarter. As expected, investments in people and technology pressured our expenses. Additionally, charges for the items I mentioned earlier impacted Q4. Excluding these items, operating expense as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat compared with last year.", "Membership income increased 5.6% during Q4. Plus renewals increased 35% over last year. And we continued to see a favorable trend of renewal rates for Plus members. The value of a Sam's Club membership is clear. Our targeted marketing programs resulted in new membership acquisitions that accelerated each of the last three quarters versus last year.", "Let's turn now to our merchandising categories. I'll provide details on areas that were materially impactful to the quarter. Please see Slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories.", "In Fresh/Freezer/Cooler, deflationary trends continued, particularly in fresh meat and dairy. We saw positive results in produce, yet headwinds from the remainder of the category proved too much to overcome. Dry Grocery and areas of Fresh experienced pressures from deflation. As we continue to expand our private brand, generate more newness and reallocate space, these areas are gaining member acceptance, but take careful handling and coordination.", "Technology, Entertainment, Office had some bright spots with new items in TVs and wearables, both of which perform well online and in clubs. Wireless installment plans continue to place pressure on the category.", "When we innovate, we see good results. In Health & Wellness and Consumables, our Free/4/10 (46:47) Plus benefit program in Pharmacy is helping to lift the total category. Services are important to our members, and they reward us when we deliver in this space. The technology services company, IMS Health, measures our market share of the five free scripts in the program. According to IMS, we grew share by 11 basis points for the three months ended December 31, 2015, and our share is nearly 25 basis points higher than it was prior to the launch of the program. Free/4/10 (47:20) was also a strong contributor to membership upgrades to Plus since the beginning of the fiscal year.", "Moving on to e-commerce, this year, we made the decision to push many of our holiday events online, and we were pleased with response from our members. Our Holiday Savings Celebration on November 14 drove good results, and we were pleased with other events, including Cyber Monday. During the quarter, traffic to our site increased by 7% versus the prior year, and the conversion improved by 18%.", "We continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in our pure e-commerce and mobile commerce capabilities. We're also excited about the integration of our digital and physical offerings. During Q4, Club Pickup increased 46% over last year, and it now represents the fastest-growing piece of our business. Members want to shop with Sam's Club how and where they choose, and we are building the infrastructure across multiple channels to deliver that experience.", "On our call from Q3, I talked about a new strategy. During Q4, we began to execute against that strategy in important ways, including: additional organizational enhancements that will better align talent with critical needs; portfolio management through the closure of underperforming clubs; an extensive review of merchandise categories; and the expansion of private label brands in key areas. These are only a few examples, and we have many other work streams underway. The totality of these efforts will address the fundamentals of our business, including membership and merchandising, as well as deliver new services and offerings.", "As I think about guidance for the first quarter, I'm reminded that, although we have accomplished a great deal over the previous months, it remains early days in our transformation. As a result, comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2016, are expected to be around flat.", "Let me close today with a few thoughts. First, the new alignment of our organization will position the business to better serve our members. It was a significant step in our transformation, and we will begin to see the benefits in the coming quarter. Secondly, our new Chief Merchandising Officer has conducted a comprehensive review of our merchandise based on identified markets and what he has gleaned from our strategy work. We are excited about his early insights at this stage.", "I'm confident we're taking the business in the right direction now and for the future. Through a disciplined, refined approach to growth, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across app, site and club.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Neil. Neil?", "Neil M. Ashe - President & Chief Executive Officer, Global eCommerce and Technology", "Thanks, Roz. I want to pick up on Doug's comments about our opportunity to be the first to offer a seamless shopping experience at a scale that only Walmart can deliver. E-commerce at Walmart is about bringing together all of the pieces to help customers buy the items they want at Walmart prices, however and wherever they want. Our customers look at us as one Walmart, one easy experience across our app, site and store or club.", "In a short span, we've built an e-commerce technology company inside of Walmart. We have rolled out a new technology platform and we have dramatically increased our physical distribution network. And, in just the past six months, we've grown to serve over 20 markets with online grocery. During the fourth quarter, we started to get a glimpse into how these capabilities we put into place are starting to come together to deliver the seamless customer experience.", "Looking forward, we're focused on three big opportunities: continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers; scaling our online assortment; and expanding online grocery. For the quarter, Global eCommerce sales and GMV both grew at 8%. For the full year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. As we discussed in October, growth continues to be pressured by weakness in Brazil, China and the UK, due to macroeconomic and competitive challenges.", "In China, we have rebuilt the Yihaodian leadership team since taking full ownership, and they continue to build on the strengths of their mobile engagement with customers and increasing business through imported products. There is work to do there, but we are taking actions to improve the business and accelerate growth in one of our key markets. In Brazil, the team has been working to balance growth and profitability during an economically challenging period that we expect to continue throughout the fiscal year.", "In the U.S., we continue to grow the business and created a more seamless experience for our customers across our app, our site and our store. Looking more closely at holiday in the U.S., Walmart.com saw strong sales on the big days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. What was most exciting was how our new capabilities started to deliver seamless shopping for customers. As customers shopped on Walmart.com, our new platform was powering the front and back-end shopping experience for the first time during holiday. Despite the complexity of a complete platform rebuild, Pangaea handled the intense holiday volume.", "Customers could order gifts even closer to Christmas this year and they saw our best on-time delivery rates ever, thanks to our new fulfillment centers. While the FCs opened just a few months before holiday, they lived up to our targets for efficiency and productivity. They showed that they can scale with our business and combine with our stores, DCs and transportation network to deliver speed, efficiency and better experiences for customers.", "Customers could also get their online orders the same day in stores, and we saw nearly a 40% jump in store pickup during holidays. We were also able to blend our online and stores to serve customers how and where they were shopping. One great example was on the morning of Black Friday, when we saw a smart TV sell out online within 20 minutes. We had another TV from that supplier available in stores, so we dialed up the promotion on Walmart.com and made it available for store pickup. The item quickly sold out in stores. To customers, it was a seamless access to a gift they wanted. It was a great example of the power of combining online with stores in close proximity to customers.", "Customers were also using our app to shop seamlessly across online and stores. We offered early access to the Black Friday circular on the mobile app for the first time, and the app jumped to the number one spot in the Apple App Store that day. Customers also showed that they are now comfortable buying on their phone. This year, more than half of online sales were on a mobile device on Thanksgiving, which was double last year. We saw significant growth in mobile sales for the rest of the peak holiday period. With our app, customers were also able to create wish lists, check-in for store pickup and pick up item locations in stores.", "We continued to build on that app experience in the quarter with another powerful tool, Walmart Pay. We started testing it in a small group of stores and the initial feedback from customers reinforced that the experience was simple and easy. Walmart Pay is the perfect example of how our app gives customers a seamless experience that merges digital and physical to make shopping faster and easier, and it gives customers a reason to form a digital relationship with Walmart. It was also a great example of how our teams aligned to deliver these experiences in just a few months.", "At Samsclub.com, we started the holidays with a big kickoff event on November 14, which delivered a triple digit comp for the day. We also saw strong comps and record sales on the biggest days of the holiday season. Club Pickup continues to be a delighter for members, and we saw it hit an all-time high in December. We saw strong growth in both desktop and mobile conversion, and mobile purchases nearly tripled over last year. Samsclub.com has also continued to drive growth in digital member sign-ups.", "As we look at critical touch points that meld our app, site and store, we obviously think about online grocery. In October, we announced we were expanding from five markets to over 20. We've rolled out to those additional markets and we're continuing to see the strong emotional response it triggers with customers and the very personal relationship they're forming with Walmart. Customers are literally jumping out of their cars to rave about it. And one of my recent favorites was a mom with two kids in the back of her car. She told us about how much easier it has made her life because she can shop where and when it's convenient and then drive up and just get her groceries. She placed her order while she was relaxing and watching her kids play. Customers are inviting us into the fabric of their lives. In just a few months, we've dramatically increased online grocery, and look for us to continue expanding this year.", "Behind all the capabilities we're delivering are some of the best technologists in the world. We've built an e-commerce technology company inside of Walmart. We've always had one of the strongest enterprise technology organizations. Those teams have worked closely to deliver experiences like online grocery and Walmart Pay that seamlessly merge the app, site and store. Last month, we announced that we are bringing together those teams under a single Walmart Technology banner. This aligns all of our technologists with how our customers see us, one Walmart.", "I'm excited about the building blocks we've put in place for the future and the ways we're starting to serve customers seamlessly across our app, site and store. We've replatformed our technology and physical distribution, while continuing to grow our business, and we've quickly grown online grocery. This year, we'll focus on three areas: continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers; scaling our online assortment; and expanding online grocery. All these will combine to offer customers compelling experiences that let them shop seamlessly with Walmart in ways that help them save money and save time. As we deliver that seamless experience across our app, site and store, we're building deeper relationships with customers. This relationship is key to building value for the enterprise.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Brett. Brett?", "Brett M. Biggs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today by providing some thoughts on the company's performance in fiscal year 2016, as well as our expectations for fiscal year 2017. Before we jump into guidance, I want to highlight a few items from the quarter and the year.", "Overall, we are pleased with the way we ended fiscal year 2016. In the fourth quarter, Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 0.6%, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and the fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. For the year, Walmart International delivered another solid financial performance, with very strong results in Canada and at Walmex. We generated full year constant currency revenue growth of nearly $14 billion, or 2.8%. Currency impacted our full year revenue by over $17 billion.", "We continue to innovate and make progress toward a seamless shopping experience through a number of initiatives, including an increased number of online grocery markets. While we would've liked to have seen higher e-commerce sales growth this quarter, we continue to make good foundational progress for the future. For the year, we generated approximately $27 billion in operating cash flow, which speaks to our continued financial strength as we transform the company. I'm particularly pleased with our inventory performance in Walmart U.S.", "During the year, we returned over $10 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We are able to deliver consistent returns to shareholders while investing for the future. ROI decreased to 15.5%, primarily due to lower operating income as well as continued capital investments. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.96 per share to $2 per share in fiscal 2017. We've now increased our dividend for 43 consecutive years.", "Now, I'd like to spend some time specifically on our EPS results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016. Fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS were $1.49 and $4.59, respectively. Our reported EPS for the same periods were $1.43 and $4.57, respectively. Let me briefly discuss the discrete items that were factored into our adjusted EPS.", "Recall, in January, we announced the closure of 269 stores globally. Charges for these store closures, which impact both the fourth quarter and full year earnings, resulted in a negative impact of $0.20 per share. Also, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year benefited from the December passage by Congress of the tax extenders legislation, which we considered in our fourth quarter guidance. However, the fourth quarter and full year effective tax rate also benefited by $0.14 per share related to other discrete tax items in the quarter. Finally, our full year adjusted EPS also excludes the effects of a benefit of approximately $0.04 from an adjustment for certain leases we disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.", "Now, let's shift gears and discuss fiscal year 2017 guidance. We remain confident that the investments we are making in our associates, our stores and our digital capabilities are the right ones and are better preparing Walmart for the future. It's also important to note that, although we continue to invest in these important areas for the future, we will remain focused on managing expenses across the company. Our guidance today includes several important assumptions, including that the economic conditions in our largest markets remain generally consistent and that the currency exchange rates remain at current levels.", "From a capital standpoint, as we indicated at our October Investor Meeting, we expect capital investments to be approximately $11 billion in fiscal year 2017, down from fiscal year 2016.", "Currency remains a headwind for our business, as it is from many U.S. multinational companies. Today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $12 billion on net sales for fiscal year 2017. Additionally, currency is expected to impact EPS by approximately $0.10 per share this year, including approximately $0.03 in the first quarter.", "Now, let's turn to full year sales growth guidance. In October, we guided that on a constant currency basis, net sales would grow 3% to 4% annually over the next three years. Excluding the impact of the recently-announced store closures and the continuing impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our fiscal 2017 sales growth guidance would have remained in that same range. However, including store closures and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, we now expect net sales growth to be relatively flat in fiscal year 2017.", "As for taxes, our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2017 estimated tax rate ranging between 31.5% and 33.5%. As is the norm, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range.", "I also want to note that historically, the tax extenders legislation has been approved at the end of each year, impacting the fourth quarter tax rate. In the December legislation, many of the relevant tax provisions were either made permanent or passed through 2019. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2017, the benefits of the extenders will be spread across the full year, rather than all being in the fourth quarter. Other discrete items as described above may still cause the effective tax rate to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.", "Taking into account the previously-mentioned assumptions, including currency rates at today's levels, tax rate and the incremental wage investments of $1.5 billion, we expect full year fiscal 2017 EPS to range between $4 and $4.30. This most closely compares to our adjusted earnings per share of $4.59 in fiscal year 2016 and is broadly in line with our guidance from October for our earnings per share to be down 6% to 12% in fiscal year 2017.", "With respect to the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to range between $0.80 and $0.95. This compares to the $1.03 we reported last year. When comparing to last year's EPS, it's important to note that the first quarter this year will be impacted somewhat more on a year-over-year basis than subsequent quarters due to the timing of wage investments.", "In closing, I'm honored to serve as the Chief Financial Officer during this very exciting time at Walmart. All of us at Walmart are pleased with the progress we're making and the work of our great associates around the world.

(NYSE:WMT) Raymond James 37th Annual Institutional Investors Conference March  8, 2016  1:05 PM ET", "Executives", "Brett Biggs - Chief Financial Officer", "Steve Bratspies - Chief Merchandising Officer", "Analysts", "Budd Bugatch - Raymond James", "Operator", "Good afternoon, I\u2019m Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. It\u2019s my privilege and pleasure to welcome you this afternoon to the Wal-Mart presentation at our 37th Annual Investor Institutional Investors Conference. I trust everybody had a good lunch. With us today from Wal-Mart we are very pleased to have Brett Biggs, Chief Financial Officer of the Company. And giving the presentation today, we have Steve Bratspies, who was recently named the Chief Merchandising Officer of the Company. Without any further ado, Steve, floor is yours.", "Steve Bratspies", "Thanks, Budd. Good afternoon everybody. As Budd mentioned, I have been Chief Merchandising Officer just a short period of time, almost five months now in the company, but I\u2019ve been with Wal-Mart for about a decade. So I\u2019ve done a lot of different things to the company, marketing and merchandising and now have the honor to lead a great merchandising team at Wal-Mart U.S. I am very proud of.", "We got a great, strong leadership team really good plan that we are very focused on delivering and while I am going to spend a little bit of time with you today is to see a top line of what that plan is on what we are focused on, but more importantly how we are going to merchandise. I\u2019m going to dive down and talk to you about what I\u2019m focused on, what my team is focused on to help deliver the U.S. plan.", "Start, I always have to put the forward-looking statements, disclaimer up you guys all know this, it better than I do, but I thought put it up there just so I\u2019ll cover it. Any questions you can see it at our website as we go forward.", "So let me talk to you about growth. And I want to start by taking a quick step back, quick look back at the release that we just made. We just made our Q4 release couple of weeks ago, and comp sales for the U.S. were positive for the sixth consecutive quarter at 60 basis points driven by the fifth consecutive quarter of positive traffic growth in the stores.", "Neighborhood markets delivered nearly 7 comps during that time. And as you know we\u2019ve been investing heavily in our business, heavily in our people, in the talent and technology and its\u2019 really starting to pay off for us as we could see improving customer experience scores across the U.S. business.", "Globally, commerce sales were at 8% for the fourth quarter and 12% for the year last year on a constant currency basis. We expanded our online grocery business to 22 markets and we\u2019ll do about another 20 markets this year as we continue to invest in that business and continue to find the intersection of physical and digital. We are getting great responses from our customer on this for satisfaction scores already in the mid-90s. So we feel good about where we are going on that.", "So, lots of progress that we feel good about, but we know we got a lot of work to do, and we are very focused on delivering in the future for our customers and for our shareholders. And for us to do that it really all begins with our customer. I am going to spend a little bit of time talking about the customer today, a little bit of a deeper dive understanding at some of the things that we are learning as we go forward.", "The customer today is changing dramatically. Who they are, what they want, how they shop, where they shop, when they shop, lots of different changes that are going on all at one time. 79 million of them are millennials, and what\u2019s great is they are moving into prime spending years, right. They started a little slower in household formation, they are moving faster and are in that time right now.", "48% of them are multi cultural, versus 285 from the boomers, which is a dramatic shift and dramatic change in the business. They are the most value driven generation that was seen in my life time, slightly ahead of Gen X but they are very, very focused to value to lines for Wal-Mart. And they also had a strong infinity for Wal-Mart than any of the generations.", "66% of millennials have shopped at Wal-Mart store in the past month. And they are more likely than the total population to shop Wal-Mart store. So it\u2019s a very important customer to us, the one that aligns very well with our business. Busy customers that demand a new level of convenience, new expectations, really what they want is, they want to see more shopping experience. They want to shop Wal-Mart, they don\u2019t care if it\u2019s online, they don\u2019t care if it\u2019s mobile, they don\u2019t care if it\u2019s in the store, they want it to be a seamless shopping experience for them and that\u2019s what we are working on delivering.", "We are seeing some good results. We continue to capture more than our fair share of millennial customer spending with especially those millennials that have kids already. We increased our market share with millennial mass by 450 basis points over the last few years and a lot of people ask why are we doing that, what\u2019s working.", "Fundamentally it\u2019s because we have the products that they want. They like our grocery, they like our babies assortment which is obviously very important for them at the stage or life that they are in right now. Convenient locations, they definitely subscribe to the one stop shopping, again you are talking young families, household formations, one stop shopping is a huge convenience to them and ultimately our low price model and budget approach to shopping works very well for them, is very value conscious.", "Our best shoppers are the ones who shop with us not only in stores, but they shop online. And if you think about that intersection of physical and digital, we talk a lot about as a company, plays out in how customer spend. They spend more; they shop more frequently when they shop all channels, so just some numbers for you.", "Wal-Mart store only customer spends on average about $1,400 a year. An online customer only spend a couple of hundred dollars. The customer who shops both, online and in the store spend about $2,500 with us on average in a year. So that customer is in the middle of the intersection of those two circles is incredibly valuable for us and as they continue to build that behavior we are going to continue to take advantage of it.", "So let me take a minute and give you high level Wal-Mart in U.S. strategy and this is nothing new. You heard this from us before, Greg Foran, my boss has talked about this, but I thought I would set the context quickly for what we are trying to do. And ultimately that\u2019s delivered a seamless shopping experience of the scale. We think we are well positioned to do that in a way that no one else has been able to do that so far.", "And there is four key planks to enable us to do that. Number one, winning new stores and it\u2019s all about what we are doing to provide an excellent experience for our customers who are there. We made a lot of investments in that area and people and the technology but make our stores fundamentally run better.", "The second is delivering value. Low price has always been our key differentiator in the market and we are going to continue as we invest to grow, we are going to continue to invest in pricing. We are not going to comprise on any quality or any products as we do that, so pricing quality investments are going to be very important to us going forward.", "The third one which is near and dear to my heart being great merchants. We\u2019ve got to run great stores and we\u2019ve got to have great product in that stores. And as merchants we have to think through how the product flows into the store, how it flows through the shelf, all the way up to the register, making that as seamless as possible for our stores so they can operate better. It\u2019s about great product, executing great programs in our stores, seasonal programs and bringing to life great brands.", "And finally, it\u2019s about providing convenience. We really believe that we are uniquely positioned with the footprint that we have on a physical basis to add the digital to that and provide a few more shopping experience for merchandise across all channels as we go forward.", "So that\u2019s the U.S. strategy, let me talk to you about merchandising. Let me talk to you about what I am focused on, what my team is focused on every single day to make our business better. And it\u2019s three things. Its\u2019 customer advocacy, it\u2019s continuing to improve our cost position and its service to our stores. Let me touch on each one of this in a minute.", "Customer advocacy, it\u2019s pretty self explanatory, but it really just needs to be obsessed with customers. It\u2019s putting the customer at the centre of every single thing that we do, and creating experience with them that\u2019s valuable, fun, exciting and basically worth their time, that\u2019s what we have to do. We have to keep focusing on them all the time.", "Our cost position, this company is built on a promise in a purpose to save money, live better, it always has been and it always will be. It\u2019s what we are known for and it\u2019s what we stand for and we are going to consistently guard that position in the market place and make investments overtime to make sure that we provide the absolute best value for our customers and to do that we have to run a strong EDLC model. We have to continue to take costs out of our business to be able to invest in price as we go forward.", "And finally, service to our stores. If you are a merchant at Wal-Mart, you serve two bosses. You serve the customer number one, and number two you serve the stores. And your job is to help the stores run more efficient, how do they improve their efficiencies once again so we can take cost out so we can continue to invest in our business. We have a lot of aggressive plans around, order fill rates, greater efficiency at the shelf; improve speed, and creating a lot more customized programs at the local level to drive our business.", "What I want to talk to you mostly today is about the first one, which is customer advocacy. And what do we do to drive royalty, to create a better customer experience and ultimately to earn the trust of our customers so that they can see to come back time and time again.", "So the first piece of customer advocacy is where we need to start is with our fresh business. Why do we start with Fresh? Because we walked into Wal-Mart so what\u2019s the first thing you see? You see Fresh. It sets the tone for the experience of your entire shopping trip with Wal-Mart. It\u2019s a huge priority for us, because it\u2019s a big traffic driver and it\u2019s very important to our customers. And we know when we get fresh right, the entire box benefits from that business as we go forward and we\u2019ve got really comprehensive plans, we called all the way from farm to fork. So what do I mean by that?", "We are looking at how source product, where we source it from globally, how we change seasons more effectively, all the way to fork. It\u2019s not just about having fresh products in our store; it needs to be fresh when you take it home. When you experience it, two, three days later out of your refrigerator, it needs to still be fresh product, how do we extend that overtime. And that\u2019s ultimately our focus.", "People often ask so what\u2019s different, when am I going to see your stores. When you go into our stores this year, I think you are going to see a couple of things. One, you are going to see better assortment, improved quality, better presentation of products. The wet wall in our produce area is different, it\u2019s been flipped, we are going to lead off with fresh both vegetables, the set of fresher tone right on atonality, and we\u2019ve expanded space for cut through which is a huge growth business for us. We\u2019ve changed our assortment mix between bag and both [ph] products all to make sure the assortment is better for the customer.", "The shopping experience is going to be different. We are rolling out a project that we call Fresh Angle rollout. And what is as we walk into a frozen department, we are reorienting all the fixturing in there and lowering the profiles. So you are going to be able to come here, you are going to have more space, you are going to have more sideline, able to see the wet walls, see the valley, easier to shop, it\u2019s going to change dramatically the looking field of our produce department. We have it in a 180 stores right now; it will be in about 3,300 by the end of the year, so a pretty big rollout for us.", "And also, much better in store execution. We\u2019ve made a lot of investment in wages as you all know about and the department managers back we are also adding in we called Fresh Operations Manager at the market level to have an expert in every single market to teach, train and build capabilities in the stores on an ongoing basis.", "And ultimately as I talked about earlier, better freshness. Freshness is the key at how you actually judge the product. We\u2019ve taken a full day at inventory out of our supply chain over the last few years to make sure that we continue to provide that fresher experience.", "So we\u2019re optimistic about our growth in this area and we are always seeing some great results. 52-week produce market share up 44 basis points, organic market share up 80 basis points in the last 52 weeks. So, the customer is responding to what we are doing. We expect these investments to pay off in the short term and the long term and we are pretty confident about what we are doing and the customer perception improvement that we are seeing across the department is the best measure to tell us that we are working on the right things.", "Second area, how do we build relationships and trust customers private brands. We\u2019ve always had a big private brand business across Wal-Mart and it\u2019s across the entire business. GM, Softline, food consumables, but customers are asking more and more from more private brands. It\u2019s a key loyalty driver and those customers who buy it, who are -- participate in private brands they make more trips and they spend more. And where they commonly make those incremental trips 50% of what they spend is on branded products. So we know what they doing, its building a more engaged relationship and it\u2019s a deeper penetration of how they shop at Wal-Mart and why they shop Wal-Mart.", "The penetration of brand, the private brand is increasing both in skew count and in new items. So, the density of that in our stores is going to continue to increase. We believe winning with private brands come down to three things, its price innovation and quality and we are spending a lot of effort to invest in product development, sourcing technology, new talent to be able to build this business.", "For those of you who visit us in Bentonville, and while I encourage you to come see us, we are building a best-in-class product development and sensory lab right in Bentonville right at our home office that will have opened in just a couple of months, which will give us whole new level of capability for us to build as we go forward.", "Now one of the question I get asked a lot of time I thought our private brands is when you are always have to say you are house of brands. And so what does that mean, how do you think about that? And what I would tell you is we always have been a house of brands, and we always will be house of brands. National brands are incredibly important to us, number one because our customers want them. Number two, it\u2019s a fundamental part of the EDLP program. We show price value by customers comparing national brands to one another. So none of that is changing as we do this, but it\u2019s going to be a balance of both as we go forward.", "The next business that really is growing and becoming a more and more important part of our business is our Health and Wellness area. Everybody knows that healthcare always ranks among the top concern of the entire population let alone just our customers. And in boomers age more and more of this is going to become a bigger and bigger issue for the society. And that\u2019s why we are continuing to invest and expand our portfolio here to serve customers better and then for us it\u2019s all about access and affordability in this area.", "Today we operate 4,500 pharmacies, 2,900 vision centers all demonstrating strong growth across the business. We worked and really how do we engage these customers even further. This is an area where health and wellness its\u2019 all about trust. When you look at the customer, I have to trust you in my health and wellness business and the best measure I have to show trust is our immunizations business has doubled in the last year. So to me there is nothing it says trust more than I\u2019m going to let you stick a needle in me in the middle of a store.", "So we feel pretty good about that as a good leading indicator and that customers trust us more and more as we go forward. Just to give you one example of something that we are doing in this business area, it\u2019s called the America\u2019s biggest health fair and we did it the first time in October, where in a four day period we delivered 50,000 immunizations, 280,000 health screenings and we distributed almost 200 million healthy product samples. And we look at those numbers and say wow, that\u2019s great the scale of our ability to do this.", "But what\u2019s really powerful about this is we\u2019re going to take it down to an individual customer and we got dozens and dozens of stories coming out of this health fair and just one that I\u2019ll share with you.", "There is a woman in one of our stores in Atlanta who came in, had a blood pressure screening. And the store immediately called 911. They took this woman to the hospital; her blood pressure was 255/160. And she was about to have a stroke or heart attack and the doctors and her family contacted the store afterwards and said she was going to have a major medical event within a few hours if she had not been in a Wal-Mart store at this healthcare and gotten her blood pressure checked.", "So it\u2019s just one example. Again, the numbers are big but we like to take it all the way down to an individual customers and pretty powerful stuff that we can do for our customers to help them on the Live Better part of our promise.", "Convenience. How do we improve customer experience? How do we think about shopping in the future and how do we change our business as we go forward? Nearly, 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of Wal-Mart store. So, we have access basically to the entire U.S. population just based on our current layout and our stores. So, we are going to continue to provide more access and more conveyance to those customers in three key ways.", "The first is with pickup. And we are really making some good meaningful progress here. Customers keep telling us how much they liked it. This is when a customer goes online, orders an item and he comes in a store and then pick it up for free, often within the same day. It\u2019s been a real priority for us over the last year. The business spiked dramatically during the holiday time, lots of huge volume. That volume has continued on. Customers are excited about it. It provides instant easier access to the great assortment that we have in our store without them having to go do a lot of work.", "Second piece, online grocery. I mentioned it earlier but customers love the ability to shop online, order the groceries and come to a store and never even get out of their car. Open their trunk, we will put the groceries in their trunk for them and move right on. These customers represent a larger basket and many of them are new incremental customers to Wal-Mart. And as I said earlier, customer satisfaction is in the 90s of this business. Customers really like it. We\u2019ve expanded it to over 20 markets already and we will do another 20 markets as we rollout this year and continue to build this business.", "And the final piece is Wal-Mart App. And it\u2019s one of the top three apps in retail. We\u2019ve got tens of millions of customers who use it and it\u2019s all about continuing to add new tools, new capabilities to the app. It\u2019s pretty helpful today if you want to go shop a supercenter to find the product and the aisle locator where you want that product. But recently, we added to it and we introduced Wal-Mart Pay, which is an example of how this app gives customers a seamless experience between digital and physical.", "It just takes the digital world and brings it to the store and makes the store that much more convenient that much simpler. It\u2019s a really, really cool application. It\u2019s unbelievably simple and we will be rolling that out through the rest of the country through the first half of this year. I really believe in this area going back to that 90% within 10 miles, we can do what nobody else can really do effectively on a big scale and that\u2019s marry e-commerce with a physical location and that\u2019s what we are really focused on rolling out over the next couple years.", "Everything I just said is always powered and anchored in what you know from us, which is we are going to be running EDLP business and we are going to power it by EDLC. We are going to deliver that consistent stable pricing that builds trust with our customers. That\u2019s why they come back to us because they trust the price that they are getting from us every single day. To do that and do that really well, we have to continue to improve our low cost position. We are doing a lot of work to drive costs out of our system across the entire franchise.", "A few things we are doing specifically that we focused on is taking all, most of the co-op marketing out of our business and encouraging our supplier partners to put that into the cost of goods, reducing the number of tabs that we have in the marketplace. We had over a 100 few years ago. We will be down under 20, as we go forward.", "We are working to get to more consistent terms and allowances to take costs out of the business, operating with our suppliers and looking at every single aspect of our business from sourcing to logistics, to technology. How do we continue to improve our cost position? So, ultimately, we can deliver on our EDL promise to our customers and not compromise on quality.", "So, as a merchant, I couldn\u2019t stand here today and not talk to you about items because we know -- Budd, we talked about earlier. We are an item driven business. We\u2019ve always been and we will always going to continue to be. So, I want to share just a couple items with you that are examples of great EDLPs that you can find in our store right now. So last year -- I\u2019m grabbing some products.", "Last year, we sold a $1.68 Cami in our store, sold millions of items and it\u2019s this program called Shocking Value that we have in our apparel business. We are following that up this year with a $2.87 No Boundaries T-Shirt. When we will have done, I would encourage you come up, feel the quality and touch this product. This is incredible quality product for $2.87. You are going to see masked out tables in our stores, great arrangement of colors, really, really looks good.", "We are also going to give lot of fun this summer with a product called Bubble Wands. We are going to sell a six pack of Bubble Wands for $3.88. We say okay that sounds good. We are going to sell 6 million of them. Last year, this product was $4.97 and we sold a million of them. This year we are going to sell 6 million to $3.88. And how we are going to do that? One, rollback of the price, but you are going to see masked displays right in front of the customers. It\u2019s a great item that we will have a lot of fun with.", "And the last one is great seasonal item which is Peeps. As we head into Easter time, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all had Peeps and I\u2019m sure you all love the taste of Peeps. Well, we are going to sell them at $1 this year, which will be a 20%, 25% value to anyone in the market and we also have what we call Mystery Peeps. There is three mystery flavors this year. So, I would encourage you to go try it, only at Wal-Mart and we will reveal them at the week of Easter. But just examples of fun exciting items at great prices that make a difference in our business.", "So, as we work on building the fresh business, as we work on building a global e-commerce business, the one thing we are never going to forget and we are never going to walk away from this Wal-Mart is great item merchandising at EDLP pricing because that\u2019s what drives our business and that\u2019s what our customers love when they come to see us.", "So let me just wrap up my time with you and just kind of leave you with a couple thoughts. One, I think we\u2019ve got a really clearly defined strategy in the U.S. It\u2019s about winning with stores. It\u2019s about delivering value, being great merchants and then providing convenience to our customers. My team\u2019s role, merchandising\u2019s focus is about executing that strategy and what are we focused on. We are going to be focused on the customer. We are going to put the customer at the centre of everything that we do. We are very focused on improving our cost positions so we can invest in price over time and make sure that we serve stores as effectively as we possibly can. I think we are on the right path. Traffic, comps, satisfaction with the customer all improving and we are working on the right things and we are encouraged about our progress so far.", "So, thank you for your time. And I guess we will probably do some questions.", "Budd Bugatch", "We have some time for questions. Let\u2019s start. Let\u2019s deal with some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Q - Unidentified Analyst", "As you continue to grow the health and wellness franchise and look to strengthen your cost position, there are examples in the market of deals directly between for instance pharma companies and pharmacies like the Walgreens, Valeant deal. As you evaluate your relationships with the wholesalers like an AmerisourceBergen or McKesson, can you just talk about how you view those relationships versus going directly to large pharma companies given your scale?", "Steve Bratspies", "Yes. Thanks for question. I would say very important relationships to us and there has been a lot of change in the marketplace over the last couple years, different mergers, different programs going on. We are always looking at options to figure out what\u2019s the best way to run our business. It\u2019s a business that we are going to continue to invest in. It\u2019s incredibly important to us and to our customers. So, we are going to always evaluate what\u2019s the best way for us to do that. But those relationships that brought us this far in this business are very important to us and we are going to build upon it.", "Budd Bugatch", "Questions? I will ask one. Several years ago at this conference, Bill Simon made a really good case about the outsized market share that Wal-Mart had at the weekly shop and part of the impetus of the Neighborhood Market and the Wal-Mart Express test was to develop a better market share of the midweek shop. Can you give us kind of an update on where we are on that process and what the current thinking is of the leadership?", "Steve Bratspies", "Yes. Sure. Thanks, Budd. Yes, worth looking at is when you run a business a size that we run we need to participate in every shopping trip that exists out there. And one of the reasons we continue to lean into invest in the Neighborhood Market franchise is it serves that need really, really well. It\u2019s our convenience format, which customers like to do, the smaller shopping trip to as they go forward.", "We build 85 to 95 more of them this year than we have going forward. So, we are going to continue to invest. We are working all the programs that I talked about today apply to Neighborhood Markets as well. Improving our fresh business there, making them more convenient. We continue to lead and to pick-up in those stores to make them more productive as we go forward. But that midweek shopping trip continues to be a big part how customers are shopping and changing their behavior and we are using the Neighborhood Market particularly to go after that.", "Budd Bugatch", "And you have been redoing Neighborhood Markets to get that. How does that feel and where are you now in that innovation? You\u2019ve made a couple of new Neighborhood Markets near the Home Office that have had some different items. Where are we on that?", "Steve Bratspies", "We have. There is a couple of different protos that we are working on in our local area, in the Home Office. Couple things. We are changing the fresh layout in those stores. Lowering profiles, creating more shopping space, adding to the assortment there in fresh, building out our daily business and adding more capabilities, things like new pizza programs and things like that in those businesses, making those stores convenient by splitting the aisles.", "A lot of times you go into Wal-Mart, one of the complaints customer has a long runs. So in Neighborhood Markets and the new protos they are split aisles, which creates more opportunity for us. We are expanding the baby department in Neighborhood Market in stores that it makes sense, all to serve that customer better over time, so just a few examples of things that we are working on.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Sometimes ago, I have read a story that you are closing down shops in let\u2019s say rural areas because the population was not big enough. You plan to address that issue with let\u2019s say Drop-off stations or something like that to give them at least a chance to buy something.", "Steve Bratspies", "Yes. Let me just start with these closing stores. We did close about 150 stores at the end of last year, which was really part of a very large comprehensive global portfolio review, as to where we are in terms of what are the best assets that we have, how do we optimize them and where do we want to invest and where do we not want to invest.", "The total closures of that business was less than 1% of our total square footage on a global basis, so not a tremendous amount. But all of those stores from the U.S. were our Express stores and many of those were located in some rural areas. That Express store pilot that we ran, it was a 105 stores, I think is the exact number.", "Basically, we decided that it didn\u2019t fit the model of operating that we wanted to have in the future. Many of those locations, we actually wish we had build the Neighborhood Market in quite frankly. So, as we\u2019ve gotten more encouraged with our Neighborhood Market results, we don\u2019t think or we know that the Express business doesn\u2019t fit into our model as we go forward.", "In terms of reaching more rural area, that\u2019s a real estate kind of analysis play that we will always do. We are always looking for new markets. We are going to continue to build the stores. We are just not going to build Express stores in those markets that we\u2019ve build. We are going to build the Supercenter. We are going to build the Neighborhood Market.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So the company\u2019s unilateral decision to raise wages, which has increased your U.S. cost structure by $2.7 billion, doesn\u2019t that really inhibit your ability to invest in price and thus driving any kind of comp going forward?", "Steve Bratspies", "So the $2.7 billion is an investment that we made for a couple different reasons. One, we need to invest in our associates and our stores, which has always been a strong plank for Wal-Mart in the U.S. and around the globe. So, we wanted to invest in them. Part of that investment is also adding labor to the stores or adding department managers, adding technology, adding capabilities to serve customers much better in our stores.", "So, $2.7 billion, that\u2019s not a small number, right. We made a big investment, which obviously you saw what it did to how we position ourselves from an earnings perspective. But what we think that\u2019s going to do is position us for the long-term to grow our comp sales business as we continue to invest and make the experience in our stores better.", "Now for price, I talked about what we are trying to do on costs, continuing to take costs out of the system. This year, we are going to start to invest in price again as a business and you are going to see a multi-billion dollar investment over the next couple years. The approach that we basically took was and I think Doug and Greg have used this phrase before. You can\u2019t invite people over your house for dinner before you clean up the house and that\u2019s what we needed to do. And we didn\u2019t think spending a lot of money on price before we improved the performance of our stores, before we improved the experience would be a prudent investment.", "Now that we are getting to the point, we feel better about how our stores are being run, how they are being operated, the customer experience in there we are ready to start spending money against price. Our fast, clean and friendly scores, which is how we ultimately kind of measure the metrics of our operators right now, we put a very high bar in place for them last year. 76% of the stores reached that bar and then we flip the calendar and then we raise the bar again and then working back up to climbing that leader to have better fast scores, better cleanliness scores and more convenient stores for our customers. Once we have that, we are going to continue to invest in price.", "Budd Bugatch", "Just piggybacking on your last comment, one of the big issues has been the back rooms, cleaning up the back rooms, taking inventory out of that.", "Steve Bratspies", "Yes.", "Budd Bugatch", "I think that's been a big push of Greg's because he believes if the back rooms are really well organized then the shrink goes down. Shrink was an issue that I think hit us at one of the quarters last year. Where are we in that process? Are all the back rooms clean like you want them?", "Steve Bratspies", "Sure. No, they are not all clean the way I want them but we are making good progress. And there is lot and there is couple different things happening there. One, clean back room is two things. It\u2019s how you flow product into the store and then ultimately, what are the back room processes you run and the floor processes you run to get it out, so a lot of changes going on in flow. But what I will talk about is in the store. We have a new process that we call CAP. We are rolling out top stock, which is you could see top shelves above where we can put product. Our buyers, some of them I have here with me today are working on pack and a half compliance in our stores, so more product fits on the shelf.", "So our back rooms are, I would say significantly better and I have been in some back rooms that are almost completely clean at this point. But not every back room across the franchise is that way. We are making meaningful progress but more work to do but I\u2019m encouraged. Ultimately, when we run a clean back room, what it really means is we are better in stock and our in-stock is better. And when our in-stock is better, we sell more, comps improve. So, we are very focused ultimately on in-stock for the customers and we run a tight efficient backroom process, it allows us to stay in stock on the floor.", "Budd Bugatch", "Thank you very much.

This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is August 18, 2016. On today's call you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO, and Brett Biggs, CFO.", "This call contains statements that Wal-Mart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking information provided by that Act. A cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements is at the end of this call.", "As a reminder, our earnings materials include the press release, transcript and accompanying slide presentation, which are intended to be used together. All of this information, along with our store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the investors portion of our corporate website; stock.walmart.com.", "For fiscal year 2017, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar. Our Q2 reporting period ran from Saturday, April 30th, through Friday, July 29th, of this year. And, as previously announced, our annual meeting for the investment community will be in Bentonville, Arkansas on October 5th and 6th. We plan on having facility tours on the 5th with our meeting taking place on the 6th. We look forward to seeing you here.", "Now, I'd like to turn it over to Wal-Mart CEO, Doug McMillon.", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter results. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $123.6 billion, an increase of 2.8% over last year.", "We exceeded our Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance this quarter, with Walmart U.S. delivering comp sales of 1.6%, driven by a traffic increase of 1.2%. This was our 8th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our 7th consecutive quarter of positive traffic.", "I\u2019m encouraged by what I'm seeing when I visit stores and pleased with how Greg Foran, our leadership team and our associates are executing our plan to win. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve, and the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down 6.5% and in-stock levels are up.", "We\u2019re also showing progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, GMV and e-commerce sales increased 13% and 11.8% respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets.", "This was primarily due to growth in our marketplace offering in the U.S., the continued roll out of online grocery and growth of pick-up in stores and clubs. We continue to see proof that our customers enjoy a seamless shopping experience.", "The distinctions that we talk about today between stores, apps, pick-up, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers. For them, it\u2019s just Walmart.", "We've built a solid foundation in e-commerce under the leadership of Neil Ashe. During Neil\u2019s tenure, we more than doubled our e-commerce GMV, became the second most trafficked e-commerce site in the U.S., re-platformed Walmart.com, opened a national fulfillment center network and most importantly, became known as a great place to work for talented technologists and e-commerce professionals in Silicon Valley. Neil also led our discussions with JD.", "Neil will be with Wal-Mart through the end of our fiscal year working on our e-commerce strategies in several international markets. I\u2019d like to thank him for his significant contributions to our company.", "Building on this solid foundation, we made some strategic decisions to position ourselves for the future in the priority markets of the U.S. and China, including the announcement last week to acquire Jet.com.", "Operating Walmart.com and Jet.com will allow us to reach even more customers and drive a higher level of growth more quickly. One of the things we like about the technology they've developed is that it rewards customers in real time with savings on a basket of goods and puts them more in charge of the price they pay. This empowers customers in a way that is true to the spirit of Walmart.", "When customers build a basket of goods online rather than ordering one item at a time, shipping economics are in their favor and ours. Wal-Mart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online. It\u2019s important to remember that customers won\u2019t see changes immediately as we await government approval, and the necessary tech platform changes, which will take time.", "Once the acquisition is complete, we look forward to welcoming Marc Lore, current President and CEO of Jet.com. He will join Wal-Mart as our new President and CEO of e-commerce, reporting to me. He will be responsible for both the Walmart and Jet brands in the U.S. Marc is a passionate merchant and innovative thinker who will definitely add value to our business. I look forward to working with him.", "In China, our recently announced transaction with, and investment in, JD.com improves our position there. JD's significant presence online, where Wal-Mart and Sam's Club will feature prominently, affords us the opportunity to extend the reach of our brands to millions of new customers.", "I made a couple of visits to JD's delivery and pickup points in Shanghai when I was last in China and am excited about the potential it creates for our customers there. Richard Liu, CEO of JD.com, is a talented e-commerce merchant and we look forward to our collaborations going forward.", "Additionally, we made advancements in the U.S. on our key priorities to build digital relationships with customers, scale the assortment and expand online grocery. As of June, we have rolled out Wal-Mart Pay nationwide to all stores.", "Customers tell us they love the convenience of this unique service, and we've found that a majority of transactions come from repeat users. If you haven't tried Wal-Mart Pay, please do and share your feedback.", "Customers also continue to enjoy our online grocery pickup service and give it high marks. We added grocery pickup to 30 more markets this quarter bringing our total to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations. It's gratifying to see how much this service helps our customers save time.", "Next, we are growing our marketplace offering at a strong pace. Since the beginning of the year, we've added about 7 million new items to the assortment and today offer approximately 15 million SKUs.", "Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. Nine of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and six of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way, and I'm pleased with the fact that the momentum in the business is broad based across all formats and countries.", "In China, in addition to expanding our reach through the strategic alliance with JD.com, we continue to grow our base of stores and clubs. In fact, we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel. China remains a strategic focus for us as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally.", "In the U.K., the competitive environment and food deflation continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales. Our strategy to turn things around is focused on improving the retail basics.", "We are simplifying and strengthening our offering through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs and driving sales through strategic price investments. While our turn-around will take time, I'm confident in the new leadership team there and want to assure you we're addressing this with urgency.", "At Sam\u2019s Club, comp sales for the period were slightly above our expectations. Membership performance was the highlight, and there is quite a bit of innovation underway at Sam's related to the member experience.", "Earlier this year we launched a test of Scan and Go, a mobile checkout and payment solution, which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of this service, and we expect to roll this out nationwide later this year.", "We also saw strong growth in the quarter from both Club Pickup and direct to home e-commerce. The new platform we are using to prospect for new members and better manage their accounts will help us deliver on our priority of growing membership. These innovations are making it easy for members to shop and save time.", "Finally, I've enjoyed my time this week with more than 5,000 store leaders and merchants with the U.S. team at our annual Holiday Meeting in Denver. We've got a great plan for the busiest time of year, and the mood at the meeting was deservedly upbeat.", "I'd like to thank our store managers and all of our associates for the job they're doing. In summary, I'm pleased with the momentum in the business. We have a plan, and we are executing against it and customers are responding favorably.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brett.", "Brett Biggs", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. We're half way through the year and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we're seeing across many parts of the business. We're executing against our strategic priorities, focusing on the customer and improving core retail fundamentals around the world.", "In addition to delivering solid second quarter results, which I'll talk about in a minute, we continue to make decisions that focus the business for long term success. Just in the past few weeks we've furthered our strategy in e-commerce through the alliance with JD.com and the planned acquisition of Jet.com.", "In addition, we've agreed to divest our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico, allowing for additional focus on our core business in that market. Each of these decisions aligns with our strategy and demonstrates our commitment to thoughtfully allocating capital against our long term strategy.", "Now, let's get to the results. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.07, which was at the high end of our guidance range, while reported EPS was $1.21. Adjusted EPS excludes a non-cash gain of $0.14, net of tax, from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. We anticipate the gain for the full year will be $0.16 per share, which is within the original guidance range when we announced the transaction.", "From a revenue perspective, we had another solid quarter. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, total revenue increased 2.8% to $123.6 billion, while on a reported basis, total revenue was $120.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added net sales of $2.8 billion in the quarter and $7.2 billion in the first six months of the fiscal year.", "Walmart U.S. delivered a very solid comp sales increase of 1.6% driven by a 1.2% increase in traffic. It\u2019s now been two full years that Walmart U.S. has delivered positive comp sales \u2013 in fact, on a two-year stack basis, comp sales increased 3.1%.", "As Doug mentioned earlier, we made progress in e-commerce with GMV and sales, growing 13% and 11.8%, respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than the international results, and globally we continue to make headway on expanding our assortment and enhancing the shopping experience for our customers.", "Whether it\u2019s through Online Grocery, Walmart Pay, or broadening our reach in China through the alliance with JD.com, we're making it easier for customers to access products when and how they want. Now, with the agreement to acquire Jet.com, we're building on our e-commerce foundation and creating an opportunity to accelerate e-commerce even further.", "Consolidated gross profit margin increased 53 basis points, driven by improvements in all three operating segments. From an expense standpoint, as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to our previously announced investments in people and technology for this fiscal year. That being said, our teams across the globe remain focused on managing expenses.", "In addition to solid operating results, disciplined working capital management and the timing of payments allowed us to generate $10.3 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, which compares to $5.1 billion in the first half of last year.", "Continuing to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases is a priority for us and we're fortunate to have such a strong business model that generates substantial distributable cash even after we've invested thoughtfully into the business.", "During the quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased 30.3 million shares for approximately $2.1 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, we have utilized approximately $7.3 billion of our current $20 billion share repurchase authorization.", "With that, let's discuss the results for each of our operating segments, starting with Walmart U.S. We continue to see steady improvement in the Walmart U.S. business as customers respond favorably to the changes we're making in our stores and e-commerce offer. Net sales were up 3.1%, or $2.3 billion, and comp sales rose 1.6% with a 1.2% increase in customer traffic.", "We believe a contributing factor to the results is our consistent improvement in customer experience. Customer surveys indicate that we\u2019re making good progress in providing a better shopping experience with cleaner stores, faster checkout and friendlier service.", "We've also broadened our e-commerce assortment, strengthened our mobile capabilities and expanded Online Grocery to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations. While there is still a lot of work to do in executing our multi-year plan, we're encouraged by the results we're seeing.", "E-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp, and all of our formats had positive comp sales, including Neighborhood Markets, which delivered approximately a 6.5% comp sales growth in the period.", "Although difficult to quantify, we know overall sales included some tailwinds from external factors such as continued low gas prices and unseasonably warm weather across much of the country.", "However, we also experienced sales headwinds from continued market deflation in food, which negatively impacted our food comp by around 100 basis points and our second quarter total segment comp by a similar amount as what we faced in the first quarter.", "The grocery business showed improvement from the first quarter with positive comp sales and traffic, despite the ongoing deflationary impacts in food. In addition, both general merchandise and health and wellness delivered solid sales growth with strength in home, toys, sporting goods and OTC.", "The back-to-school shopping season is in full swing, and we aim to be the destination of choice with low prices on a great assortment of products for parents and students preparing for the new school year.", "In the second quarter, we continued to implement a multi-year strategy of incremental price investment in the U.S. business. It's still early days for this initiative, but we are pleased with the initial results. We're committed to providing Everyday Low Prices, using data and analytics to better serve our customers both through stores and e-commerce.", "Gross margin increased 33 basis points in the quarter. Improved margin rates in food and consumables were a contributing factor. In addition, we had improvement in our cost of goods due to savings in procuring merchandise, lower transportation expense as a result of lower fuel costs and some improvements in shrink. These benefits are somewhat offset by the implementation of the multi-year strategy of incremental price investments.", "Operating expenses increased 8.3% over last year due primarily to the previously announced associate wage rate increases and investments in technology. We remain focused on managing expenses with an EDLC mindset while elevating the shopping environment for customers.", "Overall, the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins, resulting in an operating income decline of 6.2%. We're also encouraged by the progress on inventory management with inventory declining about 2.9% in the second quarter versus last year, including a 6.5% decline in comp stores.", "By cleaning up our store back rooms, leveraging technology and changing certain processes, we're improving product availability and enabling associates to be on the sales floor serving customers in a more effective way.", "Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase in the range of 1% to 1.5%. As a reminder, comp sales for last year's comparable period were 1.5%.", "Now, let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. Nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and six of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%.", "The rate of sales growth in several markets slowed versus our first quarter results, impacted by Leap Day in the first quarter and the Easter holiday shift between first and second quarters in most markets due to the one month reporting lag. Walmex continues to produce strong sales results across all formats, while the U.K. environment remains challenging.", "The International team remains focused and continues to execute on key strategic priorities; to actively manage the existing portfolio, deliver balanced growth, be the lowest cost operator, and build strong foundations in talent, trust, and technology.", "We continue to be aggressive in managing the portfolio, announcing last week the agreement to sell our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico. In addition, our recently announced strategic alliance with JD.com in China aligns with our growth strategy in this key market by better integrating our digital and physical retail operations.", "We also continue to execute aggressive cost reduction programs in the U.K. and Canada, and are expanding cost analytics programs into other markets like Mexico and China.", "We also announced market CEO moves this quarter in China, the U.K. and Canada. We are confident these moves position us well for driving improved performance in each of these markets and demonstrate the depth of our talent globally.", "With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.2% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 6.6% due to a $2.7 billion currency headwind.", "From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 47.5% on a constant currency basis and 35.2% on a reported basis. This increase includes the gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. Excluding the impact from this gain, operating income increased 3.1% on a constant currency basis, which slightly outpaced sales growth. On a reported basis, excluding the gain, operating income decreased 6.7%. ", "The accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our five major markets. However, I would like to provide some highlights on each one. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance. ", "Walmex continues to lead the way, delivering strong results. Keep in mind, Walmex releases results under IFRS and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ. The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions and countries.", "Comp sales for Walmex increased 7.3% in the quarter, significantly outpacing the rest of the self-service market. Excluding the gain from the sale of our bank operations in Mexico last year, operating income would have increased faster than sales.", "In Canada, despite increased promotional activity by competitors throughout the quarter, comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for nine consecutive quarters, and according to Nielsen we continued to gain market share in food and consumables and Health & Wellness.", "Our cost analytics program made good progress, helping drive down cost of goods allowing us to invest in price. Excluding the gain from the sale of certain properties in Canada last year, operating income increased faster than sales. Additionally, we continue to decrease inventory levels and improve efficiency from a store and labor perspective.", "In the U.K., fierce competition and food deflation continue to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends. During the quarter, comp sales, excluding fuel, decreased 7.5%. Our strategy remains focused on improving retail basics, simplifying and strengthening the offer through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs through our cost analytics program and driving sales through strategic price investments where we remain committed to the previously announced five-year \u00a31.5 billion price investment.", "In China, despite negative comp sales of 0.5% this quarter, our business continues to grow as we expand our footprint throughout the country, and we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel.\"We Operate for Less\" initiatives have delivered results, and we were able to leverage expenses. Our recently announced alliance with JD.com enables us to better serve consumers through a powerful combination of e-commerce and retail.", "JD.com, the leading online direct sales company and the country's largest Internet business by revenue has a complementary offering, allowing us to deliver compelling new experiences that can reach significantly more customers. We are optimistic about our future in China.", "In Brazil, despite the ongoing economic recession, we delivered comp sales growth of 4.7%. Our wholesale format continues to perform well and delivered strong growth again this quarter. In addition, we completed our store systems integration, which allows all banners to operate under a single financial system. This will provide better visibility to business outcomes, improved alignment of marketing efforts and further enhance our compliance programs. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with another solid performance from our international business in the quarter. ", "Now, let's turn to Sam's Club. Net sales, without fuel, grew by 0.4%. Membership income increased 2.9%, as Plus member counts increased and Plus member penetration is near all-time highs.", "Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.6%, which was slightly above our guidance. Market deflation, especially in food, continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 100 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. We're pleased with how e-commerce performed as both direct to home and Club Pickup had strong growth.", "Sam's also continues to make progress on being a leader in the digital space. Our members tell us they really appreciate the convenience that innovations like Scan & Go bring to their lives. This new checkout and payment solution lets members complete the shopping experience using their own mobile device. ", "Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect comp sales without fuel to be slightly positive. As a reminder, comp sales for last year\u2019s comparable period increased 0.4%. ", "With that let\u2019s wrap things up. There\u2019s always more work to do, but we\u2019re pleased with the first half performance. These results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year give us confidence in raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.35, which includes a range of $0.90 to $1.00 in the third quarter. This compares to previous guidance of $4.00 to $4.30 for the full year.", "As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14, net of tax, non-cash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. In addition, this guidance includes an estimated dilutive EPS impact of approximately $0.05, primarily in the fourth quarter, as a result of expected operating losses, and one-time transaction expenses related to the planned acquisition of Jet.com, assuming the transaction is closed near the beginning of the fourth quarter of FY17.", "Keep in mind that this updated guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels and that our full year effective tax rate is expected to be at the low end of our previously stated range of 31.5% to 33.5%.", "In closing, we continue to be pleased with momentum we are seeing across many parts of the business. We\u2019re executing against our strategic priorities and continue to focus on the customer. It\u2019s an exciting time at Walmart and we are proud of the progress we\u2019re making.", "Thank you for joining our call today. And we look forward to seeing many of you here in Arkansas at our annual meeting for the investment community on October 5th and 6th.", "This call included certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is November 17, 2016. On today's call, you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO, and Brett Biggs, CFO.", "This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking information provided by that Act.

All of this information, along with our recently published fiscal 2018 earnings release dates, store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the Investors portion of our corporate Web-site, stock.walmart.com. For fiscal year 2017, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar. Our Q3 reporting period ran from Saturday, July 30th through Friday, October 28th of this year.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon.", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. As you saw in our earnings release this morning, we delivered another solid quarter and are pleased with the continued momentum in the business. Our associates are doing a good job and it's much appreciated. I'll discuss the details in a minute but I'd like to start by thanking everyone who came to Bentonville for our Investment Community Meeting in October. We enjoyed giving you an update on our plans going forward.", "We have a strong Company. We're executing well in our stores and making strategic investments in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster to better serve our customers every day. When we were together last month, I outlined four priorities, make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, be the most trusted retailer, and deliver results and position the Company to win. By executing on these priorities, the customer and our shareholders will benefit.", "To start, I'd like to highlight some recent developments in e-commerce that demonstrate how we're moving faster and making every day easier for busy families. First, we're excited to see Walmart.com gaining traction. From a marketplace perspective, we're scaling fast, adding 8 million SKUs over the last three months alone. E-commerce contributed 50 basis points to our Q3 Walmart U.S. comp, which is our largest contribution yet. It's great to see an improving e-commerce business complement the momentum we have in our stores.", "Next, we recently completed the acquisition of Jet.com and we're excited to have Marc Lore as a member of our leadership team driving U.S. eCommerce for Walmart and Jet.com. One of the reasons Jet.com makes sense for Walmart is the common ground we share with basket economics. Walmart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket of goods, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online. When customers build a bigger basket online, the economics work in their favor and in ours.", "Marc has hit the ground running since the acquisition was finalized. We immediately set up teams to accelerate our integration efforts and we're working hard to leverage our strengths, such as optimizing our combined fulfillment networks, utilizing our scale in areas like shipping, sharing our assortment and leveraging the strengths of our marketing teams. We're excited to reap the benefits of our combined businesses and we look forward to updating you on our progress going forward.", "I'm also excited by how we've positioned our business in China to win. We continue to be pleased with how our alliance with JD.com allows us to reach even more customers with our brands. We recently announced we own roughly 10% of JD.com's shares and during my visit a few weeks ago we jointly launched two new services.", "Our Sam's Club flagship store launched on JD's Web-site, providing hundreds of millions of customers access to Sam's Club's premium products with JD's same-day and next-day delivery service. We also announced an exclusive Walmart Global imports store on JD.com Worldwide, the company's cross-border platform. The new store provides Chinese consumers access to Walmart's selection of thousands of products imported from Walmart stores around the world.", "We're working together with them to create a seamless shopping experience. I was able to visit the JD Home Office when I was in China last month and it was clear that they work with speed and the spirit of innovation is strong. When I was in one of our Walmart hypermarkets in Beijing, JD already had a site set up for picking and delivering customer orders.", "We also announced an investment in New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery online-to-offline, or O2O, seamless e-commerce platform. Already, New Dada is enabling two-hour delivery service from more than 45 Walmart locations. It's amazing to see how O2O is changing how Chinese consumers shop. Densely populated cities and favorable delivery economics enable two-hour delivery and we look to expand the number of locations using New Dada for two-hour delivery going forward. We're moving faster to position the Company to win, and we're doing this from a position of increasing strength.", "Now, I'd like to move to our third quarter results, where we delivered another solid quarter with earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding the $2.1 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $120.3 billion, an increase of 2.5% over last year.", "Comp store sales grew 1.2% in Walmart U.S., driven by a traffic increase of 0.7%. Greg Foran, our U.S. leadership team and our associates continue to execute our plan to win, and it's working. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve and the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down approximately 6% and in-stock levels are up.", "We also continued to show progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, global e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8% respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering, as I mentioned earlier, as well as a contribution from Jet.com. We continue to roll out online grocery and grow our pickup business in stores and clubs. We're making progress giving our customers the seamless shopping experience they are looking for.", "Dave Cheesewright and the International team delivered another solid performance in the quarter, growing sales in constant currency 2.4%. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and seven of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way and I'm pleased with the fact that our momentum is broad-based across formats and countries within Walmex.", "I'm pleased comp sales growth returned to positive territory in China. We continue to grow our base of stores and clubs, in addition to the e-commerce initiatives I mentioned earlier. When I was in China, and in conjunction with the Walmart Foundation, we were proud to launch the Walmart Food Safety and Collaboration Center in Beijing with an investment of $25 million from the Company and our foundation.", "The goal of the center is to develop solutions to food safety that can be implemented across the global supply chain, so Chinese consumers can trust that the food they eat is safe and good for their families. China is clearly a strategic market for us as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally and we're moving with speed to position the business for success.", "In the U.K., we're making some progress but our turnaround will take time. We're confident in our leadership team there and want to assure you we continue to address this market with urgency.", "We have a strong international business and are encouraged by our positive momentum. As we mentioned in October, we are shaping our portfolio and will make appropriate adjustments if it strengthens the Company. You've seen examples of this recently in Chile and Mexico and we'll continue to evaluate and adjust, when it's best.", "At Sam's Club, Roz and the team grew comp sales, excluding fuel, 1.4% and launched Scan & Go nationwide. Scan & Go is a mobile checkout and payment solution, which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of this service and we're excited about how it will improve our members' experience, making it easy to shop and save time. Whether it's transforming the way members shop or elevating the experience with exciting new merchandise, the initiatives we have underway position us to win.", "Overall, we're gearing up for the holidays, our busiest time of the year, and we'll be ready with great items at low prices to delight our customers. Here in the U.S., we'll have an expanded assortment online and available for pickup, in addition to holiday helpers in stores to help speed customers through the checkout line.", "Finally, one of the goals we laid out for you in October was to be the most trusted retailer. Part of building that trust is not only helping customers save money and time but helping them feel good about shopping at Walmart. We want them to be able to trust that the products they buy are good for their families, the planet and the people that made them. So, earlier this month we shared some new targets in sustainability, food and responsible sourcing. We set new goals in the areas of waste, renewable energy and sustainable products including food. Please check out our Web-site to learn more.", "Customers have more transparency than ever before when they shop and they expect us to lead in these areas, but they will also expect us to earn their trust and we will. We're excited about this work and are committed to lead in what we believe is a new era of trust and transparency in retail.", "In summary, overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making across our business. We have momentum and we're moving faster. We have a plan to win, we're executing against it and customers are responding favorably. Now, I'll turn it over to Brett.", "Brett Biggs", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. Last month at our Investment Community Meeting, we updated investors on how we're transforming the Company from a position of strength. I laid out the financial framework that will guide our decisions, focused on delivering strong efficient growth, operating with discipline, and strategic capital allocation. Growth going forward will focus more on comp sales and we're investing to accelerate e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. with our acquisition of Jet.com and further scaling Walmart.com. We're moving with speed to drive long-term value for our shareholders.", "Let's turn to our third quarter results. We're pleased that results were in line with our expectations and showed continuing momentum in the business. Excluding currency impacts, each business segment delivered solid net sales growth, and e-commerce GMV and sales growth continued to accelerate. Keep in mind that the results included the operating impact of Jet.com for roughly half of the quarter as well as the transaction costs, both of which were initially forecast to be in the fourth quarter.", "Total revenue, excluding an unfavorable $2.1 billion currency impact, increased 2.5% to $120.3 billion. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.7% to $118.2 billion. During the quarter, we added $2.7 billion in net sales on a constant currency basis, which brings year-to-date constant currency growth to nearly $10 billion.", "Walmart U.S. continued its solid top line performance, and it's clear that our focus on driving value and a better store experience is resonating with customers. International delivered another solid quarter with Walmex once again leading the way. Sam's Club comp sales were better than expected and membership income again showed steady improvement.", "Third quarter EPS was $0.98 versus guidance of $0.90 to $1. There were a few items that impacted the results that were not anticipated in our guidance, but in total had a minimal impact. The primary items included a gain on the sale of certain shopping center assets in Chile, a tax benefit related to our agreement to sell the Suburbia business in Mexico, as well as the dilutive impact from the earlier than expected completion of the Jet.com acquisition, including transaction costs. Also, recall that last year there was a $0.04 benefit to third quarter EPS due to a lease accounting adjustment.", "I'll provide more details about our operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce, where results have improved sequentially throughout the year. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8% respectively, with even stronger growth in the U.S.", "The continuing transition of the Yihaodian e-commerce business in China disproportionately impacted the GMV growth rate versus the sales growth rate this quarter due to the mix of first party versus marketplace sales. Excluding Yihaodian in total, GMV increased 28.6%. E-commerce growth includes a benefit from the six weeks of Jet.com results in the quarter, but the GMV growth rate would still be greater than 20% when excluding this contribution.", "In the U.S. e-commerce business, we continue to make solid progress expanding marketplace. We're thrilled to have the Jet team onboard and we're moving quickly to accelerate growth. In addition, we're pleased with the progress we're making with online grocery. Customer count and basket size continue to outperform our expectations and we've expanded this service to more than 100 U.S. markets.", "In China, we expect our broader presence on JD.com with the new Sam's Club flagship store and Walmart Global imports store will accelerate growth. We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth.", "Now let's turn back to the broader business. Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 34 basis points, due primarily to improvements in the U.S. and International segments. As expected, total SG&A also increased primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology.", "We continue to make progress on working capital, driven primarily by continuing discipline in managing inventory and payables. We also had a cash flow benefit this quarter due to the application of new tax guidelines related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. In total, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year, compared to $6.8 billion in the first nine months of last year.", "During this transformational time, a key priority remains using our financial strength to provide strong cash returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased 19.6 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we have now returned $10.9 billion to shareholders. As of the end of the third quarter, we have utilized approximately $8.7 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization.", "Let's now discuss the results for each of the operating segments in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. Overall, we're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. Sales and traffic increased again this quarter and customer experience scores improved. Walmart U.S. net sales increased 2.5%, or more than $1.8 billion. This growth comes despite persistent market deflation in food, which negatively impacted our food comp by approximately 150 basis points, as well as unseasonably warm weather in the back half of the quarter.", "Comp sales increased 1.2%, driven by a 0.7% increase in customer traffic. On a two-year stack basis, comp traffic was up 2.4%, which was relatively consistent with the first two quarters of the year. E-commerce contributed approximately 50 basis points to the segment comp, which was an acceleration from the second quarter. Also, all store formats had positive comp sales, including Neighborhood Markets which delivered comp sales growth of approximately 5.2%.", "Gross margin increased 32 basis points. Savings from procuring merchandise contributed to margin rate improvement in general merchandise, food, and consumables. In addition, transportation-related fuel cost savings favorably impacted results. These factors, which reduced cost of goods sold, were partially offset by the continued implementation of our multi-year strategy of incremental price investment.", "Operating expenses increased 8.6%, primarily due to the previously announced associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology. In addition, we lapped the lease accounting adjustment that I mentioned earlier, which benefitted last year's U.S. third quarter results. As a result, operating income declined 11.3% for the quarter. Excluding last year's lease accounting adjustment, operating income would have declined 9.8%.", "We continue to do a good job with inventory while maintaining high in-stock levels. In the third quarter, inventory declined 2%, with comp store inventory down approximately 6%.", "We continue to execute our plan and are making good progress delivering a better experience for our customers. We're pleased with the underlying momentum in the business and feel good about our plans for the fourth quarter. We're well-positioned for holiday with newness, exciting gift items, and EDLP throughout the assortment. All the pieces are in place to ensure a great shopping experience in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of between 1% and 1.5%.", "Now, let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International continues to deliver solid results. This quarter, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and seven of those markets grew comps by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way with comp sales growth of 7%, representing a two-year comp growth of nearly 13%. Our positive comp sales trend again this quarter is a continuation of what we have seen over the last several years. We will continue to focus on driving growth through our fresh offering, expanding online grocery and private brands.", "With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.4% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 4.8% due to a $2.1 billion currency impact. Operating income increased 11.2% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, operating income increased 1.2%.", "In the quarter, there was a gain from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Also, recall that in the third quarter last year, we had a favorable impact from a lease accounting adjustment. Excluding both of these items, operating income increased 9.4% on a constant currency basis. We expect a similar gain in the fourth quarter, reflecting the completion of the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile.", "Let's now turn to some brief highlights of our key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our five major markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Additionally, the results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.", "Let's begin with Walmex, which released its earnings on October 25th. Keep in mind that Walmex releases results under IFRS and that the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some results may differ. The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions, and countries.", "Comp sales for Walmex increased 7% in the quarter and total sales increased nearly 9%. In Mexico, comp sales increased 7.3% and continued to outpace the rest of the self-service market, according to ANTAD. In addition, Walmex did a good job managing inventory, which grew at a slower rate than sales growth.", "In Canada, net sales increased 3.3% and comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for ten consecutive quarters, and according to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in food and consumables, and health and wellness. Our cost analytics program continues in helping drive down cost of goods allowing us to invest in price. In Canada, we also reduced inventory levels even as sales increased.", "Turning to the U.K., net sales declined 3.8% and comp sales declined 5.8% in the third quarter. The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price. We are moving with pace as we address our customer value proposition in the market.", "In China, net sales grew 4.2% and comp sales increased 1.6% this quarter. The key drivers of the performance were strong seasonal and festive categories during the Mid-Autumn Festival and a strong performance in fresh categories, an ongoing focus area for us in China. As Doug mentioned, through our recent alliance with JD.com, we continue to offer exciting new ways for customers to access high-quality products from around the world. It was another solid performance from Walmart International.", "Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Excluding fuel, net sales and comp sales increased 1.8% and 1.4% respectively, and membership income grew by 2.3%. Market deflation, primarily in food, negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 110 basis points versus last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed approximately 60 basis points to the comp growth.", "Operating income, including fuel, declined year-over-year by approximately 27%, primarily as a result of an increase in operating expenses, including planned investments in people and technology, as well as fuel profit and lapping last year's lease accounting benefit. Excluding fuel and the lease-related benefit, segment income decreased approximately 18%. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, for the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect comp sales growth, excluding fuel, to be in a range of 1% to 1.5%.", "With that, let's discuss our fourth quarter and full year EPS guidance. We are increasing the bottom end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance resulting in a new range of $4.20 to $4.35. As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 non-cash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, our full year EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.34 to $4.49. The updated guidance assumes that the full year effective tax rate will be between 31% and 32% as well as currency exchange rates remaining at current levels.", "In closing, we're pleased with our progress in the business and the positive momentum we're seeing. We're excited for the holidays.

This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is February 21, 2017. On today\u2019s call, you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO; and Brett Biggs, CFO.", "This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking information provided by that Act. A cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements is at the end of this call.", "As a reminder, our earnings materials include the press release, transcript and accompanying slide presentation, which are intended to be used together. All of this information, along with our fiscal 2018 earnings release dates, store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the Investors\u2019 portion of our corporate website stock.walmart.com.", "For fiscal year 2017, we utilized the 52-week comp reporting calendar. Our Q4 reporting period ran from Saturday, October 29, 2016 through Friday, January 27, 2017. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you of a few upcoming dates. Our first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release will be on Thursday, May 18, 2017 and our Annual Shareholder Meeting will be held Friday, June 2 on the University of Arkansas campus here in Fayetteville.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon.", "Doug McMillon", "Good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings materials this morning, we delivered a very solid quarter. And it\u2019s great to see continued momentum in the business.", "Total revenue grew 3% in the quarter and increased 3.1% for the year, both in constant currency. Comp sales growth of 1.8% in the Walmart U.S. business this quarter was better than expected, and I\u2019m particularly pleased with the traffic in our stores. U.S. GMV grew 36% in the quarter, so we\u2019re headed in the right direction with this important part of our business too.", "Our international business again delivered solid sales growth in constant currency last quarter and Sam\u2019s Club delivered its best comp sales growth of the year. I\u2019m excited about what\u2019s happening at our company. We\u2019re moving with speed to better serve our customers every day and progressing against our four key objectives, which are: make every day easier for busy families; change how we work by becoming a more digital enterprise; deliver results and operate with discipline; and be the most trusted retailer.", "Brett\u2019s going to take you through the financials, but before he does, I\u2019d like to highlight some of our accomplishments from this past year that are positioning us to win in the future.", "Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. It all starts with our associates. And I\u2019m pleased that in addition to increased wages, we deployed more sophisticated tools to assist our associates to meet the needs of customers. New technology and apps are providing real-time information to improve our in-stock levels and better manage inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp-store basis.", "We\u2019ve also invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today\u2019s retail environment. We expect to train more than 225,000 department managers and hourly supervisors by this fall. In fact, I recently visited a store in Morrisville, North Carolina, where they had reduced inventory so significantly that the backroom was empty enough for them to build a training academy there. These initiatives are paying off for our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier service and faster check-out times.", "Greg Foran and the team continue to innovate to improve the customer experience. In the last month, we opened two new Supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like scan-and-go, touch-screens where customers can access more items on Walmart.com, virtual item displays, and an integrated Health & Wellness section.", "We got quite a few experiments going on in the company these days and we\u2019re learning at a faster rate. We\u2019ve also been investing in price and customers are responding. We\u2019re confident the continued execution of our strategy will drive sustainable growth in traffic and sales.", "Shifting gears to our International segment, I\u2019m pleased to see the business delivering consistently solid sales results. While Walmex led the way this year, our performance was broad based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year and seven of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%.", "At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was over 7% this year and 14% on a two-year stack.", "In China, we announced an alliance with, and investment in, JD.com last summer, improving our e-commerce proposition and extending the reach of Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club brands to millions of new customers. We subsequently announced an increased ownership of JD.com to approximately 10%. And we recently furthered this relationship with the launch of an exclusive Walmart Global Imports Store on JD.com Worldwide, which provides Chinese customers access to thousands of products imported from Walmart stores from around the world.", "We also announced an investment in last mile delivery-company New Dada, enabling two-hour delivery service from nearly 70 Walmart locations. China is a key growth market for our company and we\u2019re proud of how we positioned the business to win.", "In the UK, we faced some challenges this past year and we\u2019re addressing these with urgency. We\u2019re encouraged comp store sales improved during the fourth quarter. I visited stores in the market a few weeks ago and the team has us pointed in the right direction. We spent considerable time looking at our international portfolio last year and we took some decisive action along the way.", "For example, our decisions to divest noncore businesses such as an apparel chain in Mexico and shopping malls in Chile were based not on the merits of their performance, rather their relevance to the portfolio. We must ensure that we focus on businesses that are core to what we do. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the consistently solid sales results in International. We have a strong business with good momentum.", "Moving to Sam\u2019s Club, I\u2019d like to start by thanking Roz Brewer for her leadership. Sam\u2019s Club comps improved each quarter during the year last year and she has positioned the business for further progress. With Roz\u2019s departure, we promoted John Furner to CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. John\u2019s been with the business since 1993, working in Walmart U.S., International, and most recently, as Sam\u2019s Chief Merchandising Officer. He brings a unique set of experiences and a deep understanding of our company. He\u2019s going to be a great leader for Sam\u2019s.", "We\u2019re pleased with our progress in technology at Sam\u2019s, including the national launch of scan-and-go. E-commerce continues to grow with direct-to-home and Club pickup. While we have more work to do to deliver the results we expect to achieve, we believe we\u2019re on the right track to win with members and accelerate growth.", "Finally, I\u2019d like to discuss our progress in e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. We continue to invest in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We\u2019re gaining traction and moving faster. We\u2019re the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top three online retailers by traffic and our Walmart app is among the top three apps in retail. We acquired Jet.com in the second half of last year and welcomed Marc Lore, the CEO of our U.S. e-commerce business. Marc is moving quickly.", "From a marketplace perspective, we now have over 35 million SKUs, more than quadrupling the number available at the beginning of the year. We recently announced free two-day shipping on millions of items with a minimum order of $35. And as you might expect, we\u2019ve seen a nice uptick in our e-commerce business since this launch. The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, gave us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise.", "We\u2019re also leveraging the strengths of Walmart and Jet to make both platforms better. I\u2019m excited about what\u2019s to come. I\u2019m really pleased by how Greg Foran and his team are working in tandem with Marc Lore and his team to deliver the convenient shopping our customers desire, no matter how they choose to shop. They will continue to partner closely to serve our customers seamlessly across our app, site and stores.", "Over the holidays, wait times were down for Pickup and we\u2019re adding more items to Pickup Today. Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day.", "In conclusion, as I step back and look at the retail landscape, customer expectations continue to change rapidly. They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We\u2019re moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future.", "According to Bain, Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores, and over half did so through mobile devices. And more than 70% of traffic to Walmart.com during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile. While e-commerce is growing rapidly customers continue to rely on brick and mortar formats.", "The Supercenter remains the best retail format in the world, and going forward, we will continue to leverage these unique assets, even more with initiatives like online grocery, in-store pickup and others. Rapid advances in technology mean we need to become more of a digital enterprise - and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.", "So in summary, we have a clear strategy we\u2019re executing against; we\u2019re uniquely positioned to deliver value unlike any other retailer through both physical and digital assets; we have momentum across the business which positions us well for the new fiscal year; and while we must do more, we believe we\u2019re on the right track as we work to be the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders.", "Now, I\u2019ll give you to Brett.", "Brett Biggs", "Good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart. We\u2019ve made strategic decisions revolving around the customer that will reposition the business for sustainable growth to win long term. We\u2019re moving with speed to provide customers with a better offer through stores, mobile and e-commerce. And we\u2019re confident this will drive value for shareholders. And, while going through this transformation, our financial strength serves as a great competitive advantage.", "For fiscal year 2017, there were a number of accomplishments, I\u2019ll highlight just a few. Constant currency net sales were up nearly 3%, a growth of $13.7 billion. Operating cash flow reached $31.5 billion, an all-time record for Walmart. E-commerce GMV growth accelerated throughout the year. Adjusted EPS of $4.32 exceeded our initial full-year guidance. GAAP EPS was $4.38. It has been a very successful year in a number of ways.", "Now, let\u2019s discuss the results in more detail, starting with the fourth quarter. Total revenue, excluding an unfavorable $2.6 billion currency impact, increased 3% to $133.6 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added $3.7 billion in net sales. It\u2019s important to note that currency impacts on net sales during the quarter were about $600 million higher than anticipated versus when we began the quarter, driven primarily by the depreciation of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar.", "Walmart U.S. delivered strong top-line performance with comp sales of 1.8%, exceeding guidance. International continued its steady constant currency top-line performance with another solid quarter, and Sam\u2019s Club comp sales of 2.4% were better than expected, with continued strength in e-commerce and omni-channel initiatives. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.30, which was near the upper-end of our guidance range.", "Walmart\u2019s consolidated gross profit margin increased 5 basis points in the quarter with expansion in both International and Sam\u2019s Club. Walmart U.S. gross margin declined in the quarter. I\u2019ll get into more detail on this in a moment. Total operating expenses increased 58 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology.", "In both this year and last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we adjusted for discrete items. These included $939 million in charges for store closures across all segments last year as well as $370 million for discontinued real estate projects and severance in the U.S. this year. For comparison purposes, excluding these discrete items for both years, operating expenses increased 97 basis points in the quarter. Now that we will be lapping the U.S. wage increases from fiscal year 2017, we would expect to slightly lever expenses in fiscal year 2018.", "I\u2019ll provide more details about operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce where we\u2019re changing rapidly and remaining laser-focused on our customers. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 15.5% and 17.5% respectively. Excluding Yihaodian, GMV increased 29.7%.", "Going forward, we plan to discuss e-commerce results a little differently from the past in order to give you a clearer view of our performance, particularly in the important U.S. market. Given the organizational framework changes over the past few months, we will no longer be discussing global e-commerce as we have in the past.", "Sam\u2019s Club e-commerce, and the various international e-commerce initiatives, will be discussed as appropriate within those segment discussions. As we discuss Walmart U.S. eCommerce, which is led by Marc Lore and represents the largest portion of our e-commerce effort, note that it includes all web-initiated transactions including those through Walmart.com such as ship to home, ship to store, pick up today, and online grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.", "We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. eCommerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively. Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pickup Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year.", "We are seeing the benefits of our e-commerce investments. During the holiday period, the e-commerce fulfillment network performed very well, supporting record volumes with on-time delivery rates that far exceeded last year. This network is also the backbone of the new free 2-day shipping promise with a $35 minimum order available at Walmart.com. Customers are responding well to this new offer, and ecommerce sales have strengthened since its launch on January 31.", "Looking ahead, you\u2019ll continue to see us make investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition. We\u2019re excited about the things we\u2019re doing, the speed at which we\u2019re doing them, and the work we still have to do.", "In the fourth quarter, we continued to make excellent progress on working capital, with $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and $8.7 billion in free cash flow. Working capital has been a focus for us all year. And I\u2019m really pleased with our discipline, particularly in managing inventory and payables.", "For the year, we generated $31.5 billion in operating cash flow and $20.9 billion of free cash flow. This was an increase in free cash flow of nearly $5 billion, or more than 30%, versus last year. This is a great testament to Walmart\u2019s financial strength. When you consider that we were able to reduce our net debt levels this year while also making strategic decisions to grow the business both organically and through M&A, including investments in stores, logistics, people and technology, it\u2019s a fantastic achievement.", "We accomplished this while also returning a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fact, over the past year, we returned $14.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As of the end of the fiscal year, we had used approximately $10.8 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization.", "Additionally, today we announced an increase in our annual dividend from $2 per share to $2.04 per share in fiscal 2018. We\u2019ve now increased our dividend for 44 consecutive years. We\u2019re proud of our track record of returning significant cash to shareholders, while investing in future growth.", "Let\u2019s now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. We\u2019re pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. with steady improvement in stores, strong growth from e-commerce and growing contributions from the rollout of Online Grocery. We\u2019ve now seen nine consecutive quarters of traffic growth in our stores. Clearly, we\u2019re gaining traction and it\u2019s exciting to see how customers are responding to our focus on saving them time and money.", "For the quarter, strong comp sales growth of 1.8% was driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment. We were particularly pleased with the positive comp in Grocery despite ongoing market deflation in food, which negatively impacted the Food comp by approximately 90 basis points.", "Throughout the 6-week holiday season, customers responded well to consistent everyday low prices and a simplified integrated multi-channel experience that enabled last-minute shopping so they could find the perfect item. Gross margin decreased 8 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise as well as lower logistics costs benefitted the margin rate, but were more than offset by the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the timing of post-holiday markdowns.", "We\u2019re entering the New Year in a very solid inventory position. For the year, Walmart U.S. gross margin increased 24 basis points. As a reminder, both fourth quarter and full-year comparisons included a $56 million impact last year related to store closures. Operating expenses increased 4.6% this quarter and 8.1% for the year, primarily due to the associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology and e-commerce.", "As I mentioned previously, in both this year and last year we adjusted for discrete items. This year\u2019s fourth quarter included a $249 million charge related to discontinued real estate projects. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter included $670 million in charges related to the impact of store closures. Excluding these adjustments, operating expenses would have increased 7.3% in the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the year.", "Walmart U.S. operating income declined 2.5% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the discrete items discussed earlier, Walmart U.S. operating income declined 10.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.2% for the year. The Walmart U.S. team continues to do a great job with inventory while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory declined 3.1%, with comp store inventory down 7.2%, despite strong sales growth.", "To wrap up Walmart U.S., we made a lot of progress this year in providing customers value and convenience. While sales have been slower than expected to start the year, which we believe is due in part to the delay in tax refunds versus last year, we expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017 to increase between 1% and 1.5%.", "Now, let\u2019s move to Walmart International. Walmart International continued its solid sales performance this quarter. While Walmex results were the strongest with comp sales growth of 7%, the solid international performance was fairly broad based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and six of those markets grew comps by more than 4%.", "For the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.1%, impacted by a $2.6 billion currency headwind. For the year, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.9%, impacted by an $11 billion currency headwind.", "From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income increased 3.8% on a constant currency basis. I\u2019d like to point out that there were a few items in the quarter that collectively had a negative impact to operating profit of approximately $100 million, primarily because of adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairments in certain markets, which were partially offset by the gain from the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile as mentioned last quarter.", "Operating income for the year increased 19.7% on a constant currency basis and increased 7.7% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results include the gain associated with the sale of Yihaodian and the items mentioned above.", "Let\u2019s now turn to some brief highlights of the key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our five major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.", "Let\u2019s begin with Walmex. Strong sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions, and countries with total sales growing nearly 9% in the quarter. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased approximately 8% and outpaced all divisions of ANTAD, including self-service, specialty, and department stores.", "In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 0.2%. According to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in traffic driving categories like food and consumables, and health and wellness.", "Turning to the UK, net sales declined 0.6% and comp sales declined 2.9% in the quarter. We have a lot of work to do in this market, but we\u2019re encouraged by some of the early signs of traction with improvements in the customer value proposition. In China, net sales grew 5.4% and comp sales increased 2.3%. Sales were solid across hypermarkets and Sam\u2019s Club. We\u2019re excited about the future of e-commerce in China.", "The strategic alliance with JD.com will continue to expand our presence throughout the country, and offer customers new and exciting products through our flagship sites on JD\u2019s platform. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with the consistent performance from our international portfolio and excited about the new fiscal year.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to Sam\u2019s Club. At Sam\u2019s Club, we\u2019re pleased with the efforts underway to transform the business. We\u2019re making progress in a number of areas, and we know we have to move faster to provide the value that members expect.", "During the quarter, top-line performance was driven by an increase in comp sales, excluding fuel, of 2.4%. Samsclub.com GMV was strong, increasing by 25%, and Club Pickup also performed well. Operating income, excluding fuel, declined 5.1% for the quarter. Investments in associate wages pressured expenses, along with charges related to the impairment of clubs.", "In addition, this year\u2019s fourth quarter included a $10 million discrete charge for discontinued real estate projects, while last year\u2019s fourth quarter included a $57 million discrete charge related to the impact of club closures. Excluding these discrete items, operating income would have declined 14.6% this quarter.", "For the year, net sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.8% to $53.3 billion. Operating income, excluding fuel, declined 7.3%. Looking ahead, for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%.", "With that, let\u2019s discuss guidance for the total company. At our October investor meeting, we guided that fiscal 2018 full-year EPS, based on currency rates at that time, would be relatively flat to adjusted full-year fiscal 2017 EPS, and we still expect that to generally be the case. However, since then, the U.S. Dollar has strengthened, in particular versus the Mexican Peso, which negatively impacts our Walmex projections on a U.S. Dollar basis.", "We also expect our tax rate next year to be higher than the rate for fiscal year 2017, which was positively impacted by transactions such as Yihaodian during the year. We expect fiscal 2018\u2019s tax rate to be around 32%, assuming no major changes to the tax environment in our major markets. As always, there can be variability from quarter to quarter.", "Certainly, we are aware of and engaged in the discussions around tax reform in the U.S. As more information comes to light, we will continue to provide updates if any of our assumptions were to materially change. When taking all this into consideration, we expect fiscal 2018 EPS to be in a range of $4.20 to $4.40 compared to fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.32. This assumes an expected currency impact of about $0.05 per share.", "As stated in October, we expect operating income to decline slightly in fiscal 2018, driven in part by continued strategic price investments, partially offset by a more disciplined approach to expenses. We would anticipate that EPS in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.90 to $1, which includes an expected currency impact of about $0.02 per share.", "Net sales, on a constant currency basis, are anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%. We expect the underlying stores business, in most parts of the world, to continue to deliver solid top line results along with increased growth in our e-commerce business. We\u2019re focused on driving strong efficient growth by opening fewer new stores overall, particularly in the U.S., while prioritizing comp sales and accelerating ecommerce growth, including the third-party marketplace.", "Based on current exchange rates, we would anticipate a currency impact on net sales of approximately $3 billion for the year. On a reported basis, we expect net sales growth of between 2% and 3%. There are a number of additional assumptions in this guidance today, including that economic conditions, and the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest markets remain generally consistent. Also, as indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions to be approximately $11 billion for fiscal year 2018.", "So in closing, I want to thank all of our great associates around the world for the progress we made as a company this past year.

This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is August 17, 2017.

Our annual Investment Community Meeting will be held in Northwest Arkansas on October 9 and 10. Registration will begin next week. Also, we will release [second] quarter earnings on Thursday, November 16.", "And now, I'd like to turn it over to Walmart\u2019s CEO, Doug McMillon.", "Douglas McMillon", "Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Our second quarter results were solid with continued topline momentum in the business. Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 1.8% and comp traffic 1.3%. We continue to gain traction in e-commerce with Walmart U.S. GMV up 67%.", "The U.S. store team has done a great job staying focused on providing a fast and easy customer experience while managing expenses and inventory. Customers are responding to the improvements we\u2019re making to deliver a seamless shopping experience that saves them time and money and that\u2019s exciting to see.", "In addition, Sam\u2019s Club delivered comp traffic growth of more than 2%. In International, nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and five of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. So overall, we\u2019re making progress across the business and feel good about where we are midway through the year.", "Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families. To accomplish this, we continue our transformation to become more of a digital enterprise that moves with speed and agility. I\u2019m encouraged by innovation in the business. We\u2019re testing associate delivery of walmart.com orders in a few stores and by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have approximately 100 automated pickup towers in stores across the U.S., where customers can pick up their orders within a matter of minutes.", "With Easy Reorder on walmart.com, a customer has visibility to their past in-store and online purchases. In a matter of seconds, they can easily repurchase the items they\u2019ve bought most frequently before and save the time it may have taken to make a weekly shopping list.", "Another example is our integrated back-to-school offering. Our dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than a million classrooms across the United States. They can find their own list by simply entering their zip code and quickly adding all the items from the school list to their basket.", "Then, they can choose whether to pick up the items at their local store or ship them to their home. It\u2019s a huge time-saver for busy families. If you haven\u2019t done your back-to-school shopping, you should definitely check this out. We have tests going on with digital endless aisle shopping, robotics and image analytics to scan aisles for outs and we\u2019re using machine learning to assist our merchants with pricing.", "Sam\u2019s Club members continue to provide great feedback on the convenience of Scan & Go and we\u2019ll be further expanding Scan & Go within Walmart U.S. this year. This quarter, we also enjoyed welcoming entrepreneurs from more than 500 small businesses to Bentonville to pitch their Made in the USA products to sell in our stores and online as part of our Investing in American Jobs Open Call in June.", "And last month, we released proposals for policy actions to address barriers to manufacturing growth here in the U.S. We\u2019re pleased to be making progress towards our goal of purchasing an additional $250 billion in products made, sourced or grown in the U.S. Customers want to buy products that are not only good for their families, but also for the people that made them.", "In e-commerce, customers are responding favorably to our expanded assortment, which surpassed 67 million SKUs on walmart.com. Our recent acquisitions, such as Moosejaw, Shoebuy and Bonobos, further improved our assortment, and have provided critical category expertise in higher margin categories like shoes and apparel.", "A couple of weeks ago, I was in Boston to meet with the Shoebuy team, which is now known as shoes.com. They were very engaged and really impressive. In addition, I was excited to visit with the Moosejaw team in Detroit in July. This talented group is thriving in their creative culture and it was great to hear what they\u2019re working on.", "We believe that we\u2019re uniquely positioned to grow and delight customers by providing the seamless shopping experience they desire. Having stores within 10 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population allows us to serve customers in ways that are most convenient for them.", "We\u2019ve seen strong results from the rollout of online grocery, which is now in more than 900 U.S. locations, and we\u2019re expanding this service in many of our markets around the world. Retail is constantly evolving and it\u2019s critical that we move even faster as the customer and competitive landscape continue to change.", "Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly, but before he does, I\u2019ll talk briefly about each area of the business. Let me start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 1.8% and comp traffic growth of 1.3%. It\u2019s exciting that sales growth is coming from across the business including stores, e-commerce and a combination of both.", "Under Greg Foran\u2019s leadership, the stores continue to perform well. The grocery business has really strengthened as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in five years. We\u2019re also pleased with the expense discipline as physical stores leveraged expenses for the second consecutive quarter. We\u2019ve done this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels.", "Store associates are using better technology and processes to perform their tasks and we\u2019re becoming more efficient. Our training programs are fueling this progress as well. This training is not only equipping associates for their current roles, but preparing them for promotion into roles with greater responsibility and pay. We\u2019ve now opened 175 training academies and expect to have 200 operating by the end of the year.", "In Walmart U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore and the team delivered another quarter of robust topline growth with GMV up 67%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com as customers are finding a broader assortment and more options to receive what they want at their convenience.", "They love not having to pay a membership fee to get Walmart\u2019s free two-day shipping on millions of items. And we\u2019re seeing a nice increase in customers receiving discounts for picking up non-store items at their local stores. Marc, Greg and their teams continue to make good progress in driving innovative solutions across the business and providing the seamless shopping experience customers\u2019 desire.", "Staying in the U.S., let\u2019s talk about Sam\u2019s Club. John Furner and team have improved execution, resulting in stronger comp traffic. Sam\u2019s Club had comp sales growth without fuel of 1.2% in the quarter led by 2.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased 23%.", "Overall, we\u2019re starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. Club Pickup continues to grow and I\u2019m excited about how we\u2019re leveraging clubs to serve members across multiple channels. We\u2019re also strengthening the assortment with exciting merchandise, including progress in fresh and with our private brand, Member\u2019s Mark, which is more than a $10 billion brand and growing.", "Outside the U.S., the Walmart International team, led by Dave Cheesewright, continued to deliver strong underlying results with nine of 11 markets posting positive comp sales and the segment leveraging expenses overall.", "Walmex continues to be the strongest International market with comp sales growth of more than 7% in the quarter. What\u2019s even more impressive is that this sales momentum is broad-based across all countries and regions.", "In China, our stores are improving and we launched Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club global flagship stores through our alliance with JD.com this quarter. In addition, more than 25% of Walmart stores in China now offer delivery of orders in less than one hour through the JD Daojia delivery platform.", "Moving to Canada, the business continues to perform well. The investments that we\u2019ve made in price are resonating with customers and contributing to market share gains in key traffic driving categories.", "We\u2019re also encouraged that the UK delivered positive comp sales. In June, I visited Asda to see the progress being made. Customers are responding to investments in price and store experience by visiting the stores more often and increasing their basket sizes. There\u2019s still much more to be done, but we\u2019re clearly headed in the right direction. While there, I visited stores as well as our Heston grocery-delivery fulfillment center. I was impressed by how the team is focused on not only improving grocery pick-up and delivery from stores, but also from fulfillment centers in higher-volume environments.", "So overall, the International segment has made steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce.", "In conclusion, we\u2019re encouraged with the solid first half results. We are uniquely positioned to deliver the seamless, fast, innovative and exciting shopping experience our customers desire. I\u2019m pleased with how we\u2019re equipping our associates to deliver it. I\u2019d like to thank our associates for their focus on serving customers in all the ways they choose to shop. It\u2019s making a difference. We have a clear strategy that we\u2019re executing against and good momentum across the business. Thanks for your continued interest in Walmart.", "Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Brett.", "Brett Biggs", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first half of the year. We are improving our competitive position with a differentiated offering by giving customers a better experience in our stores and more of what they want online.", "We are guided by our financial framework to deliver strong, efficient growth, operate with discipline and allocate capital strategically. We are making progress on each element, and it\u2019s through this lens that I\u2019ll discuss our results.", "Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.08 was at the top end of our guidance. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 1.8%, led by traffic growth of 1.3%. U.S. e-commerce GMV grew 67% and International delivered strong results.", "Two items significantly impacted EPS for the quarter. There was a $0.17 negative impact related to the premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. We also recorded a gain from the sale of our Suburbia business in Mexico, which benefited EPS by $0.05.", "It\u2019s also important to remember that during the second quarter of last year, the Company\u2019s EPS was positively impacted by $0.14 related to the gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business in China. Adjusted for these items, EPS increased approximately 1% year-over-year.", "Gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points during the quarter. Strategic price investments in key markets and the growing mix of our e-commerce business reduced the gross margin rate. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment.", "We continue to make some progress with expenses as we leveraged expenses in our U.S. stores, as well as in the International segment. As a Company, SG&A delevered by 10 basis points in the period, primarily due to increased technology spending and some impairment charges related to Sam\u2019s Club. We expect to slightly leverage expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. Operating with discipline is important to where we are going in the future. We have a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m encouraged by the focus I\u2019m seeing.", "Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first six months were solid at $11.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decreases in operating cash flow and free cash flow were due to an increase in incentive payments and the timing of other payments. We are still seeing improvement in working capital, but not as strong as the tremendous improvement last year, which also impacts the year-on-year comparability.", "In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 283 stores globally, and in the U.S. we further expanded our online grocery service to include more than 900 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 50 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income.", "Let\u2019s now move on to e-commerce. As a reminder, e-commerce results include all web-initiated transactions including those through walmart.com such as ship-to-home, ship-to-store, pick up today and online grocery, as well as transactions through jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.", "Walmart U.S. e-commerce again performed very well on the topline as GMV grew 67% and sales increased 60%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com, including Online Grocery, which is growing quickly. We are delivering growth through an improved customer value proposition that includes free two-day shipping on millions of items and Easy Reorder, as well as an expanded assortment, now with more than 67 million SKUs, an increase of more than 30% from the first quarter.", "With Easy Reorder, we\u2019re integrating both in-store and online purchases to provide customers with a single spot to view and repurchase the items they buy most frequently. Initiatives like these, along with everyday low prices, are the reasons why customers are choosing Walmart in greater numbers. As a reminder, we\u2019ll begin to lap the jet.com acquisition in the third quarter.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. delivered another quarter of solid comp sales, increasing 1.8%, led by growth in customer traffic of 1.3%. On a two-year stacked basis, comp sales were up 3.4% and comp traffic increased 2.5%. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and the 11th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic.", "The grocery business continued to improve as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in five years, led by strong customer traffic and a return of slight market inflation in food, excluding our own price investments. All formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 70 basis points to the segment.", "Keep in mind the e-commerce sales contribution includes not only purchases that are shipped to a customer\u2019s home, but also omni-channel transactions fulfilled in stores, such as Online Grocery and Pickup Today. Gross margin rate declined five basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise benefited the margin rate but was more than offset by the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business, as well as continued investments in price.", "Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 13 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn\u2019t leverage expenses for the overall segment, we did leverage in the stores for the second straight quarter. Service levels remained high and our associates are doing a great job of being more efficient through improved training and by utilizing upgraded technology.", "Operating income increased 2.2% in the quarter, which is the second straight quarterly increase. Managing inventory has been a key focus for the U.S. business, and the team continues to do a fantastic job in this area. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 3.8%, while in-stock levels remained high.", "We\u2019re pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. With the third quarter underway, the back-to-school season is in full swing, and we\u2019re providing more options for customers to save time and money in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to Walmart International. Walmart International continued to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered strong underlying results. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2.5% and decreased 1% on a reported basis. Keep in mind, the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $520 million in the period when compared to last year.", "The good performance in the quarter was fairly broad-based, and results at Walmex were particularly strong with comp sales growing more than 7%. Nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales, including in the U.K., and five of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. As a reminder, the timing of Easter benefited our results for the second quarter.", "Operating income declined by 2% on a constant currency basis and 7.8% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, there were a few items from international affecting year-over-year performance related to divestitures. The net impact from these divestitures benefited operating income by $415 million this year and $513 million last year in constant currency.", "Excluding these items, operating income grew 5.2% on a constant currency basis. We delivered these results even as we continued to make strategic investments to enhance the shopping experience both in-store and online in several of our major markets. The attention to operating discipline allowed us to leverage expenses in the period, even as we made important investments.", "Let\u2019s now turn to some highlights from key markets. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes detailed information on our four major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.", "Let\u2019s begin with Walmex, where momentum in sales continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales grew 7.2%. In Mexico, comp sales increased more than 15% on a two-year stacked basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service.", "In Canada, net sales increased 3.4%, and comp sales increased 2.5%. We further improved our price position against competitors, which contributed to market share gains in key traffic driving categories such as food and consumables. Inventory was also a focus, as the team reduced overall levels even as sales increased.", "Turning to the UK, net sales increased 3.9%, and comp sales increased 1.8%. Customers responded to investments in the value proposition, and we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket.", "In China, net sales increased 2.5%, and comp sales increased 0.6%. Previously, we highlighted our decision to reduce the mix of bulk sales of certain items in our stores, and while we saw a negative impact to topline results, we believe it was the right decision. Results for the quarter were primarily driven by momentum in the fresh and consumables categories. Additionally, we had good performances with local festivals and holidays.", "From an e-commerce perspective, we continued to expand our offering through the alliance with JD.com. We now have 134 Walmart stores across 18 cities that have joined the JD Daojia platform, which offers delivery of orders in less than one hour.", "Moving on to Sam\u2019s Club, comp sales without fuel increased 1.2% in the period, led by traffic growth of 2.1%. We\u2019re serving members across multiple channels, and our e-commerce initiatives produced strong results with 80 basis points of contribution to comp sales and year-over-year growth of 29% or Club Pickup.", "Operating income decreased in the period primarily due to a charge of about $50 million as a result of impairments of certain assets and the decision to close four underperforming clubs. The team is moving quickly to execute on their priorities of people, products and digital, and we\u2019re starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win.", "We believe good growth opportunities exist in the club channel, and we know we have to do more to capture greater share in this space. We\u2019re laser focused on our members and how we can serve them in new and exciting ways. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales without fuel to increase between 1% and 1.5%.", "With that, let\u2019s talk about guidance. We\u2019re pleased with our first half performance. Given our results to-date, combined with our expectations for the balance of the year, we now expect full-year adjusted EPS to be $4.30 to $4.40, which includes a range of $0.90 to $0.98 for the third quarter. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full-year.", "The initial guidance for full-year EPS assumed a negative currency impact of about $0.05 per share, but we now expect the EPS impact from currency will be less given current exchange rates. We continue to assume a full-year effective tax rate around 32%. As with all guidance, this assumes the economic conditions in key markets remains relatively consistent.", "Overall, we\u2019re doing what we said we would do, executing our plan and delivering good results. I continue to be excited about where we\u2019re heading as a Company and how we\u2019re improving our customer\u2019s lives.", "As I close today, let me say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the work you do every day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host Steve Schmitt with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Steve Schmitt.", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Walmart's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results. Joining us on today's call are Walmart President and CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, Brett Biggs. Doug and Brett will have some opening remarks in a minute, and then we'll take your questions. We'll do our best to get to as many of you as possible.", "We're excited to be hosting this call today. You may have seen in our press release announcing this call that we've made a process change to have a live earnings call with executives in conjunction with our fourth quarter results going forward.", "It feels appropriate that we share our thoughts as we wrap up one year and begin another. Also, this timing is well spaced from our June and October meetings. We plan to follow our typical earnings release process for other quarters during our fiscal year.", "Now before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Please review our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com.", "And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon.", "Doug McMillon", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We just completed an exciting year with solid fourth quarter results and continued momentum in the business. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew approximately 3% both in the quarter and for the full year. We reached more than $500 billion in revenue for the fiscal 2018 for the first time as a company.", "For the quarter, Walmart U.S. delivered strong comp sales growth of 2.6% due primarily to improved comp traffic growth in stores of 1.6%. Strength was broad-based across merchandising categories, formats and regions, and holiday sales were solid. In addition, comp store inventory declined again for the 11th consecutive quarter so we're well positioned as we begin the year.", "Sam's Club comps improved to 2.4%, and in International, 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales. So overall, we were pleased with most aspects of the quarter and confident in the foundational aspects of the business as we enter this new fiscal year.", "Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales growth in the fourth quarter was 23%, down from 50% in the third quarter. The majority of this slowdown was expected as we fully lapped the Jet acquisition, as well as created a healthier long-term foundation for holiday. A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth.", "Overall, we finished the year with eCommerce sales growth of more than 40%, so we feel better about the year than the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect eCommerce growth to increase from the fourth quarter level as we enter the New Year with about 40% growth for the year.", "We're confident in our strategy to transform the company, and we continue to be guided by four key objectives: make every day easier for busy families, change how we work, deliver results and operate with discipline and be the most trusted retailer.", "We're accelerating innovation in the business to make shopping faster and easier for our customers. Creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. We made good progress this past year to save busy families time and money, and we'll do more.", "By becoming stronger at mobile and leveraging digital capabilities, we improved in-store experiences, including our pharmacy and money services areas. We enabled Easy Reorder online. We're making the checkout experience easier with Scan & Go and also digitizing the returns process.", "We made acquisitions to improve our online assortment, and we're partnering with others like Google and JD in new ways. We're expanding Online Grocery in the U.S. and around the world and broadening our delivery capabilities in the U.S., China and other international markets.", "It's really all about providing more convenience for customers. Customers that shop across all channels are important to us. As we said in October, U.S. customers that shop us in-store and online spend nearly twice as much as customers that only shop with us in stores. Their loyalty to Walmart strengthens overall.", "Online Grocery customers are a great example as they spend more with us in total once they start using the service. So we'll lean in this year by nearly doubling the number of Online Grocery locations in the U.S.", "We're also becoming more efficient by changing the way we work, including leveraging technology to equip and empower our associates to be successful. They now have better information, tools and training.", "Finally, we're always striving to earn and maintain trust. We're focused on not only helping our customers save money and live better but also on creating shared value for our business and the communities we serve.", "In his remarks, Brett will go over the financials and guidance. This will include an overview of the benefits of tax reform and the strategic choices we're making to further strengthen our business.", "Tax reform gives us the opportunity to accelerate plans for the U.S. You may have seen our announcement last month about investing some of the proceeds in better wages and benefits for more than 1 million U.S. hourly associates. We'll also continue to lower prices for customers, improve technology in our business and accelerate grocery delivery in the United States.", "Now let's get into more details for the segments, and I'll start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong year of top line growth, and we're seeing signs that the productivity loop is turning. In our stores, we're making shopping easier and equipping associates to serve customers more efficiently.", "In the fourth quarter, we took steps to restructure our store leadership teams and corporate support areas to be more nimble. We're becoming more efficient, and it's contributing to the expense leverage that physical stores have delivered all year.", "Beginning this week, we increased the U.S. starting hourly wage rate to $11. We're also proud to announce adoption benefits for associates that went into effect earlier this month in addition to expanded paid parental leave for all associates that will take effect in March. Investing in our associates will help us attract and retain talent in the future.", "In addition, we've invested in nearly 200 training academies that have further developed the retail skills of more than 250,000 associates. So our stores are executing better. We\u2019re innovating more. We\u2019re lowering prices and customers are responding with higher sales and traffic. As I mentioned earlier this has also been a year of good progress in ecommerce. We launched free 2-day shipping on Walmart.com, and customers continue to love Online Grocery pickup. We're expanding our test of same-day and next-day delivery, and our Walmart.com assortment has grown to nearly 75 million SKUs.", "Acquisitions like Bonobos and ModCloth bring unique, private-branded products to our shopping experience. In addition, partnerships like the agreement with Lord & Taylor will help create specialty experiences that complement our own assortment with more brands customers want.", "Jet.com complements Walmart.com nicely. Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, is and has been the key driver of our eCommerce growth and that will continue. The Jet brand over indexed with higher-income, urban, millennial customers when we made the acquisition, and we intend to build on that strength going forward.", "The cost to acquire a new customer on a nationwide basis is cheaper with the Walmart brand so we've been investing more in Walmart.com on a national basis and reducing marketing investment in Jet, except in certain urban markets.", "Due to this change, Jet will not grow as quickly as it did in early days but it will be well positioned where we've chosen to focus the brand. We'll continue to evaluate ourselves on the total U.S. eCommerce growth number.", "Moving to Sam's Club. You'll remember that we made a decision to close 63 Sam's Club locations in the U.S. We've talked about transforming the Sam's business, and part of this transformation means managing the club portfolio to include clubs that are both financially viable and that fit within the strategic framework for the future.", "Closing stores and clubs is difficult. It's obviously difficult for our impacted associates, and there is never a good time to do with. John and the Sam's team are working to place as many of them as possible at nearby locations. These closures will help us run a healthier business.", "We also took additional steps recently to align resources around the initiatives that are most important to our members. We enhanced the value of the Plus membership with a free shipping proposition. We also made the decision to remove tobacco from certain clubs.", "In addition, Sam's Club changed its merchandising structure to encourage more expertise and continuity in buying roles. The strategy continues to come to life, and we're already seeing progress.", "Our International team continues to deliver consistently solid results. While Walmex led the way this year, our good performance was broad-based. In fact, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year, and 5 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 5%.", "To give a little more detail, Walmex comp store sales increased 6% this year, and we're really proud of how the team is combining our stores with eCommerce to deliver a convenient, seamless shopping experience.", "As we mentioned in our October Investment Community Meeting, there's more work to be done on the portfolio. We've set priorities, focused our - on our North American core and key growth markets, including China and India.", "During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to wind down the Brazil first-party eCommerce business. We always want our resources aimed at winning in the most strategic places.", "So overall, the International segment continues to make steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and eCommerce.", "In conclusion, we have a plan that leverages our unique assets and strengths to benefit customers and shareholders. It's resulting in momentum. We're being disciplined about cost and capital, and we're acting faster as a company but are pushing to increase our speed.", "Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Brett, you want to pick up there?", "Brett Biggs", "All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year. We've made progress on several fronts, and we have good momentum across the business as we enter the new fiscal year.", "Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.33 and $4.42 for the fiscal year. GAAP EPS of $0.73 for the fourth quarter and $3.28 for the fiscal year was negatively impacted by a number of discrete items totaling $0.60 and $1.14, respectively.", "Most of these items position the business for more efficient growth going forward, including closing 63 Sam's Clubs locations to create a more viable fleet and healthier business.", "In addition, we discontinued real estate projects in the U.S., following our decision to open fewer stores and clubs, with greater emphasis on comp sales and eCommerce growth.", "We also completed our third bond tender of the year to take advantage of more favorable interest rates. A full reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included in today's earnings release.", "During the quarter, we had additional EPS headwind related to some smaller unplanned items and expenses we incurred as we pulled forward initiatives in order to take advantage of a higher tax deduction. These were only partially offset by slightly more favorable currency exchange rates.", "Before we get to the results, I'd like to highlight some accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue surpassed $500 billion for the first time and increased $15.1 billion or 3.1% in constant currency.", "Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 2.1%, the highest growth rate since fiscal 2009, led by traffic growth of 1.4%. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales grew 44%, reaching $11.5 billion. We made good progress on expenses, especially in Walmart U.S. stores and International. Without the discrete items mentioned in arriving at adjusted EPS, we would have leveraged expenses.", "Adjusted EPS increased 2%. Operating cash flow was $28.3 billion. The company returned $14.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and strong working capital improvements continued.", "Let's move on to the quarter. We delivered a solid quarter to finish out the year as constant-currency revenue grew 3.1% to $135.1 billion. Comp sales were positive in all 3 segments with growth of 2.6% and 2.4% at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively.", "On a 2 year stack basis, comp sales accelerated for the third consecutive quarter for both of these segments at 4.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Even more encouraging is that these results were driven by strong in-store traffic. International grew net sales 2.8% in constant currency, led by strength at Walmex.", "Consolidated gross profit margin declined 61 basis points. Approximately two thirds of the decline was driven by price investments in certain markets and the mix effect from our growing eCommerce business. The remaining one third was driven by Sam's Club inventory markdowns associated with closures and other International items, including the wind down of our Brazil first-party eCommerce business. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we'll continue to make investments that will pressure the rates some but not to the extent of this quarter.", "Similar to our full year results, SG&A and operating income were significantly impacted by charges for discrete items. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have decreased less than 1%.", "Let's move on to U.S. eCommerce. As Doug mentioned, the slowdown in growth during the quarter was a bit more than we planned. Looking ahead, we have a number of new initiatives planned for the year. We expect eCommerce growth to increase from the Q4 level as we enter the New Year, with about 40% growth for the year.", "Now let's discuss the results for each operating segment during the quarter, beginning with Walmart U.S. The U.S. team continued to produce strong top line growth. Customers are responding well to our everyday low prices and the convenience we're providing through a variety of initiatives. All store formats had positive comps, and we saw strength in key categories with increased customer traffic and units.", "During the fourth quarter, comp sales increased 2.6%, led by traffic growth of 1.6%. Comp sales performance on a 2 year stack was the best in 8 years, and eCommerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to the segment.", "Gross margin rate declined 50 basis points in the quarter due primarily to price investments, higher transportation expenses and mix effects from our growing eCommerce business.", "Also, the team leveraged operating expenses slightly even when considering adjustments for discrete items in both current and prior year periods. Overall, we like the momentum we see in Walmart U.S. Our strategy is working, and customers are responding.", "International had another solid quarter. The teams around the world have done a nice job of delivering top line growth through a focus on price as well as strength in fresh and private brands. Growth was broad-based across the markets, and results at Walmex were particularly strong.", "Overall, net sales in constant currency increased 2.8% and grew 6.7% on a reported basis. Changes in currency rates benefited net sales by approximately $1.2 billion. It's also important to note the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of about $400 million when compared to last year.", "From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income decreased 16.1% in constant currency and 10.9% on a reported basis. As detailed in this morning's release, restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets negatively impacted operating income. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-over-year.", "Overall, we're pleased with the consistent performance we've seen from our International business, and we feel good about the year ahead.", "Sam's delivered solid top line results. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.4%, led by traffic increase of 4.3%. Tobacco negatively impacted comp sales by 120 basis points. ECommerce growth was solid and contributed 80 basis points to the comp.", "Also in the eCommerce space, the team recently announced the free shipping offer from SamsClub.com for Plus members. The team is moving quickly and making decisions that we believe will benefit our members and the business over time.", "I'll close today with guidance. As always, we have a number of assumptions on our guidance, including the economic conditions and the tax and regulatory landscape, and our largest markets remain generally consistent.", "You'll recall that we issued fiscal year 2019 guidance last October at our meeting for the investment community. Since that time, we made some decisions and assessed other potential opportunities to accelerate investments, particularly - primarily as a result of tax reform.", "Let me start with our expectations related to tax reform. Our estimates are based on available information and our current analysis regarding the application of the new law.", "We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be 24% to 26% compared with our previous guidance prior to tax reform of 32.5%. Our global blended rate is higher than the new U.S. federal rate due to state taxes and taxes we pay outside of the U.S.", "In terms of cash flow, in addition to the income statement benefit from a lower U.S. tax rate, we expect an additional cash tax benefit due primarily to accelerated depreciation.", "Including all aspects of tax reform, we currently expect a cash benefit of around $2 billion for the year. Additionally, we are reviewing our cash positions overseas in light of the new law but have not made any decisions regarding potential repatriation.", "Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing on our business and other growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend, as evidenced by the increase we announced today. And we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program back in October.", "We've consistently talked about investing in the business for the long term while balancing near-term results. As tax reform is taking shape, we took the opportunity to step back and assess various aspects of the business, including potential investments. We will continue to be aggressive but thoughtful to ensure we win long term.", "We recently announced some additional investments related to increased wages, training and benefits for our associates in the U.S. In addition to that, we'll look to accelerate investments in our customers through lower prices, and we'll make investments in technology, supply chain and eCommerce to better position the company for the future. We'll also continue to prioritize winning with customers in our grocery and fresh business, ensuring we make shopping with us simple and at a great value.", "At the October meeting, Doug talked about some decisions we had in the Q, but it was too early to comment further at that time. During the quarter we took several actions, including: a wind down of the first-party eCommerce business in Brazil, the closure of 63 Sam's Clubs locations in the U.S. and the decision to remove tobacco from certain locations at Sam's. These decisions impact the guidance we gave in October, particularly in regards to total sales growth, so I'll quantify the impacts and compare back to the October guidance.", "Let's first talk about Brazil eCommerce. We expect a headwind to sales of approximately $500 million related to the wind down of the first-party portion of the business. In terms of profit, the benefit of fewer operating losses will be largely offset by onetime costs associated with the wind down.", "As for Sam's, we anticipate a negative impact to sales of about $6.3 billion related to the decisions to close clubs and remove tobacco from certain locations. Additionally, recall that we sold our Suburbia business in Mexico in the second quarter of last year, and this will create a headwind in the first quarter of this year.", "The combined top line impact of these items will negatively impact consolidated net sales growth by about 140 basis points. And as a result, we now expect net sales growth to range between 1.5% and 2% in constant currency. Adjusting for these changes, this growth compares to the guidance of at or above 3% that we provided in October.", "As for comp sales, we expect growth at Walmart U.S. of at least 2%. Sam's Club comps excluding fuel and tobacco should range between 3% and 4% and flat to negative 1% when including the impact of reduced tobacco sales. We expect International total net sales growth to be around 3% in constant currency.", "Our October guidance for fiscal 2019 also included expectations for expense leverage, relatively steady operating income margin and EPS growth of around 5%. The incremental investments mentioned earlier will pressure operating expenses more than anticipated in October.", "On a consolidated basis, we still expect to slightly leverage expenses but not to the extent we originally planned. Excluding the impact of the reduction in Sam's Club sales, leverage would be stronger. Overall, cost management is continuing to improve across the business, and we remain pleased with the progress.", "As for operating margin, we expect consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 4.3% to 4.4% in constant currency, resulting in a low single-digit percentage decrease in operating income versus operating income this past year, adjusted for the discrete items.", "Considering all of these items, we expect full year EPS to be in a range of $4.75 and $5, an increase of 7% to 13% compared with adjusted EPS of $4.42 in fiscal 2018. This range represents an increase from the guidance given in October.", "Additional guidance is included in the materials we issued this morning, so please reference these documents as you analyze our outlook. Going forward, we're moving to an annual guidance framework with quarterly updates as warranted.", "We considered a number of factors when making this decision, including management's long-term view of the business, the transformation of the business, the investment time horizon of many of our shareholders and the uncertainty of the timing of investments during the year.", "There could be fluctuations within the quarters, but we believe EPS growth will be relatively consistent across the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.", "So with that, I'll close by saying thank you to our shareholders for your support of Walmart. And now I'd be happy, along with Doug, to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.", "Simeon Gutman", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. And thanks for doing the call. My first question is on the e-com growth in the fourth quarter relative to next year. You mentioned some operational issues. Can you elaborate and then talk about what gives you confidence that the e-com run rate will accelerate heading into next year?", "Doug McMillon", "Hi, Simeon. This is Doug. Happy to elaborate a bit more. First of all, I would say that, as we try to communicate in our remarks, most of that was expected and planned. As we came around the fourth quarter and looked at what we did last year promotionally, realized we're lapping Jet for sometime now, we've expected a lower growth rate.", "The minority of the miss that was more operational in nature that we're referring to is related to the fact that, during the seasonal spikes, seasonal inventory, think electronics, toys, gifts, things like that, came into our fulfillment centers and there was enough cube that it harmed our basic in-stock on more everyday items, and our basic in-stock for eCommerce suffered as a result.", "So we're learning how to deal with higher volumes and learning how to deal with a higher peak than what we had previously. But again, that was the minority of the issue. Most of this was planned and in our numbers.", "Brett Biggs", "And Simeon, just to remind -- this is Brett. As a reminder, in October, we've guided to $11.5 billion of revenue for Walmart U.S. eCommerce, and that's just about where we came in for the year.", "Simeon Gutman", "Okay. And then if I can ask my follow-up. Brett, you mentioned you were doing the comparison with pre- and post-October guidance. So I think at that point, EBIT was supposed to be up maybe low single digits, and now it's going to be down a little bit.", "Can you just tell us if the entirety of that change is tax reform spending? Or is any part of it reflective of higher cost in the business in some form or another?", "Brett Biggs", "Yes, Simeon. I still remain -- feel good about the cost management in the business, and we're making progress there. When we've given guidance back in October, we've talked about an operating income range that would be similar to where we had kind of been.", "So as we step back and we looked at everything, we've decided to make these investments that we talked about, and that's all included in the guidance that's there today.", "And so it's -- that one is a little bit tougher to compare pre and post, but when you look at the investments that we're making, that is the difference. But I feel good about the overall cost management side of the business.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Simeon. Rob, next question please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robbie Ohmes", "Good morning, guys. ", "Doug McMillon", "Hey, Robbie.", "Robbie Ohmes", "So a follow-up on Simeon's just - and then on gross margin. So I just wanted to get clarity on the eCommerce growth outlook. So the first question is just, where -- the confidence in the eCommerce growth going back to roughly 40%, are you seeing that already in the first quarter? And sort of what is the difference to get back to the 40% versus the fourth quarter?", "And then could you tie that into the gross margin outlook you gave? Maybe some thoughts on where you might be investing in price. And also, I think the guidance, Brett, was that gross margin rate would be down less in fiscal '19. So if eCommerce is going to reaccelerate to a sort of 40% type growth rate, why wouldn't we see more pressure on gross margin? Thanks.", "Doug McMillon", "Thanks, Robbie. This is Doug. I'll start with the eCommerce question, and Brett can elaborate on it too if he would like to. We're not expecting the first quarter to go all the way to 40%. We think it'll start to ramp up from the fourth quarter to approximately 40% for the year. We're going to continue expanding our eCommerce business as it relates to food. Online Grocery's ramping up.", "As we've said, we're going to almost double the number of locations that do Online Grocery. That will drive eCommerce growth to a certain level. And then on top of that, we've got the activity planned for both Walmart.com and Jet. So we've got an investment plan there.", "We have an assortment plan and other innovations, as you saw last year, that will be occurring as we go through the year. So we think by the time we get to the end of the year and look back at the number for the total year, it will be approximately 40%.", "Brett Biggs", "Yes. Robbie, I'll comment more on gross margin. As we've talked about before, there's a number of things that impact gross margin. Price, shrink, transportation expenses, all of that go into that. And so as we've said before, it's tough to look at gross margin quarter-to-quarter. I think you have to look at it on a longer base. And what I'd said in my comments is that we expect that next year's decrease won't be what we saw in the fourth quarter.", "And if you look at where we've guided operating income and the comment we've made about slightly leveraging expenses, you can kind of back into what -- a bit of what we're expecting from a gross margin perspective. So we do take into consideration the mix of the business.", "We'll continue to be aggressive but thoughtful on pricing, where we invest, how we invest, both in stores and eCommerce, but we'll be thoughtful about those investments.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Robbie. Rob, next question please?", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.", "Karen Short", "Hi, thanks. Just two clarifications and then a bigger picture question. So on the gross margin, the comment that you expect next year's decrease won't be where you were in the fourth quarter, is that including or excluding Sam's? So is that the 61 basis points or around 40?", "Brett Biggs", "That's all in next year as far as gross margin rate.", "Karen Short", "Okay. And then I know you kind of said that your comments on earnings growth will be - the cadence growth rate will be similar throughout the year. Is that fair to say, for U.S. comps, you don't really expect a lot of volatility throughout the year?", "Brett Biggs", "Yes. I don't expect a lot of volatility throughout the year. Overall, for the year, we expect it to be 2% or higher, but I don't expect a lot of volatility during the year, Karen.", "Karen Short", "Okay. And then I guess I wanted to just turn to the color in terms of acquiring customers on Walmart.com versus Jet.com. Is it -- I guess, is it fair to say then, since you're switching to, I guess, a lower-cost customer to look to acquire, is it fair to say that eCommerce losses have kind of bottomed? Is it still consistent with what you previously said that eCommerce losses have bottomed in '18?", "And then I guess, bigger picture, is there any color on Jet? Like do you feel as good as you have always felt in terms of the prospects for Jet and this is just pure math, it just makes more sense to go after the Walmart.com customer?", "Doug McMillon", "Yes. Karen, this is Doug. Great questions. I think as we look at this year, we're trying to preserve flexibility as we go through the year to decide what level of investment we want to make in eCommerce as we go month to month and quarter-to-quarter. It's possible we may choose to lose a little more in eCommerce this year than we did last year, but generally speaking, we think it'd be about the same level of losses.", "Our visibility into picking costs, shipping costs, margin rates, the cost to acquire a customer and how the different cohorts are behaving as we make the marketing investments is really improving, and I'm excited about all the levers that are there. And we're -- we again are trying to preserve some flexibility to make choices as we go through.", "As it relates to the brands, Walmart is just a really well-known brand for value throughout the country. And when you get into Oklahoma and Texas, in the middle of the country, it just makes a lot of sense to invest in that brand rather than investing higher incremental dollar to introduce a brand that's less familiar.", "Now on the other hand, if you take the New York metropolitan area as one example, not the only one, the Jet brand is really well known, has a lot of traction, has appeal, as we mentioned earlier, to urban, millennial, higher-income customers. So it's really just a positioning choice, and that choice was made before we made the acquisition.", "I think we wanted to leave our minds open as we acquire Jet to make the best choices about how we use the brand and where we position it. But our thoughts before we bought it that basically become confirmed, that Jet plays a great role reaching parts of the country and selling, in some cases, some brands that are not ready to sell on Walmart.com.", "So I think what you'll see is Jet will go through a period of adjustment and then it'll start to grow again in the future but focused on specific markets and opportunities, whereas Walmart will be the broad-based, big part of the business, and growing it will be a priority.", "Karen Short", "Thank you.", "Steve Schmitt", "Rob, next question please?", "Unidentified Analyst", "And if I could just ask\u2026", "Steve Schmitt", "We\u2019re limited to just one question, just to get through as many as we can, please. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.", "Oliver Chen", "Hi. Thank you. Regarding eCommerce and the road ahead, what are your thoughts on profitability and the smart baskets and pricing and how you're thinking about grocery pickup as well as supply chain in the context of bricks post clicks?", "And would love your thoughts on eCommerce M&A and on correlated assets as you've been quite creative about thinking about how to build this business over time? Thank you.", "Doug McMillon", "Yes. Let's break it into pieces. This is Doug. I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. supercenters. Our comp traffic's up. We're in a really strong foundation there, playing more offense than before. So the big part of the company is in good shape and foundationally strong.", "Now we've got Sam's to a point where it's starting to get repositioned. We'll see more traction and improvement in that part of our business. Internationally, the big businesses at Walmex, Canada and even the U.K., which is a big part of our International business, has been stronger lately. So kind of those big platforms are there and stronger, and I wouldn't want us to spend this whole call talking about a smaller part of the business, although it's of vital strategic importance.", "So now let's click to eCommerce. In the U.S. specifically, and don't forget we've got food eCommerce opportunities around the world, but let's focus just on the U.S. for a second, we've got this tremendous advantage of having the stores and the supply chain that put us within 90% of U.S. customers within 10 miles. So you can build on that to build a strong food eCommerce business, and that's what we're doing.", "Learning how to pick in-store enables Online Grocery. Learning how to pick in store enables delivery, which we'll continue to expand and learn more about as we go through the year.", "Now let's click to the part of the eCommerce business that doesn't come out of our stores. That's where you get into eCommerce fulfillment centers, the opportunity to leverage smart cart to build an eCommerce basket, not just selling eaches. Like selling a television at cost for Cyber Mondays, not all that exciting as it relates to being a way to make money, but driving baskets on eCommerce is.", "So you'll start to see smart cart functionality move over to Walmart. You'll see us continue to make assortment improvements to bring in new brands, be more increasingly open to not only the Jet brand but the Walmart brand.", "So as that happens, your mix starts to change, and you're selling a basket and a more profitable basket. To do that, there are times when an acquisition makes sense because it accelerates the improvement that you can make in your assortment.", "It might take us longer, for example, to do it organically. There's so many suppliers and so many brands to acquire to get on the platform. So some of the acquisitions we've made have been specifically aimed at assortment, and I would expect that some of that will continue.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Oliver. Rob, next question please?", "Operator", "Next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Chris Horvers", "Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up question on gross margin. So can you talk about the 60 basis point decline in the U.S.? Where was that relative to your expectations going into the quarter?", "And then what aspects of those buckets moderate as you look to the upcoming year such that the gross margin degradation improves? Thank you.", "Brett Biggs", "Yes. Chris, this is Brett. As we mentioned earlier, so the 60 basis points you mentioned was total company, and there is about third of that, that was related to the Sam's Club closures as well as the Brazil eCommerce shutdown and a couple of other things inside of International. So it was -- about third of that was onetime type items.", "In the U.S., again, there's just so many things that go into margin in a quarter, pricing, shrink, transportation costs. And so quarter-to-quarter, I think, gross margin is challenging to look at and try to compare it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We're going to continue to invest in price. We've been investing in price.", "As you know, we always invest in price. But we've been investing in price over the last couple of years, and so we're now 2 years into that. So there's just different pieces of it. I don't want to get into specific pieces from a competitive standpoint, but we feel confident that the gross margin decrease that we will see next year will be less than what we've seen in the fourth quarter.", "Doug McMillon", "Chris, this is Doug. I'll just add that I think we're getting better at managing our price investment considering all the other investments that we're making. So Brett and I and the management team are watching eCommerce growth rates, eCommerce profitability, store traffic counts and making decisions in a relatively fast cycle on how much price to invest and where to invest it, and we're monitoring what happens when we do that.", "So we're just going to calibrate this thing as we go through the year. It's one of our big levers, and we're excited about the fact that the investments we've made in the past are driving traffic and starting to get this productivity moving, which is ultimately what we're after.", "And one of the metrics that I get excited about and have been for some time now because the team's doing such a good job is inventory. For us to be down in comp store inventory again for the 11th consecutive quarter while shelf in-stock is going up is awesome and remarkable.", "And the cash flow benefits and the other benefits are flowing through to the overall business. So on price, we're being thoughtful, we're being strategic. And we'll manage margins just like we do the other parts of the P&L, a quarter at a time, balancing short term and long-term.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Chris. Rob, next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "Good morning. Thanks a lot of taking my question. Several years ago, Walmart was ahead of the curve, investing in stores, e-com, in price, and you really saw a gain in terms of market share and your outperformance relative to a lot of other retailers. Now it seems like some of those share gains may be slowing a bit.", "So do you think you're seeing diminishing returns on your investments and you'll have to make even greater investments in order to outperform at the rate that you have been versus others?", "Doug McMillon", "No. Michael, this is Doug. That's not my perception, and the data doesn't support that. When you look at our share numbers, we feel really good about them, and not only the dollar share numbers but also units. I'm specifically thinking of the U.S. business in my comment. But the tonnage moving through our stores is increasing, and I don't feel a trend shift there.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Michael. Rob, next question please?", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.", "Scott Mushkin", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And before I ask it, I concur, our data does show you guys continue to gain a lot of market share, particularly in food. But that's kind of where I want to go with my question. If we fast-forward, guys, 5 years from now and we see a substantial, I think about 60% -- 67% of your sales are either pharmacy or food, and a good portion of that becomes click-and-collect or even maybe delivered to the home, how should we think about Walmart's profitability? And have you guys done a lot of thinking on that? Thanks.", "Doug McMillon", "Yes. Why don't we both -- I mean, you can go first, Brett.", "Brett Biggs", "Yes. I think as, Mike -- I mean, Scott, as Doug was saying, we do spend a lot of time as a management team thinking ahead, obviously, next quarter, next year, 3 years out, 5 years out and how we manage all the pieces of our portfolio, and that includes International portfolio, Sam's Club, eCommerce, Walmart, and thinking about how we will manage as this business changes.", "We know it changes. The customer is changing, and we're going to stay out in front of the customer. And the great thing about our business is we have so many different ways to do that, and we -- and the diversity of our portfolio gives us more options in which to do that.", "And I think we sit back and we say we know where we want to be 5 years from now, 10 years from now, and there's a lot of different ways to get to that versus just one direct path. And so there's different things that we can do to manage that over time.", "Doug McMillon", "I think the only thing I would add is that we're learning kind of the activity-based cost aspects of different paths. And I think, over time, if we could, and I think smart cart causes us to believe we might be able to, we'd like to bring the customers into this conversation and help them understand through our pricing and our communication that if you want to buy a single can of corn for under $1, there's not going to be a better, more efficient path to you than a supercenter visit.", "As the shape of a basket changes, food and non-food, and it goes up, and remember, Jet had a much higher units per order and still has a much higher units per order than the Walmart brand does, you can start to change the economics of eCommerce to be profitable with a unit per order that looks more like 7 than 2 and a blended basket margin that helps you to have basket economics rather than eaches.", "So part of what we're trying to build with eCommerce, and I think you can see it, frankly, in the fourth quarter choices that we made around pricing on eaches, is that we're really focused on building a basket business because that's a big key to profitability.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Scott. Rob, Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matt Fassler", "Thanks a lot. Good morning. I think I have a different way of asking the eCommerce and profitability question. Understanding that this is a year in which you're probably making some investments that you may not have made because of tax reform, is there anything that you learned since you spoke with us back in October that suggests it would be more expensive due to market conditions to get to 40% annual eCommerce growth than you had previously thought?", "Doug McMillon", "No, I don't think so. Matt, my head, when you asked the question, started dividing it into food and non-food. There's nothing new on food. I think if you go back and listen to or watch our October analyst presentation where we walked through the strategy for food, all of that, even more convicted, still holds.", "On the non-food side, we're building a business. It's \u2013 non-food eCommerce is -- has not been our historic competency over the last few decades and the history of the company, and so we're learning something new.", "We're trying to build an assortment that enables a margin ultimately, and that's got components to it like attracting brands, being able to execute from a fulfillment point of view during a busy season.", "We've got some exciting things coming out with site redesign and other things this spring, I think, that will help us make more progress in that area. So I don't think it's that we've learned something new. I think it's a question of pace. And are the operational improvements and merchandising improvements happening? And are you investing marketing to kind of coincide with those improvements.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Matt. Rob, next question please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane", "Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just to drill down a little bit more on some of the questions that have been asked. I think apparel has been highlighted by several media outlets over the weekend.", "Can you walk us through what the overall apparel strategy is in store and online and how you're balancing national brands with private label?", "Doug McMillon", "Sure. I'm excited about -- later this week, I'm headed down to Houston because we've got all of our store managers there and these new apparel brands that have been mentioned in the media are on the sales floor, and I hear they look great. We're focused on improving quality; still managing good, better and best; protecting opening price points, which we do such a great job of; reducing our SKU counts in apparel to improve our presentation.", "And we have some new fixturing in some stores that we're expanding on this year so that everything fits together, the quality of the product, the value of the product, the brand presentation of it, the ability to present it well because you have fewer SKUs and then a presentation in terms of fixturing that enables that to look fresh and new.", "We've got a big apparel business. It has been growing, but we have even more opportunity to grow it in store. And then online, there are numerous opportunities for us to build private brands, leverage the DNVBs of the world like Bonobos and ModCloth and maybe more in the future and attract other brands to both Walmart and Jet that will help us drive our apparel business and manage the mix. So apparel is a pretty big focus at the moment.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Kate. Next question please.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jeffries.", "Dan Binder", "Hi, thanks. You've talked about accelerating certain investments, so I'm just curious if you could be a little bit more specific on what those are and whether or not there'll be any lumpiness by quarter that we should consider. I know you're giving annual guidance, but just want to make sure we consider the quarters as well.", "Brett Biggs", "Yes. Dan, this is Brett. The investments that we're going to make are going to continue to change how we work as a company, help us continue to stay ahead of the customer, and those are going to be in the areas of technology. They're going to be in the areas of supply chain, pricing.", "And you can imagine, for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into a lot of things that we plan to do, and we'll be talking about those as we go throughout the year. We mentioned we think EPS growth will be pretty consistent throughout the year quarter by quarter.", "There could be a quarter or two where we make an investment that's different than the other quarters. And if that's the case, we would talk about that when we release earnings. But right now, I don't anticipate major changes quarter-to-quarter.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Dan. Rob, next question please.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Trussell", "Good morning and also thank you for doing this call. Just wanted to circle back on margins. The guidance for 4.3% to 4.4% for the year, obviously, a lot of moving parts and some acceleration in investments. So just want to confirm that your thought process is that there is an ability to find further leverage over time and expand from those levels as we look forward.", "And also, more specifically, for the current quarter, if you can just touch a little bit more detail regarding the transportation cost impact that you saw and what your expectations are on that particular line item going forward.", "Brett Biggs", "Sure. Paul, appreciate it. I'll start with the operating income question. We're only giving guidance for this year coming forward. We did leverage expenses. Excluding discrete items for the year, leverage got better as we went throughout the year. So I am optimistic about the expense leverage that we're seeing in the business, particularly in International and Walmart U.S. stores, and I expect that we'll continue to see that progress.", "So that gives us -- we've always talked about that being better with expenses gives us more flexibility and more ways in which to hit the P&L that we would like to and do what we want to do for our customers. So that's the only guidance we're going to give, is we'll be this, this year on operating income.", "On transportation costs, those vary from quarter-to-quarter. As you know, gas prices -- fuel prices have gone up a little bit. In this last quarter, I think we're maybe $0.30 versus last year roughly. So that has a bearing on what we do year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter, but that was the main mention of that in the fourth quarter.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Paul. The next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about the working capital opportunities that you see for FY '19? Obviously, you've done a great job in inventory in the U.S. Can working capital continue to be a source of cash for Walmart? Or have you harvested all the opportunity that you can?", "Brett Biggs", "Thanks, Ben. Yes, there's always more opportunity. If Greg Foran were sitting here, he would talk about, as he goes into store by store, he still sees opportunity for us to be better, to be more efficient. Some of the technology that we've talked about and investments will continue to lead to easier ways for our associates to move goods, stock goods.", "So all of that helps, and all of that matters. I don't think there's ever an end to what we can do on working capital. The last 2 years have been -- to be fair, have been pretty impressive, the last couple of years, particularly on payables and the inventory side.", "So I think there's more room to go. I won't quantify what I think that could be, but I do believe working capital can continue to be a source of cash for Walmart going forward.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Ben. Rob, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict", "Hey, guys. You've shown signs of being willing to rationalize the asset base here more recently, but, obviously, continue to invest in eCommerce. So how do you see the ROIC profile evolving over the next few years? Just curious how important stabilizing that metric is to you as you guys think about your broader priorities? Thanks.", "Brett Biggs", "Yes, great question. And Peter, as you know, we've talked a lot about ROI. It's important to us. Returns are important, along with a number of other metrics that we've mentioned this morning.", "If you pull out the discrete items, ROI would have been in a much better place in this last year, and we've seen improvements in our asset base and rationalizing that operating income being where it is. Returns short term, long term are really important for the company.", "We are going to make sure that we win long term. And as we've said before, there may be times year-to-year where that has an impact on ROI that is different than we would want on a long-term basis.", "But we will make those decisions when we need to do that. But returns are very important for us, and we talk about it a lot as a management team, as you would imagine.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Peter. Rob, next question please.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.", "Bob Drbul", "Hi, guys. Good morning. Two quick questions. The first one is, did you give a number on inflation and sort of the trends that you're seeing on -- especially on the food inflation?", "And then the other one is, on fulfillment centers, you're converting, I think it's, 10 of the Sam's Clubs into fulfillment centers. Can you just give us an idea of where you think you are with your ability on the fulfillment center proposition in the business?", "Brett Biggs", "Yes. Bob, on inflation, we didn't see a meaningful impact in the quarter. And going forward, probably a modest impact -- slight impact next year, but nothing meaningful really next year.", "Doug McMillon", "And on the fulfillment side, I would say we're in pretty good shape in terms of square footage and where it's placed. We had these 6 fulfillment centers with Walmart, the 3 we picked up from Jet. And Marc and the team are learning how to mirror inventory in certain places to improve customer service levels and to lower cost. So that's underway, but the physical plant is in pretty good shape generally. It's going to be fun to watch what happens with the Sam's Club efforts here.", "If we're going to take Memphis as a place to learn, we basically use the same facility, same steel that we use when members shop in the club and pick from those. That's going to help us with speed. It's going to help us reduce transportation costs. And once we have the wrinkles ironed out there, we'll use more facilities over time. Generally speaking, I think we're in pretty good shape. Over the years, looking ahead, as we grow the business, we may open a fulfillment center here and there, but that's where we stand today.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Bob. Rob, next question please.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson.", "Greg Melich", "Hi, thanks. I wanted to tie it back a little into the reinvestment of the tax benefits. I think you guys have invested about $750 million in labor that was announced about a month ago. When you think about the magnitude that would go back into price, should we think about it being similar to what was in SG&A?", "Or how would we even frame that? And you can answer to this year or even over the next couple of years. Thanks.", "Brett Biggs", "Yes, Greg. As I said earlier, we're not going to get into a lot of detail about how we're going to invest. The wage amount you mentioned, about $400 million of that was the onetime bonus. The other part would be going forward into next year with the increase in the start rate.", "And I'll say what I said before, which is we're going to be thoughtful about these investments. And we have a lot of levers that we can use to satisfy that customer, and we're going to be thoughtful about which levers we pull.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Greg. Rob, next question please.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.", "Edward Kelly", "Yeah, hi. Good morning. I would just like to talk about - or ask about investment in grocery at this point, just in terms of price investment, how you're thinking about the returns that you're getting on that investment, how you balance that against investing in the digital experience for the customer. I would think that, at this point, you're getting to an area, given your price perception and competitive marketplace, that maybe digital is the better return.", "And then you did mention grocery delivery. Could you just give us an update on where you stand there at this point?", "Doug McMillon", "Sure. As you think about price investments in store, think about grocery, consumables and the fact that, across the store, there are some items, windshield washer fluid in the automotive department, tennis balls in sporting goods, that are high-turn, price-sensitive items to a degree. And when we think about the price investments in the store, we're not singularly focused on dry grocery. We're thinking about this in a broad way.", "The supercenter assortment is a big advantage, and we want to deliver low prices across the store, which also helps us drive traffic to the store and manage margins across the entire store. So evaluate the price investment through that lens rather than just grocery. And the returns we're seeing there are attractive. You can see it in the store traffic.", "And we're going to continue our strategy as it relates to those. We're not cutting short the eCommerce investments. I think part of what we're doing now is just letting the business mature and learning how to become stronger operationally in eCommerce.", "There may be a point this year and looking ahead where we want to be even more aggressive on eCommerce marketing, if we feel like those operational improvements are on the right path. We kind of watch that very continuously basically.", "As it relates to grocery delivery, we've had this small pilot going on with our own associates, and we'll continue to play around with that and learn what works there. But the expansion will happen through a variety of platforms. We'll use, depending on the spot in the country, different providers to get the product to the customer, and we'll be keeping an eye on NPS scores in particular.", "Our Online Grocery business has a really high Net Promoter Score, and we want to, as we start to grow delivery capabilities, ensure that the customer experience is as good through delivery as it is for pickup. So we've got some things to learn there, and it'll happen at a pace based on the customer experience.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Ed. Rob, we have time for one question.", "Operator", "That final question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.", "Chuck Grom", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. Doug, from a capital allocation standpoint, could you discuss a little bit about closing the 63 Sam's stores earlier? And then should we expect to see continued closings both in the U.S. and International? And then for Brett, on the digital side, could you shed some light on the growth between 1P and 3P for the e-com business? Thanks.", "Doug McMillon", "Sure. I'll take capital allocation first. If you go back a couple of years, you'll remember that we closed quite a few stores around the world, including the 100-some-odd Express stores in Walmart U.S., the smaller stores that we have been testing as a pilot -- as a format. We discontinued those and closed those.", "At that moment in time, we had been through all of the 11,600-plus units around the world, sitting through real estate, meeting, Brett, country by country and making choices about the portfolio. So we did a lot of that cleanup then. We didn't do Sam's Club at the time.", "We were still working through a number of things, pacing things out, trying to put them in the right sequence. So the way I was thinking of it is let's make sure that the U.S. store business is strong. What do we need to make that work? That's where we made wage investments, price investments and cleaned up the portfolio. We've been focused on -- focusing on building an eCommerce business. That's still underway obviously. And then now we've turned our attention to Sam's Club.", "We've got a strategy we believe in, a leadership team we're excited about, and we're investing in that business to drive comps up there. So it's just been a sequencing, and the bottom line is we've been through the portfolio. I can't tell you there will never be more closings. A store here and there, I think, makes sense, but we've been through the majority of that big work for now anyway.", "Brett Biggs", "Chuck, on your question of 1P and 3P, obviously, first part, they're part - they're both important to us. We want to satisfy that customer need. Sometimes, it's better done through first party; sometimes, it's better done through third party. As you know, we have about 75 million SKUs now on our Marketplace site.", "And it's another one of those levers that we've talked about -- I was talking about earlier that we have in order to determine how we best fulfill that customer need in a way that makes sense for both top line and bottom line.", "Steve Schmitt", "Well, thanks, guys. We certainly appreciate you joining our call today. And have a great day.", "Brett Biggs", "Thank you all.", "Doug McMillon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference.
