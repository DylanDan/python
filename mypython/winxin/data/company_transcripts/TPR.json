As noted in our press release this morning our results benefited from both organic sales growth at Coach and Stuart Weitzman, as well as the contribution of Kate Spade. Naturally we were excited to drive positive global and North American comps for Coach as our inventory mix improved notably in outlets while our retail business was driven by innovation and improved domestic mall traffic for the first time in several years.", "We were also pleased to deliver better than expected results across financial metrics. Most notably and as will be shared in more detail by Kevin we experienced a significant sequential improvement in gross margin trend at Coach and outperformance at Kate Spade where we carefully managed promotions across channels. ", "The Kate Spade integration onto our operating platform continued smoothly during the quarter as we executed on the strategic actions to position the brand for long term success. These included the pull back on flash sales and wholesale disposition while taking substantial steps to unlock cost and operating synergies. We remain especially excited about the opportunities for the brand both in terms of revenue growth driven by distribution expansion and productivity and profitability improvement as we leverage our scale across our supply chain and corporate functions.", "As previously shared we continue to expect to achieve synergies primarily related to SG&A of about 30 million to 35 million in FY '18 and run rate synergies from both COGS and SG&A of approximately 100 million to 115 million in fiscal 2019. ", "This past quarter we also made several key hires across our brands.

First, leveraging the opportunity for our brands with the Chinese consumer globally, highlighted by the pending acquisition of the Stuart Weitzman business from our distributor in northern china, and taking operational control of our Kate Spade joint venture from mainland china, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. ", "And second, unlocking the value of a multi brand operating model. To this end we are excited to announce the buyback of the coach business in Australia and New Zealand from our distributor within expected closing date in the fiscal third quarter. As a result, we are creating a Tapestry multi brand hub and center of excellence in Australia which allows for greater control of our brands and the structure and resources to drive growth across our portfolio in an important market.", "Importantly given our strong year-to-date financial performance we expect that we will be able to fund these strategic actions while maintaining our operating income growth targets for the year. Taken together with the anticipated benefits from the lower tax rate and interest expense we expect to drive strong double digit adjusted earnings growth and exceed annual EPS guidance we set out for Tapestry at the beginning of the fiscal year.", "Moving to category trends and as you know given our new reporting structure we have moved to a global category update. During the second quarter we estimate that the men's and women's premium handbag and accessory market which is over 40 billion grew at a high single digit rate globally, similar to the September quarter.", "Now turning to results by brand. I would like to focus on second quarter performance and spring outlook for Coach where we remain focused on elevating brand perception, driving fashion relevance and ensuring balance across our product offering in both price points and material. As you know there were a number of extraordinary events that had impacted Q1 performance which were beyond our control. Along with poor inventory mix in our outlet channel. ", "However, as we entered Q2 we were able to address the inventory mix opportunities highlighted at the time and saw a strong inflection in both global comparable store sales and gross margin from our Q1 performance with sales driven by an improvement across all productivity metrics, traffic, ticket trends and conversion. ", "On a year-over-year basis conversion remains positive while traffic and ticket were essentially flat.

", "During the quarter, our global Coach comp rebounded rising 3% led by North America outperformance as the inventory mix was corrected and mall traffic trends improved. Overall greater China comps rose with positive comps on the Mainland and a significant improvement in trend in Hong Kong and Macau. Comps in Europe reflect year-over-year as expected given the double-digit gains posted on last year second quarter fueled by currency weakness notably in the UK. ", "Moving to wholesale. Our North America shipments grew during the quarter driven by footwear. As expected, our sales at POS declined due to the rap impact of spring 2017 door closures which have not anniversaries while our total promotional event phase in the channel declined 20%. ", "However, we were pleased to once again have positive year-on-year performance in comp doors within our largest account. Our results are especially strong in those doors which have been renovated into the modern luxury concept.

We offered a compelling holiday gift assortment with options across categories and price points in a wide selection of colors, such a playful print in the surprised and delighted our customers and while we continue to innovate leather craft launching quoting as a new technique.

In addition, Coach continues to lead in emotional and functional attributes in our brand tracking survey among the broad premium markets. ", "As noted on our last call we launched Coach Create globally in Q2, a platform for clients that customize their bags either online or in store.

Our Fall collections the first under our direct control included a focused assortment of 100 SKUs grounding in shearling and boots. ", "At the end of Q2 in December we launched pre-spring with an expanded range of functions including a broad sneaker assortment and the introduction of the dress classification. Both of these strategies resonated with our customers. As we head into spring we continue to amplify the sport category introduce signature and enhance the dress assortment.

Black Friday included the fun plant story across both men's and women's product categories. Backpacks and tops were especially strong within the black Friday message.", "Now looking to spring and outlet, we are enthusing innovation with new salivate launches across the board. We have a couple of exciting collaborations coming within the channel in the next few weeks and we will be leveraging inspiration from the 1941 runway looks. Overall, we're thrilled with Coach's holiday performance. As we look forward to spring and beyond we are well-positioned to drive positive comparable store sales driven by compelling products, our differentiated modern luxury store experience and bold marketing campaigns across all of our channels and geographies. We are especially excited about our development and logo platforms and the leverage that we expect to get from the new spring Selena Gomez campaign and bringing these ideas to our core customers globally given the current trend for highly differentiated logo products in the broader market.", "Moving to Kate Spade sales totaled 435 million in the second quarter, down about 7% from the prior year on a pro forma basis, reflecting our strategic reduction of both wholesale disposition and/or surprised sales. Underlying comparable store sales trends were similar to the prior quarter with brick-and-mortar comps down 3% globally and total comps down about 7% impacted by reduced promotional sales online.

Within handbags our core groups performed well notably [Carmen Street] and Jackson street while backpacks and cross bodies both comps significantly.", "The customer continued to response to the make-it-mine customization program which built the momentum and e-com as well since small leather goods, small wallets and cross bodies drove the biggest increases. And in ready to wear it was all about by now wear now with outerwear. sweaters and dress as the strongest categories. As noted in our last call we're especially excited about our trend in ready to wear and have been testing at different visual merchandizing approach. This test is focused on zooming retail stores by department rather than monthly introduction allowing for an easier category shopping experience. The original test doors continue to outperform the balance of change during the quarter and as a result we rolled out the test to approximately 10 additional doors in Q2. We expect to expand this program throughout the second half of the fiscal year. ", "And in outlet, we leveraged the opportunity around our gifting capsule as well as in bag packs and cross body silhouettes. We saw improved results from higher inventory levels notably in handbag sales with small leather goods and jewelry also performing well. As always, we had fun with our retail holiday marketing across direct mail featuring our seasonal and make it mine campaigns digital with our popular misadventure and talking shop videos on holiday dressing and online gift guide.

Similarly, in outlet we use on mall advertising, windows with updated creative and LED screens to drive traffic.

We also continue to further our learnings on the Kate Spade brand through U.S. brand tracking survey fielded in December. Importantly we saw the percentage of Kate Spade purchasers who are category drivers increase from the prior quarter. ", "In addition, when compared to prior year the percentage of women who believe carrying a Kate Spade handbag makes them feel put together increased among the broad premium market. Notably Coach and Kate shared leadership among bench mark brand in this attribute. ", "And among the broad premium market we continue to see the Kate Spade resonate on the attributes of fissionable, feminine and fun. In fact, 85% of women believe Kate Spade handbags are fashionable and on trend setting us up very well for the increased focus we shall be placing on core handbag innovation in the quarters ahead. ", "Overall, we're already taken steps to position the brand, building a foundation for solid and sustainable growth. As we look ahead for the Kate Spade for the balance of F18 we will continue to significantly promotional impressing by reducing surprise sales and pulling back on wholesale disposition. It's important to note that in the case of flash, we're not only pulling back on the number of events but also significantly reducing the circulation, no longer using flash sales as broad, widely advertise recruitment vehicles. ", "Under the creative direction of Nicola Glass, we will accelerate innovation in the core handbag and accessories categories, along with ready to wear and tech leveraging the Tapestry platform, notably our supply chain and product development capabilities.

Of course, we've also just announced taking operational control of the joint ventures for greater China, which we believe is a huge opportunity for Kate and where we can leverage our regional brand building capabilities. I continue to partner with the terrific Kate Spade team as interim CEO as we continue to look to both capture synergies and more importantly drive global resonance and growth. We are especially excited to support the execution of Nicola's vision for the brand as we bring our strategies to life and global markets. ", "Turning to Stuart Weitzman, sales rose 2% driven by the global direct business which in turn was fueled by distribution growth and global e-commerce. For perspective we did expect second quarter results to be essentially even on a year over year basis given the extremely difficult compare with last year's 2Q. During the quarter newer occasion categories performed well, including booties, weather and sneakers as well as our developing handbag offering.

Kevin?", "Kevin Wills", "Thanks Victor. Victor has just taken you through the highlight and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter as well as our outlook for fiscal year '18.

Net sales totaled 1.79 billion as compared to 1.32 billion in the prior-year, an increase of 35% driven by the acquisition of Kate Spade and organic growth. Coach net sales totaled 1.23 billion as compared to 1.2 billion in the prior-year, an increase of 2%. Kate Spade net sales totaled 435 million reflecting in part the strategic pullback in wholesale disposition and online flash.", "Stuart Weitzman net sales totaled $121 million an increase of 2% and slightly ahead of guidance due to wholesale shipment time and favorability as mentioned.", "Gross profit totaled $1.2 billion while gross margin was 67% as compared to 68.6% in the prior year. The addition of Kate Spade pressured our overall gross margin by approximately 120 basis points, given the lower margin profile of the Kate Spade brand.", "Gross margin for Coach was 68.8% as compared to gross margin of 69% in the prior year. We experienced a negative 30 basis points impact due to bringing the women's footwear business in house. In addition, currency pressured the brands gross margin rate with 10 basis points in the quarter. As Victor mentioned we were pleased with the sequential improvement in gross margin trend at Coach in combination with positive comparable store sales.", "Kate Spade gross margin was 63.3%. This performance was above our expectations and prior year, benefiting in part from lower discount rates in the North American outlet channel.", "Gross margin for Stuart Weitzman was 61.9% as compared to 64.4% in the prior year. The year-over-year decline was in part due to negative impact of currency of 170 basis points.", "SG&A expenses totaled $785 million and represented 44% of sales as compared to 46.3% in the year ago period. SG&A was well controlled in the quarter and also benefited from a shift and expenses into the back half of the fiscal year.", "Coach SG&A expenses totaled $485 million and represented 39.4% of sales compared to 40.9% in the year-ago quarter.", "Kate Spade SG&A expenses were $183 million and represented 42.1% of sales. Stuart Weitzman SG&A expenses were $51 million, and represented 42.4% of sales as compared to 45.6% of sales in the prior year. In addition, please note that Tapestry\u2019s total SG&A includes corporate costs, as outlined in our press release.", "Operating income for the quarter was $411 million, an increase of 40% versus the prior year, while operating margin expanded approximately 80 basis points to 23%. The addition of Kate Spade pressured our overall operating margin by approximately 60 basis points.", "Operating income for Coach was $361 million, while operating margin was 29.4% versus 28.1% in the prior year. Operating income for Kate Spade totaled $92 million, while operating margin was 21.2%. Operating income for Stuart Weitzman was $24 million or 19.6% of sales versus 18.8% in the prior year. ", "Net interest expense was $22 million in the quarter as compared to $5 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher debt levels associated with the Kate Spade acquisition. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.3% as compared to 27% in the prior year reflecting as mentioned the U.S. tax legislation changes. As outlined in detail in our press release this does not include the onetime transition tax on foreign earnings deemed to be repatriated and the measurement of the differed tax asset and liabilities resulting from the federal break reduction. ", "Net income for the quarter totaled $306 million as compared to $211 million in the prior year with earnings per diluted share of $1.07 versus $0.75. As noted our Q2 non-GAAP EPS was significantly ahead of our expectations with the lower tax rate driving approximately half of the to our internal plan. The balance of the EPS favorability was due to higher operating income versus our projection with approximately half of this upside driven by operational outperformance and half due to timing shift with the second half of fiscal year. ", "Now, moving to global distribution by brand. For Coach, we opened seven net locations globally primarily in Europe finishing the quarter with 967 directly-operated locations worldwide. For Kate Spade, we open eight net locations globally in the quarter with 284 directly-operated stores. And for Stuart Weitzman, we opened two stores and finished the quarter with 83, directly operating stores globally.", "Turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. At the end of fiscal second quarter our cash and short-term investments were approximately $2.1 billion as compared to 1.8 billion in the prior year. Our total borrowings outstanding were $2.7 billion which consisted of $1.6 billion of senior notes and $1.1 billion in terms loans versus $600 million in senior notes a year ago. ", "In January we fully repaid $1.1 billion in term loans utilizing excess cash, consistent with our comments to conservative balance sheet management the 800 million six-month term loans was repaid maturity and the 300 million term loan was retired early. These actions resulted in a reduction of our leverage by a term on a debt to EBITDA basis.", "In addition, as part of our appropriate capital structure management we will be filing a new shift registration statement this week as our prior shift expired in December 2017. While we have no plans on offer at this time an active shift registration statement allows us appropriate capital structure flexibility. ", "Inventory levels at quarter-end were $666 million including approximately $179 million associated with Kate Spade compared to ending inventory of $465 million a year ago. As previously communicated, we expected a higher inventory to sales ratio than has been our recent history due to elevated inventory levels of Kate Spade. We will protect the Kate Spade brand but not moving excess inventory into the disposition market but rather by primarily flowing it into our own network into the second half of the year. Therefore, we continue to expect our inventory to sales ratio to improve as we move to fiscal 2018.", "Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was an inflow of $514 million, compared to an inflow of $366 million last year. Our CapEx spending was $78 million in Q2 versus $54 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $436 million versus an inflow of $312 million in the same period last year. Please note based on current available regulatory guidance, we anticipate paying repatriation taxes on accumulated foreign earnings over an eight-year period starting in fiscal year 2019.", "Now turning to our capital allocation policy. Our long-term priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to invest in our brands in order to drive sustainable growth and value creation. ", "Secondly, we will seek strategic acquisitions looking for great brands with opportunities for expansion and finally returning capital to shareholders with the focus on dividends. ", "Now moving to our 2018 outlook, consistent with our past practice the following guidance is presented on a non-GAAP basis, additional the Kate Spade guidance has provided subsequent to deal close on July 11th 2017.", "Turning to our guidance, we continue to expect total revenues for tapestry in fiscal 2018 to increase about 30% versus fiscal 2017 to 5.8 billion to 5.9 billion with low single digit organic growth. This includes the expectation for low single digit Coach global comps and a low double digit increase in Stuart Weitzman sales. ", "In addition, we expect the acquisition of Kate Spade to add over 1.2 billion in revenue. The Kate Spade revenue projection includes the impact of a planned strategic pullback in the wholesale disposition in online plus channels and assumes a high single digit decrease in comps for the year. In addition, we're continuing to project operating income growth of 22 to 25% versus fiscal 2017 driven by mid-single digit organic growth, the acquisition of Kate Spade and estimated synergies of 30 million to 35 million.", "These synergies are expected to offset in part the reduction in profitability from a strategic and delivered pullback of Kate Spade wholesale disposition in online flash sales channels. Taken together, Kate Spade business and resulting synergies are expected to add approximately a 130 million to a 140 million to operating income. ", "Importantly and as previously discussed we announced key business development initiatives today that allow each of our brands to take more direct control over the international distribution. Given our year to date operating income outperformance we can find these strategic investments while maintaining our annual operating income growth targets.", "Net interest is now expected to be 75 million to 78 million for the year versus previous guidance of 80 million to 85 million reflecting the debt repayment in the third quarter. The full year fiscal 2018 tax rate is now projected at about 19.5% to 21% as compared to prior guidance of 25% to 26%. The reduction from our previous guidance is primarily attributable to the recent revisions to the US tax code as discussed. We expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year to be approximately 289 million. Overall, we are now projecting earnings per diluted share for the year in a range of $2.52 to $2.60, an increase of about 17% to 21% including mid to half single digit accretion from the acquisition of Kate Spade. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 325 million in fiscal '18.", "As previously noted we naturally be incurring a number of one-time charges primarily associated with the Kate Spade acquisition and integration. These charges include such items as transaction fees and integration cost which includes severance, store closure costs and inventory valuation adjustments. ", "For the full year we currently anticipate pre-tax integration charges to be approximately 240 million to 250 million in fiscal '18 of which approximately 120 million to a 130 million is expected to be non-cash. In addition to such integration charges we also incurred 40 million in pretax acquisition transaction fees. ", "Finally, we are expecting to incur approximately 2 million of operational efficiency charges for full-year.", "As outlined today we also expect to incur net of approximately 213 million in one-time charges as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform. These charges relate to the transition tax on foreign earnings being to be repatriated for approximately 315 million, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities under the new tax code of approximately 102 million. The actual amount of remeasurement and being repatriation tax may differ from this estimate due to among other things a change in the interpretations of revisions to U.S. tax code, changes in assumptions made in developing these estimates as as regulatory guidance that may be issued with respect to the applicable revisions to the U.S. tax code.", "Finally turning to our fiscal '18 directly operated distribution plans for brand. For Coach we now expect to close in net of approximately five to 10 locations globally. The change versus previous guidance is primarily due to Japan where we planned to close fewer doors based on performance. Also following the acquisition of our businesses in Australia and New Zealand from our distributor we will operate in additional 20 stores.", "For Kate Spade we continue to expect to open 20 to 25 net new locations globally, while also taking operational control of approximately 50 stores across mainland china, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. And for Stuart Weitzman we continue to expect approximately five net openings globally. In addition, we expect to directly operate approximately 20 doors in northern china following a distributor buyback.", "In closing we will grow both Coach and Stuart Weitzman in the year ahead while successfully integrating Kate Spade which we expect to be mid to high single digit accretive to our fiscal 2018 results. And as mentioned we continue to expect to achieve run rate synergies of 100 million to 115 million in fiscal 2019. ", "Overall, we remain very optimistic about our global opportunities and we're committed to driving long-term sustainable growth across the Tapestry portfolio of brands with a very healthy balance sheet to support our strategies.", "I would now like to open it up to Q&A. Operator?", "Andrea Resnick", "Operator, we are ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities.", "Bob Drbul", "I just have two questions, I guess. The first one is you talked about the growth and the performance of the global premium handbag category. I was wondering if you could give us some insight into what you saw in the North American premium handbag category? ", "And then the second part of it, is specifically to keep call out Coach's outperformance in North America I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on that first?", "Victor Luis", "Sure, as we have noted Bob, both last quarter and on this speakers notes that we just provided, we're providing global sales and comps and of course are committed to providing global category growth quarterly growth forward, that said to your question with a couple of significant players that have yet to report, it does appear that the North American premium handbag and accessory market grew at a mid-single digit rate which is an acceleration from the low single digit rate that we saw in the September quarter and we believe that was of course part fueled by our own sequential improvements and I will let Josh chime in a little bit on that. ", "Josh Schulman", "Hi Bob, as Victor mentioned in North America we outperformed the global performance and what we would say is that about one comp point either way would be similar and anything beyond that would be outperformance and we were just so pleased with the results in North America, it was really across business units stores and the internet and across channels and it was a combination I would say that are traffic in the malls that we see and heard about coupled with excellent execution on the part of our teams. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. ", "Ike Boruchow ", "So, Victor maybe this one is for you, I want to ask about more about the acquisition of the Kate Spade JV in Asia. Can you talk a little bit more about what the business looks like today, maybe some of the key similarities and differences you can draw back to when you took the Coach China business in house and then just lastly, can you may be size the opportunity there longer term?", "Victor Luis", "Very excited about our witness development opportunities in that part of the world, as we mentioned in our speakers notes, we're actually taking some actions across a couple of market with two real key strategies there, first and foremost is around the Chinese consumer and that obviously relates most to what we're doing with Kate Spade, but also, we're very excited with the buyback of the business from China. ", "And the Kate Spade opportunity in that market, excuse me, and the Kate Spade opportunity in that market today it's not dramatically different quite frankly from where couch was when we purchase that business back in 2008 and so we're very excited by the experience of course across our teams and the ability to help that brand grow, terrific opportunity for distribution of course across both tier 1, 2 and 3 cities, very developed infrastructure which we know well of course with Coach having well north of 150 locations now in that market, we have terrific relationship with the trade and with distribution and we're really focused now on putting in the right investments and talent of course and driving up awareness for the brand in that market not only in the Mainland but also in Hong Kong, Macau and in Taiwan. ", "And then the second part of our strategy not directly connected to your question Ike is what we're doing with the Australia, New Zealand buyback of Coach which is really about leveraging a Tapestry multi brand model to allow us to successfully grow our brands in the smaller medium sized markets where each of them independently would not have the scale to be managed directly so very excited about that opportunity and look forward to sharing more on that with you in the future as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Schick of Consumer Edge Research.", "David Schick", "Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. As you seem to be moving faster maybe that's not fair but faster at least based on conversations we're already having this morning on doing what you do buying back distribution, moving through your game plan on Kate, and global synergy is part of what you talked about. Can you talk about the sourcing cost both on materials and labor as you look out through the balance of this year and longer term?", "Victor Luis", "We don't see much impact as we discussed in the past David for this year obviously we've discussed and shared the inventory that we inherited and we're working through that right across the second half. Of course, we are and have been working incredibly hard across our supply chains both from a sourcing of materials perspective as well as from a labor perspective with all of our partners across the supply chain and what we have shared with you of course is that when we think of the FY '19 run rate of a 100 million to 115 million approximately half of that should be cogs and Kate of course will benefit from that directly, so very excited about that. ", "Just as importantly we're really excited of course about the opportunity to grow top line and that is a very significant work that the team is doing on maximizing the distribution for the brand not only here in North America but globally but also bringing in the talent that we have. ", "Nicola Glass is going to be wonderful, she's done this at scale, she's very experienced, she really understands the brand well. I've been partnering with her now for almost a month and I'm very excited with the rest of the team for the vision that she's creating for the Kate Spade brand and that's the next chapter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn Murphy", "Great, thanks good morning and good quarter. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the logo transferring the second quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a consumer perspective, are you bringing in a new or a lapsed consumer, were you seeing any traction in tourism and then if you just think about the penetration rate within outlet and then as you launch within spring for full line, where do you see that going over time, thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Sure, I'll let Josh take that one. ", "Josh Schulman", "Good morning, so I think it's really important as we talked about the logo trend to separate between the inventory issues that we experienced in outlet in Q1. As we moved into Q2 we were able to normalize our inventory in the ongoing carryover logo product that has always been a part of our outlet assortment. ", "As we look forward what we've been talking about is the re-introduction of signature which is a historic part of our brand as you know to our retail channel. And what we are seeing there is a part of global movement in luxury brands toward a higher penetration of logo product. ", "Now that has been absent from our retail assortments, these past few years during the brand transformation and that new product that appeared on Stuart Vevers run way in September will only hit our retail stores as part of the March 1st, floor set. ", "The editorial response and the response from the wholesale community, our most elevated partners around the world has been terrific on that more elevated product. So, whether it\u2019s a Harper's Bazaar or appearing in the Neiman Marcus catalog, the most elevated partners are excited about the way Stuart introduced it in conjunction with a collaboration with the key pairing archives. We want to be very clear though that we're going to take a very measured approach and a very disciplined approach in how we reintroduce this into retail, a building on the organic demand that is by the way. I also want to clarify one point from your question, that the recruitment in our North America customer base rose during this period.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva of Oppenheimer.", "Anna Andreeva", "We had more of a modeling questions, so I guess to Kevin as it relates to 3Q given the nights margin improvement at the Coach brand in 2Q, and sounds like you are very well positioned from innovation standpoint. Maybe talk about the P&L dynamics between the gross margin and SG&A. For Coach brand gross margin to be up in 3Q I'm not sure if you quantify the timing shift on expenses from 2Q and how should we think about the Easter shift benefit?", "Kevin Wills", "Good morning, as we think about the third and fourth quarter, we have given the guidance for the year. We would think from a modeling perspective the third quarter maybe in a flattish range and the gross margin with the fourth quarter up in part due to the softer gross margin performance we had in last year's fourth quarter. ", "And as you noted there was some timing shifts on the SG&A between the second quarter and the balance of the year. And we would expect the higher impacts of the SG&A probably in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen of Cowen & Company.", "Oliver Chen", "Victor on the digital frontier what are your thoughts on key and near-term and longer-term priorities and your thoughts on the evolution of the supply chain digitally and as you approach digital as well as we think about both customer relationship management and fashion and big data and algorithms, what are your thoughts -- there's a lot of a different revolutions happening including with luxury goods, so I'm wondering how you see that evolving and what your customer wants?", "Victor Luis", "On the broader supply chain question Oli, we have been may be one of the first certainly in our space to dedicate resources to trying to digitize the backend of the process, one of the first investments we made was really on 3D technology to allow our design teams as well as our product development teams to work very closely with all of our vendors on the back end. And that is the process that continues, you will be a hearing a little bit more about some experimentation that we're going to be doing with digitizing from front to back to increased speed and agility in our supply chain. ", "In terms of the front end of the business, you just heard this morning the recruitment that we have made of David Kahn who has just joined us, he will be playing a dual role firstly foremost leading e-commerce for our largest brand partnership with Josh who has as you all know a great passion for all things digital and driving the strategies for couch. ", "At the same time leveraging that platform David will play a key role across all brand looking for opportunities for us to leverage innovation along with our data laps team across our digital platforms. ", "Some of the areas that we have been thinking about and I think you know that we have an incredible asset in our data, we've made substantial investment over the last couple of years across all three brands in technology with a Hadoop database investment. We currently have over 120 million names in that database and one of our key objectives is to leverage that data and recruiting the talent that allows us to obviously think about how we can not only approach consumers more directly in a more customize manner but also in terms of how we think about leveraging machine learning for the inventory management process internally, these are all areas that we're having discussions on and working on right now, so very exciting space indeed.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs. ", "Lindsay Drucker Mann ", "I had two quick one, first I was hoping you can comment on the tenor of promotions in the outlook channel for Coach and Kate, I think you mentioned it got better for Kate, which is curious what you're seeing there generally. And then second, Kevin I don\u2019t know if you're able to help us get some understanding of what the tax rate could be in F19 and beyond once you have to deal guilty in sort of fully loaded number. ", "Victor Luis", "I will let Josh chime in on the Coach promotion and gross margin in a minute but as you stated Lindsey in the case of Kate we really have been very, very focused on leveraging a much cleaner approach channels with the very important focus on reducing of course flash, not only in terms of number of events but also dramatic reduction in the actual circulation of our mainland's and as well as the work that we done across the disposition channel, so across Kate we seen very nice improvements in our gross margin and excited by what the future hold there as we head into a better inventory position in terms of quality of inventory in the second half and beyond and I will let Josh touch on that.", "Josh Schulman", "Hi there, in the Coach brand as expected and the North America outlet channel was more promotional in Q2 but far better than what we experienced in Q1 and I think you can see the results of that in the gross margin performance that the team was able to achieve in the second quarter.", "Kevin Wills", "Good morning Lindsay, this is Kevin, as it relates to your question on the '19 taxes. As you know there were a number of changes in the tax law and we outlined in the press release this morning those changes that we think would have the most material impact on the business. ", "We are currently in the process of working through all of those items, it\u2019s fairly complex, we've done a lot of work but we will need until the end of this fiscal year to fully determine the final impact plus there may be additional regulatory guidance is issued on some of the tax law changes. ", "Having said that on a preliminary basis we would estimate their effective tax rate would go down by about 300 basis points versus what we would have expected so by way of example we originally guided fiscal year '18 effective tax rate in the 24 to 25 so you should think about fiscal year '19 maybe the 21 to 22% range. So about 300 basis points but again more work to come on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager of Baird.", "Mark Altschwager", "Nice to see the recovery in Coach comps this quarter, just wondering as you look at the first half and normalize for all the calendar shifts weather disruptions, inventory issues, what do you view as the underlying comp rate at the Coach brand. And then looking into the back half just given the favorable consumer backdrop and some of the reduced promotional intensity you talked about, is there an opportunity to perhaps accelerate the Coach comp from that normalized first half tram line.", "Victor Luis", "Sure, I'll let Josh answer that.", "Josh Schulman", "Good morning, you know as you look at Q1 and Q2 you know obviously we had a variety of impacts in Q1 and then a nice inflection points in Q2 but as you spread them out it\u2019s really a low single digit trend that we're seeing in the Coach brand. As we look to Q3 and beyond we're confident in our assortments and we're confident in the strategies that we have to continue driving a low single digit trend in Coach comps.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel of Nomura.", "Simeon Siegel", "So, Victor when you think about the long-term profitability for Kate it\u2019s obviously still early but you're already making operational improvements. Are there any structural differences you see between Kate and Coach that would keep them from reaching Coach EBIT margins over the long term and then just quickly, sorry if I missed the SG&A timing shift into the back half.", "Victor Luis", "I'll ask Kevin in a minute to talk about the SG&A timing shift but in terms of Kate's long term profitability, over the long term Simeon I don't see a reason why it could not be at Coach levels, obviously today with Kate Spade we have a business that is more North America centric, we have a business that's slightly heavier in ready to wear which is really structurally I would say some of the biggest differences but long term as we think about a handbag and accessories focused strategy, obviously global growth and a lot of the work that we are also doing across categories that Coach and Kate together we could see things normalizing to a similar level of profitability.", "Kevin Wills", "On the SG&A we did not give specific numbers but we would anticipate majority of that impact being in Q3.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Scott Krasik of Buckingham Research. ", "Scott Krasik", "Just a question on the footwear if you could you have it like for two collections now are in the process of the second collection. Just wondering what you have learned and how big we think that can be on a wholesale basis? And then what other types of brand should we index as to like whether Stuart Weitzman could be over a multiple number of years?", "Victor Luis", "I'm going to let Josh jump in here in a moment but as you suggest we are in the very early days learning a tremendous amount especially in terms of what is similar what is different amongst our portfolio of brands the largest of which you mentioned being Stuart Weitzman which is really a different business model given that it's fully or mostly manufactured in Spain where as Coach lumpy. ", "We have leveraged the lot of the lot of the fit technology of course across the Coach brand and now getting into what we could call the second inning of that rollout as I mentioned in my speakers note. So, I'll let Josh jump in, he is working very closely with the teams on the future strategy there.", "Josh Schulman", "As Victor said I think we took a very delivered approach with the launch of footwear and so for the first season it was really establishing the codes of the house. And what in internally made Coach shoe has in terms of make and look, and really launched with a couple of key categories. What's hitting the stores now using expanded assortment focused on the direct classification and focused on enhanced rollout of sneakers. We are just opening our wholesale market here in network for the next season. And you will see more merchandising there along the thing good better best lines that we have in bag and introduction of other Coach from bags including the introduction of signature, in footwear again different classifications including cold weather more sport functions et cetera. ", "The other thing we have been delivered on is the distribution strategy. We started off with a tight number of wholesale orders in North America, taking doors down significantly from where the licensee had it. And now we are adding regions too so we will be launching in Europe as well where the brands will be placed in Kurt Geiger which is one of the preeminent footwear multi brand retailers in the UK and all of the best distribution in Europe as well. So, we are playing a long game here but we are excited about the next steps.", "Victor Luis", "And for those of you who haven\u2019t yet had the opportunity and love the footwear category and I know there is one or two of you out there please do visit Stuart Weitzman stores in the months ahead as Giovanni's collection hits because I think you will find a lot of wonderful emotional products.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you. That concludes our Q&A and we\u2019ll now turn it over to Victor Luis for some concluding remarks.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Andrea. As is our custom, I just want to thank all of you and just as importantly thank the 20,000 global employees who drive our performance and make what we just announced possible. Our teams are all focused on great execution, bringing innovation to market and ensuring that consumers continue to engage with our great brands and I certainly could not be more excited by the opportunity for our brands and for Tapestry, as we continue to evolve as a house of desirable brands with very dedicated and talented global teams.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you Shirley. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. Mike Tucci, President of North American Retail is also joining us to discuss our holiday performance and spring initiative. ", "Before we begin, we'd now point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal year. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations and based upon a variety of risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

", "Now let me outline that the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2011 results. He will also discuss strategies going forward. Mike Tucci will review the holiday season from the U.S. retail perspective and discuss key initiatives for the spring season ahead. Mike Devine will continue with details on financial and operational results of the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session that will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. We will then conclude with some brief summary comments. ", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and exceptional comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. Our performance clearly demonstrates the brands of vibrancy across channels and geographies and bodes well for future growth. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation. ", "In addition, we made continued progress against our global business initiatives, including international expansion, Men's, and digital media. We experienced strong response to our new collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. Further, the announcement today of the authorization of a new buyback program reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future.", "While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: First, earnings per share rose 33% to $1 compared with $0.75 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.26 billion versus $1.1 billion a year ago, an increase of 19%; third, Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17% to $1.1 billion from $934 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter accelerated, writing 12.6% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17%; and fifth, sales in Japan were even to prior year in constant currency and rose 8% in dollars; and finally, we continue to generate very strong sales growth and significant double digit comps in China.", "During the quarter, we opened two North American retail stores both in Canada, as well as one factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 347 Full Price and 129 factory stores in operation in North America. ", "Moving to Japan, one Coach shop-in-shop was opened in addition to a travel retail location. At quarter end, they were 171 total locations in Japan with 20 Full Price stores, including eight flagships, 117 shop-in-shops, 27 factory stores and seven distributor-operated travel retail locations.", "And in China, we added three new locations all in the mainland. At the end of the quarter, they were 52 Coach locations in China, including 10 in Hong Kong, two in Macau and 40 locations on the mainland in 16 cities. As we've discussed previously, we are building a multichannel distribution model in China, including flagships, retail stores, shop-in-shops and factory stores. ", "Indirect sales increased 28% to $168 million from $131 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into international wholesale and U.S. department stores given positive POS sales trends notably in the international business. Specifically, sales for the quarter at retail and international wholesale locations were very strong driven by double-digit gains in same-store sales and new distribution, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores rose 3% for the quarter.", "We estimate that the addressable U.S. Handbag and Accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the holiday quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in the preceding nine months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessory sales rose about 14% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, Handbag and Accessory sales rose 18%. Importantly, it now appears that the category will increase to $9 billion in FY '11, surpassing its previous peak achieved three years ago. ", "Separately, it's worth noting that we've seen continued modest improvement in our customer's outlook for the economy with over a third of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is improving, the best reading in over three years. Her intention to purchase Coach over the next year is significantly higher than where it was a year ago, with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months.", "Our total revenues in North America rose 17% with our directly operated businesses up similarly, driven by 12.6% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. Fueling these overall strong comp results were significant gains in conversion from prior year and modest traffic growth, partially offset by a slight decline in average transaction size. We were particularly pleased with the improvement at conversion since it's a driver that we have the most control over through product and service. Mike Tucci will discuss our performance in more detail in just a moment. ", "In Full Price stores, conversion was the primary contributor to our comp growth, while average transaction size was also modestly higher compared to prior year. Traffic trends was slightly lower year-over-year. In factory, where our business remained remarkably strong, we saw increases in traffic and conversion, while transaction size declined modestly. Our factory store growth continued to be driven by increased spending of factory channel, loyal Coach shoppers and by new consumers entering the franchise. ", "As noted, in Japan, we posted an 8% increase in dollars on a flat performance in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against continued contraction in the category. Our growth in share reflects the relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming more value-oriented.", "Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest-growing business. During the quarter, our sales continued to rise sharply from prior year fueled by distribution growth and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who is participating in this category and increasing numbers. While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. ", "Now I will turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail businesses. Mike?", "Michael Tucci", "Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Today, I'd like to review what was an exceptional holiday season touching on the three important productivity drivers within our North American business: product performance, digital strategy and coach.com results and progress on our new Men's initiative. ", "During the holiday quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, ensuring that we had a steady flow of new product throughout the period. A key to this effort was that we are somewhat less front-end loaded than in previous holiday seasons. In October, we relaunched the Madison collection featuring the new Sophia satchel in core leather, gathered leather and novelty applications, along with the fresh dotted op art logo. The reception was excellent and Madison was our top collection for the quarter.", "We also benefited from a first-time inclusion on Oprah's favorite things for holiday featuring our large patent Sophia in crimson and camel on network TV. During the quarter, we also updated Poppy and added new colors in our Madison and Kristin collections. In mid-December, we introduced the Alexandra tote group to capture peak sales with new products just before holiday. ", "Additionally, we generated excellent sales increases in women's accessories in the quarter, notably in money pieces and small bags. Our holiday product was supported with a comprehensive marketing plan, which highlighted a powerful gifting message for the shopping season. The emphasis of our marketing was item-driven across handbags, women's accessories and other gift ideas. Our campaign span coach.com, digital media and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic into stores and on the Internet. ", "Most generally, the merchandising and pricing strategies we initiated last year to create a more balanced and productive handbag assortment have become proven sustainable growth drivers in North America. Both handbags and women's accessories achieved positive comps in the quarter with handbag penetration holding at over 53% of sales with a high single-digit increase and average unit retails. This pricing power was driven by mix as leather and novelty continued to trend very well. ", "Looking forward, we're excited about our spring product initiatives as well. We've been pleased with our performance of our newest collection, Colette, which launched on 12/24 featuring new tote, hobo and carryall silhouettes. And for spring, our major product launch is the new Kristin collection, which will be introduced on February 18. Kristin is the strong assortment of beautiful hobos, totes and satchels offered in a range of leathers and novelty fabrications such as embossed python, linen signature and op art, appealing to a broad range of consumers. This relaunch will be supported by a comprehensive broad-based marketing campaign, including window vinyls, special shopping bag and a focused online and print media campaign.", "On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the season. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. Importantly, while we're bold in our pricing strategies, the gains in our Factory business drove improved operating margins. As we enter the spring season, we continue to see opportunity to leverage our factory model and increase productivity within this business. ", "A second important growth area in the quarter was digital. As we discussed last quarter, coach.com is a key marketing tool and it's becoming a very important revenue opportunity as well. We noted that our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness and drive store traffic while also maximizing e-commerce opportunities. In our second quarter, we saw the digital initiatives we've put into place for holiday such as the virtual gift guide and e-gift card pay off in the exceptional performance of our online business. In fact, coach.com is now our fastest growing Full Price channel in North America where both traffic and sales continue to grow at a double-digit pace during the holiday quarter. ", "Of course, our web presence is now global with informational sites in 16 countries, three of which U.S., Canada and Japan are e-commerce platforms. More generally, we will continue to use our digital capability as an enabler and customer touch point as we expand the Coach brand globally.", "Moving back to our stores, as Lew mentioned, we opened two new retail stores in Q2, Pickering in Ontario and Victoria, British Columbia, taking our first half openings to five, all of which are performing very well and ahead of plan. We also opened one new factory store, taking the first half total to eight, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores, which opened in Q1. These stores also opened strongly and are running above our pro formas. ", "In Full Price, based on the initial success of our first Men's stand-alone store in Bleecker Street and our Men's sales growth in core Coach stores, we'll be opening two additional Men's retail stores later this fiscal year, including the one at Garden State Plaza in New Jersey and one in Copley Plaza in Boston. This month, we dedicated more space and introduced a broader Men's product assortment to seven additional stores bringing our total Men's concept store count to 37 in North America, including eight flagships such as 595 Madison Avenue in New York.", "On the factory side, our Men's stores, which are located next to or nearby our most productive factory locations, are performing extremely well. We believe the strong consumer response we experienced reflect the strength of the Coach brand and the factory consumers focus on value and function. It confirms our belief that there is a particularly large opportunity for Men's in our factory channel. During the remainder of that FY '11, we're planning to open at least five more Men's factory locations.", "In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our Full Price productivity and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the spring season given the current sales trends in both old Full Price and factory channels. ", "With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Mike. Our strategies continue to be focused on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. Mike just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to global growth in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. ", "Moving on to distribution growth, as mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year compared to 8% last year. Starting in North America, we will open about five stores in the back half of fiscal 2011, bringing the total to about 10 new North American retail stores for the year. In addition, we'll open about 12 new factory stores during the balance of the year primarily to support our Men's initiative. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, similar to last year. ", "In China, as mentioned, our sales are growing rapidly as the market continues to develop swiftly. Last year, we doubled sales to over $100 million and are on track to generate sales of over $175 million this year. We are also now targeting $500 million in sales during FY '14, a 10% market share compared with 5% today. Driving this growth in addition to same-store sales, we expect to open about 25 new locations this year, increasing square footage by about 65%. Over the next few years, we're targeting to open about 30 new locations per annum. These locations will be primarily focused on the mainland and mirror our multichannel distribution model in North America and Japan. ", "In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our goal continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's, where we've already seen early success. This year, we now expect to open about 10 net new Coach Japan locations, including five Men's stores. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 6% this year, similar to last year.", "Beyond our directly owned businesses in China and Japan, we have a significant international wholesale business, generating over $400 million in sales at retail. Most of these sales come from other markets in Asia where the Coach brand resonates well and includes a sizable travel retail business catering to the growing population of Asian travelers. Given our focus in this area, we're also opening about 25 new distributor-operated locations in the Asian region during this fiscal year.", "Moving to Europe, it is a new region of expansion for Coach. To date, we've opened six boutiques in Printemps Department stores in France and expect to open one additional location within Printemps during the balance of the fiscal year. And through our joint venture with Hackett, we've launched the brand with four shop-in-shops in Spain and one in Lisbon with one more to go before year end, all within El Corte Ingl\u00e9s. ", "Last quarter, we also announced plans for our initial stores in London, a stand-alone store in the Westfield White City Mall, which is on plan to open in late February and a 5,100 square foot flagship on New Bond Street, our first global flagship store in the region coming this summer. We've been pleased with our initial results in Europe as our brand gains recognition with the domestic consumer and benefits from our popularity among tourists notably those who are Asian based. ", "Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff in September and a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as two prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Colette in Paris. While it's still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer. ", "In summary, we are excited about the global opportunity for Coach especially the emerging market potential given the rapid growth of the category and the foundation, which we have begun to build in the important Asian region. ", "At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?", "Michael Devine", "Thank you, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 19% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over three quarters of our business, up 17% and Indirect up 28% due to higher shipments into international wholesale accounts and the U.S. department stores. ", "Earnings per share for the quarter increased 33% to $1 even as compared to $0.75 in the year ago period as net income rose to $303 million from $241 million. Our operating income totaled $453 million in the second quarter, up 19% from $381 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 35.9% compared to 35.8% in the year-ago period. ", "In the second quarter, gross profit rose 19% to $915 million from $771 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.4% even with the prior year. Gross margin reflected the impact of channel mix and continued high levels of promotional activity in our factory channels, offset by sourcing cost improvements. ", "Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain modest leverage in the holiday quarter, which is our toughest quarter to do so. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved from prior year levels in the second quarter and represented 36.5% of sales versus 36.6% last year. Once again, our two primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan both provided leverage not only to their own P&Ls but to the corporate P&L as well, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiently.", "Inventories at quarter end were $367 million, up 36% from the end of last year's Q2 but down 4% on a two-year basis. Clearly, these inventory levels were key to delivering the exceptional holiday quarter. Our current inventories support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this spring. Generally, it's worth noting that we've been rightsizing our inventories this year, bringing them up to more appropriate levels to support our growing businesses, including new growth initiatives such as Men's, global expansion and our new distribution center in Asia. ", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $940 million as compared with $1.1 billion a year ago, despite repurchases of nearly $1.4 billion worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 7 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $55.72, spending a total of $388 million.", "Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $408 million compared to $364 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $382 million versus $347 million in the same period last year, due to higher net income offset by working capital items; our CapEx spending was $26 million versus $17 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our last two earnings calls, based on our plans for the year, we expect the CapEx will be about $150 million in FY '11, primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies. ", "Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results and as Lew and Mike have said, we're well positioned for the back half of our fiscal year. While we do not give specific guidance, as you know, I always think it's helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year. First, and most generally, we continue to target double-digit sales increases globally with double-digit earnings growth. And given the ongoing strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve high single-digit same-store sales growth in North America for the balance of the fiscal year, even in the face of more difficult spring compares. This is up from last quarter when we projected mid-single-digit growth. Additionally, we expect the continuation of our positive POS trends in our Indirect businesses. However, our second-half comparisons will be impacted by the timing of shipments in those Indirect businesses and the extra week in the prior year's fourth quarter. As you may recall, that extra week contributed $70 million of sales and $0.08 of EPS. ", "Second, we were excited that our top line sales growth drove higher levels of profitability in the first half, and while our previous comments regarding second-half gross margins still stand, our sales growth, coupled with controlled spending, will help offset both product cost and channel mix pressures. Therefore, we are reiterating our previous guidance of a full year FY '11 operating margin at about last year's level of about 31.5% on a 52-week basis. ", "Third, our tax rate is likely to stay in the area achieved in the first six months for the balance of the year as we continue to refine our international tax strategies. ", "Fourth, I wanted to briefly touch on share count. We would expect second-half share count to be similar to where we ended second quarter. ", "Before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an exceptional quarter for Coach. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. ", "Thank you all for joining us on our call today, and now Lew, Mike, Andrea, and I would be happy to take questions, which will be followed by brief closing remarks from Lew.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Lew, I guess the first question that I have is can you talk about what contributed to the upside in the comp versus the mid single-digit guidance, and sort of what impact it had through the P&L as you look at it? And the second question I have is for Mike is so where, if you could, put any buckets on the inventory increases with the various initiatives in terms of quantifying any of the specific buckets on each category?", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure, Bob. I'll actually ask Mike Tucci to answer your first question regarding comps.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure, good morning, Bob. We had strong performance across-the-board from a comp standpoint. When I look at the business by channel, the Full Price channel performed very well, balanced throughout the quarter, a really strong online quarter, which was very nice for us. We continue to see that channel grow from an interaction standpoint, as well as being able to drive revenue there. So that was very pleasing to us, and that did provide some upside. On the factory side, the quarter was extremely strong. And we felt like from a positioning standpoint, while we were able to drive the value in terms of our proposition, we did see some upside there based on ownership of product, the very strong handbag assortment, which drove sales as we went right into peak through Christmas and the week after. So I would say across-the-board, we had strength. We are pleased with the pricing power in handbags, which drove comp in both Full Price and factory. And we had a very strong accessories quarter and it feels like the cycle, from an accessories standpoint, was a driver of comp within the quarter as well.", "Michael Devine", "Bob, let me jump in on inventory levels. We've never answered inventory levels with that degree of specificity, but let me just say a couple of things about it. Our inventory investments are nicely aligned with our growth opportunities, and I think so that would spend a number of our initiatives. I would firstly say that our investment in factory inventories allowed us to capture the outperform during the holiday quarter that Mike just spoke to, that we wouldn't have been able to get to this time last year or so that investment was well placed. Also, investment in our Men's initiative is a part of the inventory driver. And then lastly, feeding inventory into the Asia region through the ABC is also a subset of where the inventory growth came from. But the thought I want to leave with in addition to enabling the growth is that our inventories are exceptionally clean and current and really position us well now that maximize sales as we move into the spring quarter, I'm sorry, the spring half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "I was hoping you could talk to us about your gross margin outlook. And in particular, in light of sourcing cost inflation, are you considering any very slight increases in pricing? Or are you simply redesigning into the, I guess, higher cost of goods? How are you thinking about gross margin progress throughout the calendar year of 2011 and with sourcing cost inflation coming? How does that impact your thinking?", "Lew Frankfort", "So I'll take the cost part of the gross margin equation, and then I'll ask Mike to speak to the pricing power. But Kimberly, we really are where we've been for about a year now in terms of talking about our gross margin rates. We did have called out inflationary pressures would have a dampening impact on our gross margin rates in the back half of our FY '11, and so that is still going to hold. The way we wanted to ask everyone to think about it, however, is also the guidance that we've given previously, the gross margin rates coming in for the year in the 72% to 73% range are still valid. That guidance that we give a couple of quarters ago, we still feel very good about. And of course, we could go on and list. In addition to the inflationary pressures, all the positive things that we're doing to move gross margin and help to offset those pressures, things like counter-sourcing materials, looking to migrate a substantial amount of our production into lower-cost countries out of China into countries like Vietnam and India as an example. And ultimately with the top line growth in the Asian region, most notably China. We'll start to get some help from channel mix as well. So there are a number of positives going on in the gross margin line that will help mitigate on the inflationary pressures.", "Michael Tucci", "On the Retail side and Full Price, there's absolutely a focus on finding pricing opportunity within handbags in particular using Q2 as a foundation where we took handbag average unit retails to $2.95. Again, we're targeting that $300 sweet spot, that was about a 9% improvement. We will continue to focus on that area in the back half, and there are a couple of things going our way. One is a shift towards leather, which helps us from a pricing standpoint on the retail side, so we do see an opportunity to impact average unit retail in the second half, on the Full Price side of the business that will carry through to factory. And I really want to be clear on the factory side. We do have pricing power. We were aggressive in the quarter. However, we were able to protect margins from a gross margin standpoint in factory and we drove tremendous operating margins. That effort positions us very well on the back half to continue to focus on unit retail gains and the factory channel productivity gains in the factory channel and drive operating margin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.", "Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I guess one clarification first on this channel mix that impacted the gross margin here. Was it deeper promos at factory or was it selling less made-for-factory products?", "Michael Tucci", "It was actually neither one. It was not deeper promos or discount rate, and factory was virtually the same. Our margin rate in factory was actually a touch higher. It's purely a function of volume. When we put that volume increase into the quarter, it moves a bigger percentage of our overall pie into the factory channel, which has an impact on gross margin, also has a very positive impact on operating income. Hence, you see the EPS impact that we were able to deliver. So that's the story on channel mix there.", "Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then on China, you guys talked about this $500 million goal by FY '14. Can you maybe give us a sense about how you think about profitability expectations in this channel, clearly, I guess higher gross margins. But how would you expect China by '14 to rank in terms of profitability versus your other channels?", "Lew Frankfort", "Mike D?", "Michael Devine", "Yes, Brian, I'll jump in on that one. We're very excited about it.  We already are achieving four-wall store operating margins in China that begin with the four. And so as we gained same-store sales, those four walls will only drive higher. And as we grow the top line, open additional stores, realize same-store sales year-over-year, will more than cover the infrastructure investment that we have on the ground there today. And so we will have a positive as we talked about, of course, one of our highest gross margin channels that it will also help gross margin from a channel mix perspective, but ultimately be a strong driver of operating income as we grow the top line and leverage the infrastructure there with these exceptionally strong four-wall operating margins from of the China stores.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I wanted to ask about the SG&A flow-through in the quarter. I know you've got a lot of investments going on. Can you help us understand how you think about managing SG&A, the duration of some of these investments? I know you got a lot of growth, as you've just talked about in China and other markets. How should we be thinking about modeling SG&A on those lines?", "Michael Devine", "Omar, I'll take that one as well. I was really pleased with that flow-through during Q2 and we really leverage the top line growth. If you go back actually as I did in preparation for this call and looked at the Q1 transcript, I actually called out that I didn't see us having SG&A leverage in the December quarter. And the reason there is, if you look across the four quarters of the year, you'll see that Q2 last year was in the mid-30s where at the balance of the quarter for the year are in the 43%, 44% range in terms of SG&A as a percentage of sales. Point being that we already have so much leverage in this holiday quarter because of the top line growth. So the fact that we outperformed in our North American business, that Japan did as well as it did with a tough market backdrop, really allowed those mature businesses to pull our leverage to the P&L that help us offset our investment spending in Europe, in other parts of Asia, in the new RK brand, et cetera. So I was very pleased that the flow-through was as strong as it was in Q2, and that really bodes well, for the flow-through coming our way in the back half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kristin Chen with Needham.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "I wanted to ask, so your opportunities to increase AUR at the Full Price stores, wondering if you could share with us on the really high-end bags, bags over $400, what was that penetration in the holiday quarter versus last year? And then on another note, as far as factory, what was the percentage of factory-exclusive product in the holiday quarter versus last year? I think last quarter you had mentioned that it had ticked up pretty substantially from the year before.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. There is absolute opportunity by price bucket in Full Price. We had a very good quarter. Average with handbag over $400, and that's just the benchmark, penetrations were double-digit, north of 10%, which is very good. We will focus on that opportunity, particularly given the fashion cycle that we're in around manipulated leathers, gathered leathers, treated leathers, some of the burnishing that we're doing on bags. So that offers us a pricing opportunity on the Full Price side as we move forward as we develop our assortments into spring and next fall. On the factory side, our product mix in factory was very much driven by made-for-factory product. Again, I think we were north of 80% in made-for-factory. In fact, it was 89% for the quarter, probably an all-time high, very little clearance, very little Full Price delete activity in the quarter in the factory channel, and that trend will continue. One of the things that we did this quarter, which helped us on the factory side, is that we corrected a flow imbalance that we had last year where we were chasing inventory in factory and doing a lot of pull-forward on spring goods to sell in the holiday quarter. We corrected that this year, and we are able to maximize the quarter with products that was actually planned within the quarter, and that also positions us very well as we entered into January.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "And what were the penetrations last year?", "Michael Tucci", "About 85%, in fact, made-for-factory.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then the $400 bags in Full Price last year?", "Michael Tucci", "About the same.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.", "Lorraine Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I wanted to follow up on the Men's business, both in Full Price and factory. Could you just give us a little bit more details about your plans for size of stores, expected productivity versus Women's and then what your expectations are for margins over the long term for Men's?", "Michael Tucci", "I'm sorry?", "Lew Frankfort", "The question focuses on Men's, Mike, what type of size of store we're contemplating, what kind of productivity are we achieving or anticipating relative to our Women's stores.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure, Okay. The Men's stores actually are being targeted smaller, probably less than 1,000 square feet of selling space, about 1,500 square feet overall. You can assume that productivity on those stores will be extremely high given our sales thresholds, so it's a very intimate environment. On the factory side, store size will be about 2,500 square feet. We're still working the model. We're also trying something or we're exploring something on the Full Price side where we'll have a dual-gender stores side by side with a separate Men's environment and Women's environment, and that may give us some productivity opportunity. So we actually see this from a margin standpoint in terms of store contribution, as well as gross margins, these stores are very attractive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.", "Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Lew, can you talk a little more about the Chinese consumer as you're learning more and more about this customer in terms of their preferences? Or is there any price resistance, some of the price points that have out there? Just a little bit more on the qualitative side about those consumers will be helpful.", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. What we're finding is that she wants to participate in the accessory category as she does in other modern fashion areas. And she's looking for authenticity, quality, value. She's discerning. She's thoughtful. We see her as embracing Coach. The purchase reintent is approaching 90%, which is remarkable, a level we have not seen in any other market, at any other state, at any early stage of our business. And we have the emerging Chinese middle-class consumer growing at a 30% rate. And she sees Coach as an expression of authentic New York fashion. She likes the spirit. She likes our heritage, and she sees us as offering exceptional value, and she's willing to pay two to three weeks of her annual income to purchase a Coach bag.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jennifer Black from Jennifer Black & Associates.", "Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates", "You've expanded your price points as well as the appeal in your Poppy collection with your most recent floor set. And I wondered if you plan to do the same with your other collections? And I also wondered if you already seen an impact on your blended AURs on Poppy?", "Michael Tucci", "I think as we get more time with each major collection, we're constantly moving and refining it. What's happening within Poppy, specifically, is that we're trying to capture the opportunity around trend in some novelty applications and leathers and mix materials. And that actually will have a positive impact on pricing within Poppy, which really flows through the balance of our collections as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Laura Champine with Cowen and Company.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC", "In Japan, even though you mentioned that you're still gaining share, sales weren't quite as strong as what we were looking for. Maybe you could comment on the pace of share gain or more importantly, what your long-term views are of the health of that market and how that'll color your investments there.", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, first, our business was even with last year, which is running about 10% ahead of the category during the corresponding period. We were very pleased with our results. We were able to maintain very strong profitability in that business. Ramp up, Men's, which offers a future opportunity. And I believe our share today is in the neighborhood of about 17% or 18%. We believe this opportunity starts to gain additional share in the years ahead because the Japanese consumer is extremely value-oriented. In terms of the future of the category, unfortunately, the category has been on a 10-year decline. And while we expect it to slow in the rate of decline, we're not optimistic considering the aging of the Japanese population and the absolute decline in population that the category will resume growth. So our focus is to be efficient, develop our Men's business, leverage our team in Japan to assist us in growing our Southeast Asian region, and we're doing all of those things.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer with Robert W. Baird.", "Erika Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I remember when you first started talking about lowering your handbag AUR, you would talk to more of a $200 to $300 sweet spot, and today, I think you mentioned $300, is that a subtle change in your philosophy?", "Michael Tucci", "No, our $300 target, and again, it's a benchmark. It's really where we built the assortment strategy going back almost two years now. What's happening as we anniversary that strategy and we continue to fine-tune the assortment and the cycles evolves, we will constantly look at ways to impact that from a growth and productivity standpoint, price being one of them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "As you talked about new sourcing opportunities and shifting production out of China into maybe India and Vietnam, what categories are moving? How do you see the percentages shifting on the impact on margin? And then just lastly, department store and wholesale business has done well. Are you gaining further selling space and what's changing there?", "Lew Frankfort", "I'll take the second part first, Dana. We do have a healthy department store business. We're pleased with its performance and our accounts there as well. We do have a very strong presence today, and situationally, we do gain real estate in some locations, but in general, we're very comfortable with the nature of our distribution and the size of the space we have. And we are looking forward to a good and strong spring season. Mike D, with regard to production?", "Michael Devine", "Sure, Dana, in terms of moving production out of China, we have a lot of opportunities available to us. We actually have implemented or started, effective January 1, under Jerry Stritzke's leadership enact a four-year plan and measure progress and look to drive that growth by measuring and revisiting it frequently. Our big opportunities, firstly, will be to move factory store production out of China and into these new markets. And we're also going to target small leather goods, which as you can imagine are more labor-intense than bigger bags. And we had a lot of success there in India already, and we'll continue to build on that success. And we believe we can get to somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% to 50% of unit production sourced out outside of China by the end of our four-year plan. So it's an important meaningful initiative that we're putting a lot of energy against.", "Lew Frankfort", "In terms of gross margin impact, obviously, labor costs are increasing in a variety of markets and so does a whole set of assumptions that we've made that we believe this migration in four years will benefit us by at least 150 basis points from what it would have been had we remained in China.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. I will now turn it back over to Lew for some closing remarks. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "We've had a lot of attention on individual metrics, and I think that's appropriate, and it's probably also appropriate for me to bring us back to our overall performance. Not only were we pleased with the exceptional top line growth but we were also equally pleased with the exceptional bottom line growth. And importantly, I think you need to appreciate that our organic strength has not been as strong as it had been for several years, and we are leaving this recession with all guns blazing and feeling very confident that we will continue to be able to drive top line, double-digit sales growth and double-digit earnings growth, and we're committed to that. The individual metrics will move around a bit. We measure ourselves primarily via on operating income and return to shareholders, EPS. And we will manage our balance sheet tightly. ", "I just want to also comment very briefly on inventory. About 2/3 of the inventory growth that we have year-over-year is to actually support new locations in terms of model stocks, as well as a new Asia distribution center. So it's only about our inventory like-for-like is up about, we believe -- our estimate about 15%. So thank you, and have a good day, everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you.

With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO.  Mike Tucci, President of North American Retail, is also joining us.

Mike Devine will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter, as well as our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2007.  Following that, we'll hold the Q&A session that will end by 9:30 a.m.", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks Andrea, and welcome everyone.  As you know, we once again announced excellent top line growth and even stronger bottom line results of 23% and 40% respectively for the quarter just completed.  Our results are especially impressive as they represent an acceleration in our performance, notably in our US full-price businesses.", "Clearly, there were two drivers of Coach's growth.  First, the continued entry of new consumers to the franchise, many of whom are trading up to the Coach brand. And second, existing consumers with whom Coach is gaining a greater share of their growing accessory wardrobe.  Both consumer groups are responding enthusiastically to the higher levels of what we call distinctive newness in FY '07 as two of three major lifestyle platforms planned for the year have been introduced other the last four months.", "Some highlights of our first fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 40% to $0.34 compared with $0.24 per share in the prior year as net income rose 34% to $126 million.  ", "Second, net sales totaled $554 million versus $449 million a year ago, a gain of 23%.  ", "Third, direct to consumer sales rose 29% to $404 million from $315 million in the prior year.", "Fourth, US same-store sales for the quarter rose 21.4% with retail stores up 16% and factory stores up 27.1%.  It's worth mentioning that in US retail, we have achieved a double-digit comp in the first quarter in each of the last five fiscal years.  ", "Finally, sales in Japan rose 21% in constant currency driven by new stores, mid-single digit retail comps and expansions as we continue to rapidly grow our market share.", "During the quarter, we opened 12 US retail stores, including five new markets for Coach: Evansville, Indiana; El Paso, Texas; Greenville, South Carolina; South Bend, Indiana; and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, as well as one net factory store.  Thus far, the performance of these full-price, new stores are averaging $2.5 million on an annualized basis well ahead of our plan.  At quarter end, there were 230 full-price and 87 factory stores in operations.", "In Japan, eight locations were added while two were expanded.  At quarter end, there were 130 total locations in Japan with 21 full-price stores, including eight flagships, 94 shop-and-shops, 11 factory stores and four wholesale locations.", "Indirect sales increased 11% to $150 million from $134 million in the same period last year.  Results were driven by strong POS gains in U.S. businesses, including department stores and B2B, while the timing of shipments to wholesale accounts negatively impacted top line results.  In fact, U.S. department store results at POS continue to be excellent, running up in the mid-30s on a comp basis last year.", "Most broadly, we once again effectively executed our growth plans and realized companywide performance that outpaced our stated goals.  We were particularly pleased with the acceleration in Coach U.S. retail stores which enjoyed significant increases in traffic and conversion, while as expected, the average transaction remained unchanged from prior year.", "Results in our full-price businesses, both Coach retail stores and U.S. department stores, continued to be driven by the monthly flow of innovative and relevant product notably in women's bags and small accessories.  Our U.S. factory store business remained remarkably strong throughout this quarter, given the vibrancy of the Coach brand, the strength of our proposition and continued sales growth in premium factory malls.", "We were also very pleased with the performance of Coach Japan this quarter where sales grew 21% in yen and 16% in dollars as our market share continued to increase rapidly.  Last quarter, our growth in Japan was fueled primarily by distribution through both new stores and expansions augmented by mid single-digit, comparable retail locations sales.", "Finally, as always, we were particularly pleased with the significant improvement in operating margins.  While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials, I wanted to give you this recap and tell you how pleased we are with Coach's first quarter performance.", "As you know I have also asked Mike Tucci to join us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives.  ", "Mike Tucci", "Thank you, Lew.  As mentioned in our release, our transitional and fall offerings were remarkably successful across all categories and collections.  We began the quarter with Signature Stripe, our new weekend casual collection, and the first of three completely new lifestyle platforms for FY '07.  This collection was immediately embraced by our customers who loved the lightweight, reversible Coach silhouettes and great matching accessories at sharp price points.", "Also in July, we brought back an updated Soho collection in leather, suede and classic signature, which included novelty lace styles.  In August, the Chelsea handbag group offered in leather, nubuck and optic signature for the first time offered a satchel and was very well-received.  In September, our popular Hamptons collection returned for its seventh season and performed strongly against all fabrications, leather, suede and signature, as well as embossed leather.", "To open October, we brought in Legacy, our second new lifestyle platform for FY '07.  The collection represents a return to our craftsmanship heritage with truly iconic Coach elements in a broad assortment of handbag, accessories and wearables.  Our Legacy collection is a key focus and major investment for holiday.", "As always, we're excited about the ten key item concepts for the holiday season.  Collectively, we estimate that they will represent over 50% of our business in the holiday selling period.  They are:", "As we have mentioned before, we're introducing the Castle collection of jewelry in November, primarily bracelets and a few necklaces in select stores.  Of course, we'll also have a number of gifts under $100 geared to our more price-sensitive customers.  As always, our holiday floor set will be installed on the Monday before Thanksgiving with a focus on clean and bold presentations of our key holiday statements and items.  A front table change in all stores will take place in early December to coincide with the launch of Resort, a tight capsule of Legacy Signature silhouettes.", "On the marketing front, our expanded holiday catalog featuring the world of Coach will be in homes in mid-November and will include our Resort collection.  We're also looking forward to introducing our special holiday gift guide, which will be used as an in-store selling tool focused on our important key items and collections.  It will be in stores in early November and it will be put in each Coach consumer's shopping bag with their purchase.", "Finally on the in-store experience, as you know, Coach service is an initiative we implemented two years ago to enhance our consumer's in-store experience and ultimately drive conversion.  This comprehensive training program teaches interactive selling and engagement techniques to our sales associates.  For FY '07, the program has evolved, focusing on new opportunities to deliver consistent customer service during the holiday season.", "Our Q2 service strategy reinforces the key behaviors for holiday success, customer engagement, effective fulfillment of product and gifting needs and graciously assisting multiple customers at the same time.  At Coach, we want to be as well known for great service as we are for our products.", "In Q1, we introduced an enhanced ClientTrack with more sophisticated features and capabilities to support our field team.  This automated client selling tool keeps track of customers, their product needs, lifestyle and shopping preferences and recent purchases.  The program also helps the store manager facilitate timely follow-up to customer requests, communicating to our customers regarding the arrival of new or out-of-stock items in store, in-store events and gift-giving occasions.", "With ClientTrack, we've added the ability to create customer wish lists, accessible in stores across the country.  We expect these enhancements to play a significant role in our holiday service strategy.", "In addition, during this year's holiday season, we will incorporate key Coach service learnings and operational best practices from last year, including:", "Simply put, our objective this holiday is to leverage our POS transaction speed with improved service and operating standards to move the lines through the store faster and improve conversion.  Naturally, many of these initiatives introduced for holiday will continue in our second half.", "With that, I'd like to return the discussion to Lew to discuss our overarching strategies.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Mike.  Over the last several years, we have generated consistently strong results by staying true to our proven formula for success.  Our proposition is based upon five differentiating elements, which together set us apart from the competition: our distinctive brand, our leadership position, our very loyal consumer base, our multi-channel international distribution and our focus on innovation, value and the consumer.", "We have a well-articulated roadmap and clearly defined growth strategies implemented by a seasoned management team who share a common vision with considerable experience working together as a team.  ", "As most of you know, we have been implementing four key strategies that focus on sustaining growth.  First, most generally, we're building market share in a rapidly growing North American women's accessories market by leveraging our unique position as an accessible luxury lifestyle brand. As part of this strategy, we've been emphasizing new usage occasions, such as weekend, through such collections as Signature Stripe and more sophisticated products such as Legacy to heighten our cachet especially with our top-tier customers.", "Our second strategy is the continued rapid growth in North American retail.  We plan to add about 100 U.S. retail stores over the next three years, bringing the retail store base to over 300.  During this year, we intend to open at least 30 new retail stores.  These will include ten new full-price store markets for Coach, five of which we mentioned already opened during the first quarter and five coming in the balance of FY '07.  In aggregate, these 30 new stores will add nearly 80,000 square feet or 14% to our full-price retail store base during FY '07.", "In keeping with our strategy to expand our most productive locations, we will also be expanding at least eight retail stores.  These expansions will add a total of about 7,000 additional square feet or a bit over 1% to our total full-price retail space.  In addition, we are also planning on opening three more factory stores in FY '07 and expanding two more outlets, given the success we've experienced through our previous outlet store expansions. In total, factory store development in FY '07 will add nearly 26,000 square feet or 9% to our factory store base.  Thus in total, the square footage of our North American Coach stores will grow over 13% in FY '07.", "Third, outside the US, we're continuing to rapidly grow market share with the Japanese consumer from about 9% this past year to a goal of 15% during the next few years.  We are driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new retail locations and by expanding existing ones.  Overall, we expect that eventually we will have a total of at least 180 Coach locations in Japan.", "During this fiscal year, we expect to open 15 to20 net new locations in Japan, a net increase of at least 25,000 square feet or at least 13% to the store base.  We also plan to expand about 15 of our most productive retail and factory locations in FY '07 adding over 7,000 square feet or about 4% to our retail base.  ", "Thus, in FY '07, overall, we're targeting Coach Japan's constant currency sales to increase about 20% from the prior year.   Our increases will primarily come from distribution growth with mid single-digit comps expected for the year.  As we've said previously, the opportunities of our core markets of North America and Japan are abundant.  Notably in East Asia and especially in Greater China, we're intensifying our efforts to build awareness by creating a presence that will position us for meaningful sales in the future.  ", "During the first quarter, a net of five new Coach locations opened internationally including our first in Shenzhen, China, along with our first in the UAE.  We also renovated and expanded our Shanghai Times Square location, which is experiencing substantial sales increases.  It remains our intention to open at least 10 locations in the major cities on the mainland of China during the next two years, while also continuing to expand our retail store base in Hong Kong.  ", "Lastly, of course, we continue to have an overall focus on improving the rate of profitability so that our bottom line results continue to outpace top-line performance.  In closing, these strategies and actions are designed to enable us to achieve excellent financial results through our planning horizon.  ", "I will now turn it over to Mike Devine for further detail on our financials.  ", "Mike Devine", "Thank you, Lew.  Lew and Mike T have just taken you through our highlights and strategies.  Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.  ", "As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 23% with direct to consumer which represents over three-quarters of our business, up 29%; and indirect of 11%.  While our POS sales in U.S. department stores actually accelerated in the mid 30s for the quarter.  The timing of shipments to wholesale customers muted our reported revenues for the indirect channels.  ", "Net income for the quarter increased 34% to a $126 million, or $0.34 per share as compared to $94 million, or $0.24 per share in the year ago period.  This was ahead of the analysts' consensus estimate of $0.31 for the quarter.  Our operating income rose 36% to a $198 million in the first quarter versus a $145 million in the same period last year.  Operating margin in the quarter was 35.7% compared to 32.3% in the year-ago quarter, a 340 basis improvement.  In the first quarter, gross margin increased by 70 basis year-over-year from 76% flat to 76.7%.  For the quarter, gains from product mix and supply chain initiatives drove this improvement, while channel mix and a weak yen remained negatives.  ", "SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were well below prior year levels in the first quarter and represented 41% of sales versus 43.7% last year.   We were very happy to deliver significant leverage from our U.S. store base driven by the strong comps reported for both channels.  We also saw excellent leverage on what I call our semi-fixed corporate functions.  ", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $301 million, up about 40% above prior year levels, driven by both the investment in key holiday initiatives Mike T discussed, which position us well for the expected well strong selling season as well as the timing of receipts.   It should be noted that our two-year inventory growth of 47% is well under our two-year sales growth of 61%.  Further, this two-year inventory increase allows us to support 57 net new U.S. stores and 25 net new locations in Japan, and substantially increased sales levels over the two-year period.  ", "Accounts receivable balances rose $13 million, or 13%, while days sales outstanding declined by three days from 36 to 33 days.  Cash and short-term investments stood at $456 million, as compared with $448 million a year ago.  It should be noted that the quarter end cash balance reflects the repurchase of about $720 million of Coach common stock during the interim 12 months.", "The company repurchased 5 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $29.99 during the first fiscal quarter, thereby completing the existing program.  As noted in our release, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million program effective through June of 2008.  ", "Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $81 million compared to $55 million last year during Q1.  Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $44 million versus $33 million in the same period last year, primarily due to higher net income. CapEx spending, mainly for new stores and renovations was $36 million, versus $22 million in the same quarter a year ago.  ", "Now, I'd like to provide you with some of our updated goals for fiscal 2007.  For the second fiscal quarter, we are targeting net sales of about $785million, representing a year-on-year increase of about 21%.  With US comparable store sales gains of at least 10% in the retail channel and mid-teens in the factory channel, and at least mid single-digit total comp gapes at Coach Japan.  ", "For Japan, we've previously reported full price Coach Japan comps only.  Going forward, we plan to increase our disclosure to combine full price and factory, or total comps.  This will provide a better bridge to our overall direct-to-consumer sales results.  For the first quarter of '07, our total comps were up high single-digits, consistent with last year's first quarter when full price comps rose at a mid single-digit pace and total comp was high single-digit.  ", "Second quarter operating income is targeted to be up over 22% year-over-year and earnings per share of $0.56, an increase of about 26%.  Our current goals for the full fiscal year are net sales growth of over 20% to about $2.55 billion with at least 10% comparable store sales gains in both the U.S. retail and in factory channel in the second half of the year; and a total sales increase in Japan of about 20% in constant currency, driven primarily by distribution growth through new store openings and expansions augmented by at least mid single-digit total same location sales growth.", "We're targeting an operating margin up about 37.5%, which assumes the gross margin at last year's extraordinary levels over the balance of FY '07 and further SG&A leverage.  Operating income dollar growth of over 25% above FY '06.  Interest income of about $35 million, or about flat to FY '06 will add the pre-tax income, while net income will be somewhat offset by a higher tax rate rising to about 38.5% for the year, due to the fact that incremental taxable income is being taxed at higher rates.", "Including these factors, we expect to generate EPS growth of at least 28% which will produce earnings per share of at least $1.63 compared with analysts' consensus estimate of $1.58.  For FY '07, we continue to expect CapEx to rise to about $150 million, primarily for new stores and expansions, both here and in Japan. As Lew noted, we will be opening at least 35 new US retail factory stores, and continuing our North American expansion programs.  In Japan, we plan to open about 15 to 20 net new locations.  ", "While these are our current goals, our actual results may vary from these targets based upon a number of factors including those discussed under the business of Coach, Inc and risk factors in our annual report on form 10-K. Coach also does not assume any obligation to update these targets as the year progresses.  ", "In summary, we're confident that our growth strategies will enable us to continue to gain share in the large and growing global market for fine accessories and gifts.  Thank you all for your attention.  Now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I will be happy to take some questions.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you.  With the Q&A, please note that each questioner is asked to keep their questions to a single one.  Thanks and let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Bob Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers.", " Bob Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Hi, good morning.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning, Bob.", " Bob Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Congratulations on the terrific results.  The question that I have is, you talked a little bit about your ability to attract new consumers to the franchise during this quarter.  Can you elaborate a little bit more on some of the comments you made last month around what you view as the current market size and the growth opportunities in both units and dollars domestically?", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. First, our department store sales grew about 30% at POS in the United States this past quarter. When we look at it, we realize that from a dollars perspective, while our market share is about 25% or was 25% last year, the actual units that we sold in department stores only represented about 10% of their sales. As a result, with our increase of about 30% in a category growing between 10% and 15% in department stores, our actual units sold is only about 12% of total units sold in department stores.", "In all of our discussions with department store leadership as well as in our consumer research, what we're finding is that many consumers are trading up from lower, both private label brands as well as brands that we have not considered part of our overall set.  ", "So overall, where we have historically said the market is about $5 billion, that does not take into account any consumers trading up from brands such as the Le Sport Tech, DKNY, Liz Claiborne, Banana Republic and so on. When we add these brands in as well as private label, it looks as if the market is probably somewhere between $7 billion to $7.5 billion; that is the addressable market.  ", "So instead of having overall market share of about 25%, it looks to us that our market share is probably somewhat less than 20%, which suggests that the opportunity for us to have sustained, excellent growth in North America is larger than we had contemplated ourselves.", " Bob Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Evelyn \u2013 UBS.", " Jeff Evelyn \u2013 UBS", "Thank you, good morning. My congratulations also.  Lew, a question, sort of a follow-up on what Bob had asked. This was the first quarter, I believe, your average transaction stabilized versus the prior year. Was there a shift in the product offerings on the floor? Was there something unique to this quarter?  Could it reflect that maybe you are getting more new consumers trading up?", "Then as part of this, if your average transaction does not keep increasing, what happens to the resultant lack of operating leverage per transaction? Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort", "First off, I think you pretty much answered it. There are a lot of new consumers entering our franchise. We estimate that as much as 30-35% of our sales in our first quarter are consumers new to our franchise.  ", "What happens, Jeff, is when we actually pass higher traffic, we focus much more heavily on conversion rather than UPTs.  What we enjoyed this quarter, against higher traffic, is higher conversion. Also, there was not as much of a focus on UPT growth.  We think, actually, average transaction is going to grow in the second quarter, by mid single-digits, low to mid single-digits.", "Jeff Evelyn \u2013 UBS", "Okay, thank you.", "Mike Devine", "Jeff, if I could speak to the operating margin comments, you can see actually if you look at our SG&A leverage that we were able to convert this traffic at very profitable levels and drove increased operating margins through the P&L.", "Jeff Evelyn \u2013 UBS", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Ojay \u2013 Credit Suisse.", " Paul Ojay \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Thanks. I had a question on Legacy.  Can you talk about what percent of shop Legacy has represented here in its early days? Can you update us on where you are with the Legacy shop-and-shops? How many are you planning to do? Where are you in that process, and also, if you could just share with us the ending diluted share count?", "Mike Tucci", "Sure. On Legacy, I think it's important to understand, step back just for a minute. We actually piloted Legacy in the spring season which indicated to us a significantly greater appetite for Legacy products; albeit at higher price points and a more sophisticated offering. We went back in and did invest more heavily particularly in key silhouettes like the Alley and the Shoulder Zip. It's early, you know, we're in our third full week of the Legacy installation, which includes 15 in-store shops in the United States in our premier locations. ", "But we're very, very pleased with what's happening, penetrations in Legacy including wearables and related categories are consistently north of 20% in our stores. We do believe it is a driver of transaction size given the price point. The Legacy shops are consistently outperforming the overall average of 20% on a week-in and week-out basis. So that focus in the stores, the defined merchandising area with service elements and presentation highlights is really helping. ", "I think the last piece on Legacy is that it's not simply a Q2 initiative. This is a major platform that we will continue to focus on throughout the year. We'll look at in-store opportunities in the back half of FY'07. We're currently looking at opportunities for FY'08 for additional locations within our stores. Concept ideas that we can expand on and really give the customer an opportunity to see Coach in a more broad spectrum and product offering.", "Mike Devine", "Paul, your question on share count, the quarter end was very close to the quarterly average; about 1 million shares lower at 372.3.", " Paul Ojay \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Shik \u2013 Stifel Nicholas. ", " David Shik \u2013 Stifel Nicholas", "As you discussed ClientTrack and it's part of the suite of things that you are talking about going into holiday, how much of ClientTrack this year for holiday is ramping up on the learnings you developed? How much is new functionality of the system or things you are trying within ClientTrack?", "Mike Tucci", "On Client Track, we are in our 16th month of ClientTrack as a performance tool and a customer service tool in our stores. Now the big enhancements this year are around integration of our database, so that basically all of our consumer data and systems can talk to one another, and you can easily toggle back and forth to help identify customer needs. Purchase history, as an example, is an enormous aid in helping to convert customers and get them what they want, and that is a new enhancement that will be available to our customers for Q2, we launched it in Q1.", "Things like wishlisting and gifting opportunities. All of these actions result in what we call customer follow-ups, or to-dos.  To give you an idea of the ramp-up, in Q1 we saw almost 60,000 customer follow-ups in our stores versus around 30,000 from a year ago. So we know that this is a tool with the enhancements that is being used. We measure against it at a store level on a daily basis, and it's essentially an electronic client selling book, very modern and very efficient and very much in keeping with how our sales associates think.  So we see it as a real opportunity for us within Q2. ", "Just to give you a little flavor, some of the things that are most popular are customers asking to be notified on new products launches in store.  Our editorial database, where anything that is featured on an editorial basis is cross-referenced to ClientTrack, so should a customer call and ask about an item that they might see in the press, we can immediately reference them and contact them when we get that item for them. So we're feeling like it's a major tool for us and the stores have embraced it and it's performing well.", "David Shik \u2013 Stifel Nicholas", "So just to boil it down for me, so in the 16th month, we shouldn't look at it as lapping. It's grown in its usefulness year-over-year?", "Mike Tucci", "No question.", "David Shik \u2013 Stifel Nicholas", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Hurley - Chelsea Advisory Group. ", " Jim Hurley - Chelsea Advisory Group", "Good morning and congratulations to all.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you, Jim.", " Jim Hurley - Chelsea Advisory Group", "You're welcome. My question is about Japan. Obviously very good results out of that region, which has not been the case for some of your competitors, and I just wanted to understand the integration efforts with CJI, and specifically if you are able to see operating expense leverage in the first fiscal quarter?", "Mike Devine", "I'll take the latter part, the financial answer, Jim, is that we did not see leverage there. We're continuing as we guided the Street to build infrastructure in Japan and we'll see that happen throughout '07. So in none of our projections or any of our forward-looking guidance have we planned on that happening in '07 and we are continuing to build that infrastructure so we can capture some of the integration opportunities that we believe we have there.", "Lew Frankfort", "Was there another part to your question, Jim?", " Jim Hurley - Chelsea Advisory Group", "Just in terms of how that business is developing. It seems like the strength has been maintained when that's not been the case for the rest of the market. Anything that you're doing on a merchandising front?", "Lew Frankfort", "I think the most important thing to appreciate Jim, and I know you do, is that we have an alternative to the established brands. We offer a value-based proposition. Our accessible luxury proposition resonates especially well in Japan with the younger consumers and what we're finding, as we open in regional markets as well as our continued presence in existing markets is a very strong penchant towards Coach. They're embracing our monthly product flow, the innovation that we're offering in product responding very well.", " Jim Hurley - Chelsea Advisory Group", "Great. Thanks and congrats.", "Lew Frankfort", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Julie Shaw - Merrill Lynch. ", " Julie Shaw - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. I had a question regarding operating margins. Your guidance seems to have a little bit less margin expansion built in from Q1 significant increases. How much expansion do you think is left and how do you get to these peak operating margins?", "Mike Devine", "Well, we're guiding, Julie, to 37.5% operating margin level for the company for the full year. I don't think there are too many other retailer fashion stories that are achieving that. That's 150 basis points approximately above what we had last year. We believe that there is opportunity beyond that as we talked about many times, particularly being driven through the SG&A leverage that you saw us capture in Q1. We see with top line growth in the high-teens to 20% that we're guiding to through our long-range planning horizon, we can continue to deliver SG&A leverage well into the future and see an operating margin that at some point will begin to approach a 40% level. ", " Julie Shaw - Merrill Lynch", "Great. And how much has mix, the product mix of legacy played into the gross margin expansion this quarter?", "Mike Devine", "Yes. That, that collection is consistent with our extraordinary gross margin levels across our product offerings.  So it's on balance equivalent to the levels we're achieving throughout our product offering.", "Lew Frankfort", "Although, it had no impact in Q1 since we introduced legacy at the beginning of October.", " Julie Shaw - Merrill Lynch", "Right, right.  Of course.  Thank you very much.", "Lew Frankfort", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Margaret Major - Goldman Sachs. ", "Margaret Major - Goldman Sachs", "Congratulations on the great results.  I have a question about the pricing strategy for your full-price stores.  Can you just talk about what's possible in terms of the upside for price points?  I read a while back in one of the trade publications that Reed thinks that your prices, your stores and your customer would be accepting of even higher prices than what you're at right now, with regard to say $800 being the upper limit. So if you could talk about that and how you might evolve the pricing in stores?  ", "And then, I would like to ask about Japan, too. If you wouldn't mind running through how FX impacts the Japanese results, not just on the translation of the top line, but on gross margin.  Because if you are sourcing in dollars and selling in a strong yen, wouldn't that be a positive? ", "Lastly, with regard to the inventory, why do you think you needed to bring things in earlier this year versus last year? Is that just a sign of how bullish you are about holiday?  Thanks. ", "Lew Frankfort", "Mike, why don't you take the second and third question?", "Mike Devine", "We will take them in reverse order, Margaret. On the inventory, the timing is more about last year.  We actually as we closed the September quarter last year, we were about $25 million light on receipts. So it's more about last year being light. Let me just say, this time of year as we're gearing up for holiday, we can receive as much as $4 million in receipts in a single day. So just so you can gauge, that's maybe just a little more than a week's worth of timing.  ", "That being said, we have heavied up our inventory investments to speak to the ten strategies that Mike talked to especially in the Legacy opportunity, and we're feeling great and that our inventories are exceptionally clean and well positioned going into the multi-robust selling period.   And you'll see inventories back in line year-over-year, I think, at the close of the next quarter. ", "Your next question was about FX, and we actually have that as a gross margin negative because we're buying inventories now with a weaker yen and therefore it costs us more yen to convert to dollars to buy the bags. So although, we've hedged pretty effectively, there still is a modest negative impact to our gross margin rate as a result of the weaker yen. In the prepared remarks, I talk about weaker yen and channel mix driven by the success of factory being negative.  The two combined hurt us about 30 bp in Q1.", "Margaret Major - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks.  And then, the pricing strategies, Lew? ", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. First, Margaret, as you well know, we position ourselves as a brand that will always give consumers excellent value. Our pricing strategy remains consistent, that is wherever we are able to pass along to consumers in terms of our lower cost structures resulting in lower prices, we're pleased to do. More generally, what we are finding is that we have a capacity because of the breadth of our franchise to offer price points much higher than we do, with great success. ", "Mike Tucci was talking about Legacy running over 20%. The average handbag in Legacy is over $400. Conversely in Signature Stripe, which we introduced in July, the average handbag price was in the low $200s, and what we're trying to do is strike a very fine balance by not alienating the value conscience consumer and yet at the same time, doing a better job attracting the luxury consumer. ", "That\u2019s why we tier our stores by the type of consumer and in addition, we have a rapidly growing Coach by special request business that the luxury oriented consumer, even who shops in one of our core stores can purchase an item that might not be available, through Coach by special request. We think the potential is basically boundless. We just have to be careful in the way in which we move.", "Margaret Major - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Did you sell out of the $10,000 alligator bag in the catalog?", "Lew Frankfort", "So far, three out of five have sold.", "Margaret Major - Goldman Sachs", "I'm sure there will be gone by Christmas. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ruloux - Wachovia. ", " John Ruloux - Wachovia ", "Hi, guys, great quarter. My question really goes back to the comments about the new stores running ahead of plan. Why do you think that is? Are you getting better locations? Maybe opening in markets where the business has been a little bit stronger historically? I wonder if you could comment on that and what it means for your return on investment?  Is that creeping up on the new store side?", "Mike Tucci", "I do believe that we are getting very strong locations within the malls and complexes that we are going into. We focus on that. We are a preferred brand for mall developers and we attract, I think, a very strong consumer to the enterprise, so let's leverage that we think about all day long. ", "We like to think that our Coach stores are a beacon for the mall developers and for consumers and I think most important what we see happening is this idea that consumers are trading up. There is a very, very strong awareness of Coach as a brand in market s like El Paso and Rogers, Arkansas, and when we open a store there, we have people waiting for us. Woo offer the same commitment, same merchandise presentation that is consistent with stores in the rest of the country, and they're immediately coming in. We're converting them and we are developing relationships with them.", " John Ruloux - Wachovia ", "Do you have a little bit more leverage when signing a lease on the cost side so net-net better productivity combined with perhaps better expense control as your ROI, you know, up pretty significantly on the new store side?", "Mike Devine", "That would be accurate. ", "Lew Frankfort", "I\u2019ll just say one last thing.  The thing that is most exciting, like when Mike and I visited El Paso, we spoke with consumers and the staff, they told us 30% to 40% in the first few months were new to Coach.  When we spoke to individual consumers, they told us they welcomed us to El Paso. They were really enthusiastic. We have long queues outside of our store the day we opened. ", " John Ruloux - Wachovia ", "Thanks, keep it up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities.", " Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities", "Thank you. Congratulations on another fabulous quarter. Can you give us the percentages of limited edition product in the quarter versus the quarter before in novelty?", "Mike Tucci", "Total special product as we define it, was around 14%which is consistent with where we were a year ago in Q1. Within that, limited edition product was around 4%. Again, consistent with where we were last year in Q1.", "Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities", "Are there plans to try to grow that percentage over time? I mean, I think this is probably the first time where it's been consistent versus it growing as a percentage of sales.", "Mike Tucci", "I think we're constantly looking at our pricing mix, and importantly , we're actually talking internally about reviewing our definitions. One of the things that's happening out there is that we're seeing tremendous performance of what we call limited edition and special product in all stores and in particular, in core stores. So maybe what we've done is brought the consumer up and we raised our game. We may need to be more surgical internally about what we define as limited edition so that we can really push ourselves to find what those upper price boundaries are . So I think stay tuned on that one. We're pleased with where we are , but it's a constant review and it's driven by our investments and the product that we develop . ", "Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities", "Okay, and with respect to factory doing so well, are you attempting to cross market to the factory customer and the Coach customers? I mean, I know there's a small percentage that cross-shops. Do you try and separate that when you market, or do you try and target , you know, that customer both ways ?", "Mike Tucci", "We don't. We do not cross market at all. We do have a consistent service standard that we believe we treat customers graciously and with respect in any Coach store, be it a factory store or full price store, but we do not cross-market between full price and factory stores in any way.", "Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities", "It is still about 25%? ", "Lew Frankfort", "Further, we don't do any outreach for factory.", "Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities", "Okay. It's still about 25% crossover?", "Lew Frankfort", " 20%.", "Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities", "Thank you, good luck for the holidays.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Irwin Roberts \u2013 HSBC.", " Irwin Roberts \u2013 HSBC", "Good morning and congratulations. I just wanted to come back to the margin guidance , operating margin . You said it should be up about 150 basis points this year and. essentially linked to SG&A leverage . I think you have repeated quarter after quarter that the gross margin levels should be about the same as last year , but it was up 70 basis points in Q1 . I was under the impression that there should be a convergence of the comp rates between full price and outlets in, say, six to nine months . Is there a reason why gross margin can't continue to expand on a full year basis?", "Mike Devine", "The biggest factor is if you look at the compares year over year, what you will see is the Q1 compare was the easiest that we have faced in '07 . The Q1 rate was   76% in Q1, and 78% for the remaining three quarters of '06. So we're up against a tough compare, and we feel very good about being able to meet that challenge and get to the 78% level for our year-ago period.", " Irwin Roberts \u2013 HSBC", "Thanks.", "Lew Frankfort", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brad Stevens - Morgan Keegan. ", " Brad Stevens - Morgan Keegan", "Congratulations on a great quarter. Going back to the premium product question , what percentage of your Japanese business is now at the premium price points , and is there potential longer term to increase your 70% markup for doing business there ?", "Lew Frankfort", "Do the second part, Mike, in terms of the markup and I will talk about the premium. I am not quite sure what he is saying. Is there an opportunity for to us increase the markup? Is that what?", " Brad Stevens - Morgan Keegan", "Yes. ", "Lew Frankfort", "I mean, there's always an opportunity that we have to weigh that against the cost and we're very comfortable with the relative positioning between the United States and Japan, and we're not looking to make any adjustment in the relative pricing of Japan to the United States. ", "In terms of our limited edition product, in Japan, we're only scratching the surface . For example , last quarter, as part of our 65th anniversary, we presented a series of four bags that were numbered and I believe the total quantity was 2,000, and we sold through that enormously quickly. The Japanese consumers are particularly appreciative of limited edition product and again, we're in early days there.", " Brad Stevens - Morgan Keegan", "All right. Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort", "You're welcome. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you all for joining us today. That concludes the conference call . Of course, Mike and I will be available for questions throughout the day . Thanks and have a great one. ", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin. ", " Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. Mike Tucci, President of North American Retail, is also joining us. ", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current and future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations, based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate customer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. ", "Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. We presently expect to update our estimates each quarter only. However, the failure to update this information should not be taken as Coach's acceptance of these estimates on a continuing basis. Coach may also choose to discontinue presenting future estimates at any time. ", "Now, let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide the overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2007 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Mike Tucci will review the holiday season from a U.S. retail perspective and discuss key initiatives for the spring season ahead. Mike Devine will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter, as well as our outlook for the second half and full fiscal year 2007. Following that, we will hold a Q&A session that will end by 9:30 a.m. ", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO. ", "Lew Frankfort", " Thanks, Andrea and welcome everyone. Once again, I'm delighted to be speaking with you today about another excellent Coach holiday performance which reflects the strength of the Coach franchise, our position as a gift authority, and the vibrancy of the U.S. handbag and accessory category. Clearly, the Coach brand has reached a new level of popularity among North American consumers, as sales accelerated and we generated the highest level of holiday comparable store sales gains in our public history. At the same time, we achieved our highest level of POS increases at U.S. department stores. ", "As you know, Coach just announced a sales increase of 29% and a 36% increase in earnings per share for the quarter just completed. Our results are especially impressive when you consider that Coach has achieved double-digit sales growth since 2001 in each holiday quarter for a five-year CAGR of 29%. ", "Some highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: ", "First, net income rose 31% to $227 million or $0.61 per share, compared with $174 million, or $0.45 per share in the prior year, as we recorded the highest quarterly operating margin in the company's history. ", "Second, net sales totaled $836 million versus $650 million a year ago, a gain of 29%. ", "Third, direct to consumer sales rose 34% to $675 million from $504 million in the prior year. ", "Fourth, U.S. same-store sales for the quarter rose 25.7% with retail stores up 20.8% and factory stores up 33.4%. It's worth mentioning that in U.S. retail stores, we have achieved a double-digit comp in the second quarter in each of the last five fiscal years. And, our retail stores, on average, are more than twice as productive as they were just five holidays ago, even in this, our most developed quarter. ", "I should also mention that Coach.com again generated excellent sales gains, increasing 46% during the second quarter. Finally, sales in Japan rose 17% in constant currency, driven by distribution growth and mid single-digit overall comps as we continue to grow our market share. ", "During the quarter, Coach opened seven North American retail stores, including one new market for Coach -- Fayetteville, Arkansas -- and our second store in Toronto. We also opened three factory stores during the second quarter. At the end of the period, there were 237 full priced and 90 factory stores in operation in North America. ", "In Japan, two regional department store locations were opened and one was closed, while one retail and one factory location were expanded. At quarter end, there were 131 total locations in Japan. ", "Indirect sales increased 10% to $161 million from $146 million in the same period last year. POS sales at U.S. department stores accelerated from first quarter '07 levels. As mentioned, Coach's U.S. department store sales growth at POS continued to be outstanding, running up nearly 35% last quarter -- or over 40% on a comp basis -- our strongest second quarter as a public company. More broadly, we estimate that the U.S. handbag and accessory category sales grew at 20% during both the fall season and for all of calendar 2006. ", "We were especially pleased with the continued momentum of Coach North American retail stores, which posted an exceptional performance in Q2, our strongest holiday quarter ever reported. As noted in our release, each metric of comp enjoyed healthy increases: traffic, conversion, and average transaction size. Results in our full-priced businesses, both Coach retail stores and U.S. department stores, continue to be driven by the monthly flow of fresh and relevant product, especially new lifestyle collections such as Legacy. ", "It's also worth mentioning that our U.S. factory store business remained exceptional this quarter, reflecting the vitality of the Coach brand, the appeal of our product, our excellent value, and the strength of premium factory centers. ", "We were also very pleased with the performance at Coach Japan this quarter, where sales rose 17% in yen and 18% in dollars. Growth in Japan was fueled primarily by distribution through both new stores and expansions, augmented by mid single-digit comparable location sales, as our market share continued to expand against a weakening category backdrop. ", "Finally, as always, we were pleased with the significant improvement in operating margins. While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials, I wanted to give you this recap of Coach's excellent second quarter performance. As you know, I've also asked Mike Tucci to join us today to discuss our North American retail holiday sales performance and our spring initiatives. ", "Mike Tucci", " Thanks, Lew. As mentioned in our release, our holiday offerings were remarkably well-received across categories, collections and price points. Overall, sales were driven by handbags and women's accessories, while items such as pet accessories and our $98 multifunction wallet were great giftables at sharp prices. ", "The real story around holiday was the introduction of Legacy, a new collection that was inspired by our heritage with many iconic elements. As some of you know, we created 15 Legacy shop-in-shops in our flagship locations and for the first time ever, dedicated an entire catalog to this collection. We also significantly increased our investment in the collection in the wake of the exceptional pilot results we achieved last spring. Legacy was a standout, representing about 18% of sales for the quarter, and at price points about 45% above our core offering, elevated our overall mix. ", "Separately, our key item investment strategy was successful, as our ten key item concepts achieved our objective of representing about 50% of sales. Additionally, introductions including Gallery Totes, Holiday Patchwork, Duffels and Satchels also posted strong results, and our December resort package of Legacy, in signature khaki trim with gold and a denim and white version, sold through quickly. ", "We were also very pleased with our pilot of jewelry this holiday, underscoring the potential of this flanker category. This capsule group, primarily consisting of bangle bracelets, was introduced in November in a cross-section of about 60 stores and on Coach.com. The group performed exceptionally well and sales were significantly ahead of plan. We will take the key learnings from the jewelry pilot as we expand the assortment and distribution in advance of Mother's Day and prepare for a global launch next fall. ", "Overall for the quarter, we were delighted with the breadth of our appeal. Not only at our mid-range price points, but also the success of our entry level handbag offerings, such as the Soho Signature small hobo at $178 and the Soho Signature small flap at $218; and the higher-priced pieces such as the Ali shoulder flap at $498 and the Legacy leather satchel at $698. These styles blew out and reflect the continuing opportunity to more effectively target the top tier of our customer base and to selectively trade up our average retail in handbags, while still attracting the younger and aspirational consumer. ", "It's worth mentioning that handbags over $400 represented about 7.5% of U.S. retail store sales, the highest level of penetration ever. ", "Before moving on to Spring, I'd like to touch on some of the key points from our Coach service initiative during holiday. As you know, we launched our coaching initiative at the start of FY07. This new program, which introduces and refreshes selling and service skills in an ongoing way to our sales associates, allows us to continually reinforce the service-focused, consumer-centric store environment. ", "Our store managers own the implementation of weekly modules, such as engaging multiple customers, adding on, and closing the sale. Season-specific coaching modules for the holiday quarter were also created, which focused on delivering our Coach service commitments during peak traffic periods. We believe our program is providing meaningful service improvements to our customers, and we are committed to this initiative as a long-term strategy. ", "In order to get product to our customers quickly and efficiently as possible, we made process improvements to our order taking and product running systems. Additionally, an electronic version of our product running process piloted in 19 stores yielded additional efficiencies around transaction throughput and labor scheduling. We are reviewing these learnings and creating a plan to roll out this process to more stores prior to next holiday. ", "Turning to Spring, we're excited about our transitional and seasonal offerings, which are already off to a great start driven by the enthusiastic response to our new product. These introductions include the new Carly handbag group within the Legacy collection, offered in leather, suede and Signature across multiple sizes, with iconic elements such as harness detailing and turn locks. In addition, we updated our Hamptons collection with a fresh color pallet and silhouettes and introduced new spring accessories. ", "For February, we will introduce an evolved Soho collection, featuring Satchels and a new group of Signature striped handbags and accessories. For March, we will launch our own fragrance to all U.S. full-priced stores and Coach.com, as well as the new Hamptons Weekend collection, which will include a distinctive patchwork design and a new stripe group. ", "For April, we introduce our third new lifestyle platform of the fiscal year, Ergo, with soft styles and a sophisticated appeal. The new collection will include a broad assortment of handbags and accessories and based on our successful pilot, we expect Ergo to be a strong business driver. ", "In summary, we are excited about our spring opportunities, both in product flow and our continued focus on Coach service. With that, I'll turn the discussion back to Lew to continue with our overarching strategies. ", "Lew Frankfort", " Thanks, Mike. Naturally, we're thrilled with our results and what they bode for the future. As outlined in our release, our opportunities notably in our home market are boundless. We expect double-digit category growth in handbags and accessories to continue unabated in North America as the following drivers are still intact: ", "First, consumers are purchasing more handbags as they increasingly use accessories to play a leading role in updating their wardrobes. This is a secular shift which has evolved over many years. ", "Second, concrete evidence of this shift is the surge in traffic we are experiencing in Coach retail stores, coming from an acceleration of new consumers, many of whom are trading up to Coach; as well as the surprisingly strong sales we are seeing in new stores in secondary markets such as Naples, Florida, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ", "Third, we are also seeing pent-up demand from the moderate customer who has traditionally followed the lead of the upscale consumer. This is clearly illustrated by the strength of the category in department stores where both units and average prices are rising. ", "Fourth, commensurate with this increased demand, handbag and accessory shelf space is growing in department stores, as they devote more square footage to this category. ", "Finally, new accessory brands are entering the market, while apparel brands and other retailers with their own stores are also entering the category, driving consumer interest through increased visibility, including advertising. ", "Our analysis also shows that about one-third or more of new consumers are actually trading up to Coach from brands such as Fossil, Liz Claiborne, Kenneth Cole and the like, further reflecting the enhanced role accessories are enjoying within a wardrobe. This leads us to believe that we have been significantly understating our addressable market, which we now estimate to be over $7 billion, giving us even more room to grow. ", "Thus, with the market growth rapidly expanding and the Coach brand so vibrant, underscored by the acceleration in our business after literally many years of excellent growth, the potential for Coach in its current concept is clearly greater than we ever thought possible. ", "As most of you know, we have been implementing five key strategies that focus on sustaining growth within our global framework. Clearly, our first priority and still our largest opportunity is North America. ", "First, most generally, we're building market share in this rapidly-growing North American women's accessories market by leveraging our unique position as an accessible luxury lifestyle brand. As part of this strategy, we have been emphasizing new usage occasions, such as weekend, through such collections as Signature Stripe introduced in the first quarter of this year; and more sophisticated product, such as Legacy, to heighten our cachet, especially with our top tier customers. ", "As many of you know, Signature Stripe and Legacy are two of three lifestyle platforms for this year with Ergo coming in April, as Mike just mentioned. In addition, two complementary categories, such as jewelry and fragrance, both fiscal '07 introductions, represent additional opportunities for the brand longer term. ", "Our second strategy is the continued rapid growth in North American retail. We now plan to add about 40 U.S. retail stores in each of the next three years, bringing the retail store base to over 350 at that time. As announced today, during this fiscal year we intend to open about 40 new retail stores, including an incremental ten stores above our previous guidance, given the multi-store portfolio deals we have recently signed with a number of mall developers. ", "It's important to note that these additional stores will open very late in the fiscal year and are not expected to meaningfully impact this year's results. These will include 11 new full-priced markets for Coach, six of which we mentioned already opened during the first half and five coming in the balance of the fiscal year. In aggregate, these 40 new stores will add over 100,000 square feet to our retail store base during the fiscal year. ", "In keeping with our strategy to expand our most productive locations, we will also be expanding seven retail stores this year. These expansions will add a total of about 6,000 additional square feet to our total retail space. In addition, we are also planning on opening three more factory stores in FY '07 and expanding five more outlets, given the success we have experienced through our previous outlet store expansions. Thus, in total factory store development in FY '07 will add about 40,000 net square feet to our store base. Thus, in total the square footage of our North American Coach stores will in aggregate grow about 18% in FY '07. ", "Third, outside the U.S., we're continuing to grow market share with the Japanese consumer, driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new retail locations and by expanding existing ones. During this fiscal year, we expect to open between 15 and 20 net new locations in Japan, a net increase of at least 25,000 square feet, or about 13% to the store base. Similar to the U.S., we also plan to expand at least ten of our most productive retail and factory locations in FY '07, adding nearly 6,000 square feet or about 3% to our retail base. ", "Given the current weakening market for luxury accessories, we're planning Japan more conservatively for the balance of the fiscal year and are now targeting constant currency sales to increase between 10% to 15% from the prior year, driven primarily by distribution growth and low single-digit comps. ", "Our fourth strategy is to raise brand awareness in emerging markets to build a foundation for meaningful sales in the future. Specifically, Greater China, Korea and other emerging geographies where the category is rapidly growing and Coach is taking hold or increasing in importance. During the second quarter, three new Coach locations opened in Mainland China, including our second locations in Beijing and Shanghai and our first in Shia. It remains our intention to open at least ten more locations in major cities on the Chinese mainland during the next two years, bringing our total to at least 15 locations. In addition, three Coach locations were opened in the Middle East during the quarter. ", "Lastly, of course, we continue to have an overall focus on improving the rate of profitability so that our bottom line results continue to outpace top line performance. In closing, these strategies and actions are designed to enable us to achieve excellent financial results through our planning horizon. I will now turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. ", " Mike Devine", " Thank you, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 29%, with direct to consumer, which represents over three-quarters of our business, up 34% and indirect up 10%. While our POS sales in U.S. department stores accelerated over the period and shipments to these customers increased significantly, as planned we constrained our international wholesale shipments due to slowing Japanese travel trends in our markets and to maintain healthy wholesale inventory levels, as the company continues to limit its exposure to tourist sales. At POS, international wholesale sales rose at a double-digit pace, led by domestically oriented doors. ", "Net income for the quarter increased 31% to $227 million or $0.61 per share, as compared to $174 million or $0.45 per share in the year-ago period. This was ahead of the analyst consensus estimate of $0.58 for the quarter. Our operating income rose 32% to $362 million in the second quarter versus $274 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 43.3%, the highest in the company's history, compared to 42.1% in the year-ago quarter, a 120-basis point improvement. ", "In the second quarter, gross profit rose 28% to $644 million, up from $505 million a year ago, while our gross margin rate remained exceptionally high at 77.1% versus 77.6%. Year-to-date, gross margin rate is essentially flat with prior year. ", "SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were well below prior year levels in the quarter and represented 33.8% of sales versus 35.5% last year. Naturally, the leverage we achieved in our U.S. stores was significant, given the level of comp reported for both channels, while we also saw excellent leverage on what we refer to as our semi-fixed corporate functions. ", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $250 million, about 22% above prior year levels, and well below our sales increase, as the investment in key holiday initiatives, notably Legacy, paid off as Mike previously mentioned. Further, this inventory increase allowed us to support 40 net new U.S. stores, 18 net new locations in Japan, and substantially increase sales levels. ", "Accounts receivable balances rose negligibly versus last year. Cash and short-term investments stood at $820 million, as compared with $746 million a year ago. Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $345 million compared to $249 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $307 million versus $220 million in the same period last year, mainly due to higher net income. CapEx spending, primarily for new stores and renovations, was $38 million versus $29 million in the same quarter a year ago. ", "Now I'd like to provide you with some of our updated goals for fiscal 2007. For the second half of '07, we are targeting net sales of at least $1.24 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of about 23%, with U.S. comparable store sales gains of at least 10% in the retail channel and mid-teens in the factory channel; and also a low single-digit total comp gain at Coach Japan. Operating income, up about 30%, reflecting about a 200-basis point improvement in second half operating margin year over year. And earnings per share of about $0.77, an increase of more than 30% and $0.02 above the analyst consensus estimate. ", "Our current goals for the full fiscal year are: net sales growth of nearly 25% to about $2.63 billion. We're targeting an operating margin increase of about 200 basis points to over 38%, which assumes a gross margin at about last year's extraordinary levels over the balance of FY '07 and further SG&A leverage. Operating income dollar growth of about 32% above FY '06. Interest income of about $40 million will add to pretax income, while net income will be somewhat offset by a higher tax rate at about 38.5% for the year due to the fact that incremental taxable income is being taxed at higher rates. ", "Including these factors, we expect to generate EPS growth of 34%, which will produce earnings per share of about $1.71 compared with the analyst consensus estimate of $1.67 per share. For FY '07 we now expect CapEx to be about $160 million, primarily for new stores and expansions, both here and in Japan. As Lew noted, we'll be opening about 45 net new U.S. retail and factory stores and continuing our North American expansion programs. In Japan, we will be opening about 15 to 20 net new locations. ", "While these are our current goals, our actual results may vary from these targets based upon a number of factors, including those discussed under The Business of Coach Inc. and risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K. Coach also does not assume any obligation to update these targets as the year progresses. ", "In summary, we're confident that our growth strategies will enable us to continue to gain share in the large and growing global market for fine accessories and gifts. Thank you all for calling in this morning. Now Lew, Mike, Andrea, and I will be happy to take some questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bob Drbul - Lehman Brothers. ", " Bob Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Two questions. The first one is can you elaborate a little bit more on the gross margin surprises that you had in the quarter, and some of the factors? Japan or currency or the Legacy contribution? ", "The second question I have is, overall can you just elaborate a little bit on the Japanese market, Lew, in terms of what you're seeing and do you still believe that your long-term sales and market share targets are still attainable, given the tougher market over in Japan? ", "Lew Frankfort", " Sure. Let me take the second question first. Japan is a vital market, but what's clear is that it's increasingly mature as consumers are spending money elsewhere. What we saw in the overall market was a contraction of about 5% in the holiday period for imported brands. Now, we were up 17% or 18% during that period. But nevertheless, the market is contracting and the competition is obviously intense. ", "We feel very strongly that our proposition is appropriate and strong for Japan and we continue to envision double-digit growth in Japan, but at a slower rate than we've experienced in the past. We're looking to achieve about 10% to 15% growth during the second half of this year. In terms of our market share, we think 15% target is very realistic over the next few years. ", "At the same time, as we mentioned, North America's accelerating, so we're thrilled to have our lead market afford us so many additional opportunities beyond what we ever contemplated. ", "With regard to gross margin, we didn't really have any surprises. We were very pleased with our gross margin. We said that it would be approximately equal to last year, and the 50 basis points difference, in our minds, is roughly equal. Mike, you may want to just elaborate on why. ", " Mike Devine", "Sure, Lew. What I would first start out by saying is, Bob, we really feel like where the investment community should focus their attention and their effort is on the operating margin line, and we couldn't be more pleased with the fact that we've recorded the highest operating margin in the company's history this quarter. ", "With that being said, if we were to build a bridge for the 50-basis point difference at these exceptional levels between this year and last, about one-third of it is coming from channel mix with the factory channel -- which by the way, their organic gross margin rate is up nicely from last year, but still below the weighted average total for the company -- but about one-third of it coming from channel mix driven by factory success, where it was well ahead of last year and our own expectations. ", "The remaining two-thirds of the 50 bips is coming out of the currency line, our FX, we actually had some help in last year's second quarter from the yen that we did not anniversary in this year's second quarter. So those are the two primary factors of why we're different from LY. ", " Bob Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Edelman - UBS. ", " Jeff Edelman - UBS", "Lew, what are you learning about the new markets that you're entering? They're smaller, obviously, less traffic in the malls. Can you give a sense of volume you're running there and the impact on profitability, please? ", "Lew Frankfort", " Sure. What we're finding first is that our new stores are running well ahead of our expectations, and we're very pleased with the reception that we're getting from customers when we open in those malls, both customers who are long-term fans of Coach as well as first-time buyers. Their reaction is thank you for opening in our malls, and what we're finding in general is that the rate of new customers is increasing. This year we estimate that the rate of new customers into our franchise represent about 20% of our customers compared with about 15% last year. It's a very healthy level of increase. ", "When we dissect on who are the new customers, we're finding that about one-third are consumers who are accustomed to spending at our average handbag price points; one-third are consumers trading down; and very pleasingly, one-third are consumers trading up from the moderate segment. So our stores are exceeding our expectations, and it just tells us that there are many, many more stores across America that we can very successfully open than we've contemplated. ", " Jeff Edelman - UBS", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs", " Hi, Lew. Congratulations on another good quarter. ", "Lew Frankfort", " Thank you. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs", " Can you talk or elaborate on what you just said, that you think you could have many more stores than you might have originally contemplated? I know you were targeting 400 stores and with 40 opening up per year, you're going to move pretty quickly towards that number. So if you can expand on that thought and also elaborate on what you're thinking about layering on additional growth strategies for Coach? Would that be possibly entering Europe? If so, what might the timing look like, or making acquisitions, et cetera. So if you could talk about the long-term growth strategy. ", "Secondly, I'd like to ask about the development of the higher price point business where Mike Tucci said you're now at 7% of your mix at $400 or higher. What's the plan there to introduce more $400-plus price point bags and how do you see that evolving in terms of penetration? Thanks. ", "Lew Frankfort", "I think there are a lot of parts to your question. Let me take several of them and then ask Mike Tucci to talk about the retail store opportunity and the opportunity on the higher end. ", "First, for context, the category in North America, it grew by 20% this year. This is the fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Even though we grew by over 30%, our market share grew extremely modestly. We have only about 20% market share in the United States and as I indicated earlier, our average store is twice as productive as it was five years ago. ", "When we first went public, I believe we had contemplated a total of 250 stores in our universe. Today, as you mentioned, we're projecting 400. We do think the opportunities are obviously greater than that, but we're not going to be commenting on that until we complete our annual operating plan for next year when we take our yearly look at the market and we know that it's obviously much more than 400 locations. We continue to believe that North America represents boundless opportunities and we do anticipate double-digit growth continuing. We're also thrilled with our U.S. department store business here, which grew, as I commented, by another 35% this fall. ", "Now, in terms of new markets beyond Japan, which continues to be a growth market for us, we see Greater China as the number one largest opportunity during our post LRP period. We are, as I indicated, rapidly developing a footprint in China in order to build awareness and be well-positioned for when that tipping point occurs when the middle class is in large enough numbers so that they will buy premium accessories at very good levels. We believe that's just one or two or perhaps three years away. ", "Beyond that, we are looking at other regional markets and our business has grown very rapidly in Korea and Taiwan, to name two markets. We are not contemplating expanding into Europe now because that market continues to be extremely mature, very competitive, and the opportunities that exist for us in the remaining 75% of the world are boundless. ", "Mike, would you like to wrap up for me? ", "Mike Tucci", "Sure. On store growth, just quickly, it's important to note that we've spent several years building our team and our infrastructure from a systems standpoint and store construction and planning standpoint to manage to a 40-store opening cadence per year. It's a very measured and thoughtful decision, some of which was brought about by the extraordinary results of the stores that we've been opening over the last 12 months, and also a very significant window of opportunity brought about by very careful negotiations with our five key developers, Simmons, General Growth, Matridge, Talisman and Wetfield, all of whom we have developed some strong relationships with and were able to look at their portfolio in total. ", "So that, we feel, is the best approach that we can take today, is to go at an accelerated rate; and that would imply that the addressable opportunity could be larger in terms of store count, we'll do that work. ", "In terms of development of bags over $400, Legacy, of course, was the catalyst in driving that 7.5% penetration level. Maybe another way of looking at it is that bags over $400 ran at a 40% comp clip in Q2. That's a very, very important number and we break our business into price bands and say where is the opportunity? We've been talking about an opportunity to protect our opening entry price points in the franchise, in key handbag category and small accessories, and to take advantage of a growing market opportunity in bags at the higher tier of our price range north of $400. We will continue to focus on that. We're obviously well-positioned for the back half of the year, and we are also very, very intently working on what our merchandise investments will look like for Q1 and Q2 of next year. That price band will play an important role. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs", " Is Ergo a $400 level program? ", "Mike Tucci", " It's very interesting. Ergo is actually more of a mid-range. It's right in the sweet spot. There are some bags in the Ergo collection that'll be in the $400 range, but it's really more typical of what we would see in what we call our core offering in Soho and Hamptons and other core handbag resources. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs", " Okay. Thank you. ", "Mike Tucci", "Retail in Ergo is closer to the $300 price point than the $400 price point. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs", " Okay. Thanks so much, Mike and Lew, and good luck in the upcoming second half. ", "Lew Frankfort", " Thank you. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup. ", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", " I have a question about your indirect sales. This is the second quarter in a row where we've seen indirect sales growth in the sort of 10% to 12% range, and obviously U.S. department stores are seeing very robust sales. It would seem that implies some deceleration, if you will, in international wholesale. I was wondering if you are expecting that to continue for the next two quarters and then to stabilize, or do you see a sort of second leg of deceleration as we move into fiscal '08? Thanks. ", "Lew Frankfort", " That's a good question, Kimberly. One of the things we did this holiday season was monitor our shipments very carefully so that we would not be in a position where our distributors had excess inventory. We could have obviously shipped considerably more than we did. The reality is that our number one travel market has been Hawaii, and travel inbound to Hawaii is down 8% year-on-year, and that has significantly impacted our business in Hawaii. ", "We expect that level to stabilize and for the tourist part of our international wholesale business to level off as we put more effort to grow our domestic international wholesale business. So over the next quarter or two, we very well might see lighter shipments than we had contemplated a while ago when travel was stronger. But we expect that in FY '08 for that to bounceback once we anniversary the downward travel levels. ", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", " Terrific. That's helpful. Thanks, Lew. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse. ", " Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", " Thanks, guys. Can you just remind us of what sort of money you're spending in some of these newer international markets, just as far as what are the capital investments required? Second, doesn't sound like you leveraged SG&A on the Japan business. How much of a drag on SG&A was Japan? Thanks. ", " Mike Devine", "First in terms of the international doors that are being opened, Paul, Coach's capital contribution is modest. We actually categorized the new locations in our mind into a couple of categories and only those that we would consider to be what we call strategic will we participate in the capital with our distributor partner, and typically it's at levels of 50% or below. So the weighted average across all of our international store openings is probably somewhere in the 25% to 30% range of the construction costs and the opening costs. ", "Actually, Paul, it's very interesting in this quarter, SG&A leverage at Coach Japan did contribute to Coach's quarterly SG&A leverage in a very modest way, as their SG&A growth was slower than the Company's total growth as a whole and they were very close to breaking even on their own P&L on SG&A. We should expect to see that over the next quarter or two, as Lew had talked about as we plan the growth trajectory down modestly in Japan. So there actually was a bit of an inflection point for Coach Japan this quarter. ", " Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", " And you expect that to continue, to still leverage modestly? ", " Mike Devine", " We would expect to see that as we plan the back half of the year. For FY '08, as we go through our detailed planning process, we will make that call and we will talk to The Street about it. It's too early to call for '08 at this point. ", " Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", " Okay, great. Thanks. Good luck. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities. ", " Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities", " Congratulations on another fabulous quarter. ", "Lew Frankfort", " Thank you, Christine. ", " Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities", "Wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the jewelry business, how many doors will it be in going forward? I know that you tested it in the 60. Then if you could just give the actual metrics for conversion traffic and average transaction size. ", "Mike Tucci", "You got a lot of good information coming your way. I'll do the jewelry piece first. I think the way that we should think about jewelry is that we saw an immediate very strong reaction from a consumer standpoint to jewelry when we put it out in Q2. It was in 60 stores, and we learned a lot from that pilot. We're chasing it, to be very frank, to be able to just maintain sales at the demand that's coming in, in the 60 stores that we have, and we'll continue to focus on jewelry for the back half of the year in maintaining inventory levels and sales levels in those stores. ", "It is absolutely a category that has great gift appeal and gives our stores an opportunity to build on our core franchise of handbags and small leather goods. We will roll it out to all stores for fall. We've seen our fall jewelry presentation in our recent line reviews. We think it's spectacular. We think it will be a more broad assortment. We're working on positioning in stores. We're working on fixturing in stores. We're working on product knowledge and selling attributes in stores, and I think the next six months is an opportunity for us to go to school on that business and come out in a very bold way and also introduce the category on a global level. ", "In terms of traffic conversion and ADT metrics, we saw it coming. I have to say that when we had a strong traffic spike in Q1, that was a very strong indicator that we had an opportunity around traffic in Q2. Traffic and conversion were both up between mid and high single-digits, and we really focused on managing the conversion of that traffic. ", "As an example, in our ten peak days this year during the holiday quarter, we were able to increase the number of transactions in an average comp store by 14%. That's big news when you think about throughput and the level of traffic that hits us in our ten most heavily trafficked days in the quarter. So we managed it well with great investments and great operating skill. And then on the ADT side, that was the bump that took us up slightly in comp and that was driven by Legacy. ", " Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities", "The margins for jewelry, are those comparable to handbags? ", "Mike Tucci", " Absolutely. ", " Christine Chen - Pacific Growth Equities", " Thank you. Good luck. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Melissa Otto - WR Hambrecht. ", " Melissa Otto - WR Hambrecht", "Congratulations on a great quarter. Just a couple of questions around the China business. What is the company doing about copies that seem to be pretty ubiquitous in that market? ", "Lew Frankfort", " Well first, we have a multi-pronged approach towards protecting our trademark, and to hit it with a few points. First, we have registered our trademarks in China, and we have worked very closely with the Chinese government and both the national government as well as provincial government and the customs departments to be respectful of the Coach trademarks; and they have been taking very significant actions to both shut down factories and prevent counterfeits from leaving the market. ", "We've had an anti-counterfeiting program in place in China for five years, and it's been very successful. We do recognize that some level of counterfeiting will occur, and we try to bring it to as low a level as possible. ", " Melissa Otto - WR Hambrecht", "Just a quick follow-up question, could you give some color around the size of the fragrance rollout, maybe some numbers around it, what you're expecting for that. ", "Lew Frankfort", "We're launching fragrance in our North American retail stores and on the Internet in its first phase, and we're looking for success to be somewhere between 2% and 3% of sales once fragrance is launched. ", " Melissa Otto - WR Hambrecht", " Great. Thank you very much. ", "Lew Frankfort", " You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Antoine Belge - HSBC. ", " Antoine Belge - HSBC", "The first question relates to the environmental factory, no slowdown there. Can you perhaps elaborate on the most recent trends during the quarter? And also follow up on Legacy. It seems that you've been opening shop-in-shops. Is it true for stand-alone stores for the Legacy, which would then become a sort of sub-brand of Coach? ", "Lew Frankfort", "With regard to the second question, I'm not sure I fully understand. Let me try to paraphrase. Your question has to do with Legacy and its future role in Coach? ", " Antoine Belge - HSBC", " Yes exactly, and especially since you've said you've opened shop-in-shops already for Legacy within your own store. Do you think it's possible to see perhaps a stand-alone store for the Legacy products separate your current Coach store network? ", "Lew Frankfort", "It's an excellent question, and we're not prepared to announce anything today, but we would say stay tuned and you might very well see us moving in that direction. But, again, we're not ready to announce anything today. In terms of our factories, the question, Andrea? ", " Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Factory stores. ", "Lew Frankfort", " Does your first question have to do with the strength of factory stores? ", " Antoine Belge - HSBC", " Yes, exactly, and any slowdown in factory? ", "Lew Frankfort", " Let me just mention if I could Antoine, the first thing to realize for us at Coach, we do not go on sale in our full-priced stores. We offer an excellent value 365 days a year and our consumers understand that. At the same time, goods purchased in America on sale or in discount sectors are a significant majority of all sales made in the United States are in the discount sector and people are accustomed to looking for special pricing. ", "In many ways, our factory stores serve as our diffusion channel because instead of having a separate brand, we have distinctive product where customers have to go if they want to purchase Coach at a discount and we have a very loyal factory store consumer who primarily shops in factory stores. ", "The growth in factory store traffic overall was very strong in the holiday quarter. It was up almost mid single-digits. Our traffic was up considerably more than that, and the momentum that we experienced during the second quarter, that is the strength of the business in the second quarter, has continued into the third quarter. We see no slowdown. ", " Antoine Belge - HSBC", " Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Rouleau - Wachovia Securities. ", " John Rouleau - Wachovia Securities", "Hi, Lew. Just as a follow-up on the Legacy business, will you continue with a similar type of Legacy offering in the back half of the year, or does that change much? ", "Mike Tucci", "Legacy will be a very important piece of our business in the back half. An example is Carly, which is a new introduction in our January offering on 12-26. We will have SKU and color adds to Legacy throughout the back half as well, absolutely. You'll see it in store throughout the rest of the year. ", " John Rouleau - Wachovia Securities", "So if it was 18% of the mix, which I think probably was a bit stronger than you had maybe initially thought, but should we look at that as a benchmark going forward, or how should we think about that? ", "Mike Tucci", " I think that the penetration is one that will ebb and flow based on platform introductions, strength of the overall lifestyle offering within Legacy. As an example, when we feature Ergo later this spring, Ergo will show some penetration erosion into Legacy. But I think we're very much feeling like Legacy becomes a platform for us that maintains a year-round presence in the stores. We will build on the Legacy point of view in stores as we go into fall next year with a new extension of Legacy, and it may very well exceed the penetrations that we saw this year. ", " John Rouleau - Wachovia Securities", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Hurley - Telsey Advisory Group. ", " Jim Hurley - Telsey Advisory Group", " Thank you, good morning and congratulations as well. My question is about the Internet, exceptionally strong growth there relative to pretty much every competitor and even total online sales growth. Did you do anything different this year than you had in the past as it relates to driving online sales? ", "Mike Tucci", "Our internet business was very, very strong and I think what we're pleased with there is that number 1, it's a tremendous communication vehicle for the brand. We get as many visitors on our internet site as we do in all of our stores in North America. So if you think about the opportunity to engage a consumer on Coach.com, it's as important to us as every customer who walks into one of our stores throughout the year. ", "We did change our strategy or shifted our emphasis in Q2. Number 1, we had a very strong gift and merchandise focus on the site around ease of shopping, strong item messaging, and a very, very strong point of view around key collections such as Legacy and other handbag drivers. E-mail was a very strategic approach, which was segmented and much more focused on specific messaging to consumer types, so our campaigns were very segmented and pointed. ", "Lastly, we made a decision to move away from what we would call Internet advertising. Some might call it banner advertising on the internet, which has a tendency to drive traffic to the site, but is not necessarily driving qualified traffic to the site. The result of that was that the organic traffic that came in was converted at significantly higher rates, particularly in December versus a year ago. That's what drove almost a 50% increase in our sales online. ", " Jim Hurley - Telsey Advisory Group", " That's great. Any noticeable trends in terms of average transaction size online versus in the stores or are they pretty similar? ", "Mike Tucci", " Very consistent. It mirrors, we merchandise our internet site as a flagship store, and it mirrors the same kind of behavior that you would see in a flagship store in Coach. ", " Jim Hurley - Telsey Advisory Group", " Great. Thanks and congrats again. ", " Andrea Shaw Resnick", "At this time, it's 9:32, after our stated close time. Of course, we'll all be available for questions later today if you need us. Have a wonderful day. ", "Operator", " Thank you. That concludes today's conference call.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. ", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections to our business in current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10 K for a complete list of these risk factors. ", "Also, please note that historical trends may not be indicative of future growth. We presently expect to update our estimates each quarter only. However, the failure to update this information should not be taken as Coach's acceptance of these estimates on a continuing basis. Coach may also choose to discontinue providing future estimates at any time. ", "Now, let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our third fiscal quarter 2007 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Mike Devine will then discuss details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2007 and our preliminary goals for fiscal 2008. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session that will end promptly at 9:30 a.m. ", "I would now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO. ", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks Andrea, and welcome everyone. Once again, I am pleased to be speaking with you today about another terrific quarterly performance which reflects the strength of Coach brand, the power of our new product introductions, and the sustained rapid growth of the U.S. handbag and accessories category. ", "Clearly, the Coach proposition is very strong, generating increased levels of interest with both new and existing consumers, evidenced by both our double-digit comps at retail and the extremely high level of POS increases we are achieving in U.S. department stores this spring. ", "Before we get into the financial highlights of the quarter, I want to briefly touch on the closure of our small corporate accounts business through which Coach sold products to distributors for corporate gift-giving and incentive programs. As noted in the press release, we have decided to cease operations of this business in order to better control where our product is ultimately sold. Simply put, our goal is to curtail diversion of our product into non-image-enhancing environments such as the warehouse retailers and the discount chains. ", "Now, I would like to discuss the outstanding results of our continuing business. We just announced a sales increase of 30%, and a 50% increase in earnings per share for the quarter just completed on a continuing basis. It's worth noting that this was the 21st consecutive quarter that Coach achieved sales growth of at least 20%. ", "Some highlights of our third fiscal quarter were: ", "First, net income rose 45% to $147 million or $0.39 per share, compared with $102 million or $0.26 per share in the prior year; ", "Second, net sales totaled $625 million versus $480 million a year ago, a gain of 30%; ", "Third, direct to consumer sales rose 29% to $481 million from $374 million in the prior year; ", "Fourth, U.S. same-store sales for the quarter rose 20% with retail stores up 15.1% and factory stores up 26.6%. It's worth mentioning that in U.S. retail stores we have achieved a double-digit comp for 20 consecutive quarters. ", "Finally, sales in Japan rose 15% in constant currency, driven by distribution growth and low single-digit overall comps as we continue to grow our market share. ", "During the quarter, Coach opened seven North American retail stores including three in new markets for Coach: Tallahassee and Gainesville in Florida and Portland, Maine. At the end of the period, there were 244 full price and 90 factory stores in operation in North America. In Japan, five locations were opened, including one stand-alone retail store and four shop-in-shops, while three retail locations were expanded. At quarter end, there were 136 total locations in Japan. ", "Indirect sales on a continuing basis increased 36% to $144 million from $106 million in the same period last year. POS sales at U.S. department stores sustained the second quarter\u2019s torrid pace of over 30% and shipments into this channel were also very strong while we also realized significant gains in international wholesale shipments. ", "More generally, we estimate that the U.S. handbag and accessory category sales grew by 20% during the fall season, through December, as well as for the spring season through March. We were especially pleased with the continued performance of Coach North American retail stores which achieved another stellar quarter. Each metric of comp enjoyed healthy increases especially conversion and traffic, while average transaction size increased but at a lower rate than the second quarter. ", "Results in our full-priced businesses, both Coach retail stores and U.S. department stores, continue to be driven by the monthly flow of fresh and relevant product, especially new lifestyle collections such as Signature Stripe, Legacy and most recently, Ergo. It is worth mentioning that our U.S. factory store business also remains exceptional this quarter, reflecting the vitality of the Coach brand, the appeal of our product, our excellent value and the strength of premium factory incentives. Our sustained factory store sales growth reflects our ability to successfully offer two distinct store concepts, attracting two distinct consumer groups. ", "I also want to spend a minute on our Internet business, which achieved a 68% sales gain this quarter driven by significant increases in traffic and conversion. With over 13 million visits in Q3, Coach.com is a powerful marketing tool which drives traffic into our retail store. In addition, our online sales and conversion have benefited from site enhancements, a segmented email strategy and improved online merchandising. It's worth mentioning that our average Internet guest visited the site almost three times during the quarter, similar to the cadence of our monthly new product flow. ", "We were also very pleased with the performance of Coach Japan this quarter, where sales rose 15% in yen and 13% in dollars. Growth in Japan was fueled primarily by distribution through both new stores and expansions, augmented as expected by low single-digit comparable locations sales as our market share continued to expand against a weak category backdrop. ", "Finally, as always, we were pleased by the significant improvement in operating margins. While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials, I wanted to give you this recap of Coach's excellent third quarter performance and touch on some of the product highlights. ", "Across all businesses, handbag's and women's accessories continued to propel our business results as the look of our assortment continues to evolve to reflect changing consumer preferences. Earlier in the quarter, we saw excellent response to the Silhouette, a new shoulder bag group within Legacy, and an updated Hampton\u2019s collection. In February, fresh interpretations of Signature Stripe sold very well, as did Soho. After Valentine's Day, the Hampton\u2019s Weekend collection, including a new and distinctive patchwork design, was also successful. ", "We were particularly pleased with the performance of our new Coach fragrance, which launched in early March and represented over 3% of retail sales since its introduction. It's also worth mentioning that our over $400 handbag offering continued to perform quite strongly and comped at over 40%, representing 13% of handbags sales in the quarter. ", "Our business this April has continued to be robust, as we completed the introduction of Ergo, our third major new lifestyle platform for fiscal 2007, with considerable success. This month, we also successfully launched our Watercolor Stripe group, which complements Hampton's Weekend, our popular straw baskets and our best-selling Legacy silhouettes offered in a chic, neutral canvas. For Mother's Day, we're featuring a Legacy cotton Signature assortment building on the success of last year's small capsule group. Coming in June will be patchwork, a perennial favorite across a variety of best-selling Ergo styles and new styles as well as new styles and fabrications in Signature Stripe. ", "Looking forward to fiscal 2008, we are particularly excited by our two new lifestyle platforms which will be introduced into what is shaping up to be another year of rapid category growth. First, Bleeker will be arriving in October, and the second platform is Heritage Stripe, which will be fully launched in early spring. Of course, we will have the carryforward impact of the new lifestyle collections we launched during this year as we plan to update them with distinctive new styles. ", "Naturally, we are delighted with our performance and what this bodes for the seasons and years to come. Our opportunities notably in North America are virtually unlimited, given the strength and saliency of the Coach brand, our ability to bring innovative, relevant product to market at an accelerated pace, while gaining in new categories such as jewelry and fragrance as our FY07 results bear out. ", "Further, as I mentioned, we have seen no slowdown in the sustained and rapid category growth that we have experienced during the last several years. Last quarter, we discussed the key drivers of this category growth which remain intact as follows: ", "First, each year women are buying more handbags as they are increasingly using accessories to play a leading role in updating their wardrobes. As you know, this is a long-term trend which has developed over many years. ", "Second, the trend is broadening across geographies and demographics which is evidenced by the continuing traffic gains we realizing in Coach stores. These gains are in part coming from new consumers, many of whom are trading up to Coach as well as the strong sales we are experiencing in secondary markets such as Fresno, California which was open last year and Evansville, Indiana which opened earlier this year. We're also seeing increased interest from the moderate customer. This is clearly illustrated by the category strength in department stores, where the average handbag price continues to rise dramatically. ", "Third, we continue to see more square footage devoted to the category in department stores, given its relative outperformance, creating a virtuous cycle. ", "Fourth, new players are entering the accessories category, which is a good thing as it drives interest, while disproportionately benefiting the market leaders. Our latest analysis estimates that at least one-third or more of new consumers are actually trading up to Coach; once again, pointing to a larger market opportunity beyond the traditional premium buyer that we have always considered our target consumer. ", "Finally, we would point to the sales levels we are achieving in the stores we have opened in the first half of fiscal 2007. Excluding Mohegan Sun, which is running at over an $11 million clip, compared with our plan of $7 million which would unduly influence the average, the other 18 stores opened during our first half, generating annual volumes of $2.1 million, more than 20% higher than our pro forma. Further, this level of strength is consistent whether at the Mall of Georgia in Beaufort, our fifth store in the Greater Atlanta market, or at CLO Vista in El Paso, Texas, a new market. ", "Two weeks ago, I was traveling with Mike Tucci on the West Coast when we visited about 15 stores in the Southern California market and saw new Coach stores in malls such as the Galleria at Tyler in Riverside and the shops at Dos Logos in Corona, outside of the Los Angeles market. Both are excellent examples of Coach stores that are performing very well and represent a great opportunity. These stores are part of multi-store portfolio packages with key mall developers which provide us with an exceptional economics. They also illustrate our success with new stores, which opened outside of a major metropolitan area. ", "Thus, with the accessories market rapidly expanding and the Coach brand so vibrant, the potential for Coach in its current concept is clearly greater than we ever thought possible. ", "As most of you know, we have been implementing five key strategies that focus on sustaining growth within our global framework. Clearly our first priority and still our largest opportunity is North America. First, most generally, we are building market share in the rapidly growing North American women's accessories market by leveraging our leadership position as a top of mind and preferred brand for self purchase and gifts. As part of this strategy, we have been emphasizing new usage occasions such as weekend, through such collections as Signature Stripe, introduced this fiscal year in the first quarter; and more sophisticated product such as Legacy, introduced last fall to heighten our cache, especially with our higher end customers. ", "We are confident that our new collections in the pipeline for FY08, notably Bleeker and Heritage Stripe, will further enhance our appeal. The Bleeker Collection will offer the consumer a lightweight and fresh interpretation of bags and accessories inspired by our bestselling icons. It will be priced midway between our core collections and Legacy. The Heritage Stripe collection features our signature padded uncoated cotton canvas, a first for Coach. This is a fabric which has long been appreciated by consumers for being chic, durable, sporty and timeless. ", "Our second strategy is the continued rapid growth in North American retail. We plan to add about 40 retail stores in North America in each of the next several years. We will grow our North American retail store base with a continued focus on adding stores within existing markets, opening new markets in the U.S. and by accelerating our store openings in Canada, where we have only have four locations today. ", "Given the larger addressable market for Coach, we now believe that North America in total can easily support about 500 retail stores, including up to 20 in Canada. This roadmap for expansion is based upon a buildup of individual malls and locations that have already met our demographic requirements and economic hurdles. ", "Our FY07 retail openings include seven completely new full-priced markets for Coach, five of which we mentioned already opened during the first nine months of the fiscal year and two coming in the fourth quarter. Also in keeping with our strategy to expand our most productive locations, we will also be expanding seven retail stores this year, all in the fourth quarter. In aggregate, these 40 new stores will add over 100,000 square feet to our retail store base during FY07 while expansions will add 6,000 additional square feet. ", "We are also planning on opening three more factories stores in the fourth quarter of this year and expanding three more outlets as well, given the success we have experienced through our previous outlet store expansions. Thus in total, factory store development in FY07 will add about 40,000 net square feet to our store base. Therefore, in total, the square footage of our North American Coach stores will, in aggregate, grow about 17% in FY07. ", "For FY08, we expect to open 40 new North American retail stores which will include 11 completely new markets such as Wichita, Kansas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to name just two and more than five new factory locations as well. In addition, we will be expanding at least 10 retail stores and several factory stores. Taken together, we would expect total square footage to grow at a similar rate in FY08 as we are realizing this year. ", "Third, outside the U.S. we are continuing to increase market share with the Japanese consumer, driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new retail locations and by expanding existing ones. During this fiscal year we expect to open a total of 19 net new locations in Japan and similar to the U.S. we will expand about ten of our most productive retail and factory locations. Taken together, they will add about 35,000 square feet, or 18% to our store base in FY07. ", "For FY08, we plan to open about ten to 15 net new retail locations and a few factory outlets as this channel becomes more important to Japanese consumers. We will also continue to expand key locations. Overall, we expect to increase our square footage in Japan at about the same rate in FY08 as we are growing it this year. Despite the continued weakness in the Japanese luxury accessories market, we are continuing to target constant currency sales growth of 10% to 15% for both the balance of this year and for FY08, driven primarily by distribution growth and low single-digit comps. ", "Our fourth strategy is to raise brand awareness in emerging markets to build a foundation for substantial sales in the future; specifically Greater China, Korea and other emerging geographies were the category is rapidly growing and Coach is taking hold, are increasing in importance. During the third quarter, six net new Coach locations opened internationally, primarily focused on Asia and the Middle East. For FY07 we expect to open a total of about 30 net new international locations, including seven net new locations in Mainland China. ", "During FY08, we now expect to open through distributors about 30 net new locations focused on Greater China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. It remains our intention to open at least ten more locations in major cities in Mainland China during the next two years, bringing our total to at least 20 locations. ", "Lastly, of course, we continue to have an overall focus on improving the rate of profitability so that our bottom line results continue to outpace top line performance. ", "Coach continues to evolve as the house of American accessories for the 21st century, providing an integrated environment in which the broad and diverse fashion attitudes and functional requirements of our loyal consumers are not only met, but also inspired. At the same time, we continue to focus on strengthening the emotional bond between Coach and our consumer through great product fulfillment, store visits and compelling clientele programs. ", "I will now turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. ", "Mike Devine", "Thank you, Lew. Lew was just taking you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. Before we get into the details, I thought it might be worthwhile to touch on our exit from the corporate accounts business and its impact on both historical financials and our original expectations for FY07 so that you can adjust your models accordingly. ", "Simply put, the business has represented about 3.5% of sales over the last few years and a somewhat larger percentage of our earnings on an incremental basis as we allocate no corporate design or other centralized function expenses to this business. For example, in FY06 the business generated $76 million in sales, and $0.08 in earnings per share. These figures are clearly laid out in the supplemental table included in our press release from earlier today. ", "Had we continued to operate the business at first half '07 levels, we would have expected to generate about $90 million in sales and over $0.10 in earnings for the full year. We posted $0.06 of EPS in the first half, which is also in our supplemental table. Therefore, we were anticipating about $0.04 in the second half of the fiscal year, equally divided between the third and fourth quarters. ", "As noted, we decided to exit the business early in the third quarter, generating sales of $8 million and EPS of under $0.01 for this stub period. It's worth noting that while we have shut this business down, we will see a run out over the next few months, albeit at a very modest level, as we do plan to fulfill a small amount of outstanding orders. As results from this business are now considered discontinued operations, all discussion of our results here and in the future will be on a continuing operations basis only. ", "Let's get back to the results from our continuing operations. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 30% with direct to consumer which represents over three-quarters of our business, up 29% and indirect of 36%. Both our POS sales and U.S. department stores and shipments to these customers increased significantly during the quarter. We also saw continued double-digit POS sales growth in international sales, led again by domestic doors as well as a rebound in shipments. ", "Net income for the quarter increased 45% to $147 million compared to $102 million, while earnings per share rose 50% to $0.39 per share versus $0.26 per share in the year-ago period. Including discontinued operations, albeit for only the partial quarter, total earnings per share were $0.40. This was ahead of the analysts' unadjusted consensus estimate of $0.38 for the quarter. ", "Our operating income rose 48% to $227 million in the third quarter versus $154 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 36.2% compared to 32% in the year-ago quarter, a 420 basis points improvement. In the third quarter, gross profit rose 29% to $486 million, up from $376 million a year ago, while our gross margin rate continued to be exceptionally high, at 77.8% as compared to 78.4%. ", "SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were well below prior-year levels in the quarter and represented 41.5% of sales versus 46.4%. Naturally, the leverage we achieved on our U.S. stores was significant, given the level of comp reported for both channels. We also saw excellent leverage on what we refer to as our semi-fixed corporate functions. ", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $250 million, about 19% above prior year levels and well below our sales increase. Further, this inventory increase allows us to support 44 net new U.S. stores, 20 net new locations in Japan and the substantially increased sales levels. Accounts receivable balances rose $14 million or 13%. Again, well below our sales growth of 30%. ", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $936 million as compared with $838 million a year ago. Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $97 million compared to $98 million last year during Q3, as timing of interim cash tax payments in this year's Q3 offset our significant cash increase from net income. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $72 million versus $49 million in the same period last year, mainly due to higher net income. CapEx spending primarily for new stores and renovations was $25 million versus last year's $49 million. ", "Now I would like to provide you with some of our updated goals for fiscal 2007. For the fourth quarter, we are targeting net sales of $640 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 28% from last year's $501.6 million on a continuing basis, with U.S. comparable store sales gains of at least 10% in the retail channel and mid-teens in the factory channel and a low single-digit total comp gain at Coach Japan. ", "Operating income, up about 36%, reflecting more than a 200 basis point improvement in fourth quarter operating margin year over year. EPS of about $0.40, an increase of 36%. We will compare this guidance to an adjusted analyst consensus of $0.38 for continuing operations, given the $0.02 contribution we originally expected from corporate accounts in the fourth quarter which would then go to the published consensus of $0.40. ", "Therefore, our current goals for the full fiscal year are net sales growth of 28% to at least $2.6 billion; and we are targeting an operating margin increase of 300 basis points to nearly 38%, driven by further SG&A leverage; operating income dollar growth of about 37% above FY06, with interest income of about $40 million, adding to pretax income, while net income will be somewhat offset by a higher tax rate at about 38.5% for the year, due to the fact that incremental taxable income is being taxed at higher rates. ", "Including these factors, we expect to generate EPS growth of 40% on a continuing basis which will produce earnings per share of $1.67. Again, we would compare our guidance to an adjusted analyst consensus of $1.62, given the $0.10 contribution we originally expected from corporate accounts for the year, which would then foot to the published consensus of $1.72. ", "For FY07, we continue to expect CapEx to be about $160 million, primarily for new stores and expansions both here and in Japan. As Lew noted, we will be opening 47 net new U.S. retail and factory stores and continuing our North American expansion program. In Japan, we will be opening 19 net new locations. ", "Our preliminary goals for the full fiscal year 2008 on a continuing operations basis are net sales growth of about 20% to at least $3.1 billion, with at least 10% comparable store sales gains in both the U.S. retail and factory channels and low single-digit comp location sales gains in Japan. With our continued focus on profitability, pretax income dollar growth of nearly 25% above FY07 levels. ", "Again, two factors will somewhat moderate that growth on the EPS line in 2008: a higher share count brought about by option exercises; and secondly, a higher tax rate rising to about 39% due to the fact that incremental taxable income will be taxed at higher rates. Taken together, this will produce net income growth of nearly 24% and earnings per share of at least $2.02, up at least 21% from the $1.67 targeted for FY07. ", "Once again, we would compare our FY08 guidance to an adjusted consensus estimate of $1.98. We estimate an $0.11 contribution from corporate accounts was embedded in next year's analyst estimates to yield the current published consensus of $2.09. ", "While these are our current goals, our actual results may vary from these targets based upon a number of factors including those discussed under the business of Coach Inc. and risk factors in our annual report on Form 10 K. Coach does not assume any obligation to update these targets as the year progresses. In summary, we are confident that our growth strategies will enable us to continue to gain share in the large and growing global market for fine accessories and gifts. ", "Thank you, everyone for your attention. Lew, Andrea and I will be happy to take some questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bob Drbul - Lehman Brothers. ", " Bob Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Lew, the question that I have with the results today and the decision to exit the corporate accounts business is, why would you do that today? Why now? What led you to that decision at this point in time? It is a very profitable business. ", " Lew Frankfort", "Sure. For us, it became a brand integrity issue. We conclusively learned that many of our corporate accounts were diverting goods to unauthorized channels. You have heard and we have talked about our product turning up in such places as Costco. The only way to control where our product is sold was to exit this business. It's the right thing for the franchise and we decided to do that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Margaret Major - Goldman Sachs. ", " Margaret Major - Goldman Sachs", " Hi Lew and everyone and congratulations on another tremendous quarter. I have a couple questions. First of all, when you look at next year's openings, the uptick in your ultimate target of 500 stores, could you just talk about existing market opportunity versus new market opportunity in the context of the total potential? With the same-store sales for this quarter, where you said traffic and conversion are quite strong but average transaction value was down a little bit versus last quarter. ", " Lew Frankfort", " I am sorry, Margaret. It was down slightly compared to second quarter. It was still high, but the increase was lower. ", " Margaret Major - Goldman Sachs", " Thank you for that clarification. In the context of your outlet for fiscal '08, same-store sales and full price targeted at 10%. Can you talk about how you think of anniversarying the launch of Legacy in September/October and the acceleration of your business that resulted from that launch? How does that factor into your 10% comp guidance? Would you think that once you start anniversarying that it may be below 10%? How do you think about it over the course of the year? Thank you. ", " Lew Frankfort", " Your first question has to do with new and existing markets. We estimate that about 75% to 80% of new stores will be open in what we would call existing markets, with the remaining 20% to 25% in entirely new markets. However, what we have learned, Margaret, is what we often refer to as an existing market when we open a new store, it's a new market because most of the consumers who are shopping within that area are either new to Coach or primarily only shop in that area. ", "A perfect illustration in the Tristate area is Jersey City. We consider Jersey City an existing market, yet when we opened a store and spoke to our consumers, most of them did not shop previously in any other Coach stores. ", "In terms of our overall comps, which we are extremely pleased with, I'd like to just go back over them. They were primarily driven by increases in conversion and traffic and a modest increase in average ticket, lower than the mid single-digit increase that we experienced in Q2 versus the prior year. That was in part due to the introduction of new items, lower-priced items in February such as fragrance, which has a lower AUR, and we found ourselves selling a great amount of fragrance units. ", "The other thing, when we look at our comp is in Q3, we did have a considerable amount of returns from sales in Q2 that were actually recorded in Q3. You cannot look at any changes from Q2 to Q3. Our comps were extremely strong. Relative to next year, we are projecting comps of at least 10% and this is the highest guidance we have ever gave at this time in our history for a new year. If you go back to last April or any prior year, we were never as bullish as we are now. ", "That is driven by a confluence of factors: the strength of the Coach brand; our new collections that we are introducing in '08; of course the expansion of jewelry, as well as the carryforward of the existing collections; and overall the vibrancy of the brand and the continued expectation of category growth. So, you can look forward to only good things from us. ", " Margaret Major - Goldman Sachs", "Can you specifically address how price factors into the comp guidance for fiscal '08 pricing? I know it is mixed, not just raising prices, but could you just address that? ", " Lew Frankfort", " The short answer is that we are looking at our comps to be primarily driven by conversion first, traffic second and average ticket third. We see average ticket in many ways as a bonus, as a dividend. Our job is to convert more people that visit and our challenge, of course, is to have higher traffic year on year. Our conversion and traffic were up very substantially in Q3, continuing the trend that we have experienced since last July. We see no reason to expect that to decline. ", " Margaret Major - Goldman Sachs", " Congrats to you and everybody at Coach. ", " Lew Frankfort", " Thank you. ", "Operator", " Our next question comes from Jeff Edelman - UBS. ", " Jeff Edelman - UBS", " Thank you, good morning and nice job. As we think about the new product flow which has clearly had a positive impact, would you discuss the disposition and then phase out of the older lines? Has this moved into the factory outlets and has this been an extra catalyst behind those sales? ", " Lew Frankfort", " Let me go to the question at the end. The answer is no. Only about 20% of our sales in factory stores come from discontinued product. Most of our sales are either product made exclusively for factory or products that we have made from discontinued products of several years ago. So, the short answer is what is going on in factory is unique to factory. You know, Jeff, that the consumer is older, she's more functionally oriented, she likes leather and she likes to make a greater investment. The bags tend to be more straightforward than they are in full price. ", " Jeff Edelman - UBS", "I believe you are making some selective price adjustments on Legacy as we look at fall holiday '07. Are we seeing that occur in any other product lines? ", " Lew Frankfort", "Without making adjustments in existing styles, what we do each year when we introduce new styles is we obviously look at what the costs are, the make, the amount of materials, the amount of time it takes to make a product and we develop a first course and out of that we determine a fair price. The Legacy products that we are introducing next fall, some of them do have additional make and are more complex with additional ornamentation and detailing; certain products are increasing in cost. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup. ", " Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Mike, I was wondering if you could comment on your SG&A, if you could just give us any sort of rough breakdown on the contribution to the decline in SG&A rate of 490 basis points. Any detail there would be helpful. ", "On the gross margin line, if you could talk about mix versus any other pressures that you might have seen during the quarter, as slight as it was, that would be helpful as well. Thanks. ", "Mike Devine", "Let me just start off by saying we couldn't be more thrilled with our improvement in operating margin, up 420 basis points over Q3 last year. As you point out, it's largely being driven by improved SG&A leverage. The good news is we're getting it from a number of sources. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the comps that we are driving through our North American retail business is delivering improved SG&A leverage. We are also seeing it in our indirect sales groups, particularly in U.S. wholesale where we're seeing shipments up dramatically with very modest increases in sales support necessary to drive that business. ", "We also saw for the second quarter in a row, a very modest amount of SG&A leverage to Coach\u2019s total P&L coming out of Coach Japan. The lion's share, the majority of the SG&A improvement, is coming through our corporate functions; our centralized activities, that as we grow the top line at 30% rates, SG&A leverage is pouring into the operating income line. We're very excited about that. ", "If I could then now switch to your question on gross margin rate, again we are very pleased actually with our gross margin rate. In many ways we feel it is healthier this quarter than it even was last quarter, albeit down from last year. We are seeing organic gross margin improvement, we're seeing good things going on within each channel and it's really channel mix which is I think is what you were referring to, that's driving the negative year-over-year performance. When you see our factory channel growing as quickly as it is, that\u2019s going to have a negative channel mix impact. We also see Coach Japan, which is our highest gross margin channel, while we are thrilled with the 15% constant currency growth, it is not at the overall 30% growth. That is also having a negative impact. The indirect business that is pouring so much SG&A leverage in also grew more quickly than the company as a whole and also had a negative impact. ", "So, great organic gross margin rate trends but the underlying channel mix issue that you referred to is causing a negative year-over-year compare. We don't believe that is a concern, we focus on operating margin. We do expect to see the negative channel mix impact us again in Q4 because the trends in our business are going to continue: very strong factory growth, more modest growth at Coach Japan and we're seeing incredibly strong trends continue into 4Q in the U.S. wholesale channel. ", "We will expect, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, to once again see operating income grow significantly over prior year. ", " Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", " Great Mike, that was very helpful. On the SG&A rate declines that we are seeing, as you look out into fiscal '08, how would you expect the composition of the improvement in SG&A to change? Or do you expect it to come from areas that you saw in the third quarter? Thanks. ", "Mike Devine", " Kimberly, I think we are going to see the same trends continue: leveraging with strong comp growth, that is a business with a lot of variable expense, adding new stores, et cetera. At the comp rates we projected, we expect to be able to hold steady on an SG&A rate there and then have the top line growth leverage our centralize our functions. So, I think we will see trends continue. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse. ", " Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "Just of little bit more on the gross margin line. Can you talk a little bit about input prices, labor that you are seeing over in the factories in China, leather costs? I was just wondering if there has been any change to the percent of your shoppers that cross over between retail and factory? ", " Lew Frankfort", " Let me just take the second part first. Zero, Paul. There is absolutely none. In fact, we're opening full price stores in what was previously factory store markets and enjoying great results in our full price business without losing anyone from the factory store channel. It is a distinct consumer. ", "Mike Devine", "Back to gross margin, yes Paul, there are some inflationary pressures on some of the elements of our cost of goods sold. The good news is though that with the hard work of the sourcing team to this point we have been able to largely offset them. The pricing power that we have been able to enjoy has been able to offset them and that is why we are enjoying the strong organic gross margin improvements that I talked about earlier. ", " Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "The share guidance you gave as part of your EPS, you said that it would be higher. Are you including any share repurchase activity in your estimates? ", "Mike Devine", " No, we are not estimating any additional share buybacks at this time. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lorraine Makis - Merrill Lynch. ", "Julie - Merrill Lynch ", "You have been growing your market share pretty steadily in Japan. Have you changed your strategy there at all recently, other than expanding your distribution? ", " Lew Frankfort", " We have become more sophisticated as we have gotten to know the market better. And as a result, we are focused more on clientele programs and are able to drive more purposeful business into our stores. We are actually developing some of the same Coach service components that we have so successfully introduced in the United States into Japan. ", " Julie - Merrill Lynch", " Can you talk a little bit about the profitability over there? I know you mentioned that SG&A came down for the second quarter in a row. Do you expect that to continue? ", "Mike Devine", " We are really calling for flat a SG&A year for '08 coming out of Coach Japan. We are conservative planners so we will see as we actualize where it really comes in, but I wouldn't model it as being a significant contributor to SG&A leverage going forward when I spoke earlier, the way we think about our centralized functions. The store profitability in Coach Japan is the highest of any of our stores globally, because of the price premium we enjoy and other luxury brands enjoy in Japan, so driving top line growth and continuing to take market share ultimately, of course, will drive earnings per share and that is our strategy. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Melissa Otto - WR Hambrecht. ", " Melissa Otto - WR Hambrecht", "Congratulations on a great quarter. Just a follow-up question on Japan. Are there opportunities to improve the productivity of the stores and could you articulate some specifics that might actually get that comp to be a little bit better than low single-digits? ", " Lew Frankfort", "Let me first say Melissa, we are pleased with the low single-digit comps. We're opening a lot of additional locations in Japan, which is obviously a much smaller market geographically than the United States. We are finding there is some trade off and our entire strategy is to build market share. You need to appreciate that our growth is occurring in an environment that is extremely lackluster. ", "Having said all that, we are constantly focused on improving the experience consumers have when they visit our stores. I mentioned a moment ago that we are adopting many of the practices we have successfully introduced in the United States to create special moments for customers so that we can engage with them more effectively so that they will visit us more frequently. It's a never-ending pursuit of improving service and that will continue. ", " Melissa Otto - WR Hambrecht", " I just had a quick follow-up on China. You had mentioned that in China you are hoping to get to a target of 20 stores. Any color on the pirating going on there, the copies around the Coach bags and how that might be impacting your business or not really impacting your business? ", " Lew Frankfort", " First, we are pleased that over recent years we have found a growing respect in China for intellectual trademark rights. They have been working cooperatively with us to reduce and eliminate counterfeiting wherever it can be detected. It has not been a material problem for us whatsoever. ", " Melissa Otto - WR Hambrecht", " That is great to hear. Thank you so much and congratulations. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Hurley - Telsey Advisory Group. ", " Jim Hurley - Telsey Advisory Group", "I would like to add my congratulations as well. The question I have is on the tiered merchandising strategy that worked so well in the full price retail stores. Just wondering where you are with employing that strategy both in the factory outlet and also in Japan? The other question relates to fragrance and whether or not fragrance is a destination purchase in the store or if it was more an add-on purchase with other items? ", " Lew Frankfort", "With regard to tiered merchandise, in Japan we have actually a very similar structure to the one that we have in the United States where we do have three primary levels of stores: core fashion and flagship. What we have found in Japan is what we are experiencing in the United States, increasingly our stores are graduating up from one level to the next as our brand appeal broadens in all areas. ", "In factory, we do not have a tiered merchandising approach per se, but we actually do analysis of demographics and selling by types of store and we have modified our assortments and the levels of merchandise to reflect the different consumers so that in the most high end factory stores you will see a somewhat more dominant preference of the more sophisticated part of the factory assortment. ", "With regard to fragrance, as you know, we did a fairly extensive marketing campaign where we launched fragrance and that spurred a great deal of interest. What we're finding is that about 75% or 80% of consumers who are buying fragrance are existing Coach users, which is not a surprise, its expected and that\u2019s what we were hoping. We are finding that a good number of consumers are coming in just to sample our fragrance. With Mother's Day and coming we expect fragrance to be very strong item.

(COH)   F4Q07 Earnings Call  July 31, 2007  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - IR ", " Lew Frankfort - Chairman, CEO ", " Mike Devine - CFO ", "Analysts", "Bob Drbul - Lehman Brothers ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs ", " Jeff Edelman - UBS ", " Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup ", " Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel ", " Analyst for Randy Konik - Bear Stearns ", " Christine Chen - Needham ", "Operator", " Good day, and welcome to the Coach conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations for Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick ", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. ", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. A ", "also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. We presently expect to update our estimates each quarter only. However, the failure to update this information should not be taken as Coach's acceptance of these estimates on a continuing basis. Coach may also choose to discontinue presenting future estimates at any time. ", "Now, let me outline the order of speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will begin with an overall summary of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2007 results as well as our plans for the new fiscal year. Mike Devine will then follow with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter and year, as well as our outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2008. Following Mike, we will hold a question-and-answer session that will conclude by 9:30 a.m. ", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO. ", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Andrea and good morning, everyone. As we announce our fourth quarter results and the end of our fiscal year, we are very pleased with our excellent performance and are equally enthusiastic about our prospects. We're confident that FY08 will be another great year for Coach with sales planned to rise to about $3.16 billion, 21% ahead of last year. ", "We are seeing a continuation of about 20% growth in the premium handbag and accessory category in North America, and heightened interest in the category globally, as it takes hold in emerging markets for luxury goods, such as greater China. Given the strength of the Coach brands and the resonance of the Coach proposition internationally, we are in position to capitalize on these opportunities both at home and abroad in the years ahead. ", "Our performance in FY07 was highlighted by a 28% increase in revenues, a 37% increase in net income, and a 41% increase in EPS. It was a year of many accomplishments, including: ", "First, the opening of 48 total net new stores in North America; 41 new retail stores, and seven net new factory stores. ", "Second, a 16% increase in North American full price comparable store sales for the year driven primarily by increases in conversion and traffic with smaller gains in transaction size, while our U.S. factory business posted a remarkable 30% comp gain for the year. At the same time, our Internet business experienced meteoric growth with sales up 51%. We had 50 million unique visits with an average of 6 minutes spent on the site per visit. ", "Third, we achieved over 30% gains in U.S. department and specialty stores at POS. ", "Fourth, we also had an excellent year for Coach Japan. Retail sales rose 19% in constant currency and 16% in dollars to over $483 million, despite flat category sales of imported bags and accessories in Japan. Coach strengthened its number two position in this market, achieving a 10% share this year, up from 9% last year. ", "Finally with our distributors, we successfully opened eight net stores in Mainland China as we strengthened our international leadership team. ", "Our strong annual performance was capped off by an excellent fourth quarter as we announced a sales increase of 30% and a 43% increase in earnings per share for the quarter just completed. I'm pleased to report that this was the 22nd consecutive quarter that Coach achieved sales growth of at least 20%. ", "Some highlights of our fourth fiscal quarter were: ", "First, net income rose 41% to $159 million or $0.42 per share compared with $113 million or $0.29 per share in the prior year. ", "Second, net sales totaled $652 million versus $502 million a year ago, a gain of 30%. ", "Third, direct to consumer sales rose 29% to $541 million from $419 million in the prior year. ", "Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 20.2% with retail stores up 11.6% and factory stores up 31.2%. In addition, sales on the Coach Internet site rose 44%. ", "Finally, sales in Japan rose 23% in constant currency, driven by distribution growth and high single-digit overall comps. ", "During the quarter, Coach opened 15 North American retail stores, including three new markets for Coach, including: Columbia, South Carolina and Buffalo, New York. In addition, we expanded six locations. Also, three new factory stores were opened. At the end of the period, there were 259 full price and 93 factory stores in operation in North America. ", "In Japan, we opened six new locations, including one standalone retail store, three shop-in-shops, and one factory store while a DFS location was opened at Narita Airport. At quarter end, there were 142 total locations in Japan. This was a net increase of 20 locations from the 122 at year end 2006. In addition, Coach expanded two locations during the fourth quarter, bringing the year-end total to nine expansions in Japan. ", "Indirect sales on a continuing basis increased 34% to $111 million from $83 million in the same period last year. POS sales at U.S. department stores sustained the torrid pace posted in recent quarters of over 30% growth, while we also realized significant gains in international POS sales. ", "The continued momentum of Coach in North American retail stores enabled us to achieve an excellent quarter in this channel, driven primarily by conversion with more modest gains in traffic and average transaction size. Results in our full-priced businesses, both Coach retail stores and U.S. department stores, continued to be driven by the monthly flow of distinctive and relevant new product, especially new Lifestyle collections, such as Ergo. ", "Our U.S. factory store business also continued to be exceptional this quarter, driven by double-digit conversion and traffic gains with a small contribution from higher transaction size. Our strength in the factory channel reflects [break in audio] centers. Most importantly, our sustained full-price and factory store sales growth reflects our ability to successfully operate two distinct store concepts attracting two distinctive consumer groups. ", "I also want to highlight another spectacular season and year for Coach women's footwear for both our licensed business in the U.S. wholesale channel and in the Coach stores where it is sold. First our business in department stores, where we are sold through nearly 700 locations, rose 90% at POS for the February through June season to-date period. For the full year, women's footwear in department stores also increased by about 90% to $145 million in sales. In the 55 Coach comp retail stores where footwear was sold, it represented 11% of sales last quarter, up 21% from the prior year. We also introduced a few key items to an all-store distribution with great success. ", "Moving on to Coach Japan, we were extremely pleased with its performance this quarter where sales rose 23% in yen and 17% in dollars. Growth in Japan was fueled primarily by distribution through both new stores and expansions, augmented by high single-digit comparable location sales as our market share continued to expand against a weak category backdrop. The acceleration in Japan was attributable in large part to the phenomenal success of Ergo, which appealed to the consumers' interest in lightweight, close to the body shapes and minimal hardware. ", "Finally, as always, we were pleased with a significant improvement in operating margins. While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials, I wanted to give you a recap of Coach's excellent performance and touch on some of the product highlights of the fourth quarter. Across all businesses, handbags and women's accessories continue to propel our sales, as the look of our product continues to evolve and reflect changing consumer preferences. ", "Earlier in the quarter, we saw excellent response to Ergo, our third new Lifestyle platform for the year. For May, we launched a new summer program featuring Legacy Cotton Signature, which was built on the success of last year's small capsule group. In June, Patchwork, a perennial favorite, returned across a variety of Ergo silhouettes along with new styles and fabrications in Signature Stripe. Our over $400 handbag offering continued to perform quite strongly during the fourth quarter and comped at over 75% in Coach retail stores, representing over 17% of handbag sales in the period. ", "Our business in July remains strong as we successfully introduced an expanded collection of Chelsea handbags, including novelty and limited edition styles. Our August floor set installed last week features Hampton\u2019s, anchored by our best-selling carryall, updated with an outside pocket and turn lock in lightweight leathers and Signature. It also includes Legacy in new shapes and colors. ", "In September, we will be introducing a belted version of Ergo with hardware and a range of fabrications, including several sophisticated Patchwork styles inspired by early 20th century art. We're also excited to be launching an expanded jewelry offering with an all-store distribution in early September. ", "During fiscal 2008, we will be introducing three major Lifestyle platforms. The first, Bleeker, arrives in October and will offer consumers a fresh interpretation of bags and accessories inspired by our best-selling icons and anchored by our original double set first introduced in 1973. It's crafted from hand burnished leather and features our archival heritage logo, proprietary Coach hardware and a new capsule lining. Bleeker is lighter weight than our very successful Legacy line, with sharper price points at about a 25% premium to our core handbag offering. ", "The second platform for FY08 is the Heritage Stripe collection, an assortment of durable coated cotton canvas totes, bags, and accessories, which we expect to fully launch during early spring. Next April, we will relaunch Soho, a perennial favorite. It will return in new fabrications and silhouettes with reinterpreted proprietary detailing. ", "Technologically, we will also continue to innovate to improve efficiency in our stores and enhance the level of service we provide to our customers. In North America first, we just introduced store pickup giving our consumers the option to buy online and pick up their merchandise at a Coach store two hours later. This service will support last-minute purchasing and drive many additional Internet visitors into our stores. ", "Second, after a successful pilot in 19 stores last holiday, at the end of September, we will be rolling out E-Runner to nearly 100 stores. As you may know, this is a handheld device, which our sales associates on the floor use to capture the customers' order and transmit it electronically to the stock room, making the transaction at the cash more efficient by reducing wait time and allowing the customer to continue to browse. ", "Third, we will be piloting a real-time in-store inventory system in select factory stores with the intention of improving inventory accuracy and operational efficiency. ", "In Japan, we have just launched a non-commerce informational website, which we expect will drive Internet visitors into our stores. In addition, we completed the rollout of a POS system to Coach Japan this spring where we are now planning to introduce many of the same improvements that are part of our North American store environments. ", "Along with these investments in technology, we are, of course, also investing in further developing our greatest asset, which is the talented team who work in our stores. I just attended our annual North American store managers conference which took place in Boca Raton. The theme of the conference was leadership, and it focused on building the skills of our leadership team through customized training programs. As always, I was struck by the passion and commitment of the Coach retail team. ", "As you may know, we have low turnover for our industry and promote two-thirds of our store managers from within. I had the chance to talk with many of the attendees who were blown away by our performance, especially in single-store and secondary markets; markets like Milwaukee, Tucson, and Portland. In fact, it is these markets and success stories that make us confident in our ability to successfully double our North American retail store count to about 500 over the next several years. ", "Our new stores fall into three categories. First, existing markets. These are markets where we have several stores, but our current store trends show that we are still underdeveloped. Houston, Texas, a $33 million market for Coach last year, is a perfect example. Our newest stores in this market Baybrook and La Cantera, generated first year sales well ahead of pro formas and posted huge first-year comps. Our newest entrant in the market is First Colony, which just opened in March and is running at a $2.5 million annual clip, nearly 60% ahead of our expectations. It's particularly noteworthy that our Houston comp was 49% in FY '07, which represented an acceleration from the prior two years. ", "Developing markets is a second category for us. These are markets such as Milwaukee, Tucson, or Portland that have opened in the last few years that we had previously considered a single-store market, but early successes warranted the opening of second and third stores. Portland, Oregon is an example of a market where we have three stores today, which together generated $8.5 million in sales last year and comped at 30%. The newest, Bridgeport Village, opened in September 2005 and generated sales of $1.4 million in its first 12 months and is now comping at 37%. ", "Lastly, new markets. These are markets where we did not consider opening stores just a few years ago. However, given the much higher than expected new store productivity levels we're achieving and our deals with mall developers, we are opening them today with great success. They include such markets as El Paso, Texas which generated first-year sales of $3 million, well ahead of its pro forma. ", "Similar to the way we have looked at our store fleet with an eye toward evolving them from core to fashion to flagship, we are looking at cities and markets as potential candidates for upgrading. Clearly, our franchise is building as the consumer trades up into Coach and we also capture a larger share of our existing consumers growing accessories wardrobe. With the accessories market rapidly expanding and the Coach brand so vibrant, the potential for Coach and its current concept is far greater than we ever thought possible. ", "As most of you know, we have two primary sales growth drivers, each planned to achieve about 10 points of growth. First is distribution, as we expand our global network of store locations with an emphasis on North America. Second is productivity, which we drive globally through the introduction of innovative, relevant product, offering excellent value. We have been implementing five key strategies that focus on sustaining growth within our global framework. Clearly our largest opportunity continues to be in North America. ", "First, most generally, we're building market share in the rapidly growing North American women's accessories market by leveraging our leadership position as a top of mind and preferred brand for self-purchase and gifts. As part of this strategy, we've been emphasizing new usage occasions within our handbag offering and developing new flanker categories such as jewelry and fragrance. There is also a continuing opportunity to elevate our handbag offering, given the strength of our $400 plus segment, although we expect to see this AUR increase to be partially offset by the growth of categories, which have lower overall price points. ", "Our second strategy is the continued rapid growth in North American retail. We plan to add about 40 retail stores in North America in each of the next several years. Based on the continued rapid growth of the market, the performance of our new stores, and the greater numbers of new consumers we're attracting, we believe that North America in total can easily support about 500 retail stores, including up to 20 in Canada. This road map for expansion is based upon a buildup of individual malls and locations to meet our demographic requirements and economic hurdles. ", "During FY08, we expect to open about 40 new North American retail stores, including 15 from the first quarter. These new openings will include 11 completely new markets, such as Augusta, Georgia and Nashua, New Hampshire which opened last month. We expect to open at least six new factory locations with three opening in the current quarter. In addition, we will be expanding at least ten retail stores and several factory stores. Taken together, we would expect total square footage to grow by about 18% in FY '08, similar to last year. ", "Third, outside the U.S., we're continuing to increase market share with the Japanese consumer, driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new retail locations and by expanding existing ones. For FY08 we plan to open about ten to 15 net new retail locations, as well as a few factory outlets as this channel becomes more important to Japanese consumers. We will also continue to expand key locations. ", "Overall, we expect to increase our square footage in Japan at a slightly lower rate in FY08 than we did last year. ", "Also, we're continuing to target overall constant currency sales growth of 10% to15% for both the first quarter and full year in Japan driven primarily by distribution growth and low, single-digit comps. ", "Our fourth strategy is to raise brand awareness in emerging markets to build the foundation for substantial sales in the future. Greater China, Korea, and other such geographies are increasing in importance as the category is growing rapidly and Coach is taking hold. During the fourth quarter, 15 new Coach locations opened internationally, excluding Japan. Most of them were in Asia, including four in mainland China. In FY08, we will open through distributors, about 30 net new locations focused on greater China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. We also plan to open at least five more locations in major cities in Mainland China this year, bringing our total to 16. ", "In addition, underscoring our commitment to the region, we recently announced a new president for Greater China, Thibault Villet, who will be establishing our on the ground presence. He's responsible for the strategic leadership and operating results of Coach Greater China, including Mainland China, Hong Kong/Macau and Taiwan. Thibault will be partnering with Coach's regional distributors to develop, implement and execute the company's greater China strategy, focused on rapidly growing distribution, raising brand awareness, and building consumer loyalty. ", "Lastly, of course, we continued to have an overall focus on improving the rate of profitability so that our bottom line results continue to outpace top line performance. ", "At Coach, our formula for success has remained constant despite a changing environment. Our distinctive brand, our leadership position, our loyal consumer base, our multi-channel, international distribution and our focus on innovation and the consumer never vary and set us apart from the competition. The engine that drives these elements is our strong and seasoned management team, fueled by innovative, compelling product and supported by an adaptive, dynamic , global sourcing and supply chain. Our brand has never been stronger nor has our proposition ever been more vibrant. We are well-positioned to continue to capitalize on the abundant opportunities available to us and have the vision, strategies, and tactics in place to realize our long-term growth plans. ", "I will now turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. ", "Mike Devine", " Thank you, Lew and good morning, everyone. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter and year end results. ", "As Lew mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 30%, with sales of our direct businesses up 29% and the indirect business up 34%. For the year, total revenues rose 28% with sales generated by our direct channel rising 30% while our indirect revenues were up 20%. Net income for the quarter increased 41% to $159 million, and EPS rose 43% to $0.42 per share, as compared to $113 million or $0.29 per share in the year ago period. ", "Net income rose to $637 million in FY07, up 37% from the $464 million earned in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share rose 41% to $1.69 versus $1.19 a year ago. Our operating income rose 43% to $245 million in the fourth quarter versus $172 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 37.6% compared to 34.3% in the year ago quarter, a 330 basis point improvement. For the fiscal year, operating income rose to $993 million, a 39% increase, and operating margin for the year rose to 38% from 35.1% a year ago, up 290 basis points. ", "In the fourth quarter, gross profit rose 29% to $509 million from $394 million a year ago. Gross margin continued at its exceptionally high levels, finishing at 78.1% versus 78.5% in the prior year. During the year, gross profit rose 28% to $2.02 billion as compared to $1.58 billion a year ago, while gross margin was 77.4% versus 77.7% last year. ", "As expected, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were substantially below prior year levels in the fourth quarter, and represented 40.5% of sales versus 44.1% a year ago; a 360 basis point decline. For the full year, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales declined 320 basis points, 39.4% from 42.6% last year. All selling businesses saw their year-over-year spending rates decline and we also continued to leverage top line volume across all of our centralized functions. ", "At year end, cash and short-term investments stood at about $1.2 billion as compared with $538 million a year ago. Inventory levels were $291 million, up about 25% above prior year levels, below our 30% sales growth as our supply chain improvements and inventory management programs allowed us to support 48 net new U.S. stores, 20 net new locations in Japan and substantially increased sales levels with moderate additional inventory investment. Accounts receivable balances rose $23 million or about 28%. ", "Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $257 million compared to $195 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $214 million versus $161 million in the same period last year, mainly due to higher net income. ", "Our CapEx spending, primarily for new stores and renovations, was $43 million versus $34 million in the same quarter a year ago. For all of fiscal year 2007, net cash from operating activities was $779 million compared to $597 million last year. Free cash flow in fiscal year '07 was an inflow of $638 million versus $463 million in fiscal year '06, while CapEx spending totaled $141 million, again primarily for new stores and expansions, as well as investments in corporate infrastructure. ", "Now I'd like to provide you with some of our updated goals for fiscal 2008. We are looking for net sales growth of about 21% to at least $3.16 billion, driven by distribution growth and productivity gains. We expect to open at least 46 new stores in North America, 15 to 20 new locations in Japan, and about 30 new international locations, while we continue to expand select, highly productive locations globally. We expect to achieve at least 10% comparable store sales gains in both the North American retail and factory channels, and low single-digit comp location sales gains in Japan. ", "With our continued focus on profitability, pretax income dollar growth of about 26% above FY '07 levels. Two factors will somewhat moderate that growth on the EPS line in 2008. First, the higher share count, brought about by option exercises. Secondly, a higher tax rate, rising to about 39% due to the fact that incremental taxable income is being taxed at our maximum rates. This taken together would produce net income growth of about 25%, and earnings per share of at least $2.06, up over 22% from the $1.69 we just reported for FY07. ", "Moving to the first fiscal quarter of 2008, we are targeting net sales of about $655 million, representing a year-on-year increase of over 23%. For the quarter, we expect to open about 18 stores in North America, five in Japan, and five international wholesale locations with several expansions across these geographies, all augmented by U.S. comparable store gains of at least 10% in the retail channel and mid-teens in the factory channel with low single-digit comp location increases for Japan. We're looking for operating income to be up at least 25% year over year and earnings per share of at least $0.39 , an increase of more than 25%. ", "For FY08, we expect CapEx to rise to about $200 million, primarily for new stores and expansions both here and in Japan as discussed. In addition, we will be expanding our distribution center in Jacksonville by about 50% or 280,000 square feet to support Coach's projected sales growth over the next five years. While we upgraded the technology at this facility a year ago, we've now decided that a physical expansion is necessary to accommodate the faster than expected growth of our business. This will require CapEx of about $12 million to $15 million in FY08. ", "While these are our current goals, our actual results may vary from these targets based upon a number of factors, including those discussed under the business of Coach Inc. and risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K. Coach also does not assume any obligation to update these targets as the year progresses. ", "In summary, we're confident that our growth strategies will enable us to continue to gain share in the large and growing global market for fine accessories and gifts. Thank you everyone for your attention. Now Lew, Andrea and I will be happy to take some questions. ", " Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Bob Drbul - Lehman Brothers. ", " Bob Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Lew, the question that I have regarding Japan, when you look at the high single-digit comp in Japan, do you think that marks a significant improvement or change in the environment? How about maybe just Coach's success in Japan? Do you think this is an inflection point? ", "Lew Frankfort", " Good question, Bob. We actually believe that it has a lot to do with the strength of the collections we introduced last spring. Ergo was a phenomenal success. It actually generated 30% of sales during its launch month, much higher than we thought. As a result, we benefited particularly and we're taking those learnings forward as we introduce new Ergo groups, both in September and next June. Overall, we believe that the improvement is really within the range of variability. So, we're still forecasting 10% to 15% overall growth. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs", "Congratulations on 22 excellent quarters. Could you just talk about why the factory outlet channel is performing at double the pace of the full price channel? I know you said conversion and traffic were up double digit in factory outlet, but could you give us more color as to why that is occurring? Is it marketing that you're doing? ", "Lew Frankfort", " I'm with you. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs", "That's one question. On CapEx, even if we take out the distribution expansion, it's still up 31% year over year. Why is that? If you could elaborate. ", "Lastly, going forward, your points of leverage in your business model, what can we expect or how should we think about how you'll create further leverage and push your operating margins up even further above already truly excellent levels? ", " Andrea Shaw Resnick ", " Thanks for keeping it to one question, Margaret. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs", "If you want to answer one that's fine. ", "Lew Frankfort", " Mike, why don't you take the CapEx and the margin expansion questions first? ", "Mike Devine", "Margaret, you may recall that we guided to FY07 CapEx spending earlier in the year, I think on the last call, to about $160 million and we came in at about $140 million. That's purely timing of projects and settling up of invoices, if you will. So the way I think about it, if you look across the two years and you move the $20 million of timing out of '07 and into '08 and layer on the spend at Jacksonville, you're roughly, from our '07 guidance of $160 million, you get in the neighborhood of the $200 million. So it really does not represent any significant change in strategy from our thinking for '07. We feel it's relatively consistent, it's more about timing other than the Jacksonville issue. ", "So in talking about operating margins, obviously we saw another great quarter of SG&A leverage where, overall, we drove total increase in our operating rate improvement by 330 driven by SG&A leverage of 360, another great year where we got the operating margin up to 38%, 290 basis points above where it was for the full year. All of this happened, we think consistent with our guidance for the year on flattish gross margin rate, down slightly from last year, largely driven by channel mix and incredible SG&A leverage. ", "As we said many times, we believe that there is much leverage behind that for '08 and beyond. If we can continue to grow our top line in the neighborhood of 20%, you'll see us create great leverage in our centralized functions whether it's the Jacksonville distribution center or advertising or design and finance teams, everything that we have here in New York. ", "If we can continue to comp at 5% to 7% in the North American retail business, that business will continue to deliver leverage, as well. We're now seeing leverage coming out of Coach Japan. So, much leverage to come and we're optimistic that we'll continue to see operating margins grow into the future. ", "Lew Frankfort", " With regard to our factory store outlet performance, there's a lot I can say about the channel. I'll just provide some headlines in relationship to Coach. First for Coach, our factory store channels is equivalent to our diffusion brands. We never go on sale in our full price and our accessories concept. If someone wants to buy Coach on sale, they need to go to a factory store outlet. In fact, about 80% of sales in North America we estimate are purchased on discount. In Coach, we have an extremely loyal factory store customer who wants the Coach brand, but only wants to buy it at a discount. We do no external marketing whatsoever. It's entirely a pull strategy, which means that consumers are just are coming in increasing numbers because they're satisfied with what they realize. ", "What we have done, as you know, is improve the merchandise offering, and I do think that's attracting consumers, as well. So despite the higher gasoline price and concerns that some people have about consumer confidence, we're not seeing it at all in our factory store business or in our other channels. ", " Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs", " Is there any risk you're pulling traffic away from full price into factory outlet? ", "Lew Frankfort", " We measure it consistently, and the answer is no. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Edelman - UBS. ", " Jeff Edelman - UBS", "Lew, a very insightful discussion earlier. My question relates to price points in the U.S. stores. Given the 17% increase in the handbags over $400, are we seeing a shift in mix as you're pulling more customers up into the lower end price points? Just a follow-up on that: given the new product flow, what can we look at for average selling price in the first and second quarters? Thank you. ", "Lew Frankfort", " Just a clarification, Jeff. Handbags over $400 actually increased 75% to 17% of handbag sales in our own stores and in department stores it increased from 2% to 9% during the same period. So what we're finding is that consumers are attracted to the bags that have greater make. At the same time having a very broad and diversified consumer base, we are mindful of maintaining sharp price points. We have also seen an increase in sales of our smallest across the body bags, as well. So we're finding that there's growth on both ends and we do have a good assortment in the middle, as well. ", "Our overall handbag price during the fourth quarter in Coach stores actually only increased about 4% to about $280 from slightly under $270. The average handbag price actually only went up about 4%. ", " Jeff Edelman - UBS", " And the new product mix as it relates to the first half of the year? ", "Lew Frankfort", "I believe the average handbag price to be up in mid to high single-digits. However, it will be offset somewhat by increased penetration of lower-priced categories such as jewelry and fragrance, which will be growing rapidly. ", "Mike Devine", " Just to build off of what Lew said, we're looking for jewelry and fragrance to be about 4.5% of sales in '08 versus less than a 1.5% in '07. That's going to pull down average ticket. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup. ", " Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "I just had a quick question to follow-up on Bob's question. You had indicated that Ergo was 30% of sales in its launch month. ", "Lew Frankfort", " In Japan. ", " Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "That was in Japan? ", "Lew Frankfort", " Only Japan. That was a significant driver to the incredible 23% increase in the total quarter sales. ", " Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", " Terrific. Thanks for that clarification. Mike, could you just comment on the merchandise margin or gross margin trend within each channel? That would be helpful. Lew, if you could just give us a quick comment on your outlook for the next two quarters in your indirect sales. I know you've seen 34% and 36% growth in the last couple of quarters. It looks like in the first and second quarter you're up again 10% to 11% increases last year. Would you expect this trend rate to change? If you could just comment there, that would be great, thanks. ", "Lew Frankfort", " I think I'm going to answer the second question first. I think what you're actually referring to when you say 10% to 11% is actually our shipments, not our POS sales. The way we really look at our business is our POS sales. Let me answer it from a POS sales perspective. ", "Our business out of the box in July in North American department stores has continued extremely strong both in our accessories world as well as footwear. We have every reason to believe we will continue in the indirect businesses in North America to experience very strong POS increases year-on-year. ", "At the same time, our international wholesale business, especially our locations focused on the domestic consumer, is doing extremely well. Year-on-year, we expect to see extremely strong results. Last year in the first half, I know we did some inventory balancing and our shipments did not keep pace intentionally with our POS sales. I think we're in the better inventory position. So it's likely that we will see our shipments more closely reflect our POS sales in the first half. ", "Mike Devine", "Kimberly, let me talk to gross margin a little bit. I can't do it though, without first starting and saying that we believe the most important operative metric, of course, is to look at consolidated operating margins and we're thrilled with the expansion we had in the quarter and the year. ", "But moving back to gross margin rate, for the quarter we continue to have excellent trends in our business unit, gross margins while on consolidated we were off; channel mix, the fact the factory grew more quickly than the business as a whole and CJI, our highest gross margin channel grew more slowly, hurt us almost 60 basis points. So, if you adjust out for channel mix, we actually saw organic gross margin rate improvement. ", "If I could just elevate the story to look at the full year, for that time period, our gross margin year over year was down about 28 basis points. If you look there, channel mix and also the currency, the FX impact, those two things were a drag of 82 basis points. So our organic margin actually was up more than 50 basis points year over year, adjusting for those two factors with virtually every channel up year over year dramatically. ", "In fact, ironically, the biggest improvement came from our factory store year-over-year gross margin rate improvement. We're very happy with the underlying trends in our gross margin rate and particularly seeing that it's being driven, the improvement year-over-year and factory, is also very helpful. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel. ", " Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel", "Let me add my congratulations. My question relates to your mounting cash balance. Can you weigh in on what your plans are? To what point you are comfortable buying back stock? Is there any potential that you would consider an acquisition of another luxury brand with complementary categories? What are you just going to do with all this cash? ", "Mike Devine", "Let me first start, maybe hold the question about the acquisition for Lew at the end, but let me lead off by saying that first and foremost, our primary use of our cash is to reinvest in our core business. This is driven largely by investment in new stores and expansions globally. We're also looking at infrastructure improvements. Lew mentioned some in the prepared remarks, technology to further lower our SG&A rate, both in the in-store environments and in our centralized functions. I mentioned we're also going to invest and increase the size of Jacksonville to handle the continued accelerated growth of the business. ", "As you mentioned, historically we've used our cash as part of a share buyback program. In fact, last year in about a three-and-a-half month period, we spent more than $650 million on buyback. I think as most of you know, we have an authorization out there today that will allow us to go to the market and make a purchase of $500 million. The board has always supported us when appropriate to take that number higher. We've not publicly said at what point we'll get into the market, but we've been opportunistic buyers and we would look to continue to execute that strategy. ", "As I also look out further for other uses of the cash, I could see at some point in the not too distant future using that cash to buy out one of our international wholesale distributors, in effect looking to replicate the CJI model that we have used so effectively to drive shareholder value. Then at the end of the day, we are in a position where we're building cash and we're comfortable building that cash balance. ", "As Keith Monda, our Chief Operating Officer likes to talk about, to have powder dry money so we can further extend the growth of the story beyond our LRP period. Lew, do you want to talk to the acquisition? ", "Lew Frankfort", " Sure. First, we're not terribly enthusiastic about an acquisition in the foreseeable future, primarily because our opportunities as a mono brand continue to be boundless. We do have an articulated road map to double our business to $5 billion over the next four or five years and we feel very confident that we can do that staying focused on the opportunities with Coach. So we're not looking at anything at the moment. We'd be very cautious in this arena. ", " Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel", " Any chance of any dividend? ", "Lew Frankfort", " There's always a chance of a dividend. We talk about it probably every three months. We come up on balance saying, not for now. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Randy Konik - Bear Stearns. ", "Analyst for Randy Konik - Bear Stearns", "Just a quick question regarding your product mix. With the upcoming Heritage Stripe line planned for '08, how should we think about your mix of leather versus mixed material handbags? Specifically, with this line being coated canvas, could we expect to see a cyclical return to more non-leather bags in the next year or two? Thank you. ", "Lew Frankfort", " The short answer is that we're actually expecting, on the contrary, to see an increase in the role that leather plays within our handbag assortment in FY08 driven in large part by Ergo as well as Bleeker. Looking in its entirety, we think there'll be a modest increase in the role that leather plays compared to prior year. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Chen \u2013 Needham. ", " Christine Chen - Needham", " Thank you. Congrats on another amazing quarter. I wanted to talk a little bit about international. You had mentioned that international wholesale was up. I was wondering if that was consistent across the different geographies or in one area versus the other? I also wanted to ask about the jewelry and the beauty business if you have any product introductions coming in, what we might see there? ", "Lew Frankfort", " As Mike Devine indicated, we do expect jewelry and fragrance to account for -- ", "Mike Devine", " About 4.5 points of penetration in our full price channel. ", "Lew Frankfort", "So less than 1%? ", "Mike Devine", " Just under 1.5%. ", "Lew Frankfort", "1.5% this year. So we do expect these new flanker categories to be important on the margins. ", " Christine Chen - Needham", "For international across the geographies, is the performance pretty consistent or are certain areas performing better than others? ", "Lew Frankfort", " Excellent question. First, what we're finding is that the locations that are focused on domestic consumers, major markets like Korea, Greater China or Taiwan are performing remarkably well as our brand takes hold with local consumers. We're experiencing great growth also in the Middle East and other Southeast Asian countries. Markets that are focused on the Japanese tourists have been suffering. Japanese tourist levels of travel did not increase in '07 compared to last year, and actually the Japanese consumers are spending less on gifting when she travels than she did prior year. So we are seeing a much greater increase in domestic locations. Our focus, of course, is in developing the indigenous populations in these developing countries. ", " Andrea Shaw Resnick ", "At this point it's 9:35, and we're going to close the floor to questions.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.  At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Coach, Mrs. Andrea Shaw Resnick you may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning and thank you for joining us.  With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort Coach\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Mike Devine Coach\u2019s CFO; Mike Tucci President of North American Retail is also joining us.  Before we begin we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward looking statements including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years.  These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions.  Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate [inaudible] costs.  Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10K for a complete list of each risk factor.  Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.  We presently expect to update our estimates each quarter only however, the failure to update this information should not be taken as Coach\u2019s acceptance of these estimates on a continuing basis.  Coach may also choose to discontinue presenting future estimates at any time. ", "Now, let me outline the speakers the topics for this conference call.  Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our first fiscal quarter 2008 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward.  Mike Tucci will review our key initiative for the holiday season.  Mike Devine will [inaudible] details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter as well as our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2008.  Following that we will hold a Q&A session that will end by 9:30 AM.  I\u2019d now like to introduce Lew Frankfort Coach\u2019s Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks Andrea and welcome everyone.  As you know, we have once again announced excellent top line growth and even stronger bottom line results of 28% and 34% respectively for the quarter just completed.  We were extremely pleased with our performance, especially in light of the weakening retail climate in the US as our innovated and relative product clearly resonated with consumers across channels and geographies.  We were also encouraged with the continued strength of new stores that are coming online well ahead of expectations. ", "As you know, in today\u2019s press release we moderated our guidance for North American Retail same store sales for the balance of the year.  At the same time, we underscored our continuing positive outlook including the delivery of a 20% revenue gain this holiday season.  Given the vitality of the Coach brand, category strength and our diversified multi channel international business model, we\u2019re confident that the sales and earnings guidance for the year originally provided in July can still be achieved.  In addition, our ability to act quickly and nimbly to curve spending during a period of uncertain sales trends will ensure continued expense leverage.  While I will get into further detail of our current conditions and the outlook for the category in our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.", "Some highlights of our first fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 32% to $0.41 compared with $0.31 in the prior year as net income rose 34% to $155 Million.  Second, net sales totaled $677 Million versus $529 Million a year ago, a gain of 28%.  Third, direct to consumer sales rose 26% to $508 Million from $404 Million in the prior year.  Fourth, North American same store sales for the quarter rose 19.3% with retail stores up 10.8% and factory stores up 27.3%.  Finally, sales in Japan rose 17% in constant currency driven by new stores and expansions, augmented by low single digit retail comps as we continue to grow our market share. ", "During the quarter we opened 13 US retail stores including four in new market for Coach.  Rochester Minnesota, Augusta Georgia, Nashua New Hampshire and Jenson Beach Florida as well as three factory stores.  In addition, nine retail stores and four factory stores were expanded.  Thus, at the end of the period there were 272 full priced and 96 factory stores in operation in North America.  In Japan, four locations were added while one was expanded.  At quarter end there were 146 total locations in Japan with 23 full priced stores including eight flagships, 104 shopping shops, 14 factory stores and five distributor operated locations. ", "In direct sales increased 35% to $169 Million  from $125 Million in the same period last year.  Results were driven by strong POS gains in the US and internationally.  In fact, US department store performance of POS continued to be excellent running up about 20% last quarter on the same location basis. ", "We were very pleased with the performance on Coach US retail stores which enjoy strong increases in conversion and average transaction size while traffic slowed most notably at the end of the period.  Results in our full priced businesses both Coach retail stores and US department stores continued to be driven by the monthly flow of new product.  Our year end factory store business remained remarkably strong through the quarter given the vibrancy of the Coach brand, the strength of our proposition and continued sales growth in premium factory malls.  Finally, our Internet business rose 23% in total including, an 11% increase at www.Coach.com whiles sales through the introduction of Coach to the Macys and Dillards\u2019 websites which were not in place in a year ago quarter contributed to balance.", "I also want to highlight another spectacular quarter for Coach women\u2019s footwear.  Our business in department stores where we are now sold through about 800 locations rose about 75% at POS for the quarter.  We were also very pleased with the performance of Coach Japan this quarter were sale rose 17% in Yen and 15% in Dollars as our market share continues to grow rapidly.  Last quarter our growth in Japan was fueled primarily by distribution through both new stores and expansions augmented by low single digit comparable location sales. ", "Finally, we were particularly pleased with the significant improvement in operating margins.  While Mike Levine will get in to more detail on our financials and  of course, I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recount.  As you\u2019ve heard, Mike Tucci is with us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives.  Mike.", "Michael Tucci", "Thanks Lew.  As mentioned in our release, our transitional and fall offerings were successful across all categories and collections.  Each of our monthly introductions was well received started in July with Chelsea and the tiered off ring including novelty and limited edition styles.  This was followed by Hamptons and Legacy in August and by fresh group of belted Ergo Silhouettes in September.  Also, in September our jewelry assortment was expanded and introduced into an all store distribution.  Once again, it is important to note the strength of our $400 and over handbag offering in the quarter which doubled, representing 25% of our North American retail store handbag sales. ", "To open October we introduced Bleecker, our first new major lifestyle collection of fiscal 2008.  This collection which was inspired by Coach\u2019s heritage is anchored by a new version of our iconic double sack and has been well received.  Our Bleecker collection is a key focus and major investment for holiday.  And, as always, we\u2019re excited about our key items and concepts for holiday offered at a range of compelling price points.  First, in handbags beginning with Carly, this was first introduced in January an important key item style with broad consumer appeal and has consistently represented over 10% of business since its debut.  Second, Bleecker duffels inspired by our heritage and introduced earlier this month, this updated Silhouette is performing very well.  The convertible strap, great capacity and opening price point of $298 makes it particularly compelling.  Third, the Bleecker Flap starting at $348.  This iconic style was also introduced this month and the adjustable strap and exterior pockets add to its functionality.  ", "Finally, handbags over $400.  As I mentioned earlier, this category continues to be our fastest growing and we are well positioned for holiday in this price segment of our offering.  A few examples include the new Bleecker Elite Duffel at $748.  The Hamptons Miranda Satchel priced between $798-$1200 and the Legacy Lee Shoulder Bag priced from $598-$798. ", "In other categories, gifts under $100.  Whether an add on item or an introduction to the brand, she\u2019ll find a range of great gifts at sharp price points.  Included are fragrance and body lotion introduced this year, the best selling new capacity wristlet offered in a range of fabrics and mini skinnies in over 20 fabric and color choices just to name a few.  Also, jewelry, the updated holiday assortment includes a range of bangle bracelets priced from $68-$148, leather boyfriend necklaces and bracelets with charms at $88 and $98 and the Daphne collection a glass and plated metal group of rings, earrings, necklaces and bracelets at opening price points of $98. ", "Our holiday gifting floor set will be installed in the Monday before Thanksgiving with a focus on our key holiday statements and items.  The floor set will be refreshed to coincide with the launch of Resort on December 3rd.  A capsule collection of best seller Bleecker silhouettes offered in a spring signature palette and complemented by a group of metallic woven leather handbags and accessories.  Our holiday catalog in home in mid November has been expanded to include our new categories as well as the Resort collection.  We\u2019re also looking forward to introducing our special holiday gift guide which will be used as an in store selling tool focused on our key items.", "And finally, on the in store experience, Coach service is an initiative we implemented three years ago to enhance our consumer shopping experience and ultimately drive conversion.  As you know, this comprehensive training program teaches interactive selling and engagement techniques to our sales associates.  For FY 08 the program has evolved providing enhanced leadership skills to our store managers enabling them to develop their teams more effectively. ", "Technology initiatives will be important this quarter and they include first time and attendance.  A new time and attendance system is being implemented in advance of holiday. The system gives store leadership visibility to individual service leader productivity.  Specifically, it allows us to be more targeted in scheduling our most effective service leaders during peak times and then measuring their effectiveness. Second, eRunner, during the first quarter we rolled out our enhanced line management and checkout process to an additional 75 high volume stores taking us to 98 stores for the holiday season.  This system reduces transaction time and improves through put.  Third, web store pick up.  We expect that this initiative launched in July will be very popular with our holiday shoppers.  Stores will be ready to serve these customers quickly and efficiently as they visit our stores to pick up purchases and do some additional shopping. ", "Staying on the topic of www.Coach.com for a minute, as mentioned during our Analyst Day Presentation, we are excited about two new web based initiatives. First, the very recent launch of www.Coach.com in Canada and second, in early November we will be rolling out an online exclusive www.Coach.com gift registry just in time for holiday. ", "Simply put, our objective this holiday is to leverage our improved systems and operating standards to move the lines through the store faster while providing additional web service options for our Internet shoppers.  Naturally, many of these initiatives introduced for holiday will continue beyond.", "Before I turn it over to Lew I wanted to briefly touch on the performance of our new stores which has been truly exceptional and well ahead of our internal projections.  During our Analyst Day Presentation we talked about the out performance of stores opened in the first three quarters of 2007.  Good news is that the stores opened in the fourth quarter which we now have revised annual volumes are running at $2.4 Million dollars versus our expectation of $1.7 Million, 40% ahead of plan.  And, the four stores opened early enough in the first quarter to have been revised, including two in new markets and two in developing markets are running at volumes of $2 Million on average versus pro forma volumes of $1.4 Million.  Clearly, these results speak to the vibrancy of the brand and our ability to attract new consumers both in new and existing markets.  With that, I will return the discussion to Lew to continue with our over arching strategies.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks Mike.  During the last five years we have seen same store traffic increase by 50% in our North American retail stores.  At the same time, we generated double digit same store sales gains in each of these five holiday seasons capped by last year\u2019s comp of 20.8% of which about half came from higher traffic.  While we had initially expected that we could deliver another double digit holiday season at retail, the recent deceleration in traffic and moderation in category growth from the torrid 20% growth levels we have seen since 2003 to a rate closer to 10% this fall has lead us to be more conservative in our outlook. ", "At this point, for planning purposes we also think it is prudent to project that the category will grow at a 10% level for the remainder of our fiscal year.  With that said, we remain confident in our long term strategies and our prospects remain intact.  Our results both top and bottom line are determined by a multiple of factors.  Even with a modest North American retail comps our significant growth in US department stores and Coach factory stores along with Japan and other international markets in combination with strong new store performance will allow us to continue to achieve excellent revenue gains.  In addition, our strict financial controls will enable us to achieve superior earnings growth as well.", "As most of you know, we have two primary sales growth drivers, each plan to achieve about 10 points of growth.  First, is distribution; as we expand our global network of store locations with an emphasis on North America, Japan and greater China.  Second, is productivity which we drive across all geographies through the introduction of innovative relative product offer excellent value.  We have been implementing five key strategies that focus on sustaining growth within our global framework.  Clearly, our largest opportunity continues to be in North America.  First, most generally we are building market share in the growing North American woman\u2019s accessories market by leveraging our leadership position as a top of mind and preferred brand to self purchase and gifts.  As part of this strategy we have been emphasizing new usage occasions within in our handbag offering and developing new flanked categories such as jewelry and fragrance.  There is also a continuing opportunity to elevate our handbag offering as we have seen the so called white space between our price points and those of the European luxury brands continue to widen.  Our first legacy boutique opening this Friday on Bleecker street here in New York will feature a more elevated product assortment including, an exclusive group of bags and accessories.  This store will allow us to test merchandising, service and product initiatives. ", "Our second strategy is the continued rapid growth in North American retail.  We plan to add about 40 retail stores in North America in each of the next several years.  Based on the performance of our new stores and the greater number of new consumers we\u2019re attracting we believe that North America in totally, can easily support about 500 retail stores including up to 20 in Canada.  This road map for expansion is based upon a build up of individual malls and locations that meet our demographic requirements and economic hurdles.  Statistically, during FY 08 we expect to open about 40 new North American retail stores including the 13 already opened in the first quarter.  The new openings will include 11 completely new markets and we expect to open at least six new factory locations including, the three opened in the first quarter.  In addition, we will be expanding at least 10 retail stores and several factory stores.  Taken together, we expect total square footage to grow at about 20% in FY 08, a bit above last year. ", "Third, outside the US we are continuing to increase market share with the Japanese consumer driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new retail locations and by expanding existing ones.  FY 08 we plan to open about 10-15 net new retail locations as well as a few factory outlets as this channel becomes more important to Japanese consumers.  We will also continue to expand key locations.  Overall, we expect to increase our square footage in Japan at a slightly lower rate in FY 08 than we did last year.  Also, we\u2019re continuing to target overall constant currency sales growth of between 10-15% for the balance of the year in Japan driven primarily by distribution growth and those single digit comps. ", "Our fourth strategy is to raise brand awareness in emerging markets to build a foundation of substantial sales in the future.  Specifically, greater China, Korea and other such geographies are increasing in importance as the category is growing rapidly and Coach is taking hold.  During the first quarter eight new Coach locations opened internationally excluding Japan, including three in greater China.  In FY 08 we will open three distributors, about 30 new net locations focused on greater China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.  We plan to open at least three more locations in major cities in mainland China later this year bringing our total to 16. ", "And lastly, of course, we continue to have an overall focus on improving the rate of profitability so our bottom line results continue to out pace top line performance.", "In summary, we\u2019re well positioned to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities available to us and have the vision, strategies and tactics in place to realize our long term growth plans in respective of the near term environment.  I will now turn it over to Mike Devine for further detail on our financials.  Mike.", "Michael F. Devine", "Thanks Lew.  Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies.  Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.  As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 28% with direct to consumer which represents over \u00be of our business up 26% and in direct up 35% driven by strong gains in US department stores and international POS sales. ", "Net income for the quarter increased 34% to $155 Million or $0.41 per share as compared to $115 Million or $.31 per share in the year ago period.  Our operating income rose 32% to $239 Million in the first quarter versus $181 Million in the same period last year.  Operating margin in the quarter was 35.3% compared to 34.1% in the year ago quarter.  A 120 basis point improvement. In the first quarter gross profit rose 28% to $518 Million from $406 Million a year ago.  As our gross margins continue to be exceptionally high essentially flat to last year at 76.6% versus 76.7% in the prior year. ", "SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales were well below prior year levels in the first quarter representing 41.3% of sales versus 42.6% as we continue to deliver spending leverage against strong top line growth.", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $363 Million and were well controlled up only 21% from prior year levels but do include investments in key holiday initiatives which position us well for the season.  Further, this inventory level allows us to support 51 net new US stores, 15 net new locations in Japan and substantially increase sales levels from the year ago period. ", "Accounts receivable balances also grew more slowly than sales rising $31 Million or 26%.  Cash and short term investments stood at $1.2 Billion as compared with $456 Million a year ago. During the quarter the company repurchased 3 Million shares of common stock at an average cost of $43.72 per share.  At the end of the period $368 Million was available for repurchase under our current authorization. ", "Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $129 Million compared to $81 Million last year during Q1.  Free cash flow in the first quarter was an in flow of $90 Million versus $44 Million in the same period last year mainly due to higher net income.  Cap ex spending, primarily for new stores and renovations was $39 Million versus $36 Million in the same quarter a year ago. ", "Now, I\u2019d like to provide you with some of our updated goals for fiscal 2008.  For the second fiscal quarter  we are targeting net sales of about $970 Million, representing a year-on-year increase of about 20% with low single digit North American comparable sales in the retail channel and at least the mid teens in the factory channel with a low single digit comp gain at Coach Japan.  Operating income will also be up over 20% year-over-year and an earnings per share target of $0.68. ", "Our current goals for the full fiscal year are net sales growth of over 21% to over $3.17 Billion driven by distribution gains and productivity growth.  As mentioned, we expect to open at least 46 new stores in North America, 15-20 new locations in Japan and about 30 new international locations while we continue to expand select highly productive locations globally.", "Our second half sales expectations include mid single digit comparable store sales gains in North American retail stores and at least 10% comparable store gains in the factory channel and a total sales increase in Japan of between 10 and 15% in constant currency driven primarily by distribution growth through new stores opening and expansions augmented by low single digit same location sales growth.  We\u2019re targeting an operating margin of about 38.3% which assumes a gross margin close to last year\u2019s extraordinary levels over the balance of FY 08 and further SG&A leverage.  Operating income dollar growth of over 22% above FY 07 levels. Interest income levels of about $70 Million will add to pre-tax income.  Our net income will be somewhat offset by both higher share count and a higher tax rate rising to about 39% for the year due to the fact that incremental taxable income is being taxed at higher rates.  Including these factors we expect to generate EPS growth of about 22% which will produce earnings per share of about $2.06 in line with previous guidance. ", "For FY 08 we continue to expect cap ex to rise to about $200 Million, primarily for new stores and expansions both here in Japan as discussed.  In addition, as mentioned in our last call we will be expanding our distribution center in Jacksonville  Florida by about 50% to support Coach\u2019s projected sales growth over the next five years.  While we upgraded the technology at this facility a year ago, a physical expansion is now necessary to accommodate the expected growth of our business.  This will require cap ex of about $12-15 Million in FY 08.", "While these are our current goals, our actual results may vary from these targets based upon a number of factors including, those discussed under the business of Coach, Inc. and risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10K.  Coach also does not assume any obligation to update these targets as the year progresses.  In summary, we\u2019re confident that our growth strategies will enable us to continue to gain share in the large and growing global market for fine accessories and gifts.  Thank you everyone for your attention and now Lou, Mike, Andrea and I will be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you.  At this time if you would like to ask a question you may press star one on your touch tone phone.  If you would like to remove yourself from the queue you may press star two.  Once again, star one if you would like to ask a question.  Our first question comes from Robert W. Baird of Lehman Brothers, you may go ahead sir.", "Robert W. Baird \u2013 Lehman Brothers, Inc.", "Hi good morning.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning Bob.", "Robert W. Baird \u2013 Lehman Brothers, Inc.", "Lew, I guess just a couple of questions around your consumer, you know the Coach consumer.  When you look at the trends that you\u2019re seeing how concerned are you about your specific consumer in the high end?  And, do you have the right quality of inventory to match the trends that you are seeing within your product offerings?", "Lew Frankfort", "First, we\u2019re confident that the luxury consumer as well as the accessible luxury consumer which is our consumer Bob, is continuing to spend.  What we\u2019re experiencing in our stores for example, is much higher levels of conversion on lower levels of traffic this year.  So, she is spending and based upon what she\u2019s buying she\u2019s also responding very well to our elevated product offering.  In addition, when we look at our stats in terms of ongoing attitude consumer research from an attitude perspective, the Coach consumer has never been more vibrant than she is today.  She has actually the highest levels of metrics in terms of her belief and confidence in Coach relative to ranking Coach as one of her favorite brands, excellent value, a brand that she trusts, a brand that she would recommend.  So, we believe both the Coach consumer and more generally, the high end consumer is still out there and she spends when she shops.", "Michael F. Devine", "In terms of inventory position Bob, we feel very good about our position going in to the holiday season.  Mike referenced key initiatives that he has planned into his business and our inventories are well positioned to support those initiatives, we feel very good about it.", "Robert W. Baird \u2013 Lehman Brothers, Inc.", "Great.  Thank you very much.  Good luck.", "Lew Frankfort", " Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Margaret Mager, you may go ahead.  One moment please.  Our next question comes from Paul Leslie of Credit Suisse.  Your line is open sir, you may go ahead.", "Sarah Lewis - Credit Suisse North America", "Hi, this is Sarah Lewis calling on behalf of Paul.  I was just wondering, you highlight in your press release the ability to curb spending during this period of uncertain sales trends.  I was wondering if you can break up some of the bigger buckets that you\u2019ve been able to cut back on and also where we can expect some of the spending to be curbed going forward?  Thanks.", "Michael F. Devine", "The areas where we are able to act most quickly in terms of adjusting SG&A, is in Mike\u2019s business actually in the retail stores.  He talked about the investment we\u2019ve made in the time and attendance system as the most recent investment in technology that we\u2019ve put in place.  So, we are able to quickly match our stores staffing levels with the traffic that we\u2019re seeing coming into the stores.  So, that\u2019s one of the first levers that we\u2019re able to use so that we can optimize that relationship to drive conversion without over spending.  Secondly, many of our stores, in fact, the vast majority are in a variable percentage rent scenario with kick above breakpoints.  So as traffic and sales performance moderates so do our occupancy levels.  Beyond that we\u2019ve gone back into the business and are looking at all of our spending dollars and are looking for those that do not have near term immediately paybacks as we ride out this near term decline in traffic.  So, there are many levers that we have available to us and we feel good about the financial controls and how nimble we are in our ability to react to continue SG&A leverage.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question comes from Jeff Edelman from UBS.  Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Edelman \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you.  Good morning.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeffrey Edelman \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Could Lew or Mike give us a little more color in terms of your recent traffic trends was?  Were there any geographical differences or age of store?  To give us some sense whether or not it is really a weather or economy issue that is resulting in the reduced store traffic and mall traffic.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure.  Jeff, we\u2019re seeing really at the tail end of September the early part of October and I want to ground you from the standpoint of where we are for the quarter.  We\u2019ve got over 90% of the quarter in front of us as a significant portion of our volume comes post Thanksgiving but, what we\u2019re seeing in the immediate past few weeks is pressure in the northeast, some pressure in parts of the south, specifically our Florida market and pressure on the west coast.  We\u2019re actually very pleased with the continued relative success of our business in the mid west, parts of the southwest.  So, there is some geography.  I\u2019m not going to get into the weather because it\u2019s been well documented and that\u2019s really a factor that we have to manage through.  So, we\u2019re looking at some slight variation from a geographic standpoint and we\u2019re managing it very, very closely across all stores.  Age of store does not appear to be a factor at this stage in the game.", "Jeffrey Edelman \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Okay.  Great.  And then, as a follow up, could you discuss your average selling price and units per transaction?", "Michael Tucci", "Sure.", "Jeffrey Edelman \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "And again, whether there\u2019s any variation by geography there.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure.  Sure.  You know, one pocket of strength for us, by the way, recently has been Manhattan and that\u2019s be driven by what we see a robust fashion market here in Manhattan, some increase in international and domestic tourism and some pricing opportunity in what I would call our higher tiered stores.  Some real important factors: one, AUR improvement in handbags in the quarter was up almost 8%.  So, in a challenging cycle in terms of footsteps we\u2019re able to see significant improvement from a pricing standpoint and that will carry and help us tremendously as we go forward through the balance of the year.  ADT was up modestly in total because some of that AUR improvement was mitigated or offset by the introduction of jewelry and fragrance and some of the sharper priced items that we\u2019ve put into the assortment in small accessories.  So, we continue to see pricing power in the brand.  We also continue to see improved conversion levels on a lower index of traffic and that allows us to continue to get comp growth albeit against a weaker back drop from a traffic standpoint.", "Jeffrey Edelman \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Okay.  Great.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger of Citigroup.  Your line is open.", "Kimberly Greenberger, CFA \u2013 Citigroup", "Great.  Thank you.  I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on your department store POS sales.  Are there any in particular that you can call out as being stronger or by contrast weaker?  And then, Mike I was hoping you could give us just some color on your merchandise margin by channel and if you\u2019re seeing continued gains in organic gross margin by channel?  Thanks.", "Michael Tucci", "First, with regard to department stores, we actually have experienced good growth across the board during the first quarter. Interestingly, the greatest growth actually during the first quarter came from Dillards which, as you know, is a regional department store which grabbed about 35% ahead of POS. ", "Michael Tucci", "So Kimberly, let me take the \u2013 I assume you\u2019re speaking to gross margin rate and it was our Q1 performance we were once again very pleased with in terms of organic gross margins rate.  You saw that we were essentially flat, actually off 10 blips off of Q1 of a year ago and we were almost fully able to offset with organic gross margin rate improvement about 20 blips of dampening impact from channel mix and about 20 blips coming out of CJI as we sold through inventory that was purchased with a weaker Yen in Q1 of this year than Q1 of a year ago.  So, we had 40 blips if you will of bad news to overcome and we essentially did that by getting back to essentially flat with organic margin rate improvement, gross margin rate improvement.", "Kimberly Greenberger, CFA \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks and good luck for holiday.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", " Our next question comes from Margaret Mager of Goldman Sachs.  Your line is open, you may go ahead.", "Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs & Company", "Hi.  My apologizes on technical difficulties there, I hope I didn\u2019t miss too much.  But, the question I\u2019d like to hear you respond to is on the traffic why do you think it is weaker and why has it weakened in the past several weeks in your opinion?  And then, as you look out towards the second half of the year with your comp guidance going from low single digit back up to mid single digit, what do you see on the horizon that would encourage you to pick back up?  And then, related, on the department store front when you outline your expectations for the rest of the year, one of the things you called out is continuing to see strength is on the department stores.  Given that the traffic issues seem to be broader based environmental across all of retail, wouldn\u2019t you expect your department store business to start to weaken as well?  And, is that incorporated into your outlook?  Thanks.", "Lew Frankfort", "Let me take the second part of the question first.  In department stores which have not been a strong channel in terms of traffic year-on-year for several years now, Coach has out performed our competitors and have continued to have grown, as you know, very substantially in these periods.  The reason for that is that we deal with a less qualified consumer in department stores.  When a consumer is looking to buy a bag in a department store she might be loyal to Coach or she might not.  But, if she\u2019s looking for a bag we have an opportunity to compete with the other resources and even though we have 30% market share in department stores, there\u2019s another 70% we don\u2019t have.  So, we\u2019ve been fortunate that consumers continue to see our product and our offering as superior as our competitors and we believe that will continue.  So, we\u2019re very confident in our estimates in department stores that we will out pace their performance and that we will out pace other categories performance.  With regard to the retail environment, Mike touched on it earlier, the weather situation is well documented so we won\u2019t talk about that but, the overall retail environment has been soft.  It particularly started to affect us in late September and that has continued through October and when we look at it, we also look at our comparisons with last year.  The reality is that our traffic was up 11% or so this past quarter, the quarter we\u2019re in now and when we move into the second half of our fiscal year we\u2019re up against easier traffic comparisons and we also don\u2019t believe that the unusual retail environment is influenced by whether it is going to continue at this level.  Consumers will be back shopping once weather turns cooler on a sustained bases, consumers will remember that most of us do live in a tempered climate and there are seasons.", "Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs & Company", "Okay Lew, can you tell us what you\u2019re building into your expectations for department stores as far as maybe where it has been and where you see it going in terms of rate of growth?  If I recall correctly, I think that channel has been growing about 30% for you?", "Lew Frankfort", "We\u2019re very comfortable with our 20% plus growth expected during the rest of the fiscal year at POS in department stores. ", "Margaret Mager - Goldman Sachs & Company", "Okay.  Thanks and good luck.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question comes from Randy Konik of Bear Stearns.  Your line is open.", "Randy Konik - Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc.", "Great.  Thank you very much.  Lew, you talk a lot about, in your comments, about the sic down turning traffic and reduced category growth sic locality for the remainder of the year.  Can you talk in balance about [inaudible] versus secular, how do you think about the longer term secular process for the industry and what makes you so confidence there?  And, how long is the cycle, is your cycle forecast for a weaker back half picking up into the next year of calendar 08.", "Lew Frankfort", "Randy, first for context we don\u2019t really see this [inaudible] shift. The reality is handbags, during the course of these last several years has become an ever increasing important component of women\u2019s wardrobes.  You know the drill, she\u2019s now buying over four handbags a year compared with just two several years ago.  The reality is that accessories remain very important to our consumer, she\u2019s extremely loyal to them and we have every reason to believe that she is going to continue to purchase them at levels equal to, if not higher than she has in the past.  The reality is that we have experienced over 20% growth in the category since the second half of 2003.  We expected it to slow down, we just didn\u2019t know when it would occur.  It seems to have occurred this fall and we\u2019re looking for the category to continue to grow at about a 10% level.  Naturally, it could pick up or it could slow somewhat but, our assumptions going forward are built upon 5% growth although we\u2019re planning the category to grow about 10%.  The other thing that we need to keep in mind is that overall retail spending has declined and we don\u2019t know to what expense the drop in growth rate from 20% to between 10-15% is a factor of the sudden decline in retail spending.  Anything else Randy?", "Randy Konik - Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc.", "I\u2019m fine.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michelle Clark from Morgan Stanley.  Your line is open you may go ahead.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you.  Mike, do you still need about a 5% comp growth at North America retail to leverage SG&A?  Or, will that decline as you roll out these new technologies?  And then secondly, you gave us POS, department store POS at Dillards, can you also give it to us for both Nordstrom as well as Macys?  Thank you.", "Michael Tucci", "This is Mike.  I\u2019ll take the questions on the comps and then Lew maybe can take the question on department store POS.  I don\u2019t think typically we\u2019ve given that level of granularity across the board.  But, in terms of the comp basis, you know, we talked to a 5-7% comp rate leading to the leverage to the retail P&L in quarters past.  We still feel good about that.  To answer your specific question, assumed in that guidance from quarters past was continued investment and technology and continuing ability to leverage our spend and become more efficient over time so, that had always been in our thoughts and guidance.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", " And then, the other question on POS department stores?", "Lew Frankfort", "Actually, we\u2019re looking for them.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Oh, okay.  Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort", "We\u2019re looking for the numbers. What we\u2019re going to need to do is get back to you separately on the other numbers.  We don\u2019t have them available.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.  Great.  Then, just one last question on the traffic weakness.  Are you seeing that both on your off mall stand alone stores as well as your in mall retail stores?", "Lew Frankfort", "In general, we are.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question comes from Erwan Rambourg of HSBC.  Your line is open, you may go ahead.", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Hi good morning.  Irwin Rabu from HSBC in London.  Coming back to traffic, if the traffic levels remain slow could this theoretically effect your store network expansion plans?  i.e. could you cut your plans or on the contrary accelerate openings to compensate for this weaker traffic?", "Michael F. Devine", "It\u2019s highly theoretical at the moment.  Clearly, if there\u2019s a key change over a number of years, or over a much longer period things could change.  But, the reality is that we\u2019re talking about a very short term trend that we believe is going to correct itself as we move into the holiday season and we have no reason to believe otherwise.  So, we\u2019re very confident and comfortable with our roll out strategies and our trends.  Our new stores as we said, are performing exceptionally well 30-40% ahead of our pro formas. ", "Michael Tucci", "And then, just as a reminder when I think  many of you have seen our prepared materials at our more conservative pro forma  levels we\u2019re getting cash paybacks on these store openings of a year and a half so when we\u2019re out performing by 20-40%, you can do the math these are outstanding investments we would not consider slowing. ", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Okay.  Thanks.  Just a follow up question on the comp levels of full price retail because actually the figure was close to 11% for the quarter you were mentioning weakness at the end of the quarter.  Can you confirm that the comp level was still positive?  Or, can you give a bit of flavor on the differences between beginning of quarter and end of quarter.", "Michael Tucci", "The way that we look at it within the quarter on the 11 comp primarily driven by conversion and a modest improvement in tickets, we did see a slow down in traffic at the end, at the very end of the quarter but the traffic in total was down slightly for the quarter.", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Okay.  And then, maybe just a last quick question, it seems that the Coach consumer is much more resilient at the higher price points.  Is it safe to say this and if it is the case will you accelerate focus on these higher price points?", "Lew Frankfort", "Let me just jump in here and first say that our factory business, contrary to our full price, traffic, that is our traffic in our factory stores continues to run extremely high year-on-year comparisons.  We\u2019re seeing no slowdown at all in her spend in the factory arena.  In fact, we think the unusual warm weather, of course, has contributed to a pattern where our factory shoppers are behaving like its still summer.  Visiting for weekend jaunts their regional malls and tourist areas.  So, we\u2019ve seen no slow down in spending in our factory stores, again our most valued sensitive of the channels.  With regard to full price, we see that consumers are buying at all prices points.  The challenge that we\u2019re experiencing in the first part of this quarter as we said a number of times now is our traffic levels.  But, once she\u2019s in the stores she\u2019s buying at a significantly higher level than she did last year. ", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question comes from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.  You may go ahead.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Good morning everyone.  Can you talk a little bit about inventory planning given the lower comp expectations, how you\u2019re planning inventory going forward.  And also, any update on Japan both either on your own retail stores in department stores in terms of what your seeing there.  Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort", "Let me answer the second part first which is Japan.  Our October business continues strong in Japan and the trends that we were experiencing in the first quarter continue on date.", "Michael Tucci", "So Dana, to speak to inventory planning you know as well and have heard us talk and come to understand our supply chain and how nimble it is.  So yeah, as we\u2019ve moderated our expectations around top line growth we\u2019ve gone in and to a small degree moderated our production plans as well. You know our operating model.  Inventory is just a non issue for us here at Coach.  The flexibility of the factory channel at all will allow us to keep inventories very well controlled.  So, as I talked about the Q1 inventory levels were actually up much less than sales growth was up so we feel very good about inventory levels and production planning and will be nimble and react to the business as appropriate.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question comes from Christine Chen of Needham & Company.  You may go ahead.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Thank you.  I wanted to follow up on the question about traffic.  You spoke a little bit about the differences in geography.  Has there been any difference between your fashion flagship versus core stores?  And then, I have a follow up question on how jewelry has been performing.", "Michael F. Devine", "Actually when I had mentioned, the question earlier was on age of store and we have not seen any significant difference in age of store and when we look across attributes core, fashion, flagship the band on variation is very, very slight.  There\u2019s really not a difference.", "Lew Frankfort", "Ah yeah.  Let me at Christine we didn\u2019t have no evidence to believe that this was a Coach specific issue. We believe it is a function of the overall retail environment based on all the diagnostics that we\u2019ve undertaken. ", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "And then with respect to jewelry now that it\u2019s in all stores?  I know it\u2019s early but, how as performance been?", "Michael Tucci", "We\u2019re actually very pleased with jewelry it\u2019s going to be an important element of our gifting strategy for Q2 operating above or on plan in all the stores it has rolled out to.  Percent contribution levels between 2.5-3.5% depending on the store type and the assortment and the difference there is we have the capsule group for select flagship stores of a sterling line that has been excellent that has been driving some penetration.  We\u2019re actually looking at reacting to that to be in a good inventory position for holiday and add a few stores as we have inventory and capacity available to do so.  So, it looks like a nice category for us and generating a lot of interest in the stores.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "And then on the non Japan international front, maybe I missed it, could you possibly comment on how much that was up because it\u2019s blended into the wholesale category or direct category?", "Lew Frankfort", "We\u2019re just checking the numbers.  As our POS, I believe our sales were up double digits.  I was looking for the exact number.", "Michael Tucci", "And in terms of impact to our financial statements the net sales or shipments are in that 35% in direct number so we had a very good quarter with our international distribution partners as well.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Okay.  Great.  Thank you and good luck for the holidays.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "It is now 9:32, the market is open and we\u2019re going to conclude this conference call.   As always, we\u2019ll be available for questions throughout the day and the week.  Thanks everybody for joining us and have a fabulous day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Mike Devine will conclude with details, financial and operational highlights for the quarter, as well as our outlook for the second half and full fiscal year 2008.", "Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session that will end by 9:30\u00a0a.m.", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO. ", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone.", "As you know, we've announced strong top line and bottom line growth of 21% respectively for the quarter just completed, a bit ahead of our expectations. We were pleased with our performance, especially in light of the weakening retail climate in the U.S. We were also encouraged with the continued strength of new stores, which are coming online well ahead of expectations.", "Some highlights of our second fiscal quarter were:", "First, earnings per share rose 21 - I'm sorry, excuse me. Excuse me. Overall, Coach's holiday performance reflected the strength of the Coach franchise, our position as a gift authority, and the continued strength of the U.S. handbag and accessory category.", "However, this quarter demonstrated for the first time in our public history that we are not immune to a slowing consumer environment. At the same time, it's important to underscore our continuing positive outlook, including the delivery of at least a 17% revenue gain for the balance of the fiscal year, driven, as always, by both distribution growth and productivity gains.", "We're well positioned for the spring season and expect that our diversified model will continue to mitigate the impact of the consumer malaise in the U.S.", "Given the vitality of the Coach brand, category strength and our diversified business model, we're confident that the earnings per share guidance for the year originally provided in July and reiterated in October can still be achieved.", "In addition, our ability to act quickly and nimbly secure spending during a period of uncertain sales trends as demonstrated in our holiday quarter will ensure continued expense leverage.", "While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category in our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.", "As you know, Coach announced a sales increase of 21%, a 21% increase in earnings per share for the quarter just completed. It's worth noting that Coach's achieved double-digit sales growth since 2001 in each holiday quarter for a fiveyear CAGR of 27%, including a 30% increase in the year-ago quarter.", "Again, some highlights of our second fiscal quarter were:", "First, earnings per share rose 21% to $0.69 as compared to $0.57 in the prior year, while net income rose to $252 million from $214 million.", "Second, net sales totalled $978 million versus $806 million a year ago, a gain of 21%.", "Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 18% to $799 million from $675 million in the prior year.", "Fourth, U.S. same-store sales for the quarter rose 7%, with retail stores down 1.1% versus a gain of nearly 21% last year, while factory store sales were up 17.7%.", "Finally, sales in Japan rose 17% in constant currency and 21% in dollars, driven by distribution growth and mid single-digit overall comps as we continue to grow our market share.", "During the quarter, Coach opened 10 North American retail stores, including two new markets for Coach - Allentown, Pennsylvania and Anchorage, Alaska - and expanded five others. We also opened three factory stores during the second quarter. At the end of the period, there were 282 full-price and 99 factory stores in operation in North America.", "In Japan, one new department store location was opened along with one new factory store, while one department store location was closed and four locations were expanded. At quarter end, there were 147 total locations in Japan, with 23 full-price stores including 8 flagships, 104 shop-and-shops, 15 factory stores, and 5 distributor-operated locations.", "Indirect sales increased 37% to $179 million from $130 million in the same period last year. During the quarter, POS sales at U.S. department stores grew over 10%, while international POS sales grew by more than 25%. ", "We estimate that premium and U.S. handbag and accessory category sales grew by about 10% during the holiday quarter. At the same time, Coach's handbag sales rose 15% across all channels in North America over the like period. ", "As mentioned, we were pleased with our overall performance in North America this quarter against very difficult comparisons across all channels. Our total revenues in North America were up 20%, with our directly operated stores generating a 19% gain driven by both distribution and the overall high single-digit comp. ", "North America retail stores posted an 11% gain despite a 1% comp decline which, as you know, was slightly below our low single-digit guidance. Two of three comp metrics - traffic and conversion - met our expectations, while our average ticket posted a modest decline reflecting the fact that some of our consumers traded down to lower price point items, which Mike Tucci will discuss in more detail in just a minute. ", "Results in our full-price businesses both in North America and internationally continue to be driven by the monthly flow of new products. Our U.S. factory store business remained remarkably strong throughout the quarter given the vibrancy of the Coach brand, the strength of our proposition, and continued sales growth in premium factory malls.", "Finally, Coach sales on the Internet rose 15% in total this holiday, with the majority of the growth driven by the introduction of Coach to the Dillard's and Nordstrom's web sites.", "I also want to highlight another excellent quarter for Coach women's footwear. Our business in department stores where we are now sold through about 800\u00a0locations rose about 65% at POS for the quarter. ", "We were also very pleased with the performance at Coach Japan this quarter, where sales rose 17% in yen and 21% in dollars. Growth in Japan was fuelled primarily by distribution through both new stores and expansions, augmented by mid single-digit comparable location sales as our market share continued to expand against a weak category backdrop.", "While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials in general and these metrics in specific, I wanted to give you this recap of Coach's second quarter performance.", "I will now turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American retail holiday sales performance and our spring initiatives.", "Mike?", "Michael Tucci - President, North American Retail", "Thanks, Lew, and good morning.", "Lew has just given you a recap of the quarter, which was challenging in many respects. While we essentially met our guidance of our high single-digit combined full-price and factory store comp, we were surprised by the slight comp decline in our retail stores, where our traffic challenges continued through the quarter.", "The good news was that against the lower traffic, we actually converted at a much higher rate, although at a lower average transaction size or ticket than we saw last year as some consumers were definitely trading down to lower-priced items.", "As mentioned in our release, our holiday offerings were generally well received across categories in collections. Our key item strategy was successful this season, which featured groups and item concepts generating about 50% of our holiday sales.", "Bleecker, our newest lifestyle platform which was inspired by our classic Heritage, was the most important initiative during the quarter. It was well received by consumers, notably at higher price points. In fact, the $400 and up handbag offering represented about 22% of handbag sales this year versus 13% last year.", "At the other end of the spectrum, new items such as our $98 capacity wristlet were top sellers, while new categories such as jewellery and fragrance were great giftables at sharp prices.", "The strong performance of these categories speaks to the vibrancy of the brand as we gave consumers new ways to participate in Coach this holiday season. ", "Overall on a comp basis, we did see handbag penetration in our retail stores decline slightly in favor of these lower price point items. This suggests an opportunity in smaller bags at sharper prices which will be reflected in our assortments going forward. ", "Before moving on to spring, I'd like to touch on some of the key points from our Coach Service initiative during holiday.", "Coach Service is an initiative we implemented three years ago to enhance our consumers' shopping experience and ultimately drive conversion. For FY08, the program evolved, providing enhanced leadership skills to our store managers, enabling them to develop their teams more effectively. Our focus for holiday was on technology initiatives. ", "First, time and attendance. A new time and attendance system was implemented in advance of holiday. The system gives store leadership visibility to individual service leader productivity. Specifically, it allows us to be more targeted in scheduling our most effective service leaders during peak times and then measuring their effectiveness.", "Second, E-Runner. Our enhanced line management and checkout process was rolled out to an additional 75 high-volume stores, taking us to 98 stores for the holiday season. The system reduced transaction time and improved throughput.", "Third, web store pick up. This service enhancement benefited consumers by allowing them to pre-order online for in-store pickup. ", "In summary, these initiatives allowed us to leverage our store labor costs while at the same time delivering a superior in-store experience to our shoppers.", "I also wanted to briefly touch on the performance of our new stores, which has been well ahead of our internal projections. ", "During our analyst day presentation in September, we talked about the outperformance of stores opened in fiscal year 2007. This positive trend has continued, and the 21 stores opened in the first four months of FY08 are running about 24% ahead of pro forma, with an average first year annual volume of $2\u00a0million.", "Turning to spring, we're enthusiastic about our transitional and seasonal offerings. As part of this transition, we recently introduced the New Slim Carly, offered in leather and signature across multiple silhouettes with iconic elements such as harness detailing and turn locks.  ", "In addition, we updated our Hamptons Collection with a fresh color palette and silhouette, including the popular Madeline Tote and introduced new spring accessories.", "For February, we will be launching Heritage Stripe, a group of coated canvas totes and bags representing a new concept, broadening our scope of attitudes, as well as a new collection of signature stripe handbags and accessories at great price points.", "For March, we will be introducing a new silhouette, the Francine Satchel, while updating the Hamptons Weekend Collection.", "April will mark the re-launch of Soho in drapier, feminine shapes, and we're very excited about pleated Ergo coming in for Mother's Day. ", "In summary, we're confident in our spring opportunities, both in product flow and our continued focus on Coach Service.", "With that, I will return the discussion to Lew to continue with our overarching strategy.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Thanks, Mike.", "I think it's important to note that this challenging climate has only served to reinforce our longstanding practice of evolution and continuous improvement. We are embarking on a comprehensive review of all ways in which the brand touches the consumer. These initiatives will be evident as we move into full year 2009, most notably in our product and in our store environments.", "We plan to leverage for the early successes we have seen with our Pinnacle offering, creating a broader assortment of more sophisticated and elevated product which will create a halo for the entire brand, heightening Coach's aspirational appeal.", "We will also at the same time maintain the balance that is key to our franchise, capitalizing on our leadership position with our loyal core consumer and with the aspirational consumer who is often trading up to Coach.", "It is for these reasons that we're now realigning our product development structure to create separate cross-functional design and sourcing teams dedicated to meeting the varying consumer requirements across attitudes and price points.", "We will also be enhancing our in-store experience notably through the environment, creating a more residential and intimate feel, with more proprietary elements capturing the attitude we have achieved in our legacy concept store here in Manhattan.", "We continue to believe that our opportunities, both in our home market and internationally are abundant. For perspective, we estimate the addressable handbag and accessory market in North America reached over $8\u00a0billion in calendar 2007 and is continuing to demonstrate growth despite the weaker economy.", "Thus, with the Coach brand so strong and the market expanding, the potential for Coach remains significant.", "As most of you know, we have two primary sales drivers; each plan to achieve about 10 points of growth.", "First is distribution as we expand our global network of store locations with an emphasis on North America, Japan and Greater China.", "And second is productivity, which we drive across all geographies through the introduction of innovative, relevant product offering excellent value. ", "We have been implementing four key strategies that focus on sustaining growth within our global framework. Clearly, our largest opportunity during our planning horizon continues to be in North America.", "First most generally, we're building market share in a growing North American women's accessories market by leveraging our leadership position as a topofmind and preferred brand for self-purchase and gifts.", "As part of this strategy, we've been emphasizing new usage occasions within our handbag offering and developing new flanker categories such as jewellery and fragrance. ", "There is also a continuing opportunity as I mentioned to elevate our handbag offering. As we have seen, the so-called white space between our price points and those of the European luxury brands continue to widen.", "Our first legacy boutique which opened on Bleecker Street here in New York in October features a more elevated product assortment, including an exclusive group of handbags and accessories. This store, which allows us to test merchandising, service, and product initiatives, has been performing extremely well.", "Our second strategy is the continued rapid growth in North American retail. We plan to add about 40 retail stores in North America in each of the next several years. Based on the performance of our new stores and the greater numbers of new consumers we are attracting, we believe that North America in total can easily support about 500 retail stores, including up to 20 in Canada.", "This roadmap for expansion is based upon a build up of individual malls and locations that meet our demographic requirements and economic hurdles. Specifically, during FY08 we expect to open about 40 new North American retail stores, including the 23 already opened in the first half.", "The new openings will include 13 completely new markets, and we expect to open a few more factory stores in addition to the six opened in the first half. Also, we will be expanding nearly 20 retail stores and several factory stores.", "Taken together, we expect total square footage to grow at about 20% this year, a bit above last year.", "And third, outside the U.S. we're continuing to increase market share with the Japanese consumer driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new retail locations and by expanding existing ones. For FY08, we plan to open about 10 net new retail locations as well as a few factory outlets as this channel becomes more important to Japanese consumers.", "We will also continue to expand key locations. Overall, we expect to increase our square footage in Japan at a slightly lower rate in FY08 than we did last year.", "In addition, we're continuing to target overall constant currency sales growth of between 10% and 15% for the balance of the year in Japan, driven primarily by distribution growth.", "Our fourth strategy is to raise brand awareness in emerging markets to build a foundation for substantial sales in the future. Specifically, Greater China, Korea, and other such geographies are increasing in importance as the category is growing rapidly and Coach is taking hold.", "During the first half, we opened a net of 15 new international locations outside of Japan, including six in Greater China. In FY08, in total we will open through distributors about 30 net new locations focused on Greater China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.", "A few highlights of our upcoming international openings are worth mentioning.", "First, as noted in our press release, given the rapid growth we're experiencing in East Asia and Greater China, we are particularly pleased to announce the opening of a global flagship store on Queen's Road Central in Hong Kong scheduled for early summer 2008. This flagship will significantly enhance the Coach brand and is consistent with our strategy of raising awareness and aggressively growing market share with the Chinese luxury consumer. Clearly, Greater China has the potential during the next few years to become the third major market for Coach following North America and Japan.", "Second, we are also pleased to announce plans to enter the Russian market through an arrangement with JamilCo, a local distributor with significant luxury brand experience. Together, we expect to open at least 15 Coach locations in Russia over the next five years, initially concentrating development in Moscow and St.\u00a0Petersburg.", "In summary, we're well positioned to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities available to us and have the strategies in place to realize our long-term growth plan irrespective of the near-term environment.", "At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials.", "Mike?", "Michael F. Devine - CFO and EVP", "Thank you, Lew.", "Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results.", "As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 21%, with direct-to-consumer up 18% and indirect up 37%.", "Earnings per share for the quarter increased 21% to $0.69 a share as compared to $0.57 in the year ago period as net income rose to $252 million from $214\u00a0million.", "Our operating income rose 18% to $403 million in the second quarter versus $341\u00a0million in the same period last year.", "Operating margin in the quarter was 41.2% compared to 42.3% in the year ago quarter.", "In the second quarter, gross profit rose 19% to $737\u00a0million, up from $621\u00a0million a year ago. ", "Gross margin rate was 75.4% versus 77.1% last year, impacted by the promotional environment in North America as well as currency fluctuations.", "SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were below prior year levels in the quarter and represented 34.2% of sales versus 34.8% last year. ", "We achieved leverage on our retail P&L despite its lower level of comp, while we also saw leverage on what we refer to as our semi-fixed corporate functions.", "Moving to the balance sheet, inventory levels at quarter end were $301\u00a0million, about 20% above prior year levels and slightly below our sales increase, leaving us well positioned with clean inventories as we enter the spring season. This inventory increase allows us to support 54 net new U.S. stores, 15 net new locations in Japan, and substantially increase sales levels. ", "Accounts receivable balances rose only 14%.", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $891 million as compared with $820\u00a0million a year ago, despite the repurchase of $839 million worth of our stock in the interim 12 months.", "Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $393 million compared to $345 million last year during Q2. ", "Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $345 million versus $307\u00a0million in the same period last year, mainly due to higher net income.", "Our Capex spending, primarily for new stores and renovations, was $48\u00a0million versus $37\u00a0million in the same quarter a year ago.", "As noted in our press release, during the second quarter we repurchased and retired 20.5 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $34.51, spending a total of $707 million or an additional 9.9 million shares at $34.24 per share since our November 9th announcement of the new $1 billion authorization.", "As of the end of Q2, $661 million was still available under the company's most current repurchase authorization, which was put in place on November 9th.", "Now I'd to provide you with some of our updated goals for fiscal 2008. ", "For the second half of 08, we're targeting net sales of at least $1.5 billion representing a year-on-year increase of at least 17%, operating income up about 16%, reflecting an operating margin of about 36.5%, and earnings per share of $0.97, an increase of 20%.", "As noted, we are not providing comparable store sales guidance due to the lack of visibility given the macro backdrop.", "Additionally, it should be noted that going forward we will be reporting only total sales growth in Japan consistent with the practice of our peers.", "Our current goals for the full fiscal year are net sales growth of at least 20% to at least $3.15 billion, and we're targeting an operating margin of 37.7%, which assumes further SG&A leverage over the balance of the year while gross margin is expected to decline about 100 basis points; operating income dollar growth of about 20% above FY07 levels; interest income of about $40 million, which is significantly lower than included in our prior guidance due to the cash used on buyback activity as well as lower interest rates. This interest income will add the pretax income while net income will be somewhat offset by a higher tax rate this year at about 39% due to the fact that incremental taxable income is being taxed at higher rates. ", "Including these factors, we anticipate generating EPS growth of 22% which will produce earnings per share of $2.06, consistent with our prior guidance.", "For FY08, we are still planning to spend about $200 million on Capex, primarily for new stores and expansions both here and in Japan, as discussed.", "In addition, as mentioned in our last call, we are expanding our distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida by about 50% to support Coach's projected sales growth for the next few years. While we upgraded the technology at this facility a year ago, a physical expansion is now necessary to accommodate the expected growth of our business. This expansion will require Capex of about $12 to $15\u00a0million in FY08.", "While these are our current goals, our actual results may vary from these targets based upon a number of risk factors, including those discussed under the Business of Coach, Inc. and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K. Coach also does not assume any obligation to update these targets as the year progresses.", "In summary, we're confident that our growth strategies will enable us to continue to gain share in the large and growing global market for fine accessories and gifts.", "Thank you for your attention, and now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I will be happy to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ", "Our first question comes from Robert Drbul with Lehman Brothers. You may ask your question.", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Good morning.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Good morning, Bob.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - SVP, IR", "Morning, Bob.", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Lew, I guess the question that I have this morning for you is given the uncertainty out there in the environment, I mean, how can you be confident in the guidance that you're giving us for the second half of 2006 of the year?", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Bob, as you know, we have a diversified business model. We're not overly dependent on any single channel. ", "We do have two levers for growth. The first is distribution, which will represent slightly more than half of our planned growth in the second half of 2006 and that we have great visibility to.", "We also look to improve worldwide productivity, and we have excellent visibility in that arena as well.", "So we have built a range of assumptions that lead us to confidently project growth of at least 17%.", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then just another question real quickly would be:  When you talk about the consumer trading down specifically within your stores, have you seen higher levels of cross-shopping between, you know, full-price stores, shopping in the outlets or, you know, any other trends you guys usually analyze.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "No. The short answer is no.", "What we have found both in our factory stores and in our full-price stores is substantially higher conversion levels. So once the consumer is in our full-price store or our factory store, she's converting at higher levels.", "But we don't see consumers trading down from full price to factory.", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michelle Clark with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thanks. And good morning, everyone.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Good morning.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "First in terms of traffic trends, can you give us any more color, any notable cause in terms of one geography, and then if you're seeing any notable differences in terms of your on-mall locations versus your standalone locations?", "Michael Tucci - President, North American Retail", "Sure. We actually saw traffic patterns through the quarter that were very consistent from the start of the quarter right through and frankly, very consistent across geographies, so no major differences to call out around traffic. ", "Obviously, we're fighting that headwind and trying to convert the people who are coming into our stores, which we're doing at a much higher rate.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "All right. Thanks. ", "And Mike, any notable differences in your on-mall locations versus your off-mall locations in terms of traffic?", "Michael Tucci - President, North American Retail", "A very slight difference in terms of malls suffering a little bit more and our street locations and what you might call lifestyle centers or hybrids a little bit more healthy. ", "Of course, that's a much smaller piece of our portfolio.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Right. And then, second question, Lew, your thoughts on announcing a new share buyback plan in the second half of '08?", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "We actually have an existing stock authorization program, and as Mike Devine indicated, I believe there's over $660 million still available.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Right. But anything in addition to that if you can get through it in the third quarter?", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Well, we can deal with that at that time.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks and best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Citi. You may ask your question.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Great, thank you. Good morning.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Good morning, Kimberly.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "The SG&A rates or the SG&A growth rate was very nice this quarter and actually lower than we were expecting. Is this a sustainable level of SG&A growth rate, and if you could just talk about some of the levers that you're pulling in a little more detail, that would be helpful.", "Michael F. Devine - CFO and EVP", "Sure, Kimberly, I'll take that. ", "We were pleased with where SG&A landed for the quarter. As you pointed out, it was - we got about 60 BPS of leverage from SG&A. We actually saw leverage on Mike Tucci's P&L at about a 7 comp. We were able to pull that off in Q2 when volumes were high, and I think it does speak to the levers and the manoeuvrability we have within spending and how nimble we are.", "You know, I've called them out before but I'm happy to talk about them again, particularly in our direct businesses. A lot of our spending is variable. We are in percentage rent in the majority of our stores. That is true in Coach Japan as well, where their occupancy is largely variable.", "Also, Mike talked about some of the technology enhancements that we've put into the store environment to make our associates more productive, most notably those around time and attendance and smart scheduling allows us to ideally match staffing levels with anticipated traffic and control store wages that way.", "We've also put on hold certain longer payback spending initiatives. ", "Also I will tell you that, as we've shared with the Street community over the years, our internal goals are always stretch versus those expectations we set with the Street, so we also have a variable component of our SG&A in terms of management bonuses.", "So all of those things taken together give us a lot of confidence that on a mid-teen type of top-line growth, we can continue to deliver SG&A leverage.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Great. That's very helpful.", "And just one last question on your gross margin guidance for the fiscal '08 year, I think you said down 100 basis points for the year, which would imply, you know, obviously some slight pressure on Q3 and Q4, but not to the extent that we saw in Q2.", "Please talk about how it is that you're getting there, and what gives you the confidence that the promotional environment that we saw here in the holiday period doesn't continue into Q3 and Q4?", "Michael F. Devine - CFO and EVP", "Yeah, actually, Kimberly, you're right in calling out that it is down year-over-year in the second half; that continues. ", "And our own anticipations are that we're going to need to continue the promotional activities that we employed in our direct businesses, particularly in North America, in the second half. ", "These intensified promotional activities are really going to be required for Coach to adapt to the difficult consumer environment, and so that is assumed in the gross margin guidance that we've laid out there for the balance of the fiscal year.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Great. Thanks, and good luck here in the second half.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from Jeff Edelman with UBS. You may ask your question.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "On the promotional side, this is the first time you've had to step it up to create incremental purchases. As you analyze your customer base, are we seeing any shift in less positive response to new line offerings or are would you attribute it to overall slower store traffic or price points?", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Overall, the significant majority of our sales in Q2 were made at full price, so we continue to be primarily a full-price proposition.", "So what we're talking about, Jeff, is on the margins, we intensified our preferred customer events in order to offset some of the reductions that we were experiencing in traffic and to be responsive to the challenging retail environment.", "Our brand is as resilient as it has been. Based on the research we did as recently as last month and into the first part of this month, Coach consumers intend to continue to spend on bags as much or more in the future than they did in the past, even though their overall purchasing spend is expected to be less.", "So we don't see this as germane to anything related to our franchise.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Lew, in the past you've always maintained a very strong full-price proposition and the consumers have responded to that. As you increase your friends and family coupon or whatever, what's the fear that you have that you would create the let's wait and see what the next promotion is before I come into the store?", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "It's a very good question, Jeffrey.", "What I should have mentioned earlier perhaps is that the intensification primarily came from a new program that we just introduced to our exclusive factory store consumers where we offered our best factory store consumers the opportunity to buy at a discount in full price for a limited period of time. That initiative was extremely successful. ", "So this is a situation where we're looking to migrate factory consumers who are unique factory consumers or what we call exclusive factory store consumers to full price. It's been very successful. ", "So that's been the vast majority of the intensification. And again, the vast majority of our sales continue to be at full price.", "The other thing that was interesting to us, notwithstanding the very strong response we got from our best customers who we invited - best factory customers who we invited to our full-price events, there was no fall off in our factory business during or subsequent to that event.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And the same question as far as the full-price stores are concerned?", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "The only thing that happened was our business increased during the period in full price.", "Michael Tucci - President, North American Retail", "Jeff, what Lew was explaining is that the exclusive factory store customer invites were the invites for those consumers that shop in the full-price stores.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - SVP, IR", "And that was the incrementality year-over-year. ", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - SVP, IR", "That new set.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. But the fact that you've stepped up the friends and family or coupon to the existing full-price store customers, if you fall back on that - ", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Year-on-year, it's heavily the same on full price.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Okay, thank you.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "There was one event this quarter, there was one event last quarter; the numbers are relatively similar. ", "The difference is that we did a very substantial event inviting, again, unique factory store consumers to shop at full price. We obviously will be measuring the long-term impact to see whether all of the spend is incremental, whether we're also able to convert some of them to buy in full price at full price.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Okay, great. Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Schick with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.", "David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Hi. Good morning.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Good morning, David.", "David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "The question is really if you could talk about your online business and your communication with your customers through email, what they're looking at, what they're opening in terms of spring. Is there anything that leads you to any conclusions on attitudes or appetite from that line of communication? Thanks.", "Michael Tucci - President, North American Retail", "Sure. In terms of our online activity, we had a very strong quarter online. We introduced a number of features online, like the - what we're calling web store pick up.", "Interestingly, our traffic patterns online have remained very healthy. We have not significantly increased our email activity. We're very disciplined around email activity, and our thought process there is that we're going to send emails to those people who are most interested in receiving them and have the highest propensity to open them.", "Our email and promotional activity online is really focused on newness, so what we're using online as a vehicle for is an introduction to the brand. ", "Our business online equals on an annual basis all of our visits in store. It's an enormous number of people.", "We are going to be introducing new product into the stores on Friday of this week, which will be a lifestyle platform called Heritage Stripe. We'll use online as a way to introduce that in terms of a product refresh online as well as email.", "Sequentially, on the 15th of February we will introduce a major platform of Signature Stripe. We'll also refresh our web site in conjunction with our store refresh, use email to communicate that. ", "And that's essentially how we do it. We see the online experience as a direct link to our store experience, and very recent data that we've looked at suggests that more and more, the store experience is being pre-shopped by our consumer online. They're going online to basically interact with the brand, scout for newness, scout for information, and then they're visiting the stores off of that experience.", "So we feel very good about what we're doing with our online consumer. ", "David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "And is there anything, you know, in the last month or two months in terms of what people are looking at price point wise or anything that you can track there that would lead you to other conclusions about price point going forward other than what you've already shared?", "Michael Tucci - President, North American Retail", "It's very funny. It's such a mirror image, what the consumer buys online and how she behaves online. We merchandise our web site as a flagship, so it's a very broad offering. ", "I would take the opportunity to maybe bridge to the subject of assortment and what we believe very strongly in is continuing to focus on this elevated product assortment and going after the white space.", "I will say that there is an opportunity offsetting that to make sure we have proper balance across price spans at lower prices in the handbag spectrum, and as I said earlier in my prepared remarks, that's something that we're addressing.", "I think with the next two deliveries, in fact - Heritage Stripe and Signature Stripe\u00a0 you're going to see a very broad offering from a price standpoint, including some very sharp price points in smaller bags, and that'll round out the assortment. ", "And you'll see that online and in store.", "David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Liz Dunn with Thomas Weisel Partners. You may ask your question.", "Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Hi. Good morning.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Good morning.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - SVP, IR", "Hi.", "Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Can you discuss the price adjustments that occurred during the quarter? How was that accounted for? My understanding is that it was accounted for as a price adjustment, not a markdown.", "And over time, what's your ability to sort of hit those lower price points while maintaining your exceptional growth margins? ", "Also related to gross margin, what's the cost environment like? We're hearing a lot of talk about cost pressure coming out of China. What are you experiencing?", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Okay. Well first, with regard to the repricing, the catalyst for the repricing was to provide price comparability with department stores whose inventories were larger than they would have liked going into the week before Christmas. And their interest was to cleanse their inventories, and we followed up to provide consumers with comparability.", "What you need to appreciate is that it was less than 5% of our sales. It wasn't undertaken to lower price points. It was really undertaken to give consumers an equal value. ", "It was an exceptional event. We did it because wanted our department store inventories to be clean for the spring, which they are, and we think we're better off for it. It was de minimus to our overall results.", "With regard to the cost environment, you're correct. Costs are going up in China. At the same time, we are beginning to migrate some of our production to lower-cost neighbouring countries such Vietnam and India, which of course is not that close. But we are looking at other geographies. We're also, within China, moving to lower-cost areas in the northern part of China.", "So we have a very flexible constellation of independent factories that work in partnership with us in order to preserve high quality and at the same time enable us to maintain or reduce costs.", "Mike, you want to - ", "Michael F. Devine - CFO and EVP", "Yeah, just to drill down and a little nearer term in around the cost pressures, they have existed and continue to exist. We've seen some easing of leather prices, but there are also offsets.", "The sourcing organization has done a marvellous job. In the second quarter alone, while we talked about gross margin being impacted by some promotional pressures in our direct business, we actually saw gross margins expand in our indirect business.", "And so again, the sourcing organization, merchandising and our wholesale sales divisions really did a terrific job in actually delivering year-over-year margin growth in the indirect business.", "So we have been able to offset those cost increases in what I'll call our organic gross margin rate product price versus cost ratios.", "Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And do you think your gross margins are sustainable in sort of a mid-70s range over the long term?", "Michael F. Devine - CFO and EVP", "Yeah, we feel very strongly that way.", "Liz Dunn - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great. Thanks.", "Michael F. Devine - CFO and EVP", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christine Chen with Needham & Company. You may ask your question.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Thank you. I was just wondering, for the gross margin decline in the quarter, can you help us quantify what part of it might have been due to the channel shift, you know, given the outperformance of factory and how much of it was due to the promotional environment? ", "And then can you also talk a little bit about your relationship with department stores, like for the bags that did get marked down in the department stores, is that markdown money that they have to bear or is that on your end?", "Thank you.", "Michael F. Devine - CFO and EVP", "I'll take that one. I'll answer the last part of the question first.", "In terms of relationship with the wholesale partners, the markdown money is something that's been accounted for both in our actual margins through Q2 that we published today and in our guidance and thinking going forward, so it's in there, if you will.", "And I'm sorry, the second part of the question?", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - SVP, IR", "Breakdown gross margin.", "Michael F. Devine - CFO and EVP", "Oh, the breakdown of gross margin, I'm sorry.", "We had roughly an offset. I just spoke about the hard work of the sourcing organization. We actually had the sourcing relationship improvements roughly offset our channel mix. Both were at about $40 BPS in either direction offsetting those.", "And so the year-over-year change of about 170 basis points came from about 100 basis points due to increased promotional activities in our direct businesses and about 50% - I'm sorry, 50 basis points - also from a negative impact from currency fluctuations, most notably the yen in Japan.", "And so from guidance, where we had guided down about 50 basis points for Q2, the mix was about 120. That same 50 in currency accounts for part of that 120. We didn't anticipate the strengthening of the yen going into the quarter.", "And then our promotional activity was about 70 basis points more in our direct channels than we had anticipated when we gave our October guidance.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Got it. And then I guess just to further clarify the relationship with the department stores, some vendors, you know, negotiate a discount upfront and then at the end of the quarter they don't need to argue about markdown dollars. Is that how you do your business, or do you discuss it at the end of every quarter?", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "We have a longstanding partnership with department stores. They look, as we do, at our business with them on an annual basis, and any markdowns and discounts are a very small part of the total picture, not worth even discussing.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Got it. And then can you talk a little bit about jewellery, how that did during the quarter?", "Michael Tucci - President, North American Retail", "Sure. We were very, very pleased with jewellery. It is a flanker category. It is a category that we believe has strong relevance in the mix in terms of our brand. We introduced it to all stores in September. We refreshed jewellery in terms of new product going into the quarter.", "It performed better than we had planned at slightly better penetration levels in the 3% range overall; higher in our more dominant flagship locations which had a broader assortment of jewellery, including sterling. ", "And one of the learnings that we got is that we got a very strong reaction to the sterling portion of the jewellery mix, and we are rolling that to several more stores as early as this quarter where we can provide fixturing and add that in terms of an assortment mix.", "So we feel very good about the assortment. You'll see a lot of newness in jewellery in the next 60 days in our stores.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Christine?", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Yes.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Yeah, just one last thing on department stores. I know you know this, but I'll just say it anyway. ", "For context, department stores are only about 11% to 12% of our global sales, so it's actually a very small part, unlike the situation with most American brands. ", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Right. Well, thank you and good luck.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Our next question comes from Erwan Rambourg with HSBC. You may ask your question. ", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Good morning.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - SVP, IR", "Good morning.", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "I think you've been very clear on the promotional environment in the States. I was just wondering if this was an isolite - an isolated, sorry - phenomenon or if you're also seeing promotional activity going on in Japan? And if that's the case, does that explain the fact that your comps are accelerating in Japan, or is that linked to something else?", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "Well, first, our comps aren't accelerating. They've been fluctuating between low and high single digits for years now.", "Our primary growth is through distribution. The level of promotional activities in Japan are no greater today than they were yesterday. They're consistent.", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Okay. And then I was just wondering if you had given further thought to the potential of a dividend given the tough equity markets we're experiencing today?", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "It's never far from our minds. We talk about it regularly, so the answer is yes, it continues to be under consideration.", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Okay, thank you.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. You may ask your question.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Good morning, everyone. Can you talk a little bit about how you're reorganizing the business in terms of by brand or by product category, by usage? How is that going to impact costs or sales or margins or better help you develop product? Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "The intention is really to help us better develop product, and I think the best illustration I can provide is by illustration.", "We're creating a group to focus on higher-end product and we're calling that Collection Group. And that group is going to have, within the same entity, designers, sample makers, product development people and sourcing people who will be responsible for the procurement of materials.", "And to the extent that we are going to be introducing new collections in this white space, and we are, there's longer lead times that are required for new material development, and by having a dedicated unit from conception to completed production will enable us to be more nimble, enable us to also broaden our development activities.", "So that's really taking our category teams to the next level.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort - Chairman and CEO", "You're welcome.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - SVP, IR", "Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. It is now 9:31 per my watch and, of course, I look forward to taking your questions as does Mike Devine throughout the day, but we're going to end this conference call. Have a terrific day.

Devine - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President ", "Analysts", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Tracy Kogan - Credit Suisse", "Operator", "", "Good morning and welcome to the Coach conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Coach, Ms.\u00a0Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "", "Thank you and good morning. ", "With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO, and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. ", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. ", "We present expect to update our estimates each quarter only. However, the failure to update this information should not be taken as Coach's acceptance of these estimates on a continuing basis. Coach may also choose to discontinue presenting future estimates at any time.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our third fiscal quarter 2008 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Mike Devine will continue with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter as well as our outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session that will end by 9:30 a.m.", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort ", "", "Thanks, Andrea, and welcome everyone. ", "We've announced strong top-line and bottom-line growth of 19% respectively for the quarter just completed, in line with our expectations. We were pleased with our performance, especially in light of the worsening retail climate in the U.S. We also continue to be pleased with the strength of new stores, which are still coming online well ahead of expectations.", "Overall, Coach's quarterly performance reflected the strength of the Coach franchise and the continued outperformance of the U.S. handbag and accessory category as compared to overall retail sales. ", "For the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending in June we are projecting sales of $780\u00a0million and EPS of $0.50, both up 20% from year ago levels, taking the full year to about $3.18\u00a0billion with EPS of $2.06, each increasing 22%. It's worth mentioning that this EPS guidance has been in place throughout the fiscal year.", "Given the continued uncertainties in the economic backdrop, we have decided to wait until the end of our fourth quarter to provide specific guidance for the next fiscal year. At the same time, it's important to underscore the confidence we have in our ability to continue to drive significant top and bottom line growth through both distribution and productivity gains.", "In terms of distribution, given the compelling returns we are continuing to generate we will execute our existing distribution plans in North America, including the opening of 40 new retail stores in the coming year. ", "Regarding productivity, our confidence stems first and foremost from our product, coupled with 1) the overall strength of the Coach proposition underscored by our key business and brand equities, 2) our broad and loyal consumer franchise, and 3) our innovative and consumer-centric nature.", "While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category in our business shortly, I first want to take the time to review our quarter. ", "Some highlights of our third fiscal quarter were first, earnings per share rose 19% to $0.46 as compared to $0.39 in the prior year while net income rose to $162\u00a0million from $147\u00a0million.", "Second, net sales totaled $745\u00a0million versus $625 million a year ago, a gain of 19%. ", "Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 20% to $578 million from $481 million in the prior year.", "Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 9%. ", "Finally, sales in Japan rose 12% in constant currency and 25% in dollars. ", "During the quarter, Coach opened five North American retail stores, including one new market for Coach - Macon, Georgia. We also opened two factory stores during the third quarter and expanded another. At the end of the period, there were 287 full price and 101 factory stores in operation in North America. ", "In Japan, two new department store locations were opened while two retail stores were closed. Also, five locations were expanded. At quarter end, there were 147 total locations in Japan, with 21 full price stores\u00a0\u00a0including 8\u00a0flagships - 106 shopin-shops, 15 factory stores, and 5 distributor-operated locations. ", "Indirect sales increased 15% to $166\u00a0million from $144\u00a0million in the same period last year. ", "During the quarter, POS sales at U.S. department stores grew at 5%, while international POS sales grew by more than 25%. ", "During the same quarter, we estimate that the premium U.S. handbag and accessory category grew between 5% and 10%. At the same time, Coach's bag sales rose 18% across all channels in North America. ", "As mentioned, we were pleased with our overall performance in North America this quarter against very difficult comparisons across all channels. Our total revenues in North America were up 15% with our directly operated stores generating a 20% gain driven by both distribution and an overall high single-digit comp. We would note that in full price stores, our weak traffic patterns from the second quarter continued while conversion and average transaction size rose.", "In factory, we continued to see increases across all three metrics. ", "As noted in our press release, beginning this quarter we're only providing aggregated comparable store sales for our North American retail and factory stores. While less detailed, this measure fully reflects our brand's retail performance in North America while still providing a consistent metric to gauge our results against prior periods and other luxury retailers. By aggregating comps, we're aligning the way we measure performance with the way we manage our Retail business. This will also provide the operational flexibility to respond to changes in market dynamics and run our business in the best long-term interests of our shareholders.", "Results in our full price businesses across channels continued to be driven by the monthly flow of new product. Our U.S. factory store business remained very strong throughout this quarter given the vibrancy of the Coach brand, the strength of our proposition, and continued overall sales growth in premium factory malls. In addition, our made-for-factory product continues to resonate with this dedicated consumer. ", "I also want to highlight another excellent quarter for Coach women's footwear. Our business in department stores, where we are now sold through about 800 locations, rose about 24% at POS for the quarter. We were also very pleased with the performance at Coach Japan, where sales rose 12% in yen and 25% in dollars. Growth in Japan was fueled primarily by distribution through both new stores and expansions as our market share further expanded against a continued weak category backdrop.", "Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials a bit later.", "Across all businesses, bags and women's accessories continued to drive our business results as the look of our assortment continues to evolve to reflect changing consumer preferences. Consumers continued to embrace our new and innovative product this spring. ", "As part of our seasonal transition, we introduced our evolved Hamptons Collection in January, featuring the Madeline Tote. Offered in multiple sizes, this new silhouette performed very well, particularly in bold colors. ", "In February we launched our new Heritage Strip Collection, a group of coated canvas totes and bags, and added an updated group of Signature Stripe bags and accessories later that month.", "In March we introduced another silhouette, the Francine Satchel, the focus of our spring advertising campaign. We were particularly pleased with the success of this $798 bag, which was available in all stores. In fact, it's worth mentioning that our over $400 handbag offerings continued to grow in importance, representing 22% of handbag sales in the quarter versus 13% last year.", "And at the beginning of April we brought back the popular Soho Collection in softer, more feminine styles. ", "Later this week we will be introducing our group of pleated Ergo bags and accessories, which will be our focus for Mother's Day.", "In Japan, we've been conducting a pre-sale of pleated Ergo in the Millennium Department Store group and that's seen remarkable consumer response to date, so we're very optimistic about the importance of this group.", "Also on tap for Q4 are a new version of our popular Patchwork, a casual wash cotton tonal Signature Collection in an elegant floral appliqu\u00e9d group of our Signature Stripe bags. ", "I also wanted to briefly touch on the performance of our new retail stores, which has been well ahead of our internal projections. For a number of quarters we talked about the strength that we've seen in new store opening volume. This trend has continued despite the economic backdrop, and our 25 stores opened through January are running about 25% ahead of pro formas, with an average first year annual volume of $2.3\u00a0million.", "We recognize that in a period of weak consumer spending, it is especially important to provide a level of newness that will quite literally wow the consumer, compelling her to purchase. We touched on some of our upcoming initiatives regarding our product, our stores and our merchandising in previous calls and conference webcasts this spring, and as we move to fiscal '09, these initiatives will become increasingly evident.", "First and most importantly, we will be focusing on our product, the cornerstone of our brand.", "We're striving to compress multiple years of innovation into FY '09 to create a particularly compelling offering to further inspire an otherwise reticent consumer to spend. Starting with our fall collections, including Bleecker, Hamptons, Legacy and the new Zoe handbag group, you will notice a shift in attitude reflecting a more sophisticated design aesthetic, including softer, drapier silhouettes, lighter-weight leathers, and new finishes\u00a0\u00a0such as patent, glazed and metallic - and minimal hardware in some collections. ", "We're particularly enthusiastic about the launch of Madison, a new, comprehensive lifestyle platform this October. The design of this collection is distinctively Coach, with a pretty, more feminine and sophisticated appeal. This collection will include a broad array of lightweight handbag silhouettes, wallets and accessories crafted in soft, rich, finished leathers. ", "As part of Madison, we will also be introducing CC, a contemporary, abstract take on our logo, providing an entirely new platform for Coach. This graph design lends the product a fresh, modern allure. Madison's design details include chic pleating, a new horse-and-carriage iconic plaque, and handbag charms which adorn most styles. Also unique to this lightweight collection, several of the handbag styles are convertible and can be worn over the shoulder or carried in hand, meeting the needs of the functional fashion consumer.", "Second, you will also notice a number of initiatives targeting our in-store experience. They include new store formats such as Gallery, which is essentially a larger format Coach store targeted for the best and most strategic mall locations in the country. We're currently planning to pilot the Gallery format in three upscale malls beginning with Short Hills, New Jersey in June. Gallery will create more room to showcase the entire world of Coach, including our broad assortment of handbag collections and at the same time allow for flexibility within the store for new growth opportunities, such as fragrance, scarves, men's, small leather goods and jewelry, all against an elevated residential backdrop like our legacy store on Bleecker Street.", "Third, we will also be implementing new merchandising strategies. And most important, we are reducing the density of our handbag assortment by about 15% to 20%. This will enable us to be more directive, offering a stronger point of view in about 40 flagship locations. We will also be introducing a feature table concept, as used in our Bleecker Street store, where we showcase the product in a less structured, approachable manner. You will also notice more presentations by color, which lends a different point of view to our assortment. And finally, we're incorporating a range of additional decorative elements to further create a residential feel, including elevated artwork, plants, mannequins and so forth. ", "And finally, we have modified our tiered distribution strategy in order to enhance the cachet of our flagships. We have selected about 40 of our current 75 flagship locations which will be further elevated through limited edition offerings and pinnacle lifestyle product. They will also receive the enhanced merchandising fixtures and decorative elements that I just mentioned. The remaining stores will then fall into the Fashion segment. This re-tiering will be in place by July, and many of the enhancements discussed earlier will also be rolled out to these Fashion stores as well.", "Clearly, we continue to believe that our opportunities, both in North America and internationally, remain abundant. For perspective, we estimate the addressable handbag and accessory market in North America reached over $8\u00a0billion in calendar 2007 and is continuing to demonstrate growth despite the weakening economy. Thus, with the vibrancy of the Coach brand and the market expanding, the potential for Coach remains significant. ", "As most of you know, we have two primary sales drivers - first is distribution as we expand our global network of store locations with an emphasis on North America, Japan and Greater China, and second is productivity, which we drive across all geographies through the introduction of innovative and relevant product in a compelling store environment. To this end we have been implementing four key strategies that focus on sustaining growth within our global framework. ", "Clearly, our largest opportunity during our planning horizon continues to be in North America. First, we're building market share in the growing North American women's accessories market. As I already described, we're implementing a number of initiatives to accelerate the level of newness, elevate our offering, and enhance the instore experience. These plans will enable us to continue to strengthen our leadership position in the market.", "Our second strategy is the continued growth in North American retail. As you know, given the compelling returns we're generating, we plan to add about 40 retail stores in North America in each of the next several years, including next year, FY '09. We will also continue to relocate and expand stores where appropriate. Based on the performance of our new stores and the large number of new consumers we're attracting to the franchise, we still believe the North American total can easily support about 500 retail stores, including up to 20 in Canada. And through the multi-store portfolio deals we are making with developers, we already have virtually all locations confirmed for next year.", "And third, outside the U.S. we're continuing to increase market share with the Japanese consumer by driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new retail locations and by expanding existing ones. In FY '09 and in each of the next several years, we plan to add about 10 net new locations in Japan. And as has been our practice, we will continue to expand our most productive locations.", "Our fourth strategy is to raise brand awareness in emerging markets to build the foundation for substantial sales in the future, specifically Greater China, Korea and other such geographies are increasing in importance as the category's growing rapidly and Coach is taking hold. In FY '08, we're on target to open through distributors about 30\u00a0net new locations in total, including 8 in Greater China.", "A few highlights of our upcoming international openings this spring are with mentioning. First, we're very excited about our global flagship store in Queen's Road Central in Hong Kong scheduled to open during late May. We're especially pleased about it because of the rapid growth we're experiencing in East Asia and Greater China and believe that this will raise awareness and enhance our brand throughout Greater China. Clearly, Greater China has the potential during the next few years to become the third major market for Coach following North America and Japan. While we have no Investor Relations activities planned for the opening, please let Andrea know if you're going to be in the region in late May so that you can join us at this occasion. ", "In addition, we're also enthusiastic about two new international markets we're entering this quarter - Greece, with two stores in Athens, and Russia, where we're opening our first location. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to open at least 15 Coach locations in Russia over a five-year period, initially concentrating development in Moscow and St.\u00a0Petersburg.", "In summary, we're well positioned to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities available to us and have the strategies in place to realize our long-term growth plans irrespective of the near-term environment.", "At this time I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. ", "Mike?", "Michael F. Devine", "", "Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. ", "As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 19%, with direct to consumer up 20% and indirect up 15%. ", "Earnings per share for the quarter increased 19% to $0.46 as compared to $0.39 in the year ago period as net income rose to $162\u00a0million from $147\u00a0million.", "Our operating income rose 13% to $257\u00a0million in the third quarter versus $227 million in the same period last year.", "Operating margin in the quarter was 34.5% compared to 36.2% in the year ago quarter.", "The strengthening of the yen impacted all lines of our P&L given the consolidation of CJI's income statement. Adjusting for the currency impact this quarter, we would have seen a 16% increase in sales\u00a0 3 points lower than reported - but a 17% increase in operating income, 4 points higher than reported, as our operating margin would have been essentially even year to year.", "In the third quarter gross profit rose 15% to $558\u00a0million, up from $486\u00a0million a year ago. ", "Gross margin was 75% flat versus 77.8% last year, impacted by the unanticipated sharp rise in the yen versus the dollar along with the expected effect of the promotional environment and channel mix. In fact, this dramatic and unanticipated move in the yen reduced our gross margin rate by over 190 basis points.", "SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved 100 basis points from prior year levels during the quarter and represented 40.5% of sales versus 41.5% as we achieve leverage in all three of our spending categories. First, we saw leverage on what we like to refer to as our semi-fixed corporate functions. Second, CJI provided leverage to both its own P&L and the corporate income statement. And finally, given the high single-digit comp rate, our North American Retail businesses were also able to provide leverage, both to its own business unit P&L and to the consolidated corporate P&L as well. ", "Moving to the balance sheet, inventory levels at quarter end were $320\u00a0million, 28% above prior year levels. Adjusting for the impact of the stronger yen, inventories would have been up 22%. Also, looking at inventories on a twoyear basis, to smooth last year's Q3 shipment timing-related low levels our two-year inventory CAGR in actually 4 points below our sales growth. Most importantly, at quarter end our inventories were clean, allowing us to move forward in good shape for spring. It should be noted that this inventory level allows us to support 54\u00a0net new U.S. stores, 11 net new locations in Japan, and substantially increase sales levels. ", "I'll also note accounts receivable balances rose 19%, in line with sales. ", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $616\u00a0million as compared with $936 million a year ago despite the repurchase of nearly $1.2\u00a0billion worth of stock in the interim 12 months. ", "Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $85 million compared to $97 million last year during Q3, negatively impacted by a $62\u00a0million increase in cash tax payments during the quarter versus last year. ", "On a year-to-date basis through 3Q, net cash from operating activities was $600 million, up $78 million from 3Q year-to-date of '07.", "Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $52 million versus $73 million in the same period last year, also impacted by the large tax payment and Capex spending, primarily for new stores and renovation, which was $33\u00a0million versus $25 million in the same quarter a year ago. Year-to-date free cash flow at the end of the third quarter was $56 million above last year's levels. ", "As noted in the press release, during the third quarter we repurchased and retired 11.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $28.85, spending a total of $327\u00a0million. At the end of the period, $333 million was available under the company's current repurchase authorization, which we put in place in November.", "Now I'd like to provide you with some of our updated goals for fiscal 2008. ", "For the fourth quarter, we're targeting net sales of about $780\u00a0million, representing a year-on-year increase of about 20%. While we expect to continue to leverage our expenses, this improvement will not fully offset the projected contraction in gross margin rate, which we would expect to land at similar levels to Q3 due to the continuing promotional environment in the U.S., notably in factory, and the negative impact of channel mix, yielding an operating margin of about 35% and earnings per share of $0.50, an increase of 20%. ", "Therefore, our goals for the full fiscal year are net sales growth of about 22% to about $3.18\u00a0billion, and we're targeting an operating margin of nearly 37%, an operating income dollar growth of about 18% above FY '07. Interest income of about $44 million will add to pre-tax income while net income will continue to be somewhat offset by a higher tax rate this year versus last at about 39% due to the fact that incremental taxable income is being taxed at higher rates. ", "Including these factors, we expect to generate EPS growth of 22%, which will produce earnings per share of $2.06, consistent with our prior guidance. ", "For FY '08, we are still planning to spend about $200 million on Capex, primarily for new stores and expansions, both in North America and internationally. ", "While these are our goals, our actual results may vary from these targets based upon a number of factors, including those discussed under the Business of Coach, Inc. and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10K. Coach also does not assume any obligation to update these targets as the year progresses.", "In summary, we're confident that our growth strategies will enable us to continue to gain share in the large and growing global market for fine accessories and gifts. ", "Thank you all for your attention, and now Lew, Andrea and I would be happy to take some questions.", "Questions-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bob Drbul. You may ask your question. Please state your company name.", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "", "Lehman Brothers. Good morning.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Morning.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Good morning. ", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Lew, I guess I have two questions for you. I understand not giving FY '09 guidance at this point, but I guess could you maybe give us a little bit of color on your expectations in terms of double-digit top line, et cetera? And the second question that I have, I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on your decision to essentially decrease the transparency of the business by not providing your normal comp breakdown which we've all found pretty helpful over the years.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Sure. Well, first, as I said just a few minutes ago, we're confident that we're going to continue in FY '09 and beyond to achieve significant top and bottom line growth. The reason we're not providing guidance at this time is because we think it would require a level of false precision. Our distribution levers are in place. We're going to be continuing to open new stores as we indicated and expand others. In addition, we also expect to achieve productivity gains around the world, including here in the United States. So we do look forward to a good year with double-digit gains on the top and bottom line. ", "In terms of our decision to provide consolidated comps, it's really a result of our internal thinking that we need to align the way in which we run our business with the way in which we report it. As you know, we have a diversified business model. It's multi-channel and international. We're not solely dependent on any one channel and geography, and our growth is driven by both productivity and, as I said before, distribution gains.", "In North America, our Retail business consists of one brand with two platforms - full price and factory. And our franchise, as you know, is built on one set of brand equities that actually transcend an individual store concept of venue. And because of this, when we think about our business we first start with our retail stores. And as you know, we do not go on sale in our retail stores. And want to be able to leverage the opportunities that our dual-platform provides us, so during challenging times, focusing on one metric enables us to maximize brand building activities in our lead, full price channel while using promotional activity and other marketing levers in factory to drive very profitable overall growth. And at the end of the day, you need to judge us on our overall performance and on the strength of the brand, and this is the way we look at it. ", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you very much, Lew. Good luck.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michelle Clark. You may ask your question, and please state your company name.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "", "Morgan Stanley. Thanks and good morning, everyone.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Good morning.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Two questions for Mike Devine. Mike, the first is on the gross margin, the hit to gross margin, if you can detail the basis point impact 1), from promotional activity, and 2) from the channel mix shift. And then the second question relates to inventories. Your inventory per square foot rose close to 24% year-over-year. Can you just detail for me one more time the impact of the timing shift that you discussed on the call? Thank you.", "Michael F. Devine", "Sure. So let me go to gross margin first, Michelle. Let me say that other than the unanticipated movement of the yen, generally we're pleased with where gross margin landed for the quarter. In other words, it basically did hit the expectation in the guidance that we had. In fact, we slightly exceeded our expectation. And I do just want to point out initially that the supply chain, we really feel, has done a terrific job. Our design teams, merchandising, sourcing, et cetera, have continued to drive organic gross margin rate improvement. In fact, our indirect channels actually were up modestly during the quarter from the year ago period. So there are a number of good things going on and happening within the gross margin line.", "Unfortunately, those organic improvements were not enough to offset both the channel mix and promotional activities. So the two of those combined - channel mix and promotional - offset by some sourcing good news came to about a 90 basis point decline year-over-year. And you may recall on our last call we guided down about 100 to 110, so ever so slightly better than that.", "And then unfortunately, with the dramatic change in the yen - the yen hasn't moved this much in a single quarter since 1999, and we didn't see it coming - that whacked us almost 200 basis points through the gross margin rate line. So that's kind of the gross margin story. ", "In terms of the inventories, the yen got us there as well, Michelle, as, of course, in Japan we hold our inventories in yen and then when we consolidate our financial statements, it's a pure translation back. And that accounted for about 6 points of growth on the inventory year-over-year. In other words, if we went back and restated our inventory at last year's FX rate, Q3 ending FX rate, the growth would have declined about 600 basis points. ", "And then last year we had a shipment timing issue where we were very light on receipts right at the end of March and reported a bit of an artificially low ending balance at the end of Q3. So if you actually went back and smoothed it over two years, what we would have seen is an inventory CAGR building off of '06 to Q3 '08 of just over 20%. During that time, our sales CAGR has approached 25, so we still feel very good. ", "And most importantly, as I said in the prepared remarks, what really matters is our inventories are clean and we're in good shape going into the spring, and we think the compares at June will fall back in line as we don't have so much noise.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thanks and best of luck in the fourth quarter.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Thank you.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Edelman. You may ask your question. Please state your company name.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "", "Thank you. Good morning. ", "Lew, my first question is for you. If we think about the initiatives you mentioned - product, store environment, a more elevated and sophisticated look - are we seeing somewhat of a shift in strategy and maybe that's why we're not - that might also be contributing to the decision [in comp] since you're apparently maybe moving your retail stores further upscale and then looking for the big volume growth to come from the factory stores with a different mix of merchandise?", "Lew Frankfort ", "It's not the case, Jeff. I mean, even though my remarks focused on innovative newness, you're going to see actually a greater proportion of our mix this fall and holiday at sharper price points, both in bags and accessories. And we believe that critical balance is essential, and we're not looking to focus in a distorted way on any particular consumer group. ", "What is occurring in reality is that women, whether they're aspiration consumers who are trading up into Coach or fashion consumers, their tastes are evolving rapidly. And during challenging economic times, we need to have a particularly compelling offering for her to purchase, and that's really the intention.", "Further, in terms of America - and we can use Short Hills as an example of a very upscale mall in North America where we compete directly with the European luxury brands - we do need to showcase our store in a manner that is appropriate for the consumer who shops in Short Hills. Conversely, in a more mainstream mall, you will continue to see a prototype yet more advanced but that is more in keeping with the shopper in that mall.", "So no change in strategy, no de-focus away from full price.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, just a short follow before I go to Mike. The sharper price point, is this dialing into and designing into a sharper price point or is this reflecting a lower gross margin?", "Lew Frankfort ", "It's designing into a sharper price point.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "And Mike, the FX impact, I understand how it hits the inventory given the fact that the profit sits on the CJI balance sheet. Is that lost profit or does this come around and help you further down the road? Could you sort of give us a sense how this plays out?", "Michael F. Devine", "Sure. Good question, Jeff. The piece that really whipsawed us this quarter is really driven by the FX, and so the FX rate - the yen, in other words - will have to weaken again to have the opposite impact on the gross margin impact.", "So just to give you a sense, we had anticipated and I think the banks were calling for yen to be at about 112 for the balance of the calendar year when we gave our projections on our last call and it closed the quarter at 99.3, so a 13% swing. And so what happens there is that we need to mark the yen inventory up based on the stronger yen. And that inventory in Japan includes our wholesale [ship-in] margin, and as a result that margin is left on the balance sheet and doesn't come back to the P&L. So the FX would have to move to have that come back to us. ", "What I will say, though, is it is creating some good news for us in the coming months and quarters in that the product that CJI is buying from Coach New York now they're paying for with a much stronger yen. And as that product sells through, it will have a positive impact on our gross margin rates going forward.", "Jeffrey Edelman - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christine Chen. You may ask you question, and please state your company name.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "", "Needham & Company. Thank you very much. Good morning.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Good morning, Christine.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning, Christine.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "I had two questions. I'm wondering if you've seen any patterns in performance across your different store types\u00a0 flagship, fashion and core - as well as geography? And then the second question is, as you continue to grow your own store base, is there a thought to maybe cut back on the number of doors in the department stores? Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort ", "First, Christine, our performance across store type has not changed, the pattern continues. Where we continue to see fluctuations is geographically. So in North America, consistent with the holiday quarter, our business in California and Southern Florida has been very soft. Conversely, our business in the Midwest and Texas, as examples, continue very strong.", "With regard to department stores, we actually several years ago rationalized the number of locations when we went down from about 1,500 locations to about 900 today. And we're actually opening new locations now selectively, partnering with the leadership of Macy's in particular, to do so. ", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay. Thank you and good luck for the first quarter.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Erwan Rambourg. You may ask question, and please state your company name.", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "", "Hi. It's HSBC. Good morning.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Good morning.", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Just three questions, if I can. Several of the European countries we cover have mentioned that traffic in the U.S. was okay in January and February but was quite severely down in March. Is this an evolution that you've seen in the quarter in the U.S. concerning your businesses? ", "Then maybe I'll ask the other two. The second question is on Japan. We've seen a run rate of 16%, 17%. You're still growing significantly at a faster pace than the European players at 12%, however going from 17% to 12%, is this linked to a sudden sluggish of the Japanese market or can it be linked to the fact that some of the European brands are now addressing a sort of entry price point in that market? ", "And then finally looking at combined comps in the U.S., you've had 7% in Q2, where I think you spoke of an emotional recession. Now in Q3 you have a 9% combined comp with what some people consider as being a real recession. How do you think about the macro resistance of the brand, and do you see the macro environment worsening or is it reasonable to factor in sort of mid to high single-digit combined comps going forward?", "Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Obviously I'll take them one at a time. ", "Concerning traffic in the United States for Coach was consistent throughout the quarter. We didn't see a fall off during March. And again, year-on-year traffic in same stores has been weak; our overall traffic, because we've opened up many new locations, obviously has been higher than prior years.", "In terms of the 12% growth in Japan versus 17%, that's within noise level. We're aware our business is very strong in Japan. We see no signs of slowdown whatsoever for Coach. We actually welcome the entry price points from the European luxury brands that are closer to ours because we're hopeful it's going to stimulate more interest in the category, so the overall category will begin to grow.", "In terms of the macro environment, it's a very tough call. Clearly, the environment has weakened. Consumers are more pessimistic. And our response to that is to be more nimble and to compress several years of innovation into one year and to utilize our factory channel, which is a promotional channel, to help us drive very profitable sales until the economy stabilizes. We think it's going to be a rough go throughout the entire calendar year on a macro basis.", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Right. Okay. And just going back to Japan, can you give us an idea of where your market share stands on a sort of calendar '07 basis if you have that?", "Lew Frankfort ", "It's about 12%. ", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Lew Frankfort ", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger. You may ask your question. Please state your company name.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "", "Great. Thank you. Good morning. Citigroup.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Good morning, Kimberly.", "Michael F. Devine", "Kimberly.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Lew, I was hoping if not providing quantitative measures maybe you could just qualitatively address the improvement in your total consolidated comp. It was plus 7% in the second quarter. Here you're looking at plus 9%. Can we assume that both full price and factory saw improvement sequentially?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Kimberly, I wish we could do that but we made a decision that we're only going to provide consolidated comps and at the same time provide some texture. And as I indicated before, traffic in full price continued weak while conversion and average ticket rose. The factory business continued very strong. ", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Okay. Lew, there was something you mentioned in the press release about striving to compress several years of product evolution into fiscal '09. I was wondering if you could talk to us about the opportunities with doing that and also are there any challenges with the way that your product development cycle works that you might see? Thanks.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Sure. First, the initiatives that we're talking about were actually conceived last spring and last summer, so we've been thinking now for more than a year that we wanted to compress several years of innovation within one year. And our supply chain from our design group through our merchants, our sourcing group, raw materials procurement group, and our operations and quality control people have been basically gearing up for a major change in the way in which our products are manufactured.", "And when you see our product in our stores - and I think you got a preview of some of the new collections when you visited here - you're going to find, as I said before, that they're softer, drapier, lots of new materials, and this has been in the works for a long time. So our supply chain management group has been able to do a remarkable job in meeting the requirements, and we're actually on track. We measure deliveries every month and we got a preview of what July and August looks like, and we've been assured the quality is consistent with Coach standards and second, that 99% of the product will be on time. ", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Terrific. Thanks, Lew, and good luck here.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Telsey. You may ask your question. Please state your company name. ", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "", "Good morning, everyone - TAG. ", "Can you talk a little bit about the average ticket improvement in the quarter, provide some color on it. Is there an improvement in the core customer? Is there less trading down? And in regard to the promotional environment, I think last quarter some factory customers were incentivized to shop at full price. Did you see that at all this quarter? And just lastly, on the progress on the realignment of the product development organization that you mentioned last quarter, how is that moving along? Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Okay. I'll take them in order. Our average ticket rose modestly during the quarter. What we discussed during the holiday quarter remains largely the same although our handbag mix increased relative to the holiday quarter and even though it was lower than last year due to the arrival of jewelry primarily. So we haven't really seen any shift in consumers. ", "With regard to our promotional activities focused on driving factory consumers into full price, that pilot was very successful. And we do know that our factory consumer loves the Coach brand, but she's a value shopper. She only wants to buy it on sale. Right now we're monitoring the performance of the factory consumer who purchased through one of our loyalty programs at full price to see whether we're able to attract her without a discount at full price. Our general view is that we will not be very successful, that she will need to be promoted to come to - our product will need to be promoted for her to come to full price. ", "Our margins are so good that we're very comfortable with the profitability from those promotions, and we are actually conducting another loyalty event - I believe it's going to be next month - focused on the factory store consumer purchasing in full price.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort ", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from Paul Lejuez. You may ask your question, and please state your company name.", "Tracy Kogan - Credit Suisse", "", "Thanks. It's actually Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul from Credit Suisse. ", "Two questions just to follow up on the last question about promotions. Do you expect to have to increase your level of promotions over the next couple of quarters? And then secondly, can you give us a sense of what you're expecting for Capex for next year and how that breaks out between new stores, remodels and IT? Thanks.", "Lew Frankfort ", "First, with regard to promotional activities, we don't think that's going to be necessary at all. We expect promotional activities to remain at this level or decline over the next few quarters.", "Michael F. Devine", "In terms of Capex, Tracy, I think we'll hold that guidance along with our fully FY '09 guidance for our next call, but I would just say directionally we don't anticipate anything materially different. We're continuing our store expansion programs, investing in technology where it makes sense to drive earnings growth. So for the modelers out there, I would anticipate '09 being similar to '08.", "Tracy Kogan - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. Good luck.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Thank you.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you. It is now just after 9:30. The market is open, and we're going to conclude this conference call.

", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO, and Michael Devine, Coach's CFO. ", "Before we begin we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. ", "We presently expect to update our estimates each quarter only. However the failure to update this information should not be taken as Coach's acceptance of these estimates on a continuing basis. Coach may also choose to discontinue presenting future estimates at any time.", "Now let me outline the order of speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will begin with an overall summary of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2008 results as well as our plans for the new fiscal year. ", "Michael Devine will then follow with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter and year as well as our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2009. Following Michael we will hold a Q&A session that will conclude promptly by 9:30 a.m.", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you Andrea and welcome everyone. As we announced our fourth quarter and fiscal year end results we are pleased with our performance and remain confident in our long-term prospects. We expected the current consumer malaise which affects retail spending will remain in place well into 2009 significantly impacting our business.", "At the same we expect to generate profitable growth although at a lower rate as we continue to use promotional activity to drive our factory business and price select new product more sharply to deliver compelling value.", "The opportunities both here at home in North America and abroad notably in emerging markets remain abundant. In fiscal 2009 we will invest notably in Greater China and to merchandising initiatives including what we call Collections. ", "Our performance in FY 2008 was highlighted by an increase of 22% in both revenues and EPS. It was a year of many accomplishments including first, the opening of 47 total net new stores in North America; 38 net new retail stores; and nine new factory stores. Second a 10% increase in North American comparable store sales for the year. Third, continued strong growth in our indirect businesses driven by both productivity and location growth notably in international wholesale. ", "And fourth another excellent year for Coach Japan, retail sales there rose 14% in constant currency and 23% in dollars to nearly $600 million despite flat category sales for imported bags and accessories in Japan. Coach strengthened its number two position in this market with an approximate 13% share this year, up from 11% last year.", "Finally we announced the phased buyout of our retail businesses in Greater China along with our development strategy for the region. Separately I would add how pleased I am with the creation of the Coach Foundation with an initial grant of $20 million in keeping with our commitment to promote corporate philanthropy. ", "Our strong annual performance was capped off by a solid fourth quarter as we announced increases of 20% in both sales and earnings per share. Some highlights of our fourth fiscal quarter excluding one-time items were:  ", "earnings per share rose 20% to $0.50 as compared to $0.42 in the prior year while net income rose to $172 million from $159 million;", "net sales totaled $782 million versus $652 million a year ago, a gain of 20%;", "direct-to-consumer sales rose 22% to $659 million from $541 million in the prior year;", "North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 7%; and", "sales in Japan rose 12% in constant currency and 30% in dollars.", "During the quarter Coach opened 12 North American retail stores including six in new markets for Coach:  Malvern, Florida; Shreveport, Louisiana; Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; McAllen, Texas; Wichita, Kansas; and Springfield, Missouri. We also expanded an additional four locations and closed two others.", "In addition on new factory store was opened and 11 were expanded. At the end of the period there were 297 full price and 102 factory stores in operation in North America. In Japan we opened seven new locations. At quarter-end there were 154 total locations in Japan. This was a net increase of 12 locations from the 142 at year end 2007. In addition Coach expanded two locations during the fourth quarter bringing the year end total to 11 expansions in Japan. ", "Indirect sales increased 11% to $123 million from $111 million in the same period last year. During the quarter POS sales at US department stores were essentially even while international POS sales grew by more then 30%. We estimate that the premium US handbag and accessory category grew between 5% and 10% during the first half of calendar 2008. At the same time, Coach\u2019s bag sales rose 15% across all channels in North America. ", "As mentioned we were pleased with our overall performance in North America this quarter against difficult comparisons across all channels and a deteriorating economic backdrop which impacted traffic into malls and US department stores. Our total revenues in North America were up 18% with our directly operated stores generating a 22% gain driven by both distribution and an overall high single-digit comp.", "We would note that in full price stores our weak traffic patterns from the previous two quarters continued while conversion rose and average transaction size fell slightly. In factory we continued to see increases across all three metrics. For the full year we experienced 20% growth in North America including a 22% sales increase generated by our stores.", "I also want to highlight another strong season for Coach women\u2019s footwear as our business in US department stores where we have sold through nearly 900 locations rose 21% for the most recent quarter. While Michael Devine will get into more details on our financials I wanted to give you a recap of Coach\u2019s performance and touch on some of the product highlights of the fourth quarter.", "Across all channels, handbags and women\u2019s accessories continued to drive our business as the look of our product continues to evolve reflecting changing consumer preferences. The consumer responded well to our innovative spring and summer offerings, most notably our Pleated Ergo collection led by the [famed] Satchel, a particularly popular style. Other successes included the introduction of our evolved Soho collection.", "In addition our over $400 handbag offerings continued to perform strongly. Innovation will be a critical factor for success in FY 2009 as the consumer remains reluctant to purchase. Thus as mentioned last quarter we\u2019re compressing multiple years of innovation into FY 2009 to create a particularly compelling offering to further inspire our customers to spend. This will of course also provide a new foundation for us to build upon in future seasons and years. ", "Last quarter we also touched on four main areas we\u2019re focusing on; product, the in-store experience, merchandising and stores. First, product which is the foundation of our brands. We are enthusiastic about our evolved lifestyle platforms that we\u2019re launching this year which presents a fresh face for Coach. You will notice a significant shift notably in handbag attitude to be more feminine featuring lighter weight leathers in new finishes and refined hardware in many collections. ", "In addition we\u2019re offering a more robust assortment of small accessories at attractive prices. As mentioned in my opening remarks we are also pricing select new products which feature more sophisticated materials and [makes] to deliver particularly compelling value at a time when the consumer is less willing to spend. ", "Starting with July we introduced an expanded collection of Bleecker handbags including the new tote style which is already a best seller. We just installed our August floor set the other day featuring Hamptons which is anchored by our popular carry-all. This collection has been reinterpreted with a softer, more feminine aesthetic. ", "Next month in September we will be introducing the Zoe handbag group, a softer rounded version of our immensely popular Carly Bag and a new chic Legacy collection. At the same time we\u2019re also looking forward to our second Coach fragrance, Legacy, which will be available in Coach stores this fall. ", "We are particularly enthusiastic about the launch of Madison this October, a key focus for holidays. This collection includes a broad array of lightweight handbag silhouettes including satchels, wallets and accessories. By the way, we have been piloting Madison in 10 retail stores here in the States and have been very encouraged with the initial results.", "Making its debut in the Madison Collection is Coach OpArt, a new visually compelling logo treatment inspired by the mid-twentieth century OpArt movement. This abstract geometric pattern is an example of the continued evolution of Coach energizing the look, feel and attitude of every style in the collection. Moreover it provides us with an entirely new logo platform for us in future groups and collections.", "In addition this holiday we will significantly intensify the amount of new product [inaudible] during the November and December to match the repeated visits of our customers throughout the holiday season. ", "Second we have just begun to implement new initiatives targeting our in-store experience, they include new store formats such as Gallery which we are piloting in Short Hills, New Jersey. I know at least a few of you have visited the new store which opened in early June where we have already gleaned many learnings. The larger format enables us to showcase the entire world of Coach including our broad assortment of handbag collections, and at the same time allow for flexibility within the store for new growth opportunities such as fragrance, scarves, small leather goods and jewelry; all against an elevated residential backdrop like our legacy store on Bleecker Street.", "Consumer response has been very favorable particularly around the elevated assortment, enhanced presentations and evolved service offerings. In addition we\u2019re enjoying a nice uptick in sales trend in this new location. ", "Third we will be implementing new merchandising strategies. We are currently reducing the density of our handbag assortment by about 15% to 20%. This enables us to be more directive offering a stronger point of view. In about 40 flagship locations globally, we have begun to introduce a feature table concept as used in our Bleecker Street store where we showcase the product in a less structured and more approachable manner. ", "You will also notice more presentations by color which lends a different point of view to our product assortment. And lastly we are incorporating a range of additional decorative elements to further create a residential feeling including elevated artwork, plants, mannequins, and so forth.", "Finally we have modified our tiered distribution strategy in order to enhance the cache of our North American flagships. We selected about 40 of our current 75 flagship locations which will be elevated through limited addition offerings and pinnacle lifestyle product. They will also receive the enhanced pictures and decorative elements that I just mentioned.", "The remaining stores will then fall into the fashion segment. The re-tiering is now in place and many of the enhancements discussed earlier will be rolled out to these stores as well. ", "We are also investing in further developing the talented team who work in our stores. I just attended our Annual Store Managers Conference which took place in Orlando. The theme of the conference was evolution and focused on our product innovation and building the sales competencies of our field teams. As always I was struck by the passion and commitment of the Coach retail field teams. As some of you may know we have the lowest turnover in the industry and promote a significant majority of our store managers from within.", "Looking ahead as we\u2019ve discussed we have two sales drivers. First is distribution as we expand our global network of store locations with an emphasis on North America, Japan and Greater China. And second is productivity which we drive across all geographies through the introduction of innovative and relevant product in a compelling store environment. ", "To this end we\u2019ve been implementing four key strategies that focus on sustaining growth within our global framework. Our largest opportunity during our planning horizon continues to be in North America. First we are building share in the $8.7 billion North American women\u2019s accessories market. As I have already described we are implementing a number of initiatives to accelerate product innovation, elevate our offering and enhance the in-store experience.", "These plans will enable us to continue to strengthen our leadership position in the markets. Our second strategy is the continued growth in North American retail. Given the compelling returns we are continuing to generate we plan to add about 40 retail stores in North America in each of the next several years including this year, FY 2009. ", "During this year our new openings will include 14 new markets for Coach such as Bakersfield, California, and Fort Myers, Florida as well as Calgary and Ottawa in Canada. Prior to holiday we expect to have opened a total of 28 full price stores. We will also continue to relocate and expand stores where appropriate. Based on the performance of our new stores which have consistently outpaced their [inaudible] by about 20% this year, we believe that North America in total can easily support 500 retail stores including 20 in Canada.", "And third outside the US we are continuing to increase market share with the Japanese consumer driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new locations and by expanding existing ones. In FY 2009 and in each of the next few years we plan to add about 10 net new locations in Japan and as has been our practice we will also continue to expand our most productive locations. ", "Our fourth strategy is to raise brand awareness in emerging markets to build a foundation for substantial sales in the future specifically Greater China, Korea and other geographies are increasing in importance as the category is growing rapidly and Coach is taking hold. In FY 2009 we are on target to open through distributors at least 20 net new wholesale locations in total while in Greater China we expect to open five new locations; four on the mainland and one in Hong Kong. ", "As we announced in late May we are in the midst of acquiring our Greater China retail businesses in Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland from ImagineX in a phased buyout. At the same we shared our strategy for Greater China as over the next five years we expect to open 50 net new locations aggressively growing our sales and market share in this rapidly expanding region. Our goal is to be one of the top three imported handbag and accessory brands.", "With the investments we plan to make in stores, marketing, organization and infrastructure, we are striving to replicate our success formula in Japan since taking control of the businesses there seven years ago in 2001. This acquisition will be slightly dilutive to Coach\u2019s consolidated financial results in the near-term which Michael will discuss more in just a moment. ", "However taking control of brand building and distribution at this critical juncture will lay the foundation for a substantial contribution of these businesses in the future.", "Beyond these four key growth strategies and as noted in the press release, FY 2009 will be a year of investments as we strengthen the foundation for long-term growth. This spring we announced a new business initiative known internally as Collection to drive brand creativity and reinforce our goal to be known as a great American design house. ", "It will encompass all women\u2019s categories with a focus on bags, women\u2019s accessories, footwear and jewelry. This new venture will serve as an incubator for fast track, leading edge, exclusive product that will create a halo affect by providing additional design inspiration to our broader offering. ", "I think it\u2019s important to note that while we will plan cautiously until we see a clear signal that the consumer is strengthening, we will also continue to invest in our future as we manage the business for the long-term. We remain well positioned to continue to capitalize on the opportunities available to us and have the strategies in place to realize our long-term growth plans regardless of the near-term environment.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Michael, our CFO for further detail on our financials.", "Michael Devine", "Thanks Lew, Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter and year end results.", "As mentioned our quarterly revenues increased 20% with sales of our direct business up 22% and the indirect business as expected up 11%. For the year total revenues rose 22% which sales generated by our direct channel rising 21% while our indirect revenues rose by 25%. ", "Excluding the impact of certain one-time items which I will touch on in a moment, earnings per share for the quarter increased 20% to $0.50 as compared to $0.42 in the year ago period as net income rose to $172 million from $159 million. ", "For the full fiscal year earnings per share rose 22% to $2.06 as compared to $1.69 posted in FY 2007 as net income rose to $742 million from $637 million. On the same basis our operating income rose 14% to $281 million in the fourth quarter versus $245 million in the same period last year. ", "Operating margin in the quarter was 35.9% compared to 37.6% in the year ago quarter. For the full fiscal year operating income rose to nearly $1.2 billion, a 19% increase. Operating margin for the year was 37.1% compared with 38% even a year ago. ", "In the fourth quarter gross profit rose 16% to $593 million from $509 million a year ago and gross margin was 75.9% versus 78.1% in prior year. During the year gross profit rose 19% to $2.41 billion as compared to $2.02 billion a year ago while gross margin rate was 75.7% versus last year\u2019s 77.4%.", "Most of you I\u2019m sure will remember in our third quarter due to the unprecedented single quarter move in the Yen we experienced a significant gross margin hit when we marked to market our Yen inventory [ship in] margin elimination. At that time we also provided guidance to our fourth quarter gross margin of 75% flat. And we assumed that the Yen would end the quarter also flat at around 100 to the dollar.", "As the Yen actually weakened over the period ending at about 106 we had a benefit to gross margin of about 80 basis points. Before one-time items and as expected SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were below prior year levels in the fourth quarter and represented 40% of sales versus 40.5% a year ago; a 50 basis point improvement.", "For the full year SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 80 basis points to 38.6% from 39.4% a year ago. As mentioned in our press release during the quarter we recorded several one-time items. These consisted of tax adjustments related primarily to the favorable settlement of a tax return examination which decreased Coach\u2019s provision for taxes by $50 million and increased net interest income by $10.7 million.", "In addition as Lew mentioned we created a charitable foundation which increased expenses by $20 million and finally the result in higher net income led to a $12.1 million increase in variable expenses. Collectively these one-time items increased earnings by $41 million after-tax.", "At year end cash and short-term investments stood at about $700 million as compared with $1.2 billion a year ago reflecting the repurchase of over $1.3 billion worth of Coach common stock during the fiscal year. Inventory levels were $345 million up about 19% above prior year levels but below our 22% sales growth as our supply chain improvements and inventory management programs allowed us to support 47 net new US stores, 12 net new locations in Japan and substantially increased sales levels with moderate additional inventory investment.", "Accounts receivable balances were essentially unchanged as DSO fell to 31 days versus 36 days last year. Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $323 million compared to $258 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $268 million versus $216 million in the same period last year primarily due to higher net income.", "CapEx spending primarily for new stores and renovations was $55 million versus $42 million in the same quarter a year ago. For all of fiscal year 2008 net cash from operating activities was $923 million compared to $781 million a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year 2008 was an inflow of $749 million versus $641 million in fiscal year 2007 while CapEx spending totaled $175 million, again primarily for new stores and expansions as well as technology and corporate infrastructure investments.", "As noted in the press release during the fourth fiscal quarter we repurchased and retired over 4.8 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $35.18 spending a total of $170 million. For all of FY 2008 we repurchased and retired nearly 39.7 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $33.68 spending a total of over $1.3 billion.", "At the end of the period $163 million was available under our current repurchase authorization which was put in place in November of 2007. ", "I\u2019d now like to provide you our initial goals for fiscal 2009. As Lew mentioned it will be an investment year for Coach as we build the foundation for profitable growth in Greater China and implement key merchandising initiatives most notably collections. ", "Together we expect that our investment activities will impact EPS by about $0.05 to $0.06 for the year including about $0.03 to $0.04 attributable to Greater China and $0.02 for other initiatives. Coupled with these investments it is our intention to plan cautiously until we see evidence of a turn in the economy and retail spending.", "Please keep in mind that this guidance notably the comparisons to FY 2008 is based on operating metrics prior to the one-time items from Q4 that I mentioned earlier. ", "First we are looking for net sales growth of at least 13% to over $3.6 billion driven as always by both distribution growth, which will contribute about 10 points of growth and more modest productivity gains which will contribute the remaining three to four points. ", "We expect to open at least 45 new stores in North America including about 40 full price stores and about a half a dozen factory stores; 10 to 15 net new locations in Japan and about five new locations in Greater China; at least 20 net new international wholesale locations while we continue to expand select highly productive locations globally. ", "In Japan we expect to achieve constant currency growth of about 5% to 10%. While we continue to focus on profitability we would expect gross margin to see an impact from both ongoing promotional activity, notably in factory as well as the shorter margins we will take on select new product in our full price business in order to deliver exceptional value to our consumers.", "As a result we are projecting a gross margin rate of about 74% for the year. Similarly given the investment spending we\u2019ve outlined we are anticipating an SG&A expense ratio of about 40% for 2009. Therefore we are targeting an operating margin of about 34% to 34.5% resulting in more modest operating income growth of about 5% for the year. ", "In addition lower interest income due to lower rates and a lower cash balance due to repurchases will also impact net income, while our tax rate in FY 2009 should be 38 \u00bc%. Taken together we expect EPS of at least $2.25 for the year or up about 10%. ", "Moving to the first fiscal quarter of 2009, which as you know is our toughest compare of the fiscal year, we are targeting net sales of over $765 million representing a year-on-year increase of about 13%. For the quarter we expect to open about 22 stores in North America, four in Japan, two in Greater China, and three international wholesale locations which several expansions across these geographies, a gross margin of about 74% and an SG&A rate of about 43% given the expected impact of the first tranche of our Greater China phased buyout and our other investment activity.", "All of this taken together will result in operating income that will be about flat year-over-year with an operating margin from 31% to 31.5% and earnings per share of at least $0.44, an 8% increase over last year\u2019s first quarter which again was the strongest of FY 2008.", "For FY 2009 we expect CapEx to rise to about $200 million primarily for new stores and expansions both here, in Japan and also in Greater China as discussed. This projection excludes the recently announced $128 million deal to purchase our corporate headquarter building here in New York as the exact timing of that closing remains uncertain.", "While these are our current goals our actual results may vary from these targets based upon a number of factors including those discussed under the business of Coach, Inc. in risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Coach also does not assume any obligation to update these targets as the year progresses. ", "In summary we are confident that our growth strategies will enable us to continue to gain share in the large and growing global market for fine accessories and gifts. Thank you everyone for your attention and now we will be happy to take some questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "The question that I have is can you clarify exactly what you meant when you talked about sharply pricing new product, are you actually taking prices down or will you be bringing out more product at entry price points?", "Lew Frankfort", "First, we\u2019re not taking any prices down, what we were referring to is a strategy to deliver much more compelling value to consumers at a time when they\u2019re reluctant to spend and as you know, for this year, we\u2019re introducing a wide range of new collections and platforms which have an array of new materials as well as much greater make and what we typically do is we look for a certain margin based upon what the cost of these collections are we decided that we would take a shorter margin so that we can price them more sharply so that the consumer who is otherwise hesitant to spend will find it to be an exceptional value. ", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "On the inventory in terms of the amount of inventory that was made for full price North American stores, how much of it has been sold in the factory outlet, how much are you converting over and selling in the factory that was actually originally full price product?", "Michael Devine", "We\u2019re very pleased with where we came out of the quarter inventory wise, the metric that you\u2019ve heard us use many times in the past is kind of the flip side of that and what percentage that sold through in the factory channel was actually made for factory and that percentage stayed very constant in the June quarter at 75%. So our sell-throughs in full price are right where we wanted them to be and factory likewise and as you saw we came out of the quarter with inventory balances up less then sales and in fact the Yen actually hurts us in that compare year-over-year. So if you actually put in on a constant currency basis that compare would look even better. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "Could you give us the basis points associated with the gross margin change versus last year, how much was channel mix, I think you gave us the Yen impact at 80 basis points and then if you have any color on the SG&A line as well?", "Michael Devine", "As we suspected we landed the gross margin rate adjusted for the Yen impact at the 75.9% level after having guided to 75% so we got 80 basis point good guy as I mentioned from the Yen. So we actually outperformed if you will our own expectations by about 10 bps. The majority though\u2014so that was still down about 220 basis points over last year\u2019s Q4. The majority of that negative movement was driven by increased channel mix as factory continued to do exceptionally well as we continued to present great value to that consumer, both in the US and in Japan.", "The next largest impact was the level of promotional activity, while we were able to drive consumers into the factory channel we were\u2014kept our price points there very sharp as well to make sure we took advantage of the traffic and got the conversion. So that was the second largest impact; promotional activity primarily in our factory channels here and in Japan. So those were the two biggest drivers of the gross margin decline offset by help from the Yen. ", "In terms of SG&A we also came in right where we anticipated with about 50 basis points of positive leverage driven largely by leverage through our corporate functions, our distribution center in Jacksonville and our corporate functions here in New York. On the retail P&L came in very consistently with the way we\u2019ve talked about the business in the past. As you saw in the release we had a 7% comp and at a 7% comp the retail division did breakeven on their SG&A line so that\u2019s pretty consistent with the way we\u2019ve always modeled it. ", "And CJI provided leverage to their own P&L but because of the strengthening Yen as it converted back into dollars we had modest negative leverage but if you were to adjust for constant currency they would have provided some nice leverage to the P&L. So all those puts and takes we landed at about the 50 basis points of leverage that we had projected. ", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "Could you talk about product cost inflation and how you\u2019re thinking about higher costs out of China as we work our way through fiscal 2009?", "Michael Devine", "As we look forward into 2009 there definitely are some inflationary pressures, most notably some minimum wage increases, the tax environment in China is also getting a little more negative. The good news is though that the supply chain team here headed by [Angus Macrae] and his group have a lot of counter sourcing alternatives available to them. We are also seeing because of the overall macroeconomic backdrop leather is a little cheaper to us this year then it was last year so in terms of the organic price cost relationship, we\u2019re feeling reasonably good as we head into 2009 that we have enough activities ongoing to offset the inflationary pressures. ", "That being said though then what carries the day is what Lew spoke to about being more sharply priced on a select new introductions into 2009 and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to see some negative impact to the gross margin rate going forward at least into 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "As we look to the leverage point on North American retail for next year, I believe previously you said it\u2019s about a 5% to 7% comp that you [inaudible] leverage expenses is there opportunity to bring that number down?", "Michael Devine", "There is some opportunity although it is clearly our most variable channel in terms of driving SG&A as we see sales increase its driven by percentage rent and by increased store wages, also as we add new stores we add new ads to our occupancy line and to our headcount. So Michael Tucci and his team are managing it exceptionally tightly but at the 5% to 7% range we feel pretty good about that being the leverage point. And so as we\u2019re projecting to be a little under that, we will rely more heavily on FY 2009 into managing our centralized expenses and trying to drive leverage through that portion of our SG&A spend and also notably going forward with CJI growing at 5% to 10% constant currency basis, we would also expect to get leverage from that part of our business as well. They will grow more slowly then the company as a whole. ", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "As you look at the corporate expense base can you talk about any buckets of opportunity there?", "Michael Devine", "Well there\u2019s a number of them, we continue to year-over-year spend roughly the same amount in terms of our media outreach. We have one distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida which we\u2019ve recently expanded and now gives us an opportunity to gain leverage on that portion of our SG&A line. And then really the majority of the administrative functions here, corporately, my own finance team, our technology group are really not going to be growing in any material way and certainly not nearly at the 13% top line growth we\u2019re anticipating. So it those backroom functions are the ones that are really going to provide the leverage opportunity going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "I just wanted to know what percentage of your sales is jewelry which we think looks really great and where would you like it to be long-term and also how much are you going to increase the SKU count for holiday?", "Lew Frankfort", "First jewelry is running about 3% to 3.5% of our full price sales within our own stores and we believe we have great potential in jewelry and thank you for the compliment on the assortment. Its checking very well and longer term we believe it could comfortably approach or equal 10%. But again that\u2019s a vision over the next few years until we get there, we won\u2019t be there. For this holiday season, we\u2019re particularly focused on expanding our sterling group. It did remarkably well. We first introduced sterling in a limited number of stored and it checked extremely well and we have expanded it many, many more locations and now we see it as a key group within our jewelry assortment. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Can you talk a little bit about Japan, what you\u2019re expecting Japan sales growth to be and also did their product assortment trend as it did in the US, did you see the same things? And in the US on the wholesale side, how are they ordering differently this year then last year?", "Lew Frankfort", "First in terms of Japan, as Michael just referenced, we\u2019ll looking for growth between 5% and 10% on a constant currency basis and as you know the Japanese retail environment is extremely weak, it actually weakened during the last few months and for us it continues to be a market share gain where market share this past year was 13% and we\u2019re expecting it to grow based upon a market that will not grow.", "In terms of trends generally speaking we have not seen the same trends as we\u2019ve experienced in the United States although accessory sales overall did increase somewhat because it was a sharp focus in Japan as it did in the United States. What we\u2019re experiencing in Japan this summer is a very strong favorable reaction to our new Bleecker collection as we are in the States. So we feel real confident that the change in product is going to appeal particularly to the stylish Japanese consumer. ", "With regard to US department stores they still have great confidence in Coach. We obviously have trended ahead of the stores themselves. We are by far the number one accessories resource and they\u2019re planning us to be modestly up this year in an environment where they\u2019re planning their business not to grow. ", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Can you just mention what percent of sales came from handbags $400 and over and was the difference between the high end and low end in terms of what you saw, ticket performance and just acceptance of product?", "Michael Devine", "Across all of our direct businesses it was about 24%, up from 17% a year ago of handbag sales. ", "Lew Frankfort", "In terms of our lower priced bags, some of that occurred at the expense of lower sales in what we might call the lower priced bags as some consumers traded down to accessories. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Antoine Belge \u2013 HSBC", "Antoine Belge \u2013 HSBC", "Related to the performance of your full price network versus factory, can you perhaps be more precise what has been the [closing] for price, was it still negative and if so how are you planning full price factory going into FY 2009 and second relates to the dilutive impact of the Greater China integration, can you talk us through the incremental sales, operating profits, i.e. explaining how you come up to the $0.03 to $0.04 per share dilution?", "Lew Frankfort", "As we\u2019ve said in the past, we use the full price channel to drive the brand forward and during challenging economic times since we do not go on sale in our full price stores, we have more marketing flexibility in our factory stores which we utilize. We have a different consumer and as recently as last month when we bumped up our relative data bases between full price and factory we have seen no migration whatsoever of full price customers to factory. It\u2019s a discrete audience and we\u2019re very comfortable with the way in which we\u2019re approaching our retail business which we manage as an entity. ", "Michael Devine", "In terms of Greater China the real simple answer is that we\u2019re putting a team on the ground, an infrastructure in place in advance of significant revenues so that we can capture revenue growth down the road but as you would imagine while we\u2019re putting a modest regional team on the ground to manage the division there, as we transition to ownership of the stores obviously we\u2019re going to pick up the lease costs, we\u2019re going to pick up the store associates and the store wages associated with that. ", "And as we\u2019ve talked about a couple of times now, the revenues are relatively modest this year. We do have a phased approach, we\u2019re taking over the Hong Kong and Macau stores here in the fall but the mainland stores not until the spring. So we won\u2019t see a significant revenue pop in FY 2009 as much of the year will still be on a wholesale shipment basis while we build the team on the ground there so the net impact we believe this year will be dilutive to about that $0.03 to $0.04. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Following up on the trends in the full line channel you talked about traffic being down, perhaps qualitatively give us a sense where traffic has been trending sequentially and then following on that just talk about you had some efforts to try and obviously with the product innovation to jump start traffic, talk about some of the promotions in the full line, how is that trending as you try and graduate some of those factory customers to the full line channel?", "Lew Frankfort", "First with regard to traffic, it\u2019s been fairly consistent from one quarter to the next and our focus is primarily on conversion. We at this point believe the biggest opportunity for us is to generate satisfied consumers by giving them a great product when they get to the malls. Now clearly we have a very vibrant internet available to us where we have over one million visitors per week and the internet is a principal communications vehicle to introduce new collections and we\u2019re doing that through substantial targeted mailings.", "Also this holiday season we\u2019re going to be conducting for the first time in recent years a substantial number of truck shows across the United States where we will be inviting our best customers to preview our new collections. Lastly we\u2019re looking forward to a substantial increase in the level of editorial that we\u2019re getting particularly in selling magazines this holiday as our reports and fashion editors have gravitated quite positively towards our new looks particularly the Madison collection which we\u2019re launching in October. ", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Perhaps give us an update on that promotion, the invitation to the factory stores to full line, how that has been trending? ", "Lew Frankfort", "First it\u2019s significantly profitable for us. First its too short a time for us to measure the amount in a reliable way how much future business we\u2019re getting from these consumers in full price but what we are able to measure is they\u2019re spend in factory. So the people that we have invited to the full price who are exclusive factory buyers have responded well to our offers in full price and are spending at the same levels that they did previously in factory which means that we\u2019re getting substantial net plus business from there.", "In terms of converting them to full price without a promotion, that\u2019s a much harder chore because these consumers are very value-oriented. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Paul Lejuez\u2013 Credit Suisse", "Given the consumer environment do you expect any changes in consumer shopping behavior in terms of when they buy, maybe in other words, do you think you become more reliant on your second quarter sales and earnings, also wondering if you\u2019re seeing any changes in the buying patterns of your core customer and what are the expenses, the $12 million of expenses associated with the one-time items, if you could just let us know what that\u2019s all about?", "Lew Frankfort", "First in terms of shopping cadence, in general consumers are spending much closer to the moment. That\u2019s been a trend over the last several years and we expect that to continue. Second, we do believe that the holiday quarter on a relative basis might do somewhat better this year because of the strength of the Madison collection but in general we expect our seasonal spread to remain consistent. ", "Michael Devine", "In terms of the variable expense associated with the one-time items, it\u2019s a compensation related, it\u2019s the formulaic result of our bonus programs and based on the higher net income delivered and the other financial metrics, the outcome was $12.1 million. What I will pass along as well though, based on Lew\u2019s recommendation and our Board\u2019s agreement the top 13 senior members of management, what we call the operating group here at Coach, did not participate in the step-up in bonus programs driven by the one-time good guys.

(Operator Instructions) At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "", "Thank you, [Shirley]. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO, and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. Mike Tucci, President of North American Retail, is also joining us.", "Before we begin we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements and certain projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions, and future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences or control costs. Please refer to our latest annual reports on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. ", "Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. We presently expect to update our estimates each quarter only; however, the failure to update this information should not be taken as Coach's acceptance of these estimates on a continuing basis. Coach may also choose to discontinue presenting future estimates at any time.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our first fiscal quarter 2009 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Mike Tucci will review our key initiatives for the holiday season. Mike Devine will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter as well as our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2009. Following that we will hold a question-and-answer session that will end by 9:30 a.m.", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As you know, we just reported that first quarter earnings met our EPS guidance but fell slightly short of our top line goals due to the weakened retail landscape in North America. ", "While we're enthusiastic about the level of product excitement that will be available for holiday and believe that Coach will remain a brand of choice whether for self purchase or gifting, we're concerned that the weak traffic trends across our U.S. full price businesses will continue through the rest of the fiscal year. As a result, productivity gains over this timeframe will be difficult to achieve. Thus, we now expect to achieve sales growth of about 10% this year to about $3.5 billion versus our previous estimate of 13% top line growth. ", "Importantly, we have been proactive in planning for a tough retail environment for some time, managing our business nimbly and acting quickly to curb spending. We believe that our earnings guidance for the year can still be achieved through a combination of distribution growth, a focus on innovation to support productivity, disciplined expense control, and the share repurchases to date. At the same time, we will continue to invest prudently for long-term profitable growth. ", "While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category in our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. ", "Some highlights of our first fiscal quarter were:  ", "First, earnings per share rose 7% to $0.44 compared with $0.42 in the prior year. ", "Second, net sales totaled $753 million versus $677\u00a0million a year ago, a gain of 11%. ", "Third, Direct to Consumer sales rose 16% to $592\u00a0million from $511 million in the prior year on a comparable basis. ", "Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 1%. ", "Fifth, sales in Japan rose 12% in constant currency and 22% in dollars, driven by new stores and expansions. ", "And finally, we successfully completed the first phase of the acquisition of our Retail business in China from ImagineX, transitioning the 10\u00a0stores in Hong Kong and Macau. ", "During the quarter we opened 21 net North American retail stores, including six in new markets for Coach:  Calgary in Ottawa, Canada; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Appleton, Wisconsin; Bakersfield, California, and Fort Myers, Florida, as well as one factory store. In addition, 7 retail stores and 3 factory stores were expanded. Thus at the end of the period there were 318 full price and 103 factory stores in operation in North America. ", "I think it's important to note that the performance of our new retail stores has remained strong and ahead of our internal projections. This includes the stores opened in the first quarter, for which we now have revised annualized volumes which are running at $2.1 million compared with our expectation of $1.9 million, about 11% ahead of plan. And as noted in the press release, we have seen this outperformance most notably in new markets such as Calgary and Baton Rouge, but also in existing markets such as San Jose. Clearly, these results reflect the strength of the brand and our ability to attract consumers, both in new and existing markets. ", "Moving to Japan, four locations were added while one was expanded. At quarter end there were 158 total locations in Japan, with 20 full price stores including 8 flagships, 113 shop in shops, 20\u00a0factory stores, and 5 distributor operated locations. ", "Indirect Sales decreased 3% to $160 million from $166 million in the same period last year on a comparable basis. This decline was due to reduced shipments into U.S. department stores as we continue to tightly manage inventories into the channel given weakening sales at POS, which declined 8% for the quarter. ", "International POS sales posted strong gains in the period, driven by both distribution and comparable location sales gains. ", "We estimate that the premium U.S. handbag and accessory category grew at a mid single-digit pace during the third quarter of calendar 2008. At the same time, Coach's bag sales rose 9% across all channels in North America. ", "Our total revenues in North America were up 8%, with our directly operated stores generating a 15% gain driven by both distribution and a slightly positive comp. We would note that in full price stores our weak traffic patterns from the previous few quarters worsened, while conversion held at last year's levels and average transaction size fell slightly.", "In Factory, we continued to see increases across all three metrics, driven in part by higher promotional activity on a year-over-year basis. ", "I also want to highlight another solid quarter for Coach's women's footwear. Our business in department stores, where we are now sold through about 900 locations, rose 6% at POS for the quarter. ", "While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials - and of course I will discuss our outlook in some detail - I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, I've also asked Mike Tucci to join us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?", "Michael Tucci", "", "Thanks, Lew. As mentioned in our press release, each of our monthly introductions was well received, starting in July with Bleecker. This was followed up updated Hamptons and Legacy Collections in August and by Zoe, a new group of handbags and accessories, in September. Also in September we successfully introduced a new Coach fragrance, Legacy.", "Earlier this month we launched Madison, a new major lifestyle collection which is a softer, drapier and sophisticated group of handbags, accessories and footwear across multiple fabrications, including a new logo platform, Coach Op Art. We are especially excited about Madison as it represents the first collection that fulfills our strategy of compressing multiple years of product innovation into a single fiscal year. This is especially important at holiday, when our gifting opportunity is greatest.", "Our early reads on Madison show an improvement in handbag penetration as a percent of sales and a better balancing of our assortment overall. Our key item in this group is the Sabrina satchel, performing very well in both sizes, with prices ranging from $298 for the smaller version in Op Art to $798 in limited edition styles.", "Looking ahead to holiday, our customers will see important changes from previous years. First, a dramatic intensification of newness, notably in handbags. In the past we tended to frontload the quarter with the most significant delivery in October followed by more modest introductions in November and December. This holiday will build on October's Madison launch with powerful new product throughout the quarter. ", "Second, a focus on gifting, notably in a more bold accessory offering across a range of compelling price points. ", "And third, a retail presentation that truly appeals to holiday gift giving. Our in-store, web, packaging and advertising point of view will be more festive, colorful and exciting this season, anchored by the Madison Collection and great gifts. ", "Within handbags, Madison will remain front and center in our stores this holiday. We'll be updating the collection during the season with new colors in both Op Art and leather across key silhouettes such as the Sabrina satchel.", "In November we'll launch an updated Soho Collection driven by two new hobo silhouettes at core price points of $278 and $298 dollars, offering exceptional value. At the same time we'll be layering in Amanda, a chic whimsical collection of satin occasion handbags, clutches and accessories in bright colors which sit side by side with Madison. ", "And in December, Leah will be a key item focus. Sophisticated and functional, the lightweight Leah tote will be available in coated canvas, embossed patent and leather, priced between $298 and $398, all silhouettes feature a detachable shoulder strap, providing over the shoulder to cross body convertibility. ", "Moving on to gifting and our accessory focus, we will be dominant in small leather goods this holiday season. You'll see an item intensification to distort our gifting opportunity throughout the quarter and beyond. You'll also see more color, a wide range of price points, including our newest best-selling Madison wallet at $98, and a key item focus around money pieces, wristlets, swing packs and pouches in our stores and on the web.", "In new growth categories, we are expanding sterling silver to 120 additional stores in December, bringing the total to 220. And in fragrance and beauty, we'll be offering body lotion and gift set options as well. ", "Most broadly, our retail presentation in every way we touch the consumer will be infused with holiday energy and messaging. While our presentations will be straightforward and easy to shop, they'll also be more bold, colorful and emotional. When she enters a Coach store or visits us at Coach.com, she will clearly see newness and what we believe in as our key items.", "We're strengthening our visual merchandising such as propping and trim, making our stores more festive and providing a strong integrated gifting message supported by in-store marketing as well as our print and online holiday campaign, Holiday by Coach.", "Finally, it's important to note that we have achieved our targeted 10% to 15% reduction in handbag skews this quarter, enabling us to be more edited and productive in this challenging environment.", "Of course, in terms of stores, we will continue to manage labor against traffic, ensuring an excellent shopping experience while appropriately managing our payroll spend. And we will fully leverage the technology initiatives put in place over the last few years, including ERunner, smart scheduling, Coach by Special Request, and web store pickup, to name a few.", "With that I'll return the discussion to Lew to continue with our overarching strategies.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Thanks, Mike. While looking ahead, as we've discussed many times, we have two sales drivers. First is distribution, as we expand our global network of store locations with an emphasis on North America, Japan and China. And second is productivity, which we drive across all geographies through the introduction of innovative and relevant products in a compelling store environment. ", "As we discussed, given the weak retail climate in North America, productivity gains will remain challenging through the remainder of our fiscal year. That said, we have been implementing four key strategies that focus on sustaining growth within our international framework. Our largest opportunity during our planning horizon continues to be in North America. ", "First, we're building share in the $8.7 billion North American women's accessories market. As we've already discussed, we're implementing a number of initiatives to accelerate product innovation, elevate our offering and enhance the in-store experience. These plans will enable us to continue to strengthen our leadership position in this market.", "Our second strategy is the continued growth in North American Retail. As you know, given the compelling returns we are continuing to generate, we plan to add about 40 retail stores a year in North America, including FY '09. This year this will include a total of 14 new markets for Coach. Prior to holiday, we expect to have opened a total of 28 full price stores, including a total of 6 this quarter. We will also continue to relocate and expand stores where appropriate.", "As I mentioned, based on the performance of our new stores, which have consistently outpaced their pro formas even as the economy has weakened, we believe that North America in total can easily support 500 retail stores, including at least 20 in Canada.", "And third, outside the U.S. we're continuing to increase market share with the Japanese consumer, driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new locations and by expanding existing ones. In FY '09 and in each of the next few years we plan to add about 10 net new locations in Japan and, as has been our practice, we will also continue to expand our most productive locations.", "Our fourth strategy is to raise brand awareness in emerging markets to build a foundation for substantial sales in the future. Specifically, China, Korea, and other such geographies are increasing in importance as the category is growing rapidly and Coach is taking hold. In FY\u00a0'09, we're on target to open through distributors at least 20 net new wholesale locations in total. ", "In China we expect to open 5 new locations, 4 on the mainland and one in Hong Kong. As mentioned, during Q1 we successfully completed the first phase of our acquisition of our retail businesses in China, transitioning 10 stores in Hong Kong and Macau to Coach China. Over the next five years we expect to open 50 new locations in China, aggressively growing our sales and market share in this rapidly expanding region. ", "Our goal is to be one of the top three imported handbag and accessory brands. With the investments we plan to make in stores, marketing, organization and infrastructure, we're striving to replicate our success formula in Japan since taking control of that business there in 2001. ", "As you would expect, we're tightly managing our business. We have been addressing the unfolding economic crisis for more than a year now, and while it's not possible to fully insulate Coach from its effects, we've been pragmatic and forward thinking in our business strategies. We are closely managing inventories, controlling costs, and of course safeguarding our strong and loyal consumer franchise. ", "We will continue to deliver innovative products offering compelling value and intensifying our clienteling efforts, ensuring that Coach is top of mind this holiday season. By being proactive, maintaining our focus, and continuously delivering on our brand promise, we firmly believe we will emerge from this adversity a stronger company.", "At this time I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Mike?", "Michael F. Devine", "", "Thank you, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.", "As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 11%, with Direct to Consumer, which represents over three-quarters of our business, up 16% and Indirect down 3%, strong International sales and shipments, offset by weakness at U.S. department stores. ", "Earnings per share for the quarter increased 7% to $0.44 as compared to $0.41 in the year ago period as net income declined to $146 million from $155 million. ", "Our operating income totaled $233 million in the first quarter versus $239 million in the same period last year.", "Operating margin in the quarter was 31% flat compared to 35.3% in the year ago quarter.", "In the first quarter, gross profit rose 8% to $558 million from $518 million a year ago, and gross margin continued to be strong and on target at 74.2% versus 76.6% in the prior year.", "As expected, promotional activity, notably in the factory channel, which has yet to anniversary the overall higher levels of promotions which began in last year's second quarter, was the primary driver of the year-over-year change. Channel mix and the sharper pricing initiative also dampened gross margin. ", "As expected, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales rose from prior year levels in the first quarter and represented 43.1% of sales versus 41.3%. ", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $402\u00a0million, up about 19% from prior year levels on a comparable basis, driven in part by an investment in key initiatives which position us well for the holiday season. In addition, the increase included the purchase of $5 million of inventory in China as part of the transition and was also impacted by the strengthening of the yen over the period. Excluding these items, inventories would have been up 16% year-over-year.", "It should be noted that we have changed our method of accounting for inventories of Coach Japan from last in first out or LIFO to first in first out or FIFO. As a result, as was noted in the press release, our prior year inventory number was restated by $25 million to be presented on a comparable FIFO basis. ", "This inventory increase allows us to support 53 net new North American stores, 12 net new locations at Coach Japan, and increase sales levels from the year ago period.", "Accounts receivable balances remained well controlled as they rose less than $8 million or 5%. ", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $410 million as compared with $1.2 billion a year ago, reflecting the aggressive buyback activity over the last year. During the first quarter we repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $28.53. At the end of the period, $863 million was available under the current repurchase authorization.", "Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $10 million versus $83 million in the same period last year, primarily driven by changes in working capital, the investment in China, and the timing of new store openings. ", "Capex spending for new stores and renovations as well as investment spending for the China acquisition was $54 million versus $39 million in the same quarter a year ago. ", "Now I'd like to provide you with some of our updated goals for fiscal 2009. For the second fiscal quarter we are targeting net sales of about $1.05 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of about 8%, an operating margin of about 39%, with a gross margin similar to first quarter's rate of about 74%, and an expense ratio of about 35%, resulting in operating income up about 2% year-over-year and earnings per share of $0.77.", "As we've noted, we are maintaining our $2.25 EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. Our goals regarding the other key financial metrics are:", "Net sales growth of about 10% to about $3.5\u00a0billion, driven by distribution gains. ", "As mentioned, we expect to open at least 46 new stores in North America, including about 40 full price stores and about 6 factory stores, 10 to 15 net new locations in Japan, about 5 new locations in China, and at least 20 net new international wholesale locations while we continue to expand select highly productive locations globally. ", "In Japan we expect to achieve constant currency growth of about 5% to 10%. ", "While we continue to focus on profitability, we expect gross margin to be impacted by both ongoing promotional activity, notably in factory, as well as the shorter margins we will take on select new product in our full price business to deliver exceptional value to our consumers. As a result, we are continuing to project a gross margin rate of about 74% for the full year.", "Similarly, given the investment spending we've outlined, we're anticipating an SG&A expense ratio of about 40% for FY '09. Therefore, we are targeting an operating margin of about 34% to 34.5%, resulting in more modest operating income growth of about 2% for the year. ", "In addition, significantly lower interest income due to lower rates and a lower cash balance due to share repurchases will also impact net income, while our tax rate in FY '09 should be at 38.25%. ", "Taken together, this brings us to our $2.25 EPS guidance for the year. ", "For FY '09 we expect Capex to rise to about $250 million, primarily for new stores and expansions both here and in Japan, as discussed, and including the $65 million purchase of onehalf of our headquarters building in New York. This reflects a $15 million decrease from our previous guidance, excluding the building purchase, as we have deferred certain projects with longer-term paybacks.", "While these are our current goals, our actual results may vary from these targets based upon a number of factors, including those discussed under the Business of Coach, Inc. and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K. Coach also does not assume any obligation to update these targets as the year progresses.", "In summary, we're confident that our growth strategies will enable us to continue to gain share in the large and growing global market for fine accessories and gifts. Thank you all for your attention and now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I would be happy to take some questions. ", "Questions-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "", "Lew, the question that I have for you is more forward-looking in terms of the holiday quarter and then sort of the rest of this fiscal year, but what are your assumptions around the category growth? You talked about what you saw so far this calendar year. How are you planning that within your forecast for the business?", "Lew Frankfort ", "We're assuming little or no category growth even though the category did grow mid single-digits last quarter. We're really focused on Coach's growth and, as you know, we do have nearly 25% market share in the category so, as we go so will the category. And so it's hard for us to speak to other players, but we're confident that we will continue to grow our bag business through the holiday season and the rest of the fiscal year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "", "Mike, your expense levels were better than I would have expected given the level of sales. Has your leverage point changed at all or is it still that 7% for the Retail business? ", "Michael F. Devine", "We really are very pleased with our SG&A management. As you mentioned, our spending actually came in for the first quarter about $5 million below the level that we shared on our last call when we gave guidance for the quarter and really helped us to deliver that $0.44 EPS. And in fact the guidance that we've given now - the $2.25 - as you dive into it you'll actually see that we've taken out about $40 million in SG&A spend versus that initial guidance. So we really are tightening our belts, looking only at short payback spending initiatives. ", "We actually have what we're calling her a Coach hiring frost under way. We're virtually only doing hiring for our growth initiatives, most notably China, and our collections initiative on the merchandising side. So there's a number of things that we're doing by taking our revenue guidance down. ", "Of course, there's a variable component that contributes to that $40 million decline, things like percentage rent and store wages as traffic is off. Unfortunately, our bonuses also come down as earnings and net income come down. ", "So we feel really good. We're negotiating hard with vendors. We're looking at our T&E spend. We're also looking at capital spending, which has resulted in lower depreciation. ", "So all in all, I think what we're seeing, Michelle, is the 7% comp in the Retail division is probably still a pretty good number because of the highly variable nature of Mike's division there. But what we are impacting is the overall growth that we need to deliver SG&A leverage across the entire company by more closely managing corporate expenditures and also delivering more leverage from CJI's P&L. ", "So again - I'll repeat myself - we're very pleased with the way we've been able to manage SG&A and with this $40 million decline, if you allow us to adjust out the spending initiatives for China and for collections, we now actually will deliver, based on this latest guidance, a flat to slightly down SG&A rate as a percentage of sales. So there's a number of things going on here that are helping us to protect our earnings guidance.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "The second quarter question I had is on the weakness in the department store channel. I was hoping that you guys could give us some color there. Is it with a particular retailer? Any regional callouts that you can give us? ", "Lew Frankfort ", "First, for context, department stores are very important to Coach because they do offer consumers who we target who shop in department stores an opportunity to purchase Coach. But having said that, they do only represent about 11% of our global sales. So everything that I'm about to say needs to be in the context that it's a minor portion of our sales.", "We're experiencing weakness across all of the chains that we deal with, however the weakness is more exaggerated, of course, in Florida and California. At the same time, we have relative strength in the Tri-State area, in sections of the Midwest and Southeast.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus & Company.", "David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "", "So Lew, you just talked about - I think you talked about how those were, department store markets, doing by region. Can you talk about your full price stores by region, if there's anything vastly different or more disparity than typical?", "Lew Frankfort ", "We're finding the same geographic patterns. We're primarily affected geographically in same stores by the varying economic conditions. So the Tri-State area is doing well. Canada, of course, continues to do exceptionally well. Sections of the Midwest are doing better than other regions as well.", "David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "And then separately, could you talk a little bit in more depth about the online business, how's online doing, e-mail open rates, sort of things that we might want to look at for customer's interest with either researching your product or doing business with you online?", "Michael Tucci", "We've spent an enormous amount of time on Coach.com, and I think you'll notice that what we would call the skin and architecture of the site has been significantly revamped from an experience standpoint, look and feel. We've managed our shopping path much more aggressively, trying to get the consumer more effectively to key places that she visits, obviously, our handbag business. Categories that are not as important in the store such as men's and footwear and online have all been targeted for growth.", "It's part of a multi-pronged effort, including the full re-platforming of Coach.com which will now happen in the beginning of the calendar year, and what we're seeing is a huge opportunity around segmentation and customization which we'll begin to effort against this holiday. So you'll see us doing a more tailored approach around e-mail.", "In terms of open rates and e-mail response rates, we are very, very disciplined there. We don't bombard people with a lot of e-mails if they choose not to engage, so we control that very, very carefully. Our e-mail productivity is very strong. ", "And it's important to note that we've also expanded our online presence with key department store resources out there, where we now have Nordstrom, Macy's, Dillard's offering Coach products within their websites. And that's been very important to us to maintain growth or certainly protect growth within the online category overall.", "David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "So you said you're careful about it, but are you still pleased as we head into the later part of the year with open rates and things like that?", "Michael Tucci", "Absolutely. And in fact, what I want to underscore is that we are not, while e-mail can be an effective way to get a lot of messaging out there because it's virtually free from a cost standpoint, we're not going to use that irresponsibly. We are very careful to not bombard consumers with email messaging that we actually believe to be intrusive. It's not an enormous piece of our overall online business, but it's an important messaging tactic for us. We are very, very optimistic about engagement and open rates within Coach.com.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "", "My question's on square footage growth beyond the current fiscal year. And obviously business here in North America is tough for everybody and it feels like it's getting worse. Do you think it might be prudent to slow down the square footage growth at least in North America until we see some sort of stabilization in the broader economy?", "Lew Frankfort ", "The short answer is that we continue to be significantly profitable incrementally and, as I mentioned earlier, when we open new stores, they're profitable from day one. And we have a long view. We will obviously weather this economic crisis and we believe that we will come out of this adversity a stronger brand and business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christina Colone - Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Christina Colone - Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "So we understand that your new stores are still very productive and profitable and you remain committed to open the 40 new stores, but we were just wondering do you think so far that your growth in the market has impacted your comps by causing cannibalization and gross margin pressure? ", "And then also, has there been any discussion internally about slowing the growth to preserve margin and comps and potentially improve returns?", "Michael Tucci", "It's obviously an area that we manage very carefully. In terms of new store development, we have been very careful to open new stores in a very balanced way, across new what we would call developing and existing markets. And I think what you'll see us doing going forward is managing that open to buy. What we're very, very pleased with is the performance of new stores, in particular in new and developing markets, which have little to no cannibalization impact on our business.", "We are currently, to be clear - and we had a sense that this would be a topic of discussion\u00a0 we are currently managing the opening pattern for the stores that opened within this fiscal year. We've got a handful to open this quarter, 12 to open in the back half, and we're managing our real estate open to buy for next year. And we're fairly confident that we can achieve our opening plans. ", "The mix of stores for next year is likely to be more skewed towards new and developing markets than it has been in the past, which we see as a very high opportunity for distribution growth for us going forward. We also continue to be very pleased with the pure levels of performance in these stores. As we said, we're averaging about $2 to $2.1 million in new stores through the openings this year - that's a very, very strong number - in markets where we have introduced the Coach brand to the customer with a full line store.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "", "I wanted to ask, you mentioned that average transactions were only down slightly. Is that because customers are gravitating towards lower price point bags or is it because the mix has shifted because of jewelry and fragrances? And how are handbags $400 and up doing? ", "Michael Tucci", "Our average transaction size is being impacted mostly by mix within the quarter that we just reported. As we've introduced certain categories with lower price points - like jewelry and fragrance - and as we've seen some very significant growth in small leather goods, that has impacted our average transaction.", "Handbags over $400 continued to do very well. We actually within the quarter had penetrations of north of 30% in handbags over $400 within the handbag category. That's a tremendous number.", "And I might add that what we're seeing with Madison, which is a very, very well-priced collection from an elevation standpoint, is an improvement in handbag penetration which is impacting average transaction positively. Now it's very early in the launch, but we're pleased with our efforts around Madison to give us handbag growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Stacey Widlitz - Pali Research.", "Stacey Widlitz - Pali Research", "", "Can you just comment on your approach to discounting in the full price environment, for example, when consumers receive $50 off in the mail, and how you sort of strike a balance between training consumers to wait for that discount in the mail? ", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. We should really give context on this. We are a full price proposition, 365 days a year full price proposition. We have one price in our stores, and we manage our business accordingly.", "We have, I think, done a very good job of offering targeted opportunities to preferred customers to shop in our stores and receive discount incentives. And we're currently finding opportunities to manage that, I think, more effectively.", "Our target for Q2 is to manage that portion of our business in a very disciplined way, and I want to ensure you that our current plans actually assume a lower level of activity, which is a small portion of our overall business, a lower level of activity in that piece of our business within the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Glick - Buckingham Research Group.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "", "Mike, I was wondering if you could continue a little bit on Madison and give us a little more color about the successes you're seeing there and also whether your strategy to shorten the IMU on selected items is giving you the sell-throughs, accelerated sell-throughs, that you had anticipated and, if so, are you increasing the penetration of that strategy for holiday and spring? ", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. I'm going to start with the last piece first. You know, one of the things that we're learning with Madison and it really gives us a lot of conviction, great product is a real differentiator. We spent an awful lot of time on the positioning of Madison and what it would say to a consumer when she entered our store. And I think, for those of you who've been in our stores, you can really cut through to a very different proposition in terms of emotion, feel, and pure product offer.", "Now in terms of hard numbers, Madison is anchored by Sabrina. It's a collection where we have a singular style offered in two sizes across price points from $298, which we see as a real key broad price point, all the way up to $798. ", "And Sabrina in and of itself is representing about 20\u00a0points of penetration. That's a heck of a number, a heck of a number on one style, and something we believe we can build a new business around from a platform standpoint. ", "A very balanced effort from a selling standpoint across what we would say is multiple fabric messaging, so we have a very strong leather penetration. ", "The introduction of Op Art, which is a new logo platform for us, and right now Op Art executions and all other fabrications are roughly 50/50. That's a tremendous win for us in terms of a balanced offer. We're not overly dependent on one fabrication versus another. ", "And we also think that Madison gives us an opportunity to provide a more broad view into the business through other categories, so we see the extension of Madison from handbags into strong small leather goods selling. You'll see Amanda, which hits the stores this Friday with our November floor set, offering a different point of view within Madison around small leather goods, what we would call occasion pieces, and great giftables. In addition to that, we've seen strong response to Madison in footwear. ", "So we're very pleased with it. Of course, the world is a different world today. We're operating in a very tough climate. But we believe that we can offer innovation and product newness to the consumer and she will respond.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "In terms of your pricing strategy on the shorter IMU, what kind of results are you seeing with where you've taken that strategy and are you looking to expand that strategy going forward?", "Michael Tucci", "I think for the moment we should really concentrate. Within Q2 we've done some sharp pricing and you see some of the price points within Sabrina being very, very smart. Soho offers a more core price positioning for us at $278 and $298, and I would say that that is a tremendous balance for us from Madison to a more core offering. And that collection hits on Friday with our floor set. So we believe that that will further reinforce a more balanced price offer, and then we follow up in December with Leah, which is a strong key item tote, and that begins with a $298\u00a0offering. ", "All of these price points are baked into our forward guidance around margin. We've built our turn plans based on these price points. And I think we'll speak to our positioning on pricing as we learn from Q2 later in the year, in Q3 and Q4, and we'll share that with you in future calls.", "Michael F. Devine", "So David, just to build on what Mike said, there is an assumption going forward into the second half that smart pricing will continue, and that is baked into our guidance for the full year gross margin rate of 74%. ", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "And Mike, just real quick, the $2.25 guidance, does that include any share repurchases? Typically it doesn't; I just wanted to confirm that.", "Michael F. Devine", "Yes, we're consistent on that one. Just the completed share repurchase activity that we shared with everyone in the release for Q1. Nothing beyond that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "", "As you look at product costs, are you seeing a difference in product costs that allow you to get these sharper prices also? And secondly, any updates on the gallery format that you had rolled out in footwear, watches, and any ancillary categories?", "Michael F. Devine", "Why don't I take the product cost issue, firstly, and then we'll handle the second question later. I think, Dana, the cost environment is pretty consistent with the snapshot we gave you at the end of Q1. Certain raw material input costs are actually helping, most notably leather. Because of worldwide demand, we're able to buy leather today for slightly below what we were paying for it at last year levels.", "We also have, through Jerry Stritzke's supply chain organization, many, many initiatives ongoing around qualifying new sources and alternative sources for different raw goods that go into the production of our product, and those continue to proceed. That's the blocking and tackling, but there's a long, long list of items that we're working on to try and squeeze cost savings out.", "At the same time, there are other inflationary pressures - the Chinese currency and minimum wage, fuel surcharges, etc. So we don't see a significant change from where we were a quarter ago. We think that there's enough proactive activities embedded to hold gross margins pretty steady to that 74% guidance that we've had all fiscal year long. So nothing too terribly different now versus 90 days ago.", "Michael Tucci", "Dana, on gallery, we're spending a lot of time in Short Hills. That store is performing very well. We believe in the concept. We are in the final stages of build out on our second gallery store, which opens mid-November in King of Prussia. That format will be a larger format. It's about 5,500\u00a0square feet. A little more width allows us to do a more impactful men's presentation within the gallery concept, which we're anxious to learn about. ", "And we've already made some small modifications within Short Hills around positioning; to your question around footwear, we've actually repositioned footwear within that store, which has been a very successful business for us towards the center of the store. ", "Footwear overall has been a nice story for us, and what we're very pleased with is we've been able to manage productively a handful of footwear styles from an all-store point of view. And it allows the customer, particularly around some of the more casual executions and things like sneakers, to really get a multiple purchase, more head-to-toe Coach experience. We will be adding footwear selectively to stores going forward. It's not an enormous rollout, but here and there we will be adding footwear shops into a handful of stores as we expand.", "On the watch side, we are actually focusing our watch growth to the 110 top stores in the company with a full presentation. And we're looking at the balance of stores to reposition watches to allow us some additional room for growth around small leather goods, and we think that's a tremendous productivity opportunity for us.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Any update on the jewelry side or the real estate environment in dealing with the real estate developers? Are you getting better deals?", "Michael Tucci", "Jewelry's actually an opportunity for us in Q2. I spoke earlier about sterling silver rolling to more stores, and I think we're really spent enough time in terms of development environment. This is not a big deal-making time for us. We're focused on executing Q2 and holiday.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates.", "Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates", "", "Lew, I wanted to know what your thoughts are as far as this less conspicuous environment that we're in. It seems like it would be beneficial to you. And then also you've talked about over the years the number of handbags a woman purchases in a year. For awhile it was up to four to five. What do you anticipate this number to be over the next six months to a year in this kind of tough economy?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Well, first, Jennifer, we don't expect any change in the rate of handbag purchase. It will be more or less the same. It could be more, depending on how wowed she is by Coach product and that's why we decided to compress multiple years of innovation into one year, so that we can give her a particularly compelling offering when she's reluctant to spend, to emotionally entice her.", "In terms of us being a particular beneficiary, candidly, no one benefits from an economic climate such as the one we're in. Everyone is affected. And as we said throughout our discussion, we're looking to continue to navigate jointly through these waters.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "It just seems as though that women - and from what I've heard - are trading down from, say, a $2,400\u00a0handbag, and that's kind of what I was referring to. And it seems as though your brand would be in a position to benefit from that. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Well, certainly we would benefit from that. We would.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "I wanted to know your initial responses to the SLGs, your little shops that you've set up. What are the margins compared to handbags?", "Michael Tucci", "Jennifer, it's very early in terms of our SLG intensification. We actually just completing it this week. It'll be fully executed with the launch of Amanda and the Soho floor set, which happens on Friday. ", "From a margin standpoint, we've said many, many times that SLG margins are very consistent with our handbag margins. It's a growth opportunity for us and you'll see us attacking that very aggressively. ", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Antoine Belge - HSBC.", "Antoine Belge - HSBC", "", "Could you comment on the performance of factory versus full price in the quarter and also how you see it evolving in the final quarter?", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. As we've said, within the quarter we actually saw a weakening of traffic patterns from the previous few quarters within full price. And the good news against that was conversion basically held at last year's levels, with average transaction down slightly. ", "In factory, we continue to see increases across all three metrics, and that's driven in part by higher promotional activity within the factory channel and obviously the discount environment within factory and a slightly better traffic pattern there. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you. That will conclude our Coach earnings conference call. It is now 9:31 and the markets are open. Thanks, everyone, and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO, and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. Mike Tucci, President of North American Retail, is also joining us.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences or control costs. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2009 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Mike Tucci will then review the holiday season from a U.S. retail perspective and discuss key initiatives for the spring season ahead. Mike Devine will continue with details on financial and operational results for the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session that will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Lew will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO. ", "Lew Frankfort", "", "Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone.", "As noted in our release this morning, we were able to report second quarter sales and earnings per share that were only slightly lower than prior year despite the most challenging holiday season our company has experienced during my 30-year tenure.", "The heavily promotional atmosphere against a deteriorating economic backdrop impacted both traffic and conversion rates in our retail stores and department store locations and ultimately led to weaker than expected sales. Importantly, we achieved our goal of providing consumers with truly innovative wow product offering compelling value. We made the deliberate decision not to discount in our retail stores, protecting our brand equity, while our business model provided the flexibility to leverage our factory business.", "Before we discuss the details of our second quarter results, I believe it's important to touch on a few key points. ", "First, Coach is operating from a position of strength. We have made and will continue to make good sound business decisions to position us for profitable growth in the years ahead. We are continuing to build a foundation for growth by investing prudently. Our store fleet is strong, and we will be appropriately cautious about our square footage growth given the current backdrop. Our multichannel distribution model is diversified and includes substantial international and factory businesses, which reduces our reliance upon our full-price U.S. business. We will continue to protect our brand. The strength of our balance sheet and business model gives us the flexibility to adapt our pricing strategies to make the right decisions for the long term. Our toughest comparisons are to our own historic metrics.", "Second, all of our research and our experience points to the fact that the handbag and small leather goods category will hold up better than apparel and other wardrobing choices as a secular shift, which took us to the point, continues. ", "Third, we are working to rebalance our assortment for a much more price-sensitive consumer by effectively reducing prices 10% to 15% in FY '10 by rebalancing our handbag and small leather goods assortment. Mike Tucci will discuss this initiative in more detail shortly.", "Fourth, while we remain focused on innovation to support productivity, we will continue to exercise disciplined expense control, investing where prudent and cutting costs as appropriate.", "And lastly, when we do emerge from this downturn we will be well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share.", "While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key metrics of our second fiscal quarter were:  ", "First, earnings per share declined 3% to $0.67 compared with $0.69 in the prior year.", "Second, net sales totaled $960 million versus $978 million a year ago, a decline of 2%.", "Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 2% to $818 million from $803 million in the prior year on a comparable basis.", "Forth, North American same-store sales for the quarter declined 13%.", "And fifth, sales in Japan declined 1% in constant currency and rose 15% in dollars.", "During the quarter we opened six North American retail stores, including two in new markets for Coach - Sioux Fall, South Dakota and Modesto, California - as well as three factory stores. In addition, two retail stores and one factory store were expanded. Thus at the end of the period, there were 324 full-price and 106 factory stores in operation in North America.", "Moving to Japan, two locations were added. At quarter end there were 160 total locations in Japan, with 20 full-price stores, including 8 flagships, 114 shop in shops, 21 factory stores, and 5 distributor operated locations. ", "Indirect sales decreased 19% to $143 million from $176 million in the same period last year on a comparable basis. This decline was primarily due to reduced shipments into U.S. department stores. We continue to tightly manage inventories into the channel given weakening sales at POS, which declined 22% for the quarter as discounting in the channel reached unprecedented levels and Coach was generally excluded from these sales.", "International POS sales rose slightly in the period, driven by distribution while shipments declined.", "We estimate that the premium U.S. handbag and accessory category declined about 10% during the fourth quarter of calendar 2008. At the same time, Coach's bag sales declined 6% across all channels in North America. Our total revenues in North America were down 6%, with our directly operated stores off 1% as distribution growth offset nearly all of the negative comp performance. ", "We should note that in full-price stores our weak traffic patterns from the previous few quarters worsened considerably while conversion declined modestly and average transaction size fell slightly. Beyond the deteriorating retail environment, we would attribute this relative weakness in traffic and conversion to our deliberate decision not to engage in discounting when virtually the entire mall was on sale. ", "In factory, where we leveraged the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing, we continued to see increases, although at more moderate levels across all three metrics of traffic, ticket and conversion.", "While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials, and of course I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our product performance for the second quarter, highlights of the second half as well as real estate and pricing strategies for FY '10. Mike?", "Michael Tucci", "", "Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Lew has just given you a recap of the quarter, which was challenging in all respects, most notably in our full-price stores, where we held to our pricing and service standards. In factory, as mentioned, we used our promotional levers to drive sales and manage inventory. ", "As mentioned in our release, many of our customers responded positively to our new holiday offerings, though the significantly depressed backdrop and barrage of poor economic news clearly impacted spending. ", "Madison, the first lifestyle collection that fulfilled our strategy of compressing multiple years of product innovation into a single fiscal year, was the most important initiative during the quarter. It was well received by consumers, notably those silhouettes which reflected our sharper pricing initiative, such as the Sabrina Op Art satchel at $298. In addition, new items such as our $98 Madison wallet and Op Art Capacity wristlet at $119, were top sellers, while categories such as jewelry and fragrance were great giftables at sharp prices. This suggests an opportunity to better balance our assortment and realign our pricing strategy, which I will discuss in more detail in a minute.", "Turning to spring, we're enthusiastic about our transitional and seasonal offerings. As part of this transition, we recently introduced the Penelope Collection, offered in leather, our Classic Signature and Silk Shantung and Op Art across multiple silhouettes. These classic shapes, coupled with great functionality and nickel hardware offer broad appeal. A particular standout is our new Shopper Style. ", "Rounding out the third quarter introductions will be an updated Heritage Stripe group in February and the new Parker Collection in March. With its soft feminine pleats and twisted straps, Parker represents another significant design evolution for Coach. The collection is currently in pilot with excellent results in 10 stores across the country. ", "During the third quarter we will expand our sharper pricing initiative, offering especially compelling value in key silhouettes within each collection, such as the Heritage Stripe tote, Parker Op Art shoulder bag, and Signature Stripe satchel, all priced at $298. ", "Looking out to our fourth quarter, in April we'll deliver a collection of bags and accessories inspired by our Bonnie Cashin archives. And at the end of the month, just in time for Mother's Day, we'll complement our assortment with the introduction of Cricket, a spectator carryall-based item group in a broad range of colors.", "In summary, we're pleased with our spring and early summer lineup, which focuses on innovation and improved affordability.", "Moving to our stores, as you know, we've incorporated a discussion of new store performance as part of our quarterly recap for well over a year now, so I want to briefly touch on these metrics as a segue into a broader discussion of our real estate plans for the year ahead.", "Lew mentioned that we opened 28 stores in the first half, and I'm happy to note that they continue to perform well, hitting pro forma volumes at $1.8 million annualized rates. These new stores are very profitable and operate at high levels of productivity. ", "Given these strong metrics and our brand proposition, we are a highly desirable tenant and as such have ample real estate opportunities to choose from. Importantly, the flexibility built into our approval timeline provides us with the ability to nimbly manage our store openings schedule.", "However, it's also important to note that we will not be stubborn about new store growth and plan to adapt to the reality of the marketplace. Clearly, the retail landscape is changing. While this might mean more real estate opportunities for us naturally based upon the weakening consumer environment and the uncertain retail climate, we're being very cautious about entering into new deals today. Our primary focus will be on improving the productivity of our existing full-price fleet.", "Looking ahead to fiscal year '10, we're now targeting about 20 new North American retail stores rather than our customary 40. In addition, we'll focus on those store segments where we've seen the best relative performance, notably Canada, with 6 openings planned for next year, and new U.S. markets. In fact, a total of 13 of our FY '10 stores are targeted for new North American markets for Coach. In addition, we have decided to suspend retail expansion activity.", "Another important area of strategic focus in FY '10 will be the price positioning of handbags, a key lever in our ability to keep our full-price proposition strong and our sharp pricing initiative. We have and will continue to bring our regular retails down by 10% to 15% by rebalancing the handbag assortment from higher price points into the sweet spot below $300, while taking similar price reductions on women's accessories. We will exploit this opportunity by designing into this price point, engineering collections that can provide this exceptional value to our consumers, and generate excellent margins at the same time. This should drive our handbag penetrations higher, thereby improving mix, increasing ticket, and ultimately improving productivity. ", "Of course, we will continue to invest in newness across all price points, but over time our objective is to add more selection and weight to this under $300 price band to gain share in a changed consumer marketplace. ", "With that, I'd like to return the discussion to Lew to continue with our overarching strategy.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Mike.", "As we've discussed many times, we have two drivers of long-term growth - first is distribution, as we expand our global network of store locations with an emphasis on North America, Japan and China, and second is productivity, which we drive across all geographies through the introduction of innovative and relevant product and a compelling store environment. ", "What you have heard today from Mike and me doesn't change our long-term focus. We will continue to build market share here in the U.S. and grow our store base, although at a slower pace. We will continue to open new locations in Japan with a focus on regional markets and factory stores where the opportunities are greatest. And we will continue to develop the emerging market potential, completing the acquisition of our retail business in China during April, where our sales remain robust.", "It's important to underscore that we remain confident that in the emerging new reality of lower consumer spending in the U.S., the handbag and accessory category will continue to take share from other wardrobing categories such as apparel given the secular shift in spend that we have seen for the last decade. By offering her a balanced assortment of great product and exceptional value, we will continue to grow our market share position.", "At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?", "Michael F. Devine", "", "Thank you, Lew. Good morning, everyone. Lew and Mike Tucci have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results.", "As mentioned, our quarterly revenues declined 2%, with direct-to-consumer, which represents over three-quarters of our business, up 2%, and indirect down 19%, primarily due to lower shipments to U.S. department stores.", "Earnings per share for the quarter decreased 3% to $0.67 as compared to $0.69 in the year ago period as net income declined to $217 million from $252 million. ", "Our operating income totaled $348 million in the second quarter versus $403 million in the same period last year. ", "Operating margin in the quarter was 36.3% compared to 41.2% in the year ago period. ", "In the second quarter, gross profit dollars declined 6% to $692 million from $737 million a year ago, but remain strong at 72.1% versus 75.4% in the prior year. ", "During the course of the quarter, we chose to increase discounting levels in our factory stores in response to the deteriorating retail environment, which was the primary negative impact to our gross margin. Channel mix and the sharper pricing initiative in our full-price divisions also dampened gross margin. We do expect all three factors to weigh on our second half results as well as we expand our sharper pricing initiative in the full-price division.", "SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales rose from prior year levels in the second quarter and represented 35.8% of sales versus 34.2%. While we are not providing specific guidance for the second half, I would note that should we see a continuation of 2Q sales trends, we would expect our expense ratio to remain well above prior year levels given our investment spending on China and the collections initiative, as well as the diminishing amount of variable expense savings available at lower store volumes. ", "For the quarter, the tax rate was slightly lower than we'd anticipated, coming in at about 38%. We would expect that this will be our effective tax rate for the balance of FY '09.", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $383 million, up about 39% from prior year on a comparable basis. On a unit basis, however, inventory was up 14%. This differential reflects our higher average unit costs. This inventory increase was also driven in part by the higher level of product newness in December versus prior years and by the strengthening of the yen over the period. Excluding these items, inventory would have been up 28% in dollars and 11% in units year-over-year. ", "This inventory increase allowed us to support 49 net new North American stores, 13 net new locations in Coach Japan from the year ago period, as well as our newly acquired Coach China stores. It should be noted that this increase in stores accounted for more than $16 million or 6\u00a0percentage points of the dollar increase in inventories.", "Before we leave the topic of inventory, I did want to note that our operating model, with a robust factory channel, allows us to view our inventory as currency. Our balances are of high quality, current merchandise, and we repurpose excess inventory very profitability through our factory stores. We do expect to have inventory units back in line by the end of our fiscal year, so, in short, we do not see our current inventory position as a long-term issue.", "Accounts receivable balances rose $50 million or 35%, primarily due to the timing of sales and the stronger yen. Once again, here we're very comfortable with the quality and currency of the receivables and would note that the vast majority of our December ending balances have been collected since the start of the new quarter.", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $424 million as compared with $891 million a year ago, reflecting the aggressive buyback activity over the last year. During the second quarter we repurchased 6.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $17.08. At the end of the period, $760 million remained available under the current repurchase authorization. ", "Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $256 million compared to $393\u00a0million last year during Q2. ", "Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $113 million versus $345 million in the same period last year due to higher CapEx, lower net income, and working capital items. ", "Our CapEx spending was $143 million versus $48 million in the same quarter a year ago as we completed the full purchase of our corporate headquarters here in New York City for a total of $126\u00a0million, which included a $103 million cash outlay. ", "As we indicated in our earnings pre-announcement earlier this month and our press release this morning, we are not providing specific guidance. Those of you who know us well will correctly assume that we've generated a number of scenarios for the back half of the year, utilizing a wide range of assumptions. That said, we believe that providing metrics or even a range of metrics for our business at a time of so much uncertainty about consumer spending behavior would be an exercise in false precision. ", "At the same time, we have absolute confidence in our ability to nimbly manage our business. Importantly, Coach's balance sheet strength and diversified multichannel operating models provide the flexibility to adapt our strategies to the rapidly changing environment while continuing to build the foundation for long-term profitable growth.", "Thank you all for your attention, and now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I will be happy to take some questions, which will be followed by a brief summary by Lew.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "", "Lew, if I could squeeze in two questions, the first one, can you talk a little bit about how you came to the repricing of 10% to 15%, why you guys believe that that is the appropriate level in terms of moving through some of the product? ", "The second question is I think Mike talked a lot about some new pilots that were performing better or above plan. Can you talk about how trends have been sort of post-Christmas or in January a little bit for us?", "Lew Frankfort", "Let me ask Mike Tucci to begin, and then I'll pick up the rest.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. Bob, I'll talk a little bit about our current business and also about price positioning and Lew can add his thoughts as well.", "It is January, Bob, and I think we all know that the Christmas quarter was challenging. We do see importantly that there's been a stabilization in full price. We feel strongly that our decision to keep the stores fresh from a product standpoint, introduce newness on 1226 to capture that post-Christmas opportunity, was a very important move for us. And we're pleased with what we're seeing with the results in Penelope. We have new products hitting the stores in full price on Monday the 26th which will feature Heritage Stripe, and then we end the quarter with Parker, which is a very strong collection for us and it's performing well in pilot. ", "It's a very challenging time in the stores, certainly, from a consumer standpoint, but we believe that there is a stabilized trend here that somewhat gives us a sense of confidence. ", "On the factory side, we're very much concentrating on managing flow of inventory. The results there have been solid. We did manage the post-Christmas period very well in factory, and there again we have newness hitting the stores this weekend with the launch of our SoHo Collection in factory. ", "On the pricing side, the real opportunity for us is around balancing the assortment and providing more SKU choice across price ranges, and we've determined that if we look at our historical pricing, running the handbag business at $200 for a number of years and then moving north to $300 and in the more recent past getting into the $330 to $340 range, that $300 is a real important level for us to focus on to maximize handbag penetration in our stores. ", "And while a lot of the activity that we're putting into the stores currently is a reprice and it's done on the back end, the focus on our development for FY '10 is to do that on the front end and engineer that product and plan those assortments and invest in those assortments to hit that price bucket and bring our retails down to that $300 range as an average. ", "Lew Frankfort", "The only thing I'd like to add is that when we look at our historic handbag units of penetration in a single store, we actually determined that the optimal positioning for us was to have a sweet spot between $200 and $300. When we had an ample array of bags between that price range, we did our absolute best. And we do believe that with the value orientation that consumers have today more than ever that by effectively by rolling back prices through introducing new products into this sweet spot, we will be able to regain momentum and that's our intention. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "", "Can you talk a little bit about as you expand the lower price points potential impacts on gross margin and how you're thinking about the balance of the higher price versus the lower price in the assortment? ", "And just lastly, on Japan, how is the environment in Japan? What is the strategy there compared to the U.S.? Are prices being adjusted there also? ", "Lew Frankfort", "I'll begin and then ask Mike Devine to participate. I'll start with Japan. ", "The pricing initiative is a global initiative. What we want to do is become even more affordable than we have been. As you know, Dana, we've been very successful as an acceptable luxury brand and we realize that consumer spending will not return at the end of this period to prior levels, so we have to find the right balance so that we can be exceptionally compelling, both for aspirational consumers trading up and as an alternative to the European luxury brands. So when you look at our pricing, whether it's in Japan, Korea or in North America next year, you will see on average the price is 10% to 15% lower. ", "Mike, you want to comment on gross margin, if you would?", "Michael F. Devine", "Sure. Dana, if you go back and review how we've talked about this over the last couple of quarters, we actually anticipated the sharper pricing initiatives being about 100 basis points year-over-year on a compare '09 to '08. The good news is that the program has been successful and our sell-throughs for the sharper priced items have actually been stronger than anticipated, and as a result we're actually running above that. But that is again good news because it's driving higher net operating margin dollars while compromising the gross margin rate.", "I think as we've talked about a couple of times on today's call, with the environment we're facing, we're actually looking at expanding the program in the second half and into FY '10, so I think you could anticipate something more in the 150 basis point area on a year-over-year compare.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley.", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "", "The first question is I was hoping you could give us a sense of how traffic and sales trends played out throughout the quarter and maybe give us some commentary on a monthly basis.", "And then the second question is on inventory, up 39% on a comparable store basis. Any sense of how that lays out by channel would be helpful.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. In terms of the second quarter, really important to note we have a very back-weighted quarter. December is the driver and it represents an enormous percentage of our total quarter, and the reality is that we saw a very challenging period from early December right up through Christmas in terms of traffic and sales trends. On the full-price side, I think we're all very well aware of what the market conditions were and what the promotional environment was, and that really weighed on our results overall. So it was difficult as we led into our peak period to see traffic and sales trends that really pulled down the quarter.", "As I said earlier, the post-Christmas period from a calendar standpoint and weighting standpoint was actually more positive and it did help us towards the very end of the quarter. ", "Michael F. Devine", "Michelle, Mike D. here and I'll take the question on inventory. I do want to first start out by reemphasizing what I spoke to in the prepared remarks is that the good news is we have a very robust factory channel. We are able to repurpose our inventory balances from our full-price division into factory stores and sell through at a very profitable operating income level. So what you'll see us do is adjust factory production down, made-for-factory product down, in the back half of the year, move the excess inventory balances that we're carrying out of Q2 into that channel, and as I said in the remarks, have units back in line by year end. ", "That being said, I think we're seeing inventory growth across channels, most notably our two biggest inventory pools, of course, are in the U.S. and Japan. Japan is up more dramatically because of the impact of FX, where the yen is much stronger than a year ago, but the increases are pretty well balanced across all business units and divisions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "", "Can you talk a little bit about the department store business? I know it's a small part of the business and you planned it down. Are you going to in this environment try and exit doors as well as plan the business down?", "Lew Frankfort", "We're taking a very cautious approach, Christine, with the department store business, as we indicated. We actually shipped in much less inventory into the department stores in the fall and we're doing similarly in the spring.", "As far as rationalizing our doors in department stores, it so happens that we did that progressively over the last several years so that we're only in I believe about 60% of Federated's  locations today. And indeed, in the store announcements for closure, for example, we don't offer Coach in any of those locations. ", "So we do feel that the distribution that we have within department stores still works. It's obviously a very important channel, viable, and we will continue to participate actively in our wholesale business in North America. ", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "And what about product assortment for that channel, any changes there versus your full-price stores?", "Lew Frankfort", "In our department stores, we have a much more concentrated assortment, as you know, much more highly edited and it's almost 100% handbags and accessories. They, too, will of course be a beneficiary of the rebalancing of our assortment back to this sweet spot between $200 and $300.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "", "Mike, I was just wanted to follow up on the inventory question. Could you give us any information on aging, how the aging compares this year to last year, and then just remind us how does the accounting work when you transfer goods from the full-price division over to factory? And you presumably get a slightly lower margin in factory; does that, I guess, pressure hit in the quarter when those goods are sold or did you already take some sort of an adjustment in the second quarter to reflect the lower expected margin on those goods once they do finally sell in the factory channel?", "Michael F. Devine", "Kimberly, let me go to inventory aging first. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're very comfortable with the aging currency of the inventory. It is current, high quality merchandise, largely in our sweet spot of handbags and women's accessories, and we're confident that we can move it and sell it through in the spring season in the factory channel.", "In terms of inventory accounting, we account for our inventories as they manufacture as opposed for as a retailer, so no, we have not taken any accounting charge as we anticipate moving inventory into the factory stores. We will realize the shorter margin as we sell through, but of course I have to remind you once again that the factory division actually drives a higher overall operating margin than our full-price division does today. So from a pure financial profitability metric, it actually will end up with a stronger op income result. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "I'm just a little confused by the color of the trend and just wondering if you could expand on it a little bit. On the one hand you just had your toughest quarter, when people had to purchase gifts for Christmas, and now that there's not necessarily any reason to buy except the newness that you talked about - and the product does look terrific - but you said that you're seeing a stabilized trend that gives you confidence, so I'm just wondering if you could expand on that. ", "And the other issue I'm confused about is why you wouldn't be assuming the worst in terms of consumer psychology and begin taking meaningful expense and headcount reductions as virtually all other companies in the space are doing?", "Lew Frankfort", "Todd, when Mike referred to stabilization of our trends, it is in reference to our Q2 trends, not to LY. So unlike Q2, where we indicated that we saw a worsening situation throughout the quarter, that deterioration has not continued into Q3.", "Mike D., why don't you comment around the other part.", "Michael F. Devine", "Sure. Yes, when it comes to managing expenses, we really believe that it's critically important that we seek to strike the right balance. Where appropriate, we need to aggressively cut expense to face the current reality, but at the same time we need to maintain our brand position and invest in growth initiatives such as China, for example, for our future. ", "But that being said, I do think that we have taken fairly strong and nimble actions around expense control, Todd. You may recall that on our Q1 call when we gave new guidance for the fiscal year FY '09, we actually pulled $40 million of expenses out of the year at that time. And if you actually look at our actual results for Q2 compared to the guidance at that time, we actually in Q2 alone went $24 million lower than the guidance at that time. So just on that, we're not giving specific guidance going forward; on that basis, we have pulled $64 million of expense out of the year as we walked into it with our initial planning. ", "So I'm really pleased with the way the organization has responded and feel good that we've acted fairly nimbly. That being said, with second half store volumes where they are, there is less further expense reductions. I wouldn't anticipate us taking additional expenses out of the second half at the same rate as we have in the first half, but we do still feel like there's a high single digit amount of expense leverage as we tweak sales volume.", "So I think we have acted nimbly. Mike Tucci in his prepared remarks talked about the actions we're taking around store count. We are not looking to expand any existing stores and are cutting our new opening pace in half in our full-price division. So I think we have taken a fair number of actions, while at the same time protecting our brand positioning, our service levels, and putting forward a modest amount of investment for future growth.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "Mike, do you plan any corporate headcount reductions or have there been any?", "Michael F. Devine", "As we talked about on our last call, we have instituted what we're calling a Coach hiring frost. What we've done is we're really allocated increases in headcount only to those important growth initiatives, again, most notably China and our merchandising initiatives that we're now calling internally new venture, and so beyond that there's no plans at this current time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse.", "Paul Lejuez - Credit Suisse", "", "Just one clarification, then a question. Lew, did you say that during the quarter the factory channel traffic, ticket and conversion were up slightly? ", "And then my question, you know, you guys are talking about lowering prices 10% to 15%, and you're also talking about increasing store productivity. Does that imply that you're planning to order inventory in units up at least 10% to 15% or even above that to drive higher store productivity? Just wondering how those comments all tie together with how you're planning inventory in the future.", "Lew Frankfort", "All good questions. Mike T., you want to take the second part of the question?", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. In terms of inventory planning as we look into FY '10 and we're building those plans today, you have to really factor in our sell-through assumptions. And what's happening is while we are planning average unit retails in handbags to come down, we're planning on sell-through improvement, so we are buying very tight, which will mitigate unit increase. And of course, as we engineer product at lower retails, our cost base will reflect that as well. ", "So from an inventory position, we are managing the business very, very tight in terms of our forward buys.", "Lew Frankfort", "In terms of our factory stores, all three metrics - traffic, ticket and conversion - did rise moderately.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray.", "Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray", "", "Mike, could you clarify a little bit the commentary you were making on factory stores? I think those of us who have followed the stock for quite some time know that factory's a very profitable division for you, but are you actually implying that factory profitability's going to be up in your fiscal back half? I'm just trying to reconcile that with you taking down the made-for product on the product mix side.", "Michael F. Devine", "It's a good clarifying question, Neely. The answer is not that it will be up, I assume you mean on a year-over-year basis, but I wanted to emphasize the point that the factory division actually returns a higher four-wall operating contribution rate than the full-price division and so it takes a shorter gross margin rate. And the fact that we've been highly promotional in that channel in Q2 and we would anticipate into the back half will hurt our year-over-year compares, but nonetheless we still deliver very, very profitable four-wall operating returns higher than [inaudible] the full-price division.", "Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray", "Mike, that's even when you take down your percentage of penetration on made-for products?", "Michael F. Devine", "That's correct.", "Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then just one other housekeeping. The stabilization that you guys are speaking to in January from the, I guess, less negative is kind of the implication based on Lew's commentary, I'm just wondering is the delta here the conversion rate or is it the traffic? ", "Michael Tucci", "", "The real improvement or stabilization is around traffic in full price.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs.", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "", "You referenced the strong balance sheet earlier on. Could you help us think about capital allocation buyback appetite, even CapEx, in light of the lower store growth? I'm just wondering the reined-in 20 store openings, is that in response to the current environment or should we be thinking about that as a shift in mind-set going forward and perhaps, you know, should we expect that to continue to trend lower?", "Lew Frankfort", "It's entirely a function of the current environment. We feel very strongly that we will once again, when the economy recovers, be well situated to achieve strong and profitable growth, and our opportunities continue abundant. What we're doing now, obviously, is adapting to an unprecedented retail environment, balancing both long-term and short-term considerations.", "Michael F. Devine", "In terms of CapEx, if you go back and look you'd see that our CapEx on an LY basis in FY '08 was about $216 million. Adjusted for the spend on the building, this year we're anticipating that that spend be around $180 million on roughly the same store count. So we have tightened our capital spending considerably, another action that we've taken this year around expense control. ", "From that you can adjust out expansions and 20 additional full-price stores next year. I think we're also likely to invest less with our U.S. wholesale partners going forward during this backdrop, so I think you'd see a number nicely below $180 million. ", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "And then, Lew, just following up on your comment, so should we be thinking about that as things improve we should be ramping back towards a 40-store opening?", "Lew Frankfort", "I think it's too early to provide that type of texture, although in a perfect situation the answer would be yes.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from David Glick - Buckingham Research Group.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "", "Lew, just a question on the handbag category trends. My recollection is that Q1 the category was up mid single digits and obviously that decelerated to minus 10. I was wondering if you could give us some color, maybe some data that you have that you could share with us that gives you the confidence that handbags as a category is still gaining share and are those share gains similar to previous levels or have those share gains narrowed somewhat?", "Lew Frankfort", "A good set of questions, David. First, when we analyze the reason for the rate of decline, it was primarily our handbags being on sale at all levels at unprecedentedly low price points. And that doesn't really mean a unit decline. It really means a dollar decline that's a function of our handbags being on sale.", "Having said that, all of the research we do and we just fielded some research at the beginning of January to understand our consumer's purchase intent regarding bags versus apparel and other fashion accessories, and the reality is while consumers expect to spend less, they expect to spend relatively less in handbags than they do in apparel, and we think that trend will continue.", "Now our handbag sales in North America fell about 6% during the last quarter and we estimate the category fell about 10%. So in a very modest way, perhaps we gained market share, but we obviously did not feel very good about our results and we'd prefer to be in positive territory. And our general view is that when the market stabilizes, the handbag category will grow relative to apparel and assume a larger share of the consumer's wardrobing spend.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "", "And then, Mike, maybe I missed it, but did you comment on your approach to share repurchases going forward? Obviously, you commented on the amount remaining; I assume you're going to be buying back stock. But if you could give us some color on how you guys are looking at that going forward.", "Michael F. Devine", "Yes, we did just mention how much we had left on our current authorization, David. You know, our view has altered somewhat on our buyback activity. In the current credit crisis, where liquidity is king, I think you'll see us take a little more cautious and conservative approach to maintaining high cash balances and probably slow down the pace of buyback. ", "In the last year we spent $900 million on buyback activity. If you go over an 18 month period, it's been $1.7 billion and we've taken 15% of our share count out. So we've been aggressive to date and it's benefited us, but in this current liquidity crisis we're going to be a little more conservative about holding cash.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "So it's not a suspension of the buyback, just a slowdown in the pace?", "Michael F. Devine", "Exactly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lorraine Maikis - Banc of America - Merrill Lynch.", "Lorraine Maikis - Banc of America - Merrill Lynch", "", "I just wanted to get a little clarification on our expectations for 2010. I know you're planning price points down and you said that you're expecting sell-through improvement. Is that based on an improvement in the consumer's willingness and ability to spend or is that purely product driven?", "Lew Frankfort", "It's a function of multiple factors. One is distribution growth. As you know, we are growing our business across multiple geographies and that will continue in FY '10. Second, we do have a very diverse model and what's important to note, Lorraine, is that less than 30% of our sales are North American full-price sales. So we do have several businesses, factory businesses, international businesses, wholesale businesses, and other channels, many of which continued to grow during this period. So it's a combination of factors.", "Michael F. Devine", "I think also one thing I would build on Lew's point, also referencing something Mike T. said earlier, is we're also buying much more tightly going forward, which will also drive the stronger sell-throughs. ", "Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, Lorraine, for that concluding question. Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. As Mike noted, I'd now like to turn it back to Lew Frankfort for a few closing words. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you, Andrea. Obviously, we're in uncharted waters, Coach is and America is as well. We know our business well. We have a very strong franchise. We have a very excellent balance sheet. All of you know that we don't borrow. And when we talk about inventory being equivalent to currency and our ability to repurpose it, it's probably more true for Coach than any other company that I'm aware of. So we feel very comfortable with where we are. We will continue to manage cautiously and at the same time invest prudently. ", "And as I said earlier, our opportunities remain strong. We are the market leader. We will continue to build on that. And we do feel and believe strongly when the economy recovers we will be well situated to again achieve strong and profitable growth.", "Thank you and have a very good day, everybody.

As noted in our release we were pleased to generate sales that were essentially even with prior year and encouraged by the stabilization of our comparable store sales to pre-Christmas levels in North America.

And fifth, sales in Japan rose 1% in constant currency and 14% in dollars. ", "In addition we are continuing to generate very strong sales and comps in China where we just concluded the acquisition of our retail businesses on the mainland. ", "During the quarter we opened two North American retail stores, Youngstown, Ohio, a new market for Coach, and Temecula, California between LA and San Diego, as well as three factory stores. ", "We also closed two retail locations. In addition one retail store and one factory store were expanded. Thus at the end of the period there were 324 full price and 109 factory stores in operation in North America. ", "Moving to Japan, one location was added and one expanded. At quarter-end there were 161 total locations in Japan with 20 full price stores including eight flagships, 114 shop in shops, 22 factory stores, and five distributor operated locations. ", "In direct sales which for context represents less then 20% of Coach\u2019s sales on an annualized basis decreased 35% to $106 million from $162 million in the same period last year. This decline was primarily due to reduced shipments into US department stores. We continue to tightly manage inventories into the channel given lower demand with sales declining 30% for the quarter as discounting continued at high levels and Coach was generally excluded from these promotions.", "International retail sales rose modestly in the period driven by distribution while shipments also declined as we closely managed inventories in this channel as well. ", "We estimate that the addressable US handbag and accessory category declined 10% to 15% during the first quarter of calendar 2009. At the same time Coach\u2019s bag sales declined 2% across all channels in North America. ", "Our total revenues in North America were down 5% with our directly operated stores up 7% as distribution growth offset the negative comp performance. As noted, same store sales which were down 4% stabilized to pre-Black Friday levels. ", "On an aggregate basis the biggest difference from the holiday quarter trends was traffic which improved from 2Q comp levels in both channels. We would note that in full price stores our weak traffic pattern from the previous quarter improved while conversion and the average transaction size both declined modestly from prior year. ", "In factory where we continue to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing we continue to see solid increases in traffic and conversion while ticket was flat. It should me noted that month to date, April, comparable store sales are consistent with our third quarter experience after adjusting for the holiday shift.", "As noted, we posted a 1% gain in local currency in Japan and a 14% gain in dollars. Business in Japan continued to be fueled primarily by distribution through both new stores and expansions as our market share further expanded against a weakening category backdrop. ", "In fact preliminary estimates for calendar year 2008 suggest that Coach now holds a 14% share of the Japanese imported accessories market where our accessible, luxury proposition is resonating with a more independent, less status oriented Japanese consumer. ", "I also wanted to call out China which of course represents only a very small portion of our total sales today. I just visited the region the other week and was truly amazed by the rapid market development and how the Coach brand is taking hold with consumers both domestically and Mainland China and with millions of Chinese who are travelling notably to Hong Kong and globally. ", "We have been especially pleased with the transition of our first 10 locations in Hong Kong and Macau last September where we have seen a significant positive impact resulting from Coach\u2019s direct operation of these stores. Similarly we\u2019re looking forward to the seamless integration of the Mainland China locations which were just transitions on April 1st. ", "Our business performance in the region to date including double-digit comparable store sales growth demonstrates that Coach has significant potential with this emerging and very important consumer group. We have now built an on the ground team and deepened our insights into the Chinese consumer through substantive market research.", "This experience and market knowledge together with our financial strength, multiple distribution channels, and brand positioning provide a solid foundation for Coach\u2019s expansion in the Chinese market where the opportunity is large. In fact today, among target consumers in Mainland China, our brand awareness remains very undeveloped at only 6% on an unaided basis compared to 63% in Japan and 70% in the US.", "While Michael Devine will get into more details on our financials and of course I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap of the quarter and touch on some of the product initiatives.", "During the third quarter we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Beginning on December 26, we transitioned to spring with the introduction of the Penelope collection, offered in leather, our classic signature, and Op Art across multiple silhouettes, and anchored by our shoppers\u2019 style.", "This was followed by an updated heritage stripped group in February and the new Parker Collection in March. With its soft feminine pleats and twisted straps, Parker represents another significant design evolution for Coach. It was supported by our spring ad campaign and its two key styles, the shoulder bag and hippie, represented 12% of sales in March. ", "Earlier this month we introduced a collection of bags and accessories inspired by our Bonnie Cashin [archives]. While the whimsical prints and bright colors have captured the attention of many, the best selling styles are the convertible foldover bags offered in leather and signature. And this coming Friday, we\u2019ll compliment our assortment with the introduction of Cricket, a spectator carry all based item group in a broad range of colors.", "Cricket, along with our strong Madison collection updated in a beautiful spring pallet across multiple fabrications are the key statements for Mother\u2019s Day. ", "Perhaps most exciting in our upcoming product introductions is the Poppy collection, a new attitude for Coach arriving in July. Poppy is youthful in appeal offering a variety of fresh silhouettes, vibrant colors, and particularly accessible price points. A new Poppy logo is inspired by notebook graffiti and evokes a playful energy that rings throughout the collection. ", "And we just finalized the robust marketing plan to support the launch which will utilize several new elements for Coach, including social networking websites such as Facebook and fashion blogs to get the word out along with an interactive global online campaign entitled, Are You Poppy. ", "Moving to our stores, as you know we\u2019ve incorporated a discussion of new store performance as part of our quarterly recap for more then a year now, so I want to touch on these metrics. We opened 30 stores in the first nine months of FY09 and am pleased to note that they continue to perform well, essentially in line with pro forma volumes.", "These new stores are very profitable and operate at high levels of productivity. We also wish to note the planned closure of four retail stores which are underperforming. They include Greenwich, Connecticut, which closed on the last day of the quarter, along with Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, Green Valley Ranch and Henderson, Nevada, and Embarcadero, in downtown San Francisco. ", "These remaining stores will close by the end of June. ", "An important of strategic focus in FY10 is the price positioning of handbags and accessories. Building on our FY09 product initiatives we will rebalance our assortment within our current range by increasing the proportion of bags introduced at prices below $300. ", "Beginning in Q1 about 50% of our handbag choices, or about 70 SKUs in an average store will be at retails between $200 and $300, as compared to an average of 30% in FY09.", "This reweighting of our assortment will result in an average unit retail reduction in bags and accessories of 10% to 15% next year. ", "Our goal is to provide our consumer with more choices at prices she is willing to spend or is able to afford. We are exploiting this opportunity by designing into this price point, engineering collections that can provide this excellent value and still generate strong margins. ", "We believe this will drive our handbag penetrations higher, thereby improving mix, increasing average transaction size, and ultimately improving productivity. ", "As we\u2019ve discussed many times, we have two drivers of long-term growth. First is distribution as we expand our global network of store locations with an emphasis on North America and China, and second, is productivity which we drive across all geographies through the introduction of innovative and relevant product in a compelling store environment. ", "The current macroeconomic backdrop does not change our long-term focus, although we have sharpened our focus on distribution putting more emphasis on the largest opportunities both in North America and abroad. We will continue to build market share here in North America and grow our store base although at a slower pace in FY10 due to the challenging environment. ", "Given our strong productivity metrics and our brand proposition, we are a highly desirable tenant and as such have ample real estate opportunities to choose from. However, our primary focus is on restoring productivity to our existing full price store base. ", "Thus we are limiting our new North American retail store openings to 20 locations rather then the 40 we have opened for each of the last two years. In addition we\u2019ll focus on those store segments where we have seen the best relative performance, notably Canada with six openings planned for next year, and new US markets.", "A total of 13 of our new store openings for next year are targeted for new North American markets for Coach. In addition we have decided to suspend retail expansion activity. We have been slowing the pace of square footage growth in Japan given the economic environment by reducing the number of new openings and stemming expansion activity.", "In FY10 we expect to open a net of seven new locations while in FY09 we will open a net of five new locations. And as I\u2019ve mentioned we will continue to develop the emerging market potential particularly in China where we have seen excellent results as I\u2019ve mentioned too. In FY10 we expect to open about 10 new locations in China and looking further out over the next five years, we expect to open a total of over 50 new locations, aggressively growing our sales and market share in this rapidly expanding region. ", "In fact our market research indicates that by 2013 the China, Hong Kong, and Macau premium handbag and accessories market will likely exceed $2.5 billion, a significant increase from its current size of about $1.6 billion. ", "Our goal is to become one of the top three imported handbag and accessory brands with sales of over $250 million and a market share of at least 10% by fiscal 2013, up from about $50 million and 3% today. ", "With the investments we will make in stores, marketing, organization, and infrastructure, we are well positioned to replicate our success formula in Japan since taking control of the business there in 2001. ", "In addition to China, there are several other international growth markets that we will focus on over the next few years. In Asian markets such as Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, the Coach brand is among the top five brands with good headroom for further strong growth. ", "We also have made significant headway in The Middle East and expect continued strong performance. ", "Finally as we grow our brand awareness across new markets, global travelers will increasingly represent a significant growth opportunity for Coach. At about $4 billion in global sales for fashion and accessories, we believe we can double our share of the global travel retail market over the next three to five years both through new locations and improved productivity. ", "In FY10 we expect to open more then 30 new locations in what we call our international wholesale markets increasing our store base to about 190 locations. ", "In summary we\u2019re encouraged by the stabilization of our business and we remain unshakable in our resolve to not only weather this storm, but to emerge a stronger company for it. ", "At this time I will turn it over to Michael Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. ", "Michael Devine ", "Thank you Lew, Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies, let me know take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. ", "As mentioned our quarterly revenues declined 1% with direct to consumer which represents over 80% of our business, up 9%, and indirect down 35% primarily due to lower shipments to US department stores. ", "Excluding the impact of certain one-time items, which I will touch on in a moment, earnings per share for the quarter declined 17% to $0.38 as compared to $0.46 in the year ago period as net income totaled $123 million, down from $162 million. ", "On the same basis, our operating income declined 23% to $199 million in the third quarter versus $257 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 26.9% compared to 34.5%. ", "In the third quarter gross profit declined 6% to $525 million from $558 million a year ago and gross margin rate was 71% versus 75% in the prior year. As planned, we maintained a high level of promotional activity in factory stores which was the primary driver of our lower gross margin rate. Channel mix and the sharper pricing initiative in our full price divisions also dampened margins.", "We anticipate delivering similarly high rates of gross margin in the coming quarters. Adjusted for one-time charges, our SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales rose from prior year levels as expected, in the third quarter and represented 44.1% of sales, versus 40.5%. ", "As a result of our recent actions we believe our expense spending strikes the right balance between driving growth opportunities and operating efficiently while overall top line growth remains challenged. As mentioned in our press release during the quarter we recorded three one-time charges. These consisted of expenses related to the reduction of corporate staffing levels in the US, the planned closure of four North American retail stores, and the closure of the company\u2019s sample making facility in Italy. ", "Collectively, these actions increased the company\u2019s SG&A expense by $13 million in the period and negatively impacted earnings by $8 million after tax. The actions taken will help the balance of FY09 in a modest way and position us well for FY10. ", "Combined with other key measures previously implemented, such as the elimination of merit-based salary increase and a hiring freeze outside of critical growth areas, we now expect to capture over $50 million in total pre-tax savings next year.", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $358 million, up about 23% from prior year on a comparable basis. This compares favorably to the dollar inventory growth level of 39% reported at the end of Q2. On a unit basis inventory was up 10%. This differential reflects our higher average unit costs. Our inventory increase allows us to support 45 net new North American stores, 14 net new locations of Coach Japan from the year ago period, as well as our 27 Coach China stores. ", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $551 million as compared with $660 million a year ago. During third quarter we repurchased and retired 3.6 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $13.98, spending a total of $50 million. As of the end of the period $710 million was available under the current repurchase authorization. ", "Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $207 million compared to $85 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $180 million versus $52 million in the same period last year. ", "Our CapEx spending was $27 million versus $33 million in the same quarter a year ago. The main drivers for the year over year cash flow improvement are a near $60 million swing in timing of holiday receivable collections and substantially lower cash tax payments this year versus last.", "We currently anticipate CapEx in FY09 to come in at about $165 million excluding the purchase of our headquarters building earlier this year. That  is about $15 million lower then we projected at the end of the second quarter primarily due to the elimination of additional long-term payback initiatives as well as negotiated savings for ongoing projects. ", "Its important to note that based on our current plans for FY10 we would now expect the CapEx for next year will be down substantially and will be in the area of $110 million. ", "Before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to reiterate Lew\u2019s earlier comments, our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to navigate through the challenging environment. In addition the steps that we\u2019ve taken to reduce our expense structure will help position Coach to improve our profitability. ", "Thank you for your attention and now Lew, Andrea, and I will take some questions which will be followed by a brief summary by Lew. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Can you address the timing of your decision to initiate a dividend, why did you choose to do this today and I guess the second question that I have is, when you talk about the pricing strategy that you\u2019re undertaking, do you believe you\u2019ve found the appropriate level with the SKUs and the timing of it and is the part that you\u2019re talking about, is that the product that will be designed for those price points between $200 and $300?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Let me take your second question first, the answer is yes to both. We understand through our pilots and our consumer research that there is a sweet spot in $200 to $300 range that, where we have been under represented in the last year or two and it is that area which we\u2019re looking to distort by rebalancing our assortment and putting at least 50% of our SKUs in handbags at those price points and what we understand from consumers, in addition to great product they want exceptional value and they need to really feel when they pick up the product in addition to feeling great about it, that it represents a great value.", "From our testing and our experience we believe that that is the right place to be. In terms of our FY10 starting with Poppy, we have engineered our collections into these price points and we\u2019re excited to see Poppy\u2019s arrival at the end of June and we do believe its going to be a very successful introduction. ", "I might add one other thing, we\u2019re in the midst of a pilot with Poppy and its actually running at about 16% in pilot which we feel really good about because its one of the highest results we\u2019ve achieved in a pilot. ", "Getting to the timing of the dividend, we thought that there was no better time then during a period of great economic uncertainty to send a clear and strong signal to investors that our business model is healthy, vibrant, and we feel excellent about our prospects for the future. ", "Michael Devine ", "If I could just build on Lew\u2019s comment too for the financial modelers out there around the price points, because it may seem a bit counterintuitive, but this ultimately is designed to improve productivity. What we\u2019ve seen over recent quarters as the consumer spending has been challenged, is our handbag penetration has declined over time and as a result its negatively impacted average ticket.", "So this change is designed to drive handbag conversion, increasing penetration and although a lower average price for handbags, drive actually a higher ticket and productivity and improvement in operating income dollars into the stores.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "Kimberly Greenberger - Citigroup", "I was hoping you could talk to us about the SG&A savings and any sort of guidance you might have on the SG&A growth rate you expect in the fourth quarter given the addition of the China acquisitions and then if you could just comment on the nice improvement in your comp store sales here from the second quarter to the third quarter, was that driven more by a pick up in factory, retail, or equally between both channels.", "Michael Devine ", "I\u2019ll address the question on SG&A and kick it over to Lew to answer on the comp question, as you know we\u2019ve suspended giving specific guidance looking forward but in terms of our SG&A rate we feel very good about the actions that we\u2019ve taken. As we said in the prepared remarks, we believe the steps we\u2019ve taken will allow us to capture an additional $50 million SG&A reduction from our fixed overhead structure.", "Some of that will come back to us in Q4, no question, as the actions we\u2019re taking in this March-ending quarter. Not in as complete a way as you heard, three of the four stores are still open. We will close them by end of the year and we haven\u2019t completely closed the Italy facility as yet. That will be an activity that will continue to evolve through the quarter but also be complete by year end. ", "So, the impact for Q4 will be helpful but not nearly as impactful as what we\u2019d anticipate for next year, our FY10.", "Lew Frankfort ", "On the comp question as you know, we have an integrated business model where we look to use both channels in the most advantageous long-term way possible and we\u2019re quite different then other companies in that, [we\u2019ll] not go on sale in our full price stores and what we have done is use our factory stores as our diffusion channel to drive higher sales at considerably profitable levels. ", "What we experienced in this last quarter is a stabilization at pre-holiday levels and an improvement in our traffic levels in both channels. We don\u2019t wish to be more specific then that because we actually are able to shape the comp by individual actions in each of those channels but we approach it as an integrated business. ", "Michael Devine ", "Let me just also follow-up, I recall now you asked about Coach China and its impact, you may recall at the outset of the year we talked about China having about a $0.04 dilutive impact on FY09 as we built infrastructure in advance of capturing sales volumes, we\u2019re actually performing a little bit better then that but directionally, I think that\u2019s still a good number to build into models. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "", "The first question, if I look at your SG&A performance in the third quarter, the expense you leveraged was a little bit greater then I would have expected on a negative four comp, so I just wanted to drill into some detail, figure out what\u2019s going on in the expense line there and then second question, SG&A outlook for FY10, can you just give us a sense of what you\u2019re new leverage point for FY10 given the announced cost reductions of about $50 million. ", "Michael Devine ", "So to give you a little additional color on the quarter in the SG&A line, I think if you were to take a look at extracting the one-time events, if you were also to take out China that we just spoke to, take out our investment in our new merchandising initiatives, what we\u2019re looking at really is a SG&A rate for the quarter of under 43%, about 42.9 in that area, and so the deleveraging as you called it is much more modest when you look at it on that  basis. ", "So against a flat top line revenue essentially down I think a little more then half a point, to actually deliver SG&A within 250 basis points of the year ago quarter, we actually feel pretty good about. We\u2019re done, we\u2019re not there yet, as we\u2019ve talked about. We taken these steps, we continue to look at other opportunities and there are many that go beyond these three one-time actions in our blocking and tackling day to day. ", "We\u2019re negotiating hard with vendors. As I mentioned we\u2019ve taken our CapEx expectations down significantly. That will help us through the depreciation line. So there\u2019s a number of other opportunities in addition to these one-time events. We feel good about driving our leverage point down. You remember well we used to talk about having a mid to high teen top line growth to achieve SG&A leverage. I think you\u2019ll see us realize something significantly below that, both in Q4 but especially in FY10 and going forward. ", "Michelle Clark - Morgan Stanley", "And then just to follow-up the investment in new merchandising initiatives, how much longer is that going to continue.", "Michael Devine ", "We have some new collections in development. We plan to have those in our product offering into our foreseeable future. Its probably in an investment mode through FY10 and into FY11. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "", "I was just curious if you could give us an update on how handbags in the higher price point category are performing and what they are as a percentage of sales for the $400 and up bag and then [inaudible] factory and full price. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Handbags over $400 in this last quarter performed at the same penetration levels as they did the prior year representing about 12% of our total sales. The other question?", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "And then the customer base between factory and full price, has that remained constant even in this environment.", "Lew Frankfort ", "It has, we continue to see growth in factory coming from three places. First is existing factory store buyers purchasing more, existing households. Second are international travelers. And third are consumers who are new to our database. These are consumers who we consider first time users entering the franchise through factory. ", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "And then the promotions that you [inaudible] to your best factory consumers to try and get them to cross over to full price, are there any things you can share with us anecdotally on the success of that. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Let me answer it in a few different parts, first the people who are, the consumers who were primarily our factory store consumers appreciate a great buy so when we invite them to purchase at full price as a preferred customer, they respond extremely well. ", "We\u2019re measuring their willingness to then convert to a full price buyer without a special offering and we\u2019re finding that not that many are willing to do that. They\u2019re really looking for a great value. ", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "I guess that\u2019s why your overlap has remained very consistent over the years. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Its remained consistent. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets", "", "Kudos on managing through the quarter. Can you provide a little more color on the store closings which are in some of the most highly concentrated wealth markets in the world, just wondering how much and in what ways they were under performing and what does this say about the brand\u2019s possible relevance to the upscale consumer and then also if you could give us some guidance on the cost of goods line going forward especially as it relates to some of the decreases we\u2019re seeing in leather and raw material costs and deflation on other input costs. I\u2019m just wondering when we might start to see the benefits of that. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Okay, just for context we have a fleet, full price fleet, as you know more then 300 stores so these four locations represent just 1% of our stores. And you\u2019re correct, they are in the Greenwich Avenue and Worth Avenue, are in [inaudible] areas and the reality is that the rents are the highest in these areas as well. ", "What we have found is that in high street locations our performance has been most effected because of lower traffic and these stores are very expensive stores to operate and we decided that this was the right time to rationalize our approach to them and we took two location, Greenwich and Worth Avenue, when we decided it was time to leave those locations. ", "Michael Devine ", "In terms of gross margin rates, we also feel very good about delivering the 71% in the quarter while we were working through some of the inventory challenges and the progress we\u2019ve made there. You\u2019re absolutely right to call out some of the raw material costs actually working their way downward and our supply chain group headed by Angus [McRae] and others have worked very aggressively and we are going to capture those savings and they will be built into our FY10 product costs. ", "So that is the good news and we will need that good news to help us offset the more aggressive sharper pricing initiatives of Poppy and other collections that Lew spoke to. So I think you can anticipate to continue to see gross margin rates staying high in the level of 70% to 72% for the coming quarters. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Liz Dunn \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners ", "", "Liz Dunn \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners ", "", "I guess relative to store closures, are there other stores that are being considered for closure and then I just wanted to get some comments from you on your longer-term strategy as it relates to US department stores and growth or what you plan to do with your cash given the growth doesn\u2019t look\u2014", "Lew Frankfort ", "First, its actually coincidental to the timing of these closures for this quarter because every year in the spring, post-holiday, we go through a complete portfolio review of all of our locations and we have completed that review now for this year and we don\u2019t contemplate any additional closings during the course of the next year. And again the four closings represent just a little bit over 1% of our fleet. ", "Relative to our US department stores, they are important channel although for context they represent only about 10% of our sales and we do have a loyal Coach consumer who primarily shops in North American department stores. So we continue to see them as an important part of our franchise and we\u2019re looking for that business to stabilize once the promotional environment improves which I know the stores are working on today. ", "In terms of use of cash, Michael do you want to answer that. ", "Michael Devine ", "Sure, I think firstly I would start with the good news is that in spite of our challenges to the top line, we feel very good about the business\u2019 ability to generate significant free cash flow which is why as Lew mentioned at the outset we\u2019ve elected at this point to return additional capital to shareholders through a dividend program. ", "We also once again during the quarter bought back our stock at these accretive levels and as we mentioned we still have $710 million available to us under the buyback program. But first and foremost cash flow generation gives us the ability to continue to grow the business both domestically and with an increasing focus internationally. We stepped up this year and bought out our China distribution partner, so we could take control of that robust market and it was great to be able to have the free cash flow to be able to do that. ", "I think down the road we\u2019ll look for similar opportunities to drive top line and bottom line growth and we have the cash position to allow us to do so. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Just to build on the international part very briefly, we are an international company. We are not yet a global business and its evident by our successes in East Asia, The Middle East, and now early stages China, that the opportunities for us are abundant and we are looking to develop an entry strategy as well for western Europe starting with England and France and even though we\u2019re not in a position to be more specific then I am now, you can expect that these will be markets we will be entering in the next few years.", "Over [inaudible] we are enthusiastic about the opportunities outside North America and Asia and particularly because our concept as an accessible luxury brand resonates with consumers even more today then ever before. Consumers are looking for innovation, relevance, and value and as an alternative to the traditional luxury brands, there is no better choice then Coach.

", "Lew Frankfort ", "The only thing I can add there is that from a grand positioning perspective, our philosophy is to offer consumers an opportunity to purchase Coach in image enhancing environments where ever they choose to shop and department stores continue, as I said earlier, to be a viable channel and we continue to participate in that venue.

Should we, does that imply that deeper promotion in outlets and channel mix will be less of a concern in the next few months. ", "Michael Devine ", "Yes, I think that\u2019s a good assumption. We\u2019ll see that channel mix moderate and we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to also moderate as we move into FY10 the level of promotions in the factory channel and then the big helper of course we mentioned earlier, is the great work that our supply chain is doing to get our average costs down through lower cost materials and negotiating with our vendors, looking at everything, turning over all the rocks from shipping and logistics costs and squeezing a couple of pennies out here and there will of course be helpful at our volumes. ", "Erwan Rambourg \u2013 HSBC ", "I had just a little question on diversification because I\u2019m surprised you\u2019ve added beyond a fragrance a lot of different products now to the fragrance and cosmetic arena, will there be a time for you to launch more broadly beyond your own network in that area. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "We always think about opportunities to distribute our products through other channels and some day its very possible we will.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Can you talk a little bit about the decline in inventory you saw from last quarter, how much of it was driven by the clearance of excess full priced merchandise at the factory stores. Are you still on track with that mid to high teens inventory in dollar terms at the end of this fiscal year.", "Michael Devine ", "You\u2019re right on point with both of your questions. Yes, we were able in a meaningful way to re-purpose the full priced merchandise that we carried out of Q2 into the factory channel and we made a significant move in selling those units out through that division. ", "I\u2019ll also point out, the other metric as you know that we track is what percentage of what we sell at the register in the factory division is made for factory versus full price deletes and that metric did not move significantly year over year. We maintained a metric north of 60%, 62% I believe it was, 63% versus about a 65% last year so we\u2019re still able to accomplish that, work through the inventory and yes, we\u2019re feeling very good that we\u2019re on track to deliver a year end inventory level that\u2019s essentially flat in units. ", "So we\u2019re feeling good about how we\u2019re working the inventory issue.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Very well managed quarter. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "That will end the formal Q&A session, I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Lew Frankfort, our CEO, for some closing remarks. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Well first I\u2019ll thank you for participating with us and you can tell by our enthusiasm that we feel that we had a very good quarter and that it actually positions us well for this coming quarter that we\u2019re in now as well as in the years ahead.", "I just wanted to leave you with a few thoughts, first, we do have a distinctive multi channel model with a very diversified consumer base and you need to appreciate that in having this model we have an opportunity to flex our marketing and promotional activities through our factory channel while maintaining the vibrancy of our full priced channel. ", "The businesses work extremely well together and as most of you know we do not go on sale in our full price stores. Its one of our tenants, we look to give consumers an excellent value every day and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and I think next year they\u2019re going to think the value is even better.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO, and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO.", "Before we begin we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward looking statements including projections for our business in the current quarters and fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences or control costs. ", "Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our fourth fiscal quarter and annual 2009 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Mike Devine will continue with details on financial and operational results of the quarter and year. Following that we will hold a question and answer session where we will be joined by Mike Tucci, President North American Retail. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Lew will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman, and CEO.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "As noted in our release this morning we were once again pleased to generate sales that were essentially even with the prior year, and encouraged by the continued ability of our comparable store sales in North America through the first half of calendar 2009. Though still early days we are also encouraged by the improvement of our July full priced business notably in North America and Japan where we have seen strong consumer response to Poppy and our broadened assortment of handbags in the $200 to $300 range, supported by comprehensive new marketing programs.", "Our results for both the year and the quarter demonstrate the resiliency of the Coach model and our commitment to maintaining the integrity of our full price proposition in retail stores even in the face of an extraordinarily challenging environment. This performance also reflects the strength of our franchise and our flexibility in adapting to changing business conditions. This year we have taken the steps necessary to reduce our expense structure while also investing in growth areas such as China in order to position Coach for future profitable growth.", "Despite the economic backdrop and future uncertainty we remain confident in Coach\u2019s durability and growth prospects over our planning horizon. Clearly the opportunities both hear at home in North America and abroad notably in emerging markets remain abundant. While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our year and quarter first.", "Our performance in FY09 was highlighted by an increase of 2% in revenues. It was a year of many milestones including; first the opening of 42 total net new stores in North America, 33 net new retail stores and nine new factory stores. Second, direct to consumer sales rose 7% to $2.7 billion with a 5% increase in North American store sales, driven by distribution, while we also experienced rapid growth in China sales.", "Third, a solid DF for Coach Japan, retail sales there were essentially flat on a constant currency basis while dollar sales rose 11% against very weak category sales for imported bags and accessories. Coach strengthened it number two sales position in this market to about a 14% share this year. Fourth, we successfully completed the phased buyout of our retail businesses in China and saw increasing interest in the brand as the market continued to grow rapidly. Finally, we initiated a quarterly dividend, sending a clear message about our financial strength, cash flow generation, and business outlook.", "This annual performance was capped off by a solid fourth quarter. Some key metrics were first, net sales totaled $778 million versus $782 million a year ago, a slight decline of 1%. Second, earnings per share excluding unusual items totaled $0.43 compared with $0.50 in the prior year on the same basis. Third, direct to consumer sales rose 3% to $683 million from $662 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same store sales for the quarter remained stable from the third quarter, declining 6% from the prior year while total North American store sales rose 5% driven by distribution.", "Fifth, sales in Japan declined 4% in dollars and declined 10% on a constant currency basis as consumer spending contracted significantly during the period. Finally, we are continuing to generate very strong sales and comps in China.", "During the quarter we opened nine North American retail stores including four in new markets for Coach; Laredo, Texas, Capitola, California, Kennewick, Washington, and Boise, Idaho. We also closed three retail locations as previously announced. In addition, we opened three factory stores and closed one. Lastly, we expanded one retail store and four factory locations. At the end of the period there were 330 full priced and 111 factory stores in operation in North America.", "Moving to Japan, one location was added, two closed, and one was expanded. At quarter end there were 160 total locations in Japan with 20 stand alone full priced stores, including eight flagships, 113 shop in shops, 22 factory stores, and five distributor operated locations. Also, during the fourth quarter and as part of our Poppy marketing programs we opened two temporary stand alone Poppy locations in event spaces in key department stores. They were extremely successful and we expect to do more of these pop up locations going forward.", "Indirect sales which for context now represent just over 15% of Coach\u2019s sales on an annualized basis decreased 21% to $95 million from $119 million in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to reduced shipments into US department stores where sales declined about 30% for the quarter, essentially even with the prior quarter. Discounting continued at high levels throughout the period in department stores while Coach was generally excluded from these promotions. Naturally we continue to tightly manage inventories into the channel given lower demand.", "International retail sales declined modestly in the period as we continued to experience a bifurcation between locations catering to the domestic consumer, where we saw sales gains and those serving the international tourists which were impacted by the slowdown in travel, exacerbated by the Swine Flu epidemic.", "We estimate that the addressable US handbag and accessory category declined 10% to 15% during the first half of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach\u2019s bag sales declined 3% across all channels in North America over that six month period.", "Our total revenues in North America were essentially even with prior year in the quarter, with our directly operated stores up 5% as distribution growth offset the negative comp performance. As noted, Q4 same store sales were down 6% consistent with 3Q trends. In addition, our key comp metrics in the fourth quarter were also quite similar to 3Q. ", "Specifically, we would note that in full price stores traffic continued to be weak on the year over year basis, while conversion and average transaction size both declined modestly. In factory, where we continued to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing, we continued to see solid increases in traffic and conversion while ticket was flat.", "As noted, we posted a 10% decline in local currency in Japan and a 4% decrease in dollars. Business in Japan continued to be fueled primarily by distribution through new stores as our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. In fact, Coach now holds a 14% Yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. Our growth in share this year in the very tough Japanese market reflects the strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming more discerning and value oriented.", "I also wanted to call out China, which is only a very small portion of our total sales to date but represents a significant growth opportunity. As many of you know, this was the first quarter that we were directly operating all the China stores, having completed the acquisition of the mainland stores on April 1st. During the fourth quarter we continued to achieve significant double digit comp growth as the Coach brand is taking hold with increasing numbers of consumer, both domestically and mainland China and with many of the Chinese who are traveling to Hong Kong.", "Clearly, China is already becoming a significant market for imported brands that will grow rapidly over the next several years as personal income and consumer spending increase. We estimate that the market for imported handbags and accessories grew over 40% during the last year, while the number of target consumers in mainland China alone grew from six million to over eight million.", "To implement our growth strategy as announced in May, we\u2019ve appointed Andre Cohen to lead our on the ground team. Based in Hong Kong he now has responsibility for the strategic leadership and operating results of Coach China. Andre originally joined Coach International in early 2008 and has extensive prior experience in the region, building brands and businesses. His experience and market knowledge, together with our financial strength, brand positioning and consumer research; provide a solid foundation for Coach\u2019s expansion in the Chinese market.", "During the fourth quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Beginning in April we introduced a whimsical collection of bags and accessories inspired by our body, cash and archives, and in May we introduced Cricket, a spectator carry all based item group in a broad range of colors. ", "Cricket, along with our strong Madison collection, updated in a beautiful spring pallet across multiple fabrications for the key statements for Mother\u2019s Day and for June, Ali was our new group, focused on soft, drapy shoulder bags and hobos. Of course we continue to update our core collections during the spring including Parker with new colors and silhouettes.", "Clearly the big news at the end of the quarter was the introduction of the Poppy collection. Poppy is youthful in attitude and is proving to have broad customer appeal. Presented in a variety of new silhouettes, vibrant colors and prints, it offers great value with an average handbag price of about $260. Poppy\u2019s launch has been supported by comprehensive marketing campaign, \u201cAre you Poppy\u201d utilizing several elements in digital media, including stand along flash Poppy websites, email campaigns, Facebook fashion blogs and targeted online banner advertising to get the word out.", "The marketing and press around Poppy is clearly driving more traffic into our stores, resulting in a significant improvement in trends from the prior few quarters. Not surprisingly the impact of Poppy has been most significant in our direct to consumer channels, notably North American full price stores in Coach Japan, retail locations where we have made the largest investment in both product and marketing and are experiencing the largest returns.", "Our retail store environment is also where we are best able to merchandise Poppy as a lifestyle collection across all categories from footwear to jewelry to scarves, along with its handbags, wallets, and wristlets. Poppy will continue to be a key collection throughout FY10, regularly updated with new color pallets, fabrications and styles, such as the book tote coming for holiday.", "Of course I would be remiss not to mention Maggie, also introduced in July. This key handbag silhouette provides a more sophisticated counterpoint to Poppy. Maggie will evolve and continue to be important through the holiday season.", "Just last week we introduced two new handbag groups, Tribeca, a collection of East-West totes and Garnet, which focuses on satchel silhouettes. Both are offered at new core price points furthering our strategy to rebalance our handbag assortment, an important area of focus in this year.", "Starting with Poppy in our July product, we rebalanced our assortments within our current range by increasing the proportion of bags introduced at prices below $300 from about 30% of the assortment in FY09 to 50% in FY10. This rebalancing gives the consumer more choices at prices she is willing to spend or is able to afford. As you know, our plan is to exploit this opportunity by designing into this price point engineering collections that can provide excellent value and still generate excellent margins.", "Now that the rebalancing is in place we have begun to achieve the goals we set out for our North American full price business. These include higher handbag penetrations, now running at about 55% of sales versus 50% a year ago, or a 10% increase. As planned, this strengthening in merchandise mix favoring handbags has resulted in flat overall unit retails in our stores. ", "As noted, we have also seen an improvement in traffic trends for the very weak levels of the first half of the calendar year. We are encouraged that the execution of our strategies is resulting in a sequential improvement in retail store performance from Q4 levels.", "As we move to FY10 our primary focus will continue to be on restoring productivity to our existing full price store base. At the same time our July trends and the factory channel remain robust with strong consumer response to new made for factory product such as the pleated Soho collection. That said, it\u2019s also important to note that we manage our North American store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long term returns of both channels.", "Moving to our stores, we opened 39 new retail stores in FY09 and in aggregate they generated volumes of about $1.6 million, modestly below pro-formas of about $1.8 million. All of these stores are very profitable and operate at high levels of productivity. However, and perhaps most noteworthy, is that the 13 stores we opened in new markets for Coach, such as Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Modesto, California, actually outperformed their planned volumes, underscoring our plan to focus on new markets in FY10 openings.", "In addition, we saw excellent response to new stores in our developing Canadian markets as well, another area of focus this year which I will touch on more in just a minute.", "As we\u2019ve discussed many times, we have two drivers of long term growth. First is distribution as we expand our global network of store and shop locations with an emphasis on North America and China and second is productivity which we drive across all geographies through the introduction of innovative and relevant product in a compelling store environment.", "In FY09 our erosion and same store sales was more than offset by distribution growth. The current macro economic backdrop does not change our long term strategy though we have sharpened our focus on distribution putting more emphasis on the largest opportunities both in North America and abroad. We will continue to build market share here in North America and grow our store base, although at a slower pace this year due to the challenging environment.", "Given our strong productivity metrics and grand proposition we are a highly desirable tenant and as such have ample real estate opportunities to choose from. This year we\u2019re opening 20 North American retail stores rather than the 40 we\u2019ve opened for each of the last two years. In addition, as I mentioned, we will focus on those store segments where we have seen the best relative performance, notably Canada, with six openings planned for next year and new US markets. ", "A total of 14 of this year\u2019s stores are targeted for new North American markets for Coach. In addition, we will open at least six North American factory outlets. In total we expect North American square footage growth of about 9%, down from about 13% in FY09.", "We have also been slowing the pace of square footage growth in Japan given the economic environment, by reducing the number of new openings and stemming expansion activity. This year we expect to open about 10 new locations including a few Poppy locations next Spring. Further, we are developing plans to open the first few men\u2019s stand alone shops in Japan given that the stylish male shopper in this market is underserved in the accessories category. In total we would expect that square footage growth in Japan will increase by slightly less than 5% this year compared to about 8% in FY09.", "In China we now expect to open about 15 new locations this year up from the 10 forecast previously given our performance and the opportunity. Looking further out over the next five years we expect to open a total of at least 50 new locations, aggressively growing our sales and market share in this rapidly expanding region. ", "Our market research indicates that by 2013 that China, Hong Kong and Macau premium handbag and accessories market will likely exceed $2.5 billion, a significant increase from its current size of about $1.6 billion. With the investments we\u2019re making in stores, marketing, organization and infrastructure we are well positioned to replicate our success formula in Japan.", "In Asian markets such as Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, the Coach brand is among the top five brands with good headroom for further strong growth. We\u2019ve also made significant headway in the Middle East and expect continued strong performance. ", "Finally, as we grow our brand awareness across new markets, global travelers will increasingly represent a significant growth opportunity for Coach. At about $4 billion in global sales for fashion and accessories we believe we can double our share of the global travel retail market from about 4% today to around 8% during the next five years.", "Thus, across all geographies and channels we expect to grow our square footage by about 9% in FY10, modestly below the 11% distribution growth last year with the greatest moderation in our North American full price expansion.", "Finally, I would like to touch on the announcement of the Reed Krakoff label a new global brand which we intend to launch in the fall of calendar 2010. It will encompass all women\u2019s categories including ready to wear, handbags, women\u2019s accessories, footwear, and jewelry. We believe that this concept will serve to define the new American luxury and engage a different customer who is looking for exclusivity and limited distribution.", "While still in the development stage, the Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It will be a stand alone brand separate and apart from Coach while leveraging Coach\u2019s infrastructure. It will have a unique point of view in aesthetic, reflecting Reed\u2019s personal design philosophy. Initially, Reed Krakoff will be launched with a few boutiques in the US, Japan and Hong Kong as well as limited distribution in specialty stores.", "In closing, while our new fiscal year has just begun we are very encouraged by the early success of Poppy and our pricing strategy in this very tough environment. Accordingly, we will plan cautiously until we see concrete evidence of a change in consumer behavior. Irrespective of the backdrop we are confident that our proven growth strategies built upon or leadership position and diversified business model will continue to deliver excellent returns in the seasons ahead and over our long term planning horizon.", "At this time I will turn it over to Mike Devine our CFO for further details on our financials.", "Mike Devine", "Lew was just taking your through the highlights and strategies, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues declined just under 1%, with direct to consumer which represents nearly 85% of our business up 3% and indirect down 21% primarily due to lower shipments to US department stores.", "Excluding the impact of certain unusual items which I will touch on in a moment, net income for the quarter totaled $136 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.43. This compared to net income of $172 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.50 in the prior years fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year earnings per share were $1.91 as compared to $2.06, while net income totaled $622 million versus net income of $742 million recorded in FY08.", "On the same basis our operating income totaled $220 million, below the $281 million reported last year, while operating margin was 28.2% versus 35.9%. For the full fiscal year operating income was $1 billion even, a 15% decrease from $1.18 billion generated a year ago. Operating margin for the year was 31% flat as compared to 37.1% a year ago.", "During the quarter gross profit totaled $547 million versus $593 million a year ago. Gross margin rate which met our expectations was 70.4% versus 75.9% a year ago. As planned, we maintained the high level of promotional activity in factory stores which was the primary driver of our lower gross margin rate year on year. ", "Channel mix and the sharper pricing initiative in our full price divisions also dampened margin. We anticipate delivering similarly high rates of gross margin in the coming quarters. For the full year gross profit declined 4% to $2.32 billion from $2.41 billion a year ago. Gross margin rate was 71.9% FY09 versus 75.7% posted in FY08. ", "Again, excluding the unusual items in FY09 and FY08\u2019s fourth quarters SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 42.1% compared to the 40% flat reported in the year ago quarter. For the fiscal year on the same basis SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 40.9% compared to 38.6% reported in FY08.", "As the result of our recent profitability initiatives we believe our expense spending strike the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating our core businesses efficiently.", "As mentioned in our press release we recorded unusual items resulting in a substantially lower tax rate of 29.5% for the fourth quarter. These consisted of a favorable settlement of a multi-year tax return examination which decreased Coach\u2019s provision for taxes by $9 million as well as certain other tax accounting adjustments. These items also increased net interest income by $2 million. In addition, as a result of this favorable tax settlement we made a contribution to our charitable foundation which increased expenses by $15 million pre-tax or $9 million after tax.", "As you may remember, in the third quarter, we had announced a one time net charge related to the reduction of corporate staffing levels in the US, the closure of four North American retail stores, and the closure of our sample making facility in Italy. In aggregate these actions increased the company\u2019s Q3 SG&A expenses by $13 million.", "Including the impact of the unusual items in all periods net income totaled $146 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the current quarter and $214 million or $0.62 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, net income totaled $623 million for 2009 as compared to $783 million in 2008, while earnings per diluted share was $1.91 compared to $2.17.", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $326 million essentially even in both dollars and units with prior year on a comparable basis. This is consistent with management\u2019s second half expectations as we have worked through all of the excess inventory from calendar year end. This flat inventory level allows us to support 42 net new North American stores, six net new locations in Coach Japan from the year ago period, as well as our 28 Coach China stores.", "Cash and short term investments stood at $800 million as compared with $699 million a year ago. During the fourth quarter we did not repurchase any of our own shares thus $710 million is still available under the current repurchase authorization. Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $270 million compared to $323 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $245 million versus $268 million in the same period last year. ", "Our CapEx spending was $26 million versus $55 million in the same quarter a year ago. For all of fiscal year 2009 net cash from operating activities was $809 million compared to $923 million a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year \u201909 was in inflow of $569 million which included the $103 million purchase of our corporate headquarters building here in New York City, versus $749 million in fiscal year \u201908. ", "CapEx spending totaled $240 million for the year, also including the cash outlay for the headquarters purchase as well as for new stores and technology and corporate infrastructure investments. This compared to $175 million spent for CapEx last year. As you know, we did eliminate certain long term payback initiatives this year as well as benefited from negotiated savings for ongoing projects. It\u2019s important to note that based on our current plans for FY10 we would expect that CapEx for next year will be down further and will be in the area of $110 million.", "While as you well know we are not giving specific guidance for FY10 I believe it would be helpful for some of your modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when we\u2019re looking at the new year. First, as we mentioned on our third quarter call our gross margin is likely to stay in the 70% to 72% area over the next few quarters. ", "We noted previously that our cost cutting actions will net at least $50 million in SG&A savings in FY10; however, it will still be an investment year for Coach in terms of China and our new business Reed Krakoff. Taken together they will impact FY10 earnings per share by about $0.05 or about the same amount as they did in FY09. Finally, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 37% for the year.", "Before we open it up to Q&A I want to reiterate Lew\u2019s earlier comments. Our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results demonstrate Coach\u2019s strength, our resiliency and the flexibility and balance our diversified operating model provides in challenging times such as these.", "Thank you all for your attention and now Lew, Andrea, Mike Tucci and I will be happy to take some questions which will then be followed by a brief summary by Lew. Thank you all for joining us on the call today and we\u2019ll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "The questions that I have all stem around the top line as you look at the business. The comment that you made around Poppy in July, can you maybe expand upon just how dramatic there was an improvement during the month of July. The second part of that would be can you just talk about in the factory channel the email promotions to factory consumers and how sustainable you think the factory channel is.", "Lew Frankfort", "What we are saying here at Coach is that Poppy created a positive inflection point for Coach in our North America full price stores and Japan. When we talk about an inflection point it is significant, we\u2019d rather not be specific of course because it\u2019s early days, its four or five weeks and we have a long view. What it does do is reinforce our new pricing strategy to rebalance our assortment as well as the opportunity come out with a broad new lifestyle collection that is youthful in attitude yet appeals to our broad and diversified consumer base.", "With regard to factory our business continues to be very robust and we feel very confident that we can continue to grow our factory base because we have a very strong consumer who is brand loyal but is looking to buy Coach on a sale. Its effectively a diffusion channel, we do not go on sale in our full price stores so we force the consumer who want to buy Coach and get a full array assortment of Coach, although last year\u2019s product or product made exclusively for factory to go to the factory channel. Its works very well.", "In terms of emails, what I can say is that it\u2019s a marketing lever for us we\u2019re very enthusiastic about our ability to draw into factory stores consumers who are exclusive factory shoppers and they do respond to price. Again, we do not go on sale in our full price stores.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "Do you have something following Poppy that you think can sustain the momentum that you\u2019re seeing here in July? I know the Poppy collection will live in the stores or do you think it\u2019s that the improvement in full price is really driven by the new pricing strategy and the collections that follow also have that lower price point of view.", "Mike Tucci", "I think what we see is Poppy is a nice catalyst for us. It\u2019s created a platform, an energy in the stores; certainly the response has been terrific to the product assortment and the marketing. It\u2019s really part of a much more broad strategy across the board and specifically targeted at building handbags, conversion and penetration in our stores.", "Interestingly we just release Tribeca and Garnet and these are two, what I would categorize as core groups within the mix, again priced against our new strategy and we\u2019re seeing very strong results with those two groups over the weekend. Again, targeting price points that have been traditionally very strong for Coach $268, $298, $328, and $358 to build this presence.", "What we feel strongly about going forward is sustaining momentum in Poppy and building the foundation at $300 for the long term. You\u2019re seeing us very quickly react to what\u2019s going on in Poppy by flexing our on order, moving goods through the pipeline. We don\u2019t see it as a specific reorder business but we do see it as a newness and excitement business. We\u2019re reinvesting in 10-1 and 11-1 in our pipeline today and we\u2019ll turn those products around very quickly.", "What I think is also important to note, the marketing and positioning campaign both in traditional print and digital media as well as our in store presence you\u2019ll see us replicate that again specifically in Q2 with a strong Poppy message and a very broad gifting message. I believe it\u2019s just the beginning of what we\u2019re doing and use Poppy as kind of a benchmark for how we\u2019ll launch products going forward.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "On gross margin, could you help us understand the sort of relative weight of the three different contributing factors to the gross margin pressure here in the fourth quarter?", "Mike Devine", "Of the more than 500 basis points of year over year decline, slightly more than half of that is going to be driven by the increased level of factory promotions. I would say the remaining let\u2019s call it half is roughly split between channel mix and sure margins on the sharper price product in the full price divisions. Let me quickly say, however, that since that time and since the product had sold through in Q4 in the full price divisions our supply chain, our merchandising and design teams, everyone involved here in getting product into the stores, has done a magnificent job to work on the full price sharper price selections to move the gross margin rates back to longer term more acceptable Coach levels.", "With the state of the world the way it is today and the receptiveness of our suppliers, etc. I\u2019m happy to say as an example the Poppy collection has a gross margin rate that is quite consistent with the balance of the full store chain. I do think that there is some opportunity in that third metric that caused the fourth quarter decline as we move into the fiscal year.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "You were not seeing any of the deflationary trends benefit the fourth quarter but they should start in first quarter?", "Mike Devine", "Correct. The product that we\u2019re selling through in the stores now is showing in the full price collections that are \u201csharply priced\u201d generating higher gross margin rates then what we had in Q4.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Schick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "David Schick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "On China, what\u2019s really selling there, you talked about the big comps? How is the brand positioned there, is it similar to Japan or how should we think about that?", "Lew Frankfort", "What\u2019s selling well in China is what\u2019s selling well worldwide. Poppy is doing extremely well as are our other ranges. We are positioned similarly in China as an acceptable luxury brand, targeting the growing middle class professional female who is looking for great product that is relevant to her lifestyle at an excellent value. What we\u2019re finding is that our business and product is resonating very well with the emerging middle class in China.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "With Poppy, could you just share with us, is it attracting the younger customer that you were hoping it to attract? I know it has broad appeal but are you seeing addition of new customers?", "Mike Tucci", "I think Poppy is absolutely appealing to a younger consumer as part of the story. I say that because we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time in our stores working with the consumer, watching her and we\u2019ve also been spending an enormous amount of time online dialoguing with the consumer through some of the social media sites, Facebook as an example. She\u2019s very engaged, she\u2019s excited. That\u2019s not the total story though; Poppy has a strong foundation of product that appeals to a very broad range of Coach consumers. ", "That\u2019s really important, we have hallmarks in Poppy like classic signature, pop art, very important trim details, and things like our turn lock that we\u2019ve given a new sort of energy to. That rings truth through the entire collection; I think it offers us an opportunity to speak to the Coach audience in a very powerful way. We\u2019re pleased with the consumer response and we also believe that part of our traffic improvement is really excitement around Poppy and what it brings to the brand and what it brings to the store from an environment standpoint.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "Could you share with us how same store sales trends progressed during the quarter? I would assume that June, even though it was just the last part of June, that June showed a bigger improvement over April and May trends?", "Mike Tucci", "Actually to be clear, Poppy hit on literally the last Friday of June so I wouldn\u2019t attribute June\u2019s performance as anything that happened with Poppy.", "Mike Devine", "We had two days in the quarter.", "Mike Tucci", "We did spend a lot of time in June setting Poppy up in terms of launch activity and marketing activity but the true impact of Poppy is coming with the July floor set.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "What about quarterly trends for same store sales?", "Mike Tucci", "Quarterly trend for us was very consistent throughout the quarter. We didn\u2019t see a lot of wavering there. It really held in both full price and factory our trends held very consistent throughout the quarter and consistent with what we saw in Q3.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Liz Dunn \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Liz Dunn \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "A follow up on the question surrounding the improvement related to Poppy. You saw traffic improvement, was there also a conversion improvement? Can you talk us through some of the gives and takes around increasing handbag penetration but at lower prices? Will the net effect of that have sort of a neutral impact on transaction value or how should we think about that?", "Mike Tucci", "You actually answered your question within your question. It absolutely what the goal has been for us. The broadest goal for us is to improve productivity in our full price stores. Behind that is an object to drive handbag penetration in our stores and drive handbag conversion that\u2019s our brand hallmark, that\u2019s the foundation of the brand.", "What we\u2019re seeing is handbag penetration improving, unit sales in handbags from a run rate standpoint improving which has a virtuous positive impact on average dollar transactions. As the handbag becomes a greater portion of our overall transaction it helps us to drive productivity and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. I think what we want to build on is an improvement in visitation in our stores, work with that consumer, develop the relationship with her and then ultimately as we improve conversion we think that that is a driver of restoring productivity in our stores as well.", "Liz Dunn \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Will you continue to have many of these events like you\u2019ve been having for Poppy?", "Mike Tucci", "We will. We\u2019ll continue to focus on things like preview events. We will also use very dynamic web marketing to drive events in store, things like pre-sell, some of the gift with purchase ideas, we\u2019re absolutely committed to that and we will fund that going forward.", "I don\u2019t want to totally dodge your conversion question, it is early but I would say that what we\u2019re happy with is a sequential improvement in conversion performance. That\u2019s important for us to continue to monitor and as you know an important driver of comp.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Congratulations on the improvement and traction you\u2019re seeing, I was in Tokyo just a few weeks ago and I saw the excitement from the Poppy collection. What are you seeing the impact of Poppy in other channels, wholesale, online, and do you see Poppy at all going into factory and as you get leaner in inventory at factory do you keep factory excited with other merchandise, how do you see that trending?", "Lew Frankfort", "To answer the second part of your question first, we don\u2019t have any plans in the foreseeable future to put Poppy into our factory stores, it will stay out of factor stores indefinitely. We see it as a sub-gram, as I mentioned earlier and you were in Japan and you saw the excitement there, we are going to be opening Poppy stores in Japan and possibly here in the United States as well at some point. As we experience more we\u2019ll fine tune our strategies and refine our thinking.", "With regard to other channels, we\u2019re finding that Poppy is doing extremely well. In wholesale channels we tend to measure performance by sell through rates weekly and what we\u2019re finding is that Poppy is selling through at two to three times the rate that prior collections last quarter sold through. Everyone wants more Poppy and we\u2019re developing a rapid response program to get back into Poppy everywhere. In Japan we have a robust backorder program, similarly in the US we\u2019re developing one and we think Poppy will be a continuing success story throughout the entire fiscal year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen", "Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen", "Looking at your comments on SG&A expense this year and that they\u2019ll be $50 million flow through of savings offset by some investments. If I run that investment through the numbers you gave it seems like you still have an opportunity for SG&A improvement but I know you\u2019re investing in marketing and other things. Do you think it\u2019s possible you can actually take SG&A expense down year on year in fiscal 2010?", "Mike Devine", "With our conservative planning and where we are right now we don\u2019t see that happening. We have made major strides though, I have to say, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the way the business is operating in these challenging times. Perhaps the most exciting work really has been done in the field and in the selling teams where we actually have seen us move the needle significantly on the leverage point required for our SG&A line.", "As an example, if you followed us for some time you may recall that we used to talk about North American retail store chains needing about 5% to 7% comp to deliver SG&A leverage to their own P&L. With the fabulous work that\u2019s been done there largely around labor management, the great rent negotiations that we\u2019ve had, the great new deals we\u2019re booking on the new stores that we\u2019re opening and just the fact that we challenged every line item on the store P&Ls. I think that we will see moving into FY10 that we can deliver leverage to the retail P&L which is roughly a flat comp. Real, real progress has been made.", "Similar things happening in Japan where the cost cutting and expense spending review is fantastic so real, real progress has been made. None the less, with the investment that we\u2019re making in new stores and the investment in China and Reed Krakoff its unlikely that we\u2019ll get to a flat SG&A number next year but we\u2019re going to continue to work hard and see what we can bring home.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Rick Battell] \u2013 BAS-ML", "[Rick Battell] \u2013 BAS-ML", "Can you just update us on how your sourcing relationships are changing? Do you plan on sticking with the countries and vendors you\u2019ve been working with or do you plan to seek lower cost options?", "Lew Frankfort", "We have a broad constellation of partners that constitute our sourcing base and many of them who are entrepreneurial actually have migrated with us to lower cost areas. While we always look for new partners to work with we do have a very broad and diversified group of our suppliers who are working with us to establish significant capabilities in our Vietnam, India, and other parts of China where costs are lower. The key is to maintain quality and so we put as a premium those people who we have worked with in the past who understand the Coach way and our requirements.", "[Rick Battell] \u2013 BAS-ML", "Can you update us on your inventory plans going forward? Perhaps are you thinking about inventories both on a dollar and unit basis as you prepare for the holiday season?", "Mike Devine", "We\u2019re very pleased with the way the second half of fiscal year \u201909 ended. We\u2019re able to manage the inventory flat on a year over year basis with significantly higher store base in North America, Japan and of course we took over the 28 stores in China. To get flat on dollars and units versus where we were coming out of December was a real accomplishment for the team.", "We\u2019ve gone into FY10 with a conservative approach against this very challenging macro economic backdrop but we are in a position now of looking at chasing, its something we as an organization did exceptionally well over the year as we changed comp as the business was so strong in the past that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll look forward to doing again. We have Jerry Stritzke, our COO and Angus McRae the head of our supply chain looking at and working very hard against that initiative.", "As Mike talked about earlier we\u2019re looking to get back into Poppy in a bigger way by October and again in February. I think we\u2019ll continue to see very, very good inventory metrics as we go through FY10.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "As it is now 9:29 am I\u2019m going to thank everyone for joining us today and I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Lew for some closing words.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you everybody. The big story of course is Poppy, as evidenced by your comments. Really the larger story is the rebalancing of our assortment to bring great product to consumers at much more compelling prices to address a consumer who is more cautious and reluctant to spend. We\u2019ve been working on this strategy for the last nine to 12 months and it\u2019s exciting for us to actually bring product into the market and see the early results which are in keeping with our expectations. We shared with your previously that it\u2019s our intention to emerge stronger from the adversity we\u2019re experiencing and we\u2019re committed to doing that.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO, and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. Mike Tucci, President of North American Retail, is also joining us.", "Before we begin we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward looking statements including projections for our business in the current and future quarters and fiscal year. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences or control costs. Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our fiscal quarter 2010 results and will discuss our strategies going forward. Mike Tucci will review our key initiatives for the holiday season. Mike Devine will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter. Following that we will hold a question and answer session that will end shortly before 9:00 a.m. Lew will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "Now I would like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman, and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks Andrea and welcome everyone. As noted in our press release we were pleased to generate quarter sales of slightly above prior year and encouraged by the sequential improvement of our comparable store sales in North America. We experienced strong consumer response to Poppy, supported at its launch by comprehensive new marketing programs. In addition our results reflected the positive impact of our new pricing strategy as we broadened the assortment of handbags in the $200-300 range.", "Throughout the quarter customers responded well to our innovative, relevant products offered at price points that were particularly compelling. Beyond the top line we were also pleased with our high level profitability and substantial cash generation in Q1 as we continued to invest in our growth initiatives. Despite the economic backdrop and future uncertainties we remain confident in Coach\u2019s durability and growth prospects over our planning horizon. Clearly the opportunities both in North America and abroad, notably in emerging markets are abundant.", "While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights from our first fiscal quarter were:", "First, net sales totaled $761 million versus $753 million a year ago, an increase of 1%. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.44, even with prior year. Third, directed consumer sales rose 10% to $654 million from $592 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same store sales for the quarter improved sequentially from the fourth quarter, declining 1% from prior year while total North American store sales rose 8% driven by distribution. Fifth, sales in Japan rose 11% in dollars and declined 3% on a constant currency basis as consumer spending remained very weak. Finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double digit comps in China.", "During the quarter we opened 10 North American retail stores including 8 in new markets for Coach. Pensacola, Florida; Midland and Tyler, Texas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Madison, Wisconsin; Charlottesville, Virginia and Kitchener and New Market, both in Ontario, Canada. In addition, we opened five factory stores. At the end of the period there were 340 full price and 116 factory stores in operation in North America.", "Moving to Japan, two locations were added during the quarter. At quarter end there were 162 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone, full price stores including 8 flagships, 114 shop in shops, 23 factory stores and 5 distributor operated locations. Indirect sales which for context now represent about 15% of Coach\u2019s sales on an annualized basis decreased 33% to $180 million from $160 million in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to reduced shipments into U.S. department stores where sales declined nearly 30% for the quarter, similar to the first half of the calendar year.", "Discounting continued at a high level throughout the period while Coach was generally excluded from these promotions. It should be noted, however, that we did see an improving trend over the quarter and overall better full price sell through on lower and cleaner inventory levels. Naturally we will continue to tightly manage inventory into the channel given lower demand.", "International retail sales rose in the period driven by both comparable location sales and distribution growth. We continued to experience better performance in locations catering to the domestic shopper where we saw significant sales gains than in those locations serving the international tourists where sales rose more modestly. The international domestic consumer represents a sizeable growth opportunity as Coach\u2019s global awareness and presence increases.", "We estimate that the addressable, U.S. handbag and accessory category declined 5-10% last quarter, an improvement over the 10-15% decline experienced in the first half of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach\u2019s bag sales declined 1% across all channels in North America over the most recent quarter. It is worth noting we have seen a significant improvement in our customer\u2019s outlook for the economy and intention to purchase over the next year.", "Our total revenues in North America were essentially even with prior year in the quarter, with our directly operated stores up 8% as distribution growth offset the slightly negative comp performance. As noted, Q1 same store sales were down 1% showing sequential improvement from last quarter. Fueling this trend was better traffic and transaction size comparisons from 4Q. Average transaction size in full price was only slightly lower compared to prior year as increased handbag penetration offset lower average unit retail in handbags.", "In factory, where we continued to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing, we saw increases in traffic and tickets while conversion levels were maintained. It is important to note that our factory store growth continues to be driven by increased spending of factory channel, loyal Coach shoppers. We have seen no increase in cross channel behaviors.", "As noted, in Japan we posted an 11% increase in dollars on a 3% decline in constant currency, a sequential improvement from fourth quarter levels. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 14% Yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. Our growth in share in the very tough Japanese market reflects the strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming more discerning and value oriented.", "Once again, I want to call out China, which is only a very small portion of our total sales to date but is growing rapidly and represents a significant opportunity for Coach. We estimate that the market for imported bags and accessories in China grew by 40% over the last year. During the first quarter we continued to achieve significant double digit comp growth as the Coach brand is taking hold with increasing numbers of consumers, both domestically and mainland China and with many of the Chinese who are traveling to Hong Kong. Our blend of New York fashion and accessible price points is resonating with Chinese shoppers. Coach\u2019s potential in the China market is reflected in our very low, unaided brand awareness at 8% compared to 72% in the U.S. and 63% in Japan among targeted consumers.", "Similar to our approach in the U.S. and Japan we are building a multi-channel distribution model in China including stand alone stores, shop in shops, department store and factory store locations as the factory outlet market begins to develop. During the last quarter we added five new stores on the mainland, bringing our total Coach China store count to 33 including Hong Kong and Macao.", "We are also pleased to announce our first flagship location on the mainland scheduled to open next spring in Shanghai. The 7,000 square foot store will reflect Coach\u2019s latest flagship designs. While Mike Devine will get into more details on our financials and of course I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I did want to give you this recap. Mike Tucci as you know has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?", "Mike Tucci ", "Thanks Lew and good morning. During the first quarter as always we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Clearly the big news in July was Poppy. While Poppy is youthful in attitude, it proved to have broad customer appeal. Presented in a variety of silhouettes and vibrant colors and prints, Poppy offers great value with an average handbag price of about $240. The launch was supported by a comprehensive marketing campaign, utilizing several elements in digital media, including stand alone, flash Poppy websites, email campaigns, Facebook, fashion blogs and targeted online banner to get the word out.", "The compelling Poppy assortment combined with marketing and press around it drove more traffic into our stores, resulting in a significant improvement in trends from the past few quarters. Poppy will continue to be a key collection throughout FY10, regularly updated with new colors, prints, fabrications and silhouettes.", "It is also important to note that Poppy was not the only story in Q1. Maggie, a key item concept, was also introduced in July, providing a more sophisticated counterpoint to Poppy. Maggie has evolved and will continue to be important throughout the holiday season as the anchor to our Madison collection. In addition, the product launches that followed over the quarter such as [Trifecta], Garnet and Brook were also well received and further supported our overall handbag rebalancing strategy.", "Earlier this month we started flowing in our holiday assortment including a pre-launch of the Madison collection and the introduction of new Poppy styles and fabrics. The initial reception has been excellent. You will continue to see a high level of newness over the next few months with updates to Brook and Garnet and a new tote group, Alex, for December. We are also excited about our gifting program highlighted by two new women\u2019s accessories groups, Waverly and Gramercy, which will work across all of our handbag offerings and colorful, fun, Poppy items offered at great price points under $100.", "In addition, our holiday products will be supported by a significant investment in marketing building on the successful elements from our Poppy launch this summer. We will execute a targeted strategy beginning in mid-November to highlight a powerful gifting message for the holiday shopping season. Our primary focus will be to leverage Coach.com, digital meetings and compelling prints and in-store marketing to drive traffic.", "While great products supported by creative marketing has and will continue to be key in driving productivity, the consumer is also responding to our new pricing strategy. Starting with Poppy in July we rebalanced our assortment within our current range by increasing the proportion of handbags to prices below $300 from about 30% of the assortment in FY09 to 50% this year. As we have said before, this rebalancing gives the consumer more choices at prices she is willing to pay or is able to afford. As you know, we are designing into this price point, engineering collections that can provide this excellent value and still generate excellent margins.", "Now that this rebalancing is in place, we have begun to achieve the goals we set out for our North American full price business. These include higher handbag penetrations, now running at about 57% of sales versus 52% a year ago or a 10% increase. As planned, this improvement in merchandise mix favoring handbags has resulted in essentially flat overall average unit retails in our stores. Additionally, we saw an improvement in traffic trends from the very weak levels of the first half of the calendar year.", "The execution of our strategies resulted in a sequential improvement in retail store performance from Q4 levels. As we move through FY10 our primary focus will continue to be on restoring productivity to our existing full price store base. At the same time, our results in the factor channel remain robust. Here we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative, factory exclusive products combined with in-store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best factory consumers.", "It is also important to note that we managed our North American store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels while maintaining the integrity of our full price proposition in retail stores.", "Moving to our stores, as Lew mentioned we opened 10 new retail stores in Q1 and on average they are generating annualized volumes of about $1.6 million. All of the new stores are very profitable and operate at high levels of productivity. As discussed, our FY10 emphasis is on new markets for Coach.", "I also want to mention we are beginning to explore broader men\u2019s opportunities for the brand both in North America and globally. We will be opening our first men\u2019s stand alone store this spring adjacent to our Bleecker Street store here in New York. We view this concept as a laboratory where we can pilot emerging men\u2019s collections and evolve our merchandising [practice]. Ultimately we will use these learning\u2019s to help refine our global, long-term men\u2019s growth strategy.", "With that I will turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our overarching strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Thanks Mike. Setting the course for the new normal does not change our long-term strategy although we have sharpened our focus on distribution putting more emphasis on international growth, especially China. At the same time, we are continuing to build market share here in North America and grow our store base although at a slower pace due to the environment.", "As you know, in FY10 we are opening 20 North American retail stores rather than the 40 we have opened in each of the last two years. In addition, we are focusing on those store segments where we have seen the best relative performance, notably Canada, with six openings planned for this year in new U.S. markets. A total of 14 of this year\u2019s stores are targeted for the New York American market for Coach including the eight new markets opened in Q1. In total we expect North American square footage growth of about 9%, down from 13% last year.", "In China we expect to open about 15 new locations for this year compared with four net new locations opened last year. To support future growth as mentioned in our press release, we will also open our first Asia Distribution Center in Shanghai before the end of the fiscal year, allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region. With the investments we are making in stores, marketing, organization and infrastructure, we are positioning ourselves to replicate our success in Japan.", "Moving on to Japan, this year we expect to open about 10 new locations including a few Poppy shops. In addition we will be opening our first new exclusive men\u2019s locations next spring. In total, we expect square footage in Japan will increase by 5% this year compared to 8% last year. This year we plan to open more than 30 new locations in what we call our international wholesale business. In Asian markets such as Korea, Taiwan and Singapore Coach is among the top five brands with significant potential for further strong growth.", "We have also made considerable headway in the Middle East and expect continued robust performance. Finally, as we grow our brand awareness across new markets, global travelers will increasingly represent a growth opportunity for Coach. At about $4 billion in global sales for fashion and accessories, we believe we can double our share of the global travel retail market from about 4% today to around 8% during our next 4-5 years.", "Thus, with all geographies and channels we plan to grow our square footage by 9% this year, modestly below the 11% growth last year primarily due to opening fewer new stores in North America.", "In summary, naturally we are feeling very good about the early success of our FY10 initiatives noting the sequential improvement in our key store productivity metrics in North America and increased handbag penetration which bodes well for Coach. Our [inaudible] results have shown the continuation of the strengthening trends that we saw in Q1 with the consumer responding well to innovation such as our updates to Madison and Poppy at a wide range of price points.", "In addition, as Mike Tucci, we are well positioned for the holiday season with a broad range of great products at particularly compelling prices. At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Mike?", "Mike Devine ", "Thank you Lew. Good morning everyone. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the financial details of our first quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased about 1% with direct consumer, which represents about 85% of our business, up 10% and indirect down 33% primarily due to lower shipments to U.S. department stores.", "Net income during the quarter totaled $141 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.44. This compares to net income of $146 million and earnings per diluted share also of $0.44 in the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Our operating income totaled $223 million below the $233 million last year while operating margin was 29.3% versus 31% even.", "We are pleased with these results and our continued high levels of profitability. During the quarter gross profit totaled $550 million versus $558 million a year ago. Our gross margin rate was 72.3% versus 74.2% a year ago. The year-over-year change in rate was a function of promotional activity in factory stores and channel mix with the [store opening] benefits offsetting the impact of sharper pricing.", "We are particularly pleased with our expense ratio in Q1 as SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 42.9% compared to 43.1% reported in the year-ago quarter a 20 basis point improvement. As a result of the profitability initiatives put into place over the last few quarters we believe our expense spending strikes the right balance between driving for future growth opportunities and operating our core businesses efficiently.", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $338 million, 16% below the $402 million reported at the end of last year\u2019s Q1 and essentially even on a two-year basis. This inventory level allows us to support 35 net new North America stores, four net new locations at Coach Japan from the year-ago period as well as our 33 Coach China stores.", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $995 million as compared with $410 million a year ago. During the first quarter we did not repurchase any shares. Thus, $710 million still remains available under the current repurchase authorization.", "Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter were $241 million compared to $76 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $221 million versus $10 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending of $20 million versus $58 million in the same quarter a year ago. It is important to note that based on our current plans for FY10 we expect CapEx will be in the area of about $110 million.", "As I have already said, we are very happy to report first quarter earnings per share equal with prior year on essentially even sales showing sequential improvement compared to recent quarters. In spite of the continued difficult economic backdrop, our goal for the balance of FY10 is to achieve continued, gradual quarterly improvement versus our FY09 earnings per share results. Coming out of Q1 we believe we are well positioned to achieve this goal.", "I believe it would be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the balance of the year. First, our gross margin is likely to stay in the 72% area over the next few quarters versus our previously stated range of 70-72%. Second, while we were able to leverage our expense base in Q1, we would note that similar improvements will become more challenging to achieve as we ramp investments for the RK brand in China and anniversary saving initiatives over the balance of the year. Finally, our tax rate is likely to remain in the area of 37% for the year as we noted on our July call.", "Before we open it up for Q&A I wanted to reiterate Lew\u2019s earlier comments. Our first quarter results demonstrate Coach\u2019s strength, our resiliency and the flexibility and balance our diversified operating model provides in challenging times such as these. Thank you all for joining us all on our conference call today. Now Lew, Mike Tucci, Andrea and I will be happy to take questions. As Andrea mentioned this will be followed by a brief comment by Lew.", "Question-and-Answer Session", " ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "I guess I was wondering if you can go into a little bit more about your sales expectations for the second quarter for full year fiscal 2010. How are you thinking about it looking at planning the business? Are you looking at it on a 2-year basis? I guess sort of tying it together with that, do you think the inventory levels will impede continued sales gains given that they are down 16%?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Good questions. First, consistent with what Mike Devine said earlier in reference to our gradual improvement in earnings per share over the prior year for the rest of FY10 we also anticipate modeled increases in sales as we move forward in FY10 from quarter-to-quarter. We are planning conservatively. We have the ability to as you well know to chase inventory and we don\u2019t think it is going to impede sales at all. We have actually a more focused product assortment this year than we did last year; I think our SKU offering is actually down about 15% so inventory is very healthy.", "Mike Devine ", "Let me just build on that or provide another fact. Because of the great sourcing work that our supply chain team has done our average unit cost is actually down about 8% over where it was a year ago so as a result on a unit basis which we think obviously is more important than raw dollars our inventories are down only 8% and above where they were two years ago at the same time. We feel like we are in very good position with our inventories.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "I had a couple of really brief questions if you will indulge me. Gross margin, Mike I was hoping you could give us a relative magnitude on the gross margin impact of the mix shift versus promos. I am wondering if you can also talk at all about any sort of monthly progress in your North American comps throughout the quarter. Would you care to comment on October month to date? Share repurchases, any intention to re-enter the market on share repurchases?", "Mike Tucci ", "I will take the gross margin question first. For the quarter where we were down year-over-year by about 190 basis points which by the way was a significant closing of the gap. In Q4 I think we were about 550 basis points below the year earlier quarter so we are pleased with where gross margin is landing north of the 72% range we had given. Of that 190 basis points the vast majority of it is increased factory promotions. We had not started our deepest discounting during Q1 of last year. We really took it to its greatest levels during the December quarter and then perpetuated it through the balance of the year and we have carried it into FY10 so we still are seeing negative compares in this quarter from factory discounting. The good news is that we anticipate anniversarying that for Q2 through Q4 for the balance of the year and therefore actually delivering some of the sourcing costs upside as gross margin rate improvement in the factory channel. Our full price we would expect sharp pricing again to be offset by sourcing and that is why we are feeling good about guiding to a 72% range for year-ago which of course represents year-over-year improvement for the back three quarters of the year.", "Lew Frankfort ", "As to the October results, as we mentioned we have seen a continuation of the strengthening trends that we experienced in Q1 with the consumer responding well to our innovation such as the relaunch of Madison and Poppy.", "Mike Devine ", "I will take the question in terms of share repurchase. You know the markets obviously were very volatile during our September quarter. You have seen that we have been big buyers of our stock over the last three years. We spent $2.7 billion in 2007 through 2009 retiring more than 65 million shares. We still have $710 million available to us. So that is still a lever we have available to us as a method of returning cash to our shareholders.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of   Analyst for Loraine Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Analyst for Loraine Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Could you just provide some color on your SG&A plans for this year? I know improvement in the future will get tougher but do you expect to get leverage? Also how should we think about variable expense impacting operating margins as comps get better?", "Lew Frankfort ", "As I said in the prepared remarks and you picked up on, the compares for the balance of the year will get more challenging. We really thought very differently about our spending in Q1 last year before the holiday sales did not materialize. As we all know, we had challenging top line back three quarters of the year and we took a dramatically different approach to spending Q2 through Q4 of last year so anniversarying those activities will be again more challenging. As an example we took a number of compensation actions, most notably we stopped accruing bonuses in Q2 through the balance of the year and then as we all know we actually had a headcount reduction in Q3. None of those activities were we required to anniversary in Q1.", "That being said, I am feeling very good about the underlying good news the first quarter represents. Our two primary direct businesses both here in North America and Japan both provided leverage not only to their own P&L but to the corporate P&L as well as we were able to manage our variable expenses in both of those important markets very nimbly, applying labor at just the right levels to maximize conversion and also now as sales move up our percentage of rent in many of our locations will not kick in until we get to higher sales levels. So we are feeling very good. I would project those two large businesses will continue to be able to provide leverage through the balance of the year at low negative comp as we reported in Q1. So we are feeling very good about where we are in SG&A in the main.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of   Jennifer Black \u2013 Jennifer Black and Assoc.", "Jennifer Black \u2013 Jennifer Black and Assoc. ", "I wonder what your response to your CRM event was. Do you see definitive changes in consumer behavior or do you think it is a better product or both? I also wonder with today\u2019s consumer being more discrete how does that affect your brand? For example with the OP art versus one of your solid, beautiful, patent bags. Does it vary by age as far as how discrete she is?", "Lew Frankfort ", "In regard to our CRM initiatives, a good portion of them have been focused in recent months on our factory channel which as you know we are able to use promotional leverage to help pull people into our factory stores. They have worked very well because the factory consumer wants to buy a brand, Coach, however at an excellent value. What we have found with regard to our product, our product has been extremely important both in factory and especially in full price. Our consumers have embraced our new offerings. I think it is a function of great products at especially compelling prices. So a cautious consumer feels really wonderful when they actually pick up the bags and see for instance in the case of Poppy a price point for a full size bag at $198.", "Now with regard to our consumer preferences whether it is for OP art or patent leather what we have found is a high level of interest in novelty. Consumers are looking for cheery products. They are looking for bright products to help complement their wardrobe. We have seen a real increase in our sell through of novelty and we are well positioned for the holiday season in that arena.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray.", "Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Just one clarification and then just a general question on directional expectation for retail average ticket. If we have kind of gone through the tougher compares and obviously the comps have eased considerably, just remind us what the composition of that comp was last year and how you would expect either AUR or average ticket to compare in the Q2 period. Then one clarification, SG&A are you looking for like a low single digit on the year increase in dollars? That would be really helpful for the modelers.", "Mike Tucci ", "I will speak to the handbag average retail unit performance and to give you a basis or a foundation our average unit retail on handbags for Q1 was $290 this year, down about 14% from the prior year and right where we targeted it from a performance standpoint. Our expectations as we move into Q2 will be to hold average unit retail in handbags at roughly those levels and to continue to focus on increasing the number of handbag units sold at an average store rate which we did achieve in Q1. To take our productivity improvement through increased penetration of handbags, all of those drivers and metrics are the foundation of our plan for Q2 and beyond. We see that playing out with the assortment that we have put into the stores thus far.", "Mike Devine ", "In terms of your question about SG&A I am going to answer it in another way. What I would say is that we are planning SG&A spending that will be a couple of points above where our top line growth would come. So in spite of the leverage we achieved in Q1 with the modest de-leverage in the back three quarters of the year and for the year in total.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Christine Chen - Needham & Company.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "I just wanted to ask about China. I know you gave the numbers of stores you are opening this year but ultimately how many stores or how many locations rather do you think that market could support? Does the shopper shop differently than the Japanese customer? Can you quantify the contribution in this quarter to sales?", "Lew Frankfort ", "We are just at the tip of the iceberg. The opportunity is extremely large. There are over 125 cities in China with a population more than one million people. I visited just a few weeks ago with my colleagues a number of cities in China, secondary cities, as they are modern, the infrastructure is extremely strong and the emerging professional middle class is embracing imported accessories. Needless to say that Coach is high on her list. It is early days and it is too early to say how large the market can be. We do believe that we have an opportunity for the market to be larger than Japan is today within the next 5-6 years. We are not planning that way but we are ready for the opportunity. You can expect we will see ramping up in the years ahead the number of stores that we are opening from the 15 this year.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "And does that customer buy a specific type of product more than others? Logo versus non-logo?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Very good question. We actually see her as primarily a fashion driven consumer. She likes the same styles and the same shape in the main as consumers both in Japan and in the United States. We are finding very little differentiation in what she is purchasing from us. The only thing I will add is she is [departing] with a bag so she makes her first imported purchase she wants it to be something that can be seen by others and to contain her essentials. We are finding our accessory penetration lower to date but that we expect is because it is a developing market.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Liz Dunn \u2013 Thomas Weisel.", "Liz Dunn \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "My question is related to gross margin stabilization. You are now saying gross margin should remain in the range of 72% versus your prior guidance that was a little bit weaker than that. Can you just talk through how you have been able to impact slipping into some of these lower price points and should we just think about gross margin at that stable 72% rate for the foreseeable future or is there opportunity to go higher over the longer term?", "Mike Devine ", "We feel good about the 72% range for the foreseeable future. There are obviously many variables and we don\u2019t have a crystal ball to predict with perfect clarity. The big levers are going to be the required level of promotional activity in our factory channel and then channel mix. We feel very good that we know what we are going to deliver the product at in terms of the cost and the sourcing initiative has really been very powerful for us. We know they are strong enough to offset the sharper prices for the Poppy collections and others as we rebalance our assortment. In the factory channel really what is going to make the determination as to how much upside there will be will be the level of promotion required to continue to drive traffic and deliver the productivity and enormous operating margins that channel delivers when we deliver top line dollars.", "Now we have very good vision through FY10 on our cost base. We are also benefiting from the macro economic backdrop in this regard that our raw materials and input costs are at lower levels than we have achieved over time. As the economy turns there will be some inflationary pressures in FY11 so that will cause us to need to continue to be sharp in our products, planning, design and production and sourcing to look to offset those which we feel we have a capability to do.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Can you talk a little bit about on the factory store side as you transition from full price merchandise in factory to direct and made for factory, how is that going? How are those price points being adjusted? Are lower raw materials, how important are lower raw material prices to the growth in margins you are seeing at 72%?", "Mike Devine ", "On the factory side it is important to note that in Q1 and actually as we look forward through the balance of this year we restored our mix in factory back to a more traditional level of made for factory product in a range of around 75%. It has been lower than that in the back half of last year based on the amount of clearance activity that we had in the channel. That bodes well for us as we have more pricing flexibility there. We have more promotional flexibility and frankly our margin returns there on made for factory products have been excellent which allows us to mix the business differently.", "We really have seen no movement in average unit retail in factory from our historical levels and we have no plans to really change the model on the factory side. We think the balance between full price at about $300 in factory and probably half that is the right balance. It is the right relationship. If you travel into our factory stores today you will notice that from a look and feel standpoint while it is clearly a Coach store there is no aesthetic overlap between the two businesses. We have clean platforms in full price which are really driven by Madison and Poppy on both ends of the fashion spectrum and then we have a real foundational business on the factory side with Hansons and Soho as the anchors to that business.", "Over time we have been able to realize some cost savings. I think Mike has outlined what we have been focused on there in terms of raw material benefits, hardware benefits, make and trim opportunities on the factory side all with the intention to maintain very strong margins in the factory business and also allow us to be aggressive there because it is our promotional channel in the business model.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Erwan Rambourg \u2013 HSBC.", "Erwan Rambourg - HSBC", "I just wanted to come back to Japan because you have had a sequential improvement in Yen terms from last quarter to this quarter and most of your European competitors are actually noticing a stabilization of trends if not a worsening of trends. Should we consider this as a Poppy related boost or is there something else you are doing differently? Related to that, I just wanted to come back to your comment on China and saying that eventually in 5-6 years time China could be as big as Japan. Should we consider that your long-term target? I think you stated $250 million by 2013 could be interpretive at this stage.", "Lew Frankfort ", "Well first to your second question, $250 million is extremely conservative. We are not yet prepared to provide numbers. We are just starting our time and our resources in China to really understand how large this could be. We are running well ahead of where we thought we would be and are finding great reception with Chinese consumers, particularly with repeat purchasing which is key to developing a sustained brand.", "With regard to Japan it is Poppy actually created an inflection point in Japan. We had an integrated, comprehensive launch in late June throughout Japan. We even created a few free standing, temporary locations for Poppy in prime locations such as [inaudible] and Poppy has been enormously important to us.", "In addition, we actually benefited from a year-over-year improvement in our men\u2019s business which has become a much more important focus for us in Japan. That contributed to the gains as well. More generally, we do believe that the very challenging economy in Japan is forcing consumers to make very tough choices in terms of where they will spend their accessory dollars. Fortunately they are spending a disproportionate amount or a growing amount on Coach.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of   Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen.", "Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen", "My questions are a follow-on to the gross margin guidance maintained around that 72% level. Does that imply your mix of full price and factory is likely to stay stable where it is or should we see full price [grow] as a percentage of the mix in the December quarter?", "Mike Devine ", "That is a very good question and the answer to your question is yes. We do assume that we will carry through the balance of the fiscal year a full price factory mix about in line with what we just achieved in Q1. As Lew just talked about, the full price business strengthening in Japan. Mike Tucci talked about it strengthening here in North America. Channel mix was not nearly the detractor of Q1 FY10 as it has been in recent quarters as we have seen an inflection point in that business as getting healthier. Channel mix will not be a detriment going forward that it has been in prior quarters.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg \u2013 JJK Research.", "Janet Kloppenburg \u2013 JJK Research", "I was wondering on the average cost outlook, I thought you say it may actually track higher in 2011 but I am wondering what the prospect is for lower cost as we move through the rest of the year and if you could give us an update on your plans for marketing this holiday season in terms of dollar spending versus last year. I just was not clear if you had been accruing for bonuses. If you had accrued for bonuses here in this quarter and going forward versus what you had done last year. Mr. Tucci, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit bout Poppy and the customer base there. Is it all a youthful base or are you seeing some crossover and what opportunity that might represent.", "Mike Devine ", "I will take the questions on average cost and the bonuses. We are in very good shape and have contracts with most of our raw material suppliers and our factories through the balance of fiscal year introduction. So we feel like we have great vision to what our costs will be and so we would anticipate delivering similar year-over-year average unit cost favorability. Now we began to capture some of those improvements during the back half of the year so the 8% will gradually decline but we won\u2019t see average unit cost increasing. We look forward to delivering that in the 72% guidance that I have talked about and given.", "FY11, we haven\u2019t by long shot given up on holding our average unit cost content. I will just point out there is likely to be some inflationary pressures we are going to look to offset them. Secondly, in terms of the bonuses, we did accrue bonuses both this year and last year in Q1. So there was not a challenging compare there if you will in this most recent quarter. That changes on a year-ago basis. Our plans are at this moment in time to deliver bonuses in FY10 so therefore to accrue for them year ago this year as a compare again it is a situation in 2009 where that was not the case so it challenges the leverage.", "Mike Tucci ", "I will take care of the Poppy and the marketing piece. On the Poppy side, my feel on Poppy is that it actually is selling very broadly across our consumer base. We see that through all channels. We do believe it has driven some energy into the stores with the fashion consumer but it is selling broadly.", "On the marketing side, very important for holiday to understand we are actually spending about the same amount in marketing. However, we have reshaped our marketing expense dramatically away from traditional print emphasis and away from packaging to fun concepts and programs similar to what we did for the Poppy launch. So it is [DWT] to support our gifting programs. Significant investment in online advertising including some association with fashion blogs, our continued relationship with other social networking sites that are out there, a very targeted approach to in-store marketing both in mall and in our windows and in-store which we got feedback very quickly with the launch of Poppy it was highly effective in bringing people into the store and getting a strong message out there.", "All of this will break into market mid-quarter. It is really a different type of quarter in Q2 where everything is shaped to the end leading to December 26th obviously and so we are going to target our marketing this quarter, November 15th and drive the marketing spend November 15th right through the Christmas selling period and I think you will see a very dominant, very mixed in terms of platforms with a high level of energy in our stores from a marketing standpoint.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick ", "With that we will conclude our Q&A session and pass it on to Lew for some closing remarks. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Obviously as you can hear from our prepared remarks and our questions we feel that we did have an inflection point with the arrival of Poppy and the rebalancing of our assortment to a much more compelling price point. We feel very good about our position in the holiday season ahead and more broadly we feel that the expectations where we are taking to adjust to a consumer who is spending less than she did for the long-term, that is for the foreseeable future, we do not expect the consumer to spend as much as she did in discretionary areas. So our adaptations we think are positioning us well and we are looking forward to restored growth and we think that is available to us.

These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. ", "Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences or control costs. Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call.

As noted in our release this morning we were very pleased with our holiday results including strong sales and earnings growth and the return to positive comparable store sales in our North American retail business where trends improved through the quarter.", "Our performance clearly demonstrates the traction of the product and pricing strategies we put into place and bodes well for future growth. Beyond the top line we were also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation in the quarter. ", "Its important to note that we achieved these results despite the challenging retail environment. The consumer in North America remains cautious. She is more value conscious than ever. Fortunately our multi channel distribution model is diversified and includes substantial factory store, and international businesses. ", "The strength of our consumer franchise, flexible business model, and strong balance sheet gives us the ability to adapt our strategies to make the right decisions for the long-term. As we continue to emerge from this downturn we are well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share as a growth company. ", "While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were, first earnings per share rose 12% to $0.75 compared with $0.67 in the prior year. ", "Second, quarterly net sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time and totaled nearly $1.1 billion versus $960 million a year ago; an increase of 11%. Third, directed consumer sales rose 14% to $934 million from $818 million in the prior year on a comparable basis. ", "Fourth, North American same store sales for the quarter accelerated rising 3% from prior year while total North American store sales rose 16%. And fifth, sales in Japan declined 2% in constant currency and rose 7% in dollars. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China. ", "During the quarter we opened three North American retail stores including two in new markets for Coach; London, Ontario in Canada, and Canton, Ohio, as well as two factory stores. Thus at the end of the period there are 343 full priced and 118 factory stores in operation in North America. ", "Moving to Japan, one location was added. At quarter end there are 163 total locations in Japan with 20 full price stores including eight flagships, 115 shop in shops, 23 factory stores, and five distributor operated locations. ", "And in China we added four new locations, three on the mainland and one in Hong Kong. At quarter end there were 37 Coach locations in China including 10 in Hong Kong, two in Macau, and 25 locations on the mainland in 10 cities. As we\u2019ve discussed previously we are building a multi channel distribution model in China including flagships, retail stores, shop in shops, and factory stores. ", "Indirect sales decreased 8% to $131 million from $143 million in the same period last year. This decline was primarily due reduced shipments into US department stores. We continue to tightly manage inventories into the channel given sales levels at POS which declined 22% for the quarter as discounting in the channel continued and Coach was generally excluded from these sales. ", "As in Q1 we were pleased with the trends in full price sell through in this channel while there was less product available for clearance. International POS sales rose modestly in the period driven by distribution. ", "We estimate that the addressable US handbag and accessory category declined only slightly, between zero and 5% in the fourth calendar quarter. An improvement over the 5% to 10% decline in the prior quarter and a 10% to 15% decline experienced in the first half of the calendar year. ", "At the same time Coach\u2019s bag and accessory sales rose about 3% across all channels in North America over the most recent quarter. In our own stores handbag and accessory sales rose 18%. Separately, its worth noting that we\u2019ve seen continued modest improvement in our customers\u2019 outlook for the economy.", "Her intentions to purchase Coach over the next year is significantly higher than where it was a year ago. Our total revenues in North America rose at the same pace as our overall top line, up 11%, with our directly operated stores up 16% driven by both distribution growth and positive comp performance.", "As noted Q2 same store sales rose 3% marking an inflection point in our total North American retail business. As expected our trend improved through the quarter with December our strongest month. Fueling these comp results was significant gains in conversion from prior year offset in part by lower traffic.", "We were particularly pleased with this improvement as conversion is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service, which Mike Tucci will discuss in more detail in just a moment. In full price stores, average transaction size was modestly lower compared to prior year as increased handbag penetration offset most of the impact of lower AUR, while traffic trends held at Q1 levels.", "In factory where we continued to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing we saw increases in all comp metrics. Its important to note that our factory store growth continued to be driven by increased spending of factory channel loyal Coach shoppers and by new consumers entering the Coach franchise. ", "As noted in Japan we posted a 7% increase in dollars on the 2% decline in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Our growth in market share in this very tough Japanese environment reflects the relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming more value oriented. ", "Finally, we were very pleased with our performance in China where our brand is clearly taking hold with consumers both domestically and mainland China and with millions of Chinese who are travelling notably to Hong Kong and globally. ", "Coach\u2019s potential in the China market is reflected in our very low unaided awareness of 8% compared with 72% in the US and 63% in Japan among target consumers. What we also learned last fall through our market research is that the Chinese consumer loves Coach. ", "She rates us highly on all of the attributes she values such as fashion, sophistication, quality, and value and as our awareness increases her future purchase intent is holding among those who have not yet purchased Coach. And among existing Coach China consumers, repurchase intent is surprisingly high at 94%, a higher level than we\u2019ve experienced in the US or Japan.", "Lastly and perhaps most importantly our significant double-digit comp store sales growth further demonstrates Coach\u2019s great potential with this emerging consumer group. While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and of course I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American retail business. ", "Mike Tucci ", "Thanks Lew, and good morning. Today I\u2019d like to review the holiday season touching on the three main areas of our North American business; product and pricing, marketing, and stores. First product and pricing, during the quarter as always we offered a high level of fashion innovation and distinctive newness, as well as a diversified assortment of product to fit a wide range of customer preferences for self-purchase and gifts. ", "The two lead collections for holiday were Madison, which was relaunched in October with new styles and colors, and Poppy, where we added new novelty prints and colors in October and December. Taken together and as planned, these collections represented nearly 50% of full price store sales and targeted a broad array of consumer attitudes. ", "We were also pleased with Brooke, our lead collection for fall and with Alex, a fun group of totes introduced in December at compelling price points. Within handbags the key business driver was Maggie, while Madison wallets dominated within the accessories category. ", "Wristlets and swing packs were also important this holiday as they represented great gifts. We continued to realize improvement in overall handbag and money piece trends during the quarter. We\u2019re also excited about the new Peyton collection which launched on December 26 and is off to a great start. And later this week, we\u2019re relaunching Poppy in a fresh color pallet featuring new silhouettes as well. ", "Building on the success of our price rebalancing strategy which rolled out in July, we offered more handbags choices in the $200 to $300 range in our retail stores. This resulted in increased penetration of handbags to 54% of full price store sales from 51% last year. ", "Additionally we saw further improvement in average store handbag unit sales during Q2 driven by gains in conversion rates over last year. We believe the conversion improvement this quarter is a strong indicator that our product pricing and service efforts are taking hold with our consumers.", "On the factory side our business remained strong. Here we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative factory exclusive product combined with in store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best factory customers. ", "Of particular note in our factory business was a higher penetration of factory exclusive product which resulted in improved profitability in this channel. Its also important to note that we manage our North American store business in aggregate. As such we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels while maintaining the integrity of our full price proposition in retail stores. ", "Moving to marketing, we drove considerable brand interest along with web and store traffic through our digital strategy. Our more traditional outreach included a gift with purchase, magazine inserts, newspaper advertising, and in store visual enhancements, all of which continued to support Coach as a gift-giving destination. ", "We introduced an online gifting application that was interactive and fun suggesting a focused assortment of gift ideas for everyone on your list. Not only was it present on our own website but we launched it on our first iPhone application and through Facebook. In fact Facebook continues to provide us with a dynamic platform to communicate targeted and relevant messages to over a half a million of our highly engaged fans. We launched on Twitter in early October and now have over 200,000 followers there. ", "And lastly moving to our stores, as Lew mentioned we opened 13 new retail stores in the first half of fiscal year 2010, including 10 in new markets for the brand and on average, they\u2019re generating annualized volumes of about 1.7 million. All of these new stores are very profitable and operate at high levels of productivity. ", "As discussed our FY10 emphasis will continue to be on new markets for Coach, along with Canada, where we\u2019ve seen very strong results and are significantly under penetrated with only 18 retail stores today. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our over arching strategies and opportunities for growth. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Thanks Mike, our strategies remain largely unchanged focusing on the expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition as always we\u2019re focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach\u2019s share of our consumers\u2019 accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. ", "Starting in North America we will open an additional seven stores in the back half of 2010 bringing the total to 20 new North American retail stores for the year. In addition we\u2019ll open three new factory stores. In total we expect North American square footage growth of about 9%, down from about 13% last year. ", "In China we expect to open about seven additional locations in the second half of the year including our first flagship on the mainland bringing us to 15 new locations for the year, resulting in about 50% growth in square footage. ", "Its important to note that we find landlords and department store owners are eager to embrace Coach and we\u2019re having no problem whatsoever in finding locations that are viable today in a country where 125 cities have a population of one million or more. That compares with 50 cities in the US. ", "Given the faster market growth than expected, we\u2019re accelerating our growth strategies in China and are in the process of revising our long-range plans substantially higher. In Japan this year, we now expect to open about seven net new locations including a few men\u2019s shops. In total we would expect our square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year compared to about 8% in FY09.", "During the first half of FY10 we opened a net of 12 international wholesale locations with a net of about 13 additional locations planned during the second half, that would take us to about 25 net new international distributor operated locations this year primarily focused on Asia. Thus across all geographies and channels we plan to grow our square footage by about 9% this year, modestly below the 11% distribution growth last year, primarily due to opening fewer new stores in North America. ", "In summary, our holiday performance bodes well for the future and we\u2019re confident that we will continue to deliver healthy sales and earnings growth over the balance of the fiscal year despite a weak consumer backdrop. Importantly our January results [inaudible] the trend that we saw last quarter where the consumer was responding well to innovation, notably our new Peyton collection at a wide range of prices. ", "We\u2019re well positioned for the new normal and expect to further expand our North American market share irrespective of category growth. We will leverage the abundant opportunities available to us both domestically and internationally as we become and increasingly global brand. ", "At this point I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. ", "Mike Devine ", "Thank you Lew, Lew and Mike Tucci have just taken you through the highlights and strategies, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. ", "As mentioned our quarterly revenues rose 11% but direct to consumer which represents over three quarters of our business, up 14% and indirect down 8% due to lower shipments to US department stores. ", "Earnings per share increased 12% to $0.75 as compared to $0.67 in the year ago period as net income rose to $241 million from $217 million. Our operating income totaled $381 million in the second quarter, up 9% from $348 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 35.8% of sales compared to 36.3% in the year ago period. ", "In the second quarter gross profit rose 11% to $771 million from $692 million a year ago and gross margin rate increased to 72.4% versus 72.1% in the prior year. The primarily driver of our gross margin expansion was the reengineering of our product collections that resulted in lower average costs. ", "These sourcing costs improvements more than offset continued high levels of promotional activity in factory stores, lower AURs in full price, and channel mix. As expected SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales rose from prior year levels in the second quarter and represented 36.6% of sales versus 35.8%. ", "Its important to note that the prior year\u2019s quarter benefited from significant accrual reversals for bonuses in the headquarters\u2019 rent. If you were to exclude these items from the year ago period, we did achieve expense leverage in Q2. ", "Once again our two primary direct businesses here in North America and Japan, both provided leverage, not only to their own P&L\u2019s but also to the corporate P&L. Inventory levels at quarter end were $269 million, down about 30% from prior year on a comparable basis. On a unit basis, inventory was down only 15% reflecting our lower average unit costs. ", "As I\u2019m sure you all remember we exited holiday last year with a significantly higher inventory position than planned, and Q2 FY08. If you do a two-year inventory compare, we were essentially flat with December of calendar 2007 levels. ", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.1 billion, as compared with $424 million a year ago despite repurchases of $350 million worth of Coach common stock over the last 12 months. During the second quarter we resumed our purchase activity spending $300 million buying nearly 8.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $35.03. ", "As of the end of the period $410 million remained available under the current repurchase authorization. Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $364 million compared to $256 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $346 million versus $120 million in the same period last year due to lower CapEx and higher net income and working capital items. ", "Our CapEx spending was $17 million versus $130 million in the same quarter a year ago which was driven by the purchase of our corporate headquarters for a total second quarter 2009 cash outlay of $91 million. ", "Naturally we were very pleased to report second quarter earnings that showed both substantial sequential improvement from the first quarter and demonstrated our ability to achieve strong top and bottom line growth. ", "So taking a look ahead I think it would be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when projecting the balance of the year. First, our gross margin rate is likely to stay at or just above 72% and above last year\u2019s second half levels. Though we would note that Q3 will likely be higher than Q4 due to channel mix as factory will be distorted in the 14-week fourth quarter. ", "Second, as a result of our sales productivity gains and our ongoing operating efficiencies, we now expect that our SG&A dollar growth will be quite close to our top line growth for the balance of FY10. We are targeting these levels in spite of more difficult compares from last year\u2019s second half. ", "This represents an improvement to the modest de leverage we were forecasting last quarter. And finally, our tax rate is likely to remain in the area of 37% for the year as we noted on our last two earnings calls. ", "Separately, I did want to reiterate that based on our plans for FY10 we continue to expect that CapEx will be in the area of $110 million. Before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to echo Lew\u2019s earlier words. Our January results have shown a continuation of the trend that we saw last quarter with the consumer responding well to our product innovation. ", "And again I wanted to reiterate, the second quarter of FY10 was an extremely important quarter for Coach where we resumed strong top and bottom line growth. Clearly our holiday results bode well for the future and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll continue to deliver healthy sales, and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year despite the weak retail environment. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you everyone, we would now like to open it up for Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "I guess when you look at the results for this quarter that you just reported, can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of how you\u2019re feeling about the back half of the year, the drivers for the back half of this fiscal year for you and just had one clarification question, I think you said that traffic in full price was the same as it was in the first quarter, can you talk about how it was year over year. ", "Mike Tucci ", "You\u2019ll remember that in Q1 we saw an inflection in traffic, an improvement in full price from rates coming out of Q4. That was significant. What we saw in Q2 was that we held that improvement through the quarter and on a positive note, we\u2019re able to convert better on that traffic improvement. While it was down year over year, we got positive conversions which led to an improved performance in comps in full price in the quarter. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "And with regard to the second half, we feel very good about our prospects. I mentioned the trends that we experienced in the quarter continued through January. We are managing our business in a very balanced way and fortunately as I said earlier we do have a multi channel distribution model that\u2019s diversified and it gives us a great deal of flexibility. ", "When we couple that with our very strong consumer franchise we believe that the growth that we achieved last quarter is a reflection that we have a lot of runway ahead of us, both here and North America and internationally and we will continue to perform as a growth company. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "I was hoping you could talk about how quickly you think you could ramp up growth in China. Do you think it could be meaningful to your fiscal 2011 results. And I just had a clarification, if you could just help us, the relative magnitude of the items in the gross margin line, that would be helpful.", "Lew Frankfort ", "The first part of the question relates to whether we believe our China could be meaningful in FY11 to our results, the answer is yes and we\u2019re ramping up as rapidly as we can. We\u2019re very focused on the in store experience. Building a franchise requires us not only to have great product and beautiful stores but excellent service so we\u2019re focusing on strengthening the knowledge of our sales associates and our teams so that they can really convey the DNA of our brand in a way that will continue to encourage 94% of those who purchased previously to continue to return.", "So we\u2019re ramping up new stores. We\u2019re focusing on staff knowledge, operating protocols and the like and we will, as I mentioned earlier, we are in the midst of revising our numbers upward. ", "Mike Devine ", "Let me firstly take advantage to build off of Lew\u2019s comments about China, what we\u2019ll also see in terms of performance in FY11 versus FY10 is more rapid expansion of the bottom line as we\u2019ve talked about since we opened the business there by buying out Imaginex last year, the first couple of years were going to be investment years and we feel very good that FY11 will be a year of profitability for Coach China. ", "So now shifting to your gross margin rate question the sourcing cost improvements and the product reengineering that was so key to the work done here by our design groups, our merchandising groups and certainly our operations folks is far and away the most powerful delivering about 200 basis points of year over year gross margin rate improvement which fortunately offset continued higher levels of promotions in the factory channel.", "Now remember we talked last year that we ramped up our promotional levels Black Friday forward so we\u2019re now, we anniversaried if you will, half a quarter of the highest level of promotional activity, we would expect promotional activity the back half of the year to be about flat to what it was in FY09.", "And then the other offset was the additional channel mix so the combination of promotional activity higher than last year and further but more modest channel mix deterioration were above a point, the difference being the 30-point gross margin rate improvement that we saw year over year. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "You had mentioned that comps kind of improved through the quarter with December comps being the best, perhaps you could shed some light in terms of the cadence of monthly comps through the quarter and your comments that January kind of running better, is that sort of the comparable level of December or sort of overall quarter. And then just talking about that handbag penetration, it looks like we\u2019ve seen sort of sequential dip from 57 to 54%, so help us think about what\u2019s the right target and how do we read that in terms of the customer response to your new center of gravity in the $200 to $300 level. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "With regard to the first part of the question we manage our business with a long-term in mind and we moved away from providing monthly comps because we didn\u2019t think that was a productive metric in terms of the way in which we see our business which of course is a multi channel international business.", "So to answer your question with a general response, we feel very good about our outlook for this quarter and January trends reflect a continued strong performance within our full price stores as well as our factory stores. ", "Mike Tucci ", "On the handbag penetration in full price, actually the 54 is a very healthy number showing a nice improvement over last year\u2019s level. I just want to clarify handbag penetration in Q2 is historically lower on an absolute basis given the size of our accessory business so the rate of improvement was roughly, it was similar to what we saw in Q1 and importantly we saw significant handbag unit comp at an average store level in the quarter which I think was a big part of our conversion improvement within that. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "The only thing I\u2019d like to add to your questions around comps what we would like to do, direct our analysts to look at our overall global business and our top line growth whether its in North America or globally because what it really reflects is that we have two vectors for growth. ", "One is distribution and one is same store productivity and we have enormous runway ahead of us so we feel very, very good. We do not manage our business to achieve the maximum comp that we can in any particular month or quarter. Again we manage it for the long-term in the context of building a lasting franchise. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Lorraine Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Was just hoping to get an update on your strategy for Japan going forward and any plans to try to reinvigorate that business, what you\u2019re expecting for square footage over the longer-term and how you\u2019re feeling about that market in general. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "First when we talk about reinvigorating our business, our business on a relative basis in Japan is terrific. The market has declined 15% to 20% this year with the consumer continuing to be more value oriented and our business effectively [inaudible] so our market share has grown 15% to 20%. ", "When we look at our underlying metrics in terms of consumers\u2019 attitudes towards Coach they have never been better. So we feel very good about our business within this very challenging market. At the same time we do believe there\u2019s an opportunity long-term to drive the men\u2019s business and our team is focused on that. ", "If you visit our stores today particularly our larger stores, you\u2019ll see a very strong men\u2019s presence and we\u2019re doing very well in the men\u2019s area. Further we believe that there is an opportunity over time to develop Poppy stores in a new channel such as train stations that may only be a handful of stores, we don\u2019t know yet. ", "However what we can say in general is that our team is strong and our business is very strong in a challenging market. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Michelle Clark \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I was hoping you could give us some additional detail on the unusual expense items from the second quarter of last year and then secondly obviously you\u2019re continuing to benefit from lower product costs benefiting your gross margin rate, how should we be thinking about product costs for the back half of the year. ", "Mike Devine ", "I was hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to talk about it again, but the big Q2 item last year of course was when calendar 2009 proved to be the Christmas that never came. It put us in a position to realize that we would not be paying significant financial bonuses so in Q2, we had a big single reversal that we talked about, it was actually in our 10-Q and I think Andrea and I have talked about it over the last couple of quarters as well. ", "So you could refer back to that. It was a significant reversal. That coupled with the fact that we bought the corporate headquarters building in Q2 and we had some straight line rent accruals that we were able to release put more than $20 million of good news to the SG&A line in Q2 of last year which we just anniversaried and so if you were to do the math and adjust that out, you\u2019d actually see that we did gain SG&A leverage this Q2 and so we\u2019re feeling quite good about that. ", "Now that being said, we\u2019re going up against some pretty significant headwinds now for the second half of the year. Not only did we reverse what we had accrued in Q2, in the back half we didn\u2019t record additional bonuses and our plans are to do that this year. So that will be a negative compare. We also as you remember put a number of saving initiatives in place during Q3 of last year.", "We took a reduction in force, among many other activities. And lastly we\u2019re looking to ramp our investment opportunities to make sure that we can deliver balanced strong top and bottom line growth for the years to come. ", "So the SG&A compares will get a little more challenging for the back half but as we shared in the prepared remarks with the businesses operating as effectively as they are the direct businesses turning out leverage both to their own P&L\u2019s and to the corporate P&L, the centralized core corporate functions of design, distribution, administration, marketing, etc. as you\u2019ll see when the Q comes out we delivered about a point of leverage from those areas in Q2. ", "The big traditional parts of our business are operating extremely effectively so we now believe that that can offset some of the investment spending and some of the savings headwinds that we see in the back half of the year. So we\u2019re feeling very good about where SG&A leverage will come in. In terms of product costs, we would expect to see similar types of savings that we just experienced in Q2 in the back half of the year. ", "Some of the difference will be channel mix will once again continue to  moderate, not be as big a negative drag as it had been in prior quarters and also we\u2019ll look to have promotional levels in the factory channel that are very close to back half levels of last year versus a negative compare in the first two quarters of this year. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Just a question here on some products, just getting a sense here in terms of timing of Hamptons relaunch in the spring, which quarter would that really fall in and then maybe could you dissect for us a little bit on Poppy, that\u2019s just in stores and actually online right now, as well as Hamptons, the balance of the price points. I think its my imagination potentially but are you taking the price points of Poppy up a little bit in terms of the balance of the price points. If you could talk through that a little bit for the second half of this year. ", "Mike Tucci ", "Can you just clarify I think when you\u2019re speaking to Hamptons, do you mean Madison because is not really a full price proposition at this point, it\u2019s a factory proposition. ", "Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Yes I think so. You\u2019re doing a major launch in spring, is that right. ", "Mike Tucci ", "We\u2019re actually, let me just give you some highlights for our spring product flow within in full price and then I can speak to factory, it\u2019s a good opportunity just to get some depth out there around product. One is in full price, actually today online and Friday in stores we relaunched Poppy very completely from a product assortment standpoint including a new style there. ", "We do see some opportunity in Poppy more broadly to offer more varied price points to build on the success of 198 in handbags, but to broaden that up the spectrum and you\u2019ll see us really concentrate on that in the back half of the year and as we get into Q1 of next year to anniversary. ", "On the Madison side of the business we also have a very strong lineup for the back half. There\u2019s a significant refresh of Madison hitting the stores this weekend and what we found really importantly is that we\u2019ve built a new base in full price on product anchored by Madison, a little bit more modern, contemporary, higher price points, and then on the other end of the spectrum Poppy which is more of a youthful and introductory price offer and we fill in the middle with what we would call Coach classics like a Brooke, or a Peyton which is in the stores today and importantly as we launch [Kristan] later this spring which we think will be a very dominant flow for us in March. ", "On the factory side of the business what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve built a base around Hamptons and Soho and that was really our full price base from several years back and there we see the opportunity to restore levels of made for factory penetrations and I want to be clear that as we entered the back half of last year we went in with a significant burden to liquidate unsold inventory in our factory channel. ", "We will not anniversary that this year which will provide us a much more balanced and healthy platform, potential margin improvement, and balancing our sales growth with a very different mix of goods. So we feel good about our product lineup in both channels and the anchors of Madison and Poppy will continue in full price [straight through]. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "Just wanted to ask your sharper pricing clearly has been successful, have you thought about skewing the mix towards even a greater than 50% penetration and then can you talk about the penetration of factory exclusive, you said it was up, just wondering if you could give a number around that. ", "Mike Tucci ", "Sure, on the pricing strategy we really believe that we\u2019ve hit the right balance. There\u2019s a lot of fine-tuning that we\u2019re realizing and as we get more experience, more data, and we see conversion rates improve, we believe that the balance in mix is a driver of that. I think if I, looking back in hindsight in the quarter the opportunity that we see is to use some of the performance in handbag unit sales as a way to drive investments going forward.", "And taking somewhat more of an aggressive approach on certain key items in the mix to deliver higher returns is more of an opportunity than tweaking our pricing strategy which we\u2019re very pleased with at this point. We think we\u2019ve found a sustainable level going forward. ", "In factory the opportunity there is to return to made for factory rates in the 75%-ish range, 70 to 80% is very much doable in the back half and a much lower level of clearance activity in our factory stores gives us a significant amount of pricing flexibility and allows us to leverage some of the cost benefits that we built into the business. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "And for those of you less familiar with Coach than others, when Mike or we refer to clearance, we\u2019re talking clearance of full price products. We do not go on sale in our full price stores and as a result when we discontinue product any remaining inventory is eventually sold in our factory stores. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Schick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "David Schick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Just a quick question, you talked a little bit about inventory managed back to 2007 levels and the number was quite low where you finished anyway, do you feel that the low inventory held you back in any categories, lines, etc. ", "Mike Devine ", "No we feel really good about our inventory position and that\u2019s why I called out in the prepared remarks that the compares against last December numbers is probably not the best compare. I mentioned already with the Christmas that never came and we were in over inventory position at the end of last December and so to have units down only 15% from that level, feels very healthy to us.", "Our supply chain is as usual operating at peak efficiency, the merchants across the business identifying opportunities and we\u2019re well positioned to chase products. So we feel inventory levels are right where we need them to be. ", "David Schick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And I know you don\u2019t want to talk about months and shorter-term trends but you\u2019ve talked in broad terms about mid single-digit comp for the business on the long-term, would you care to just sort of talk about that as your long-term planning once again.", "Lew Frankfort ", "We haven\u2019t talked about mid single-digit comps for a while and actually Andrea reminded me today that this is the first positive comp we had in five quarters. We do feel as we move out of the recession that we will be able to realize double-digit top line growth, double-digit bottom line growth and we should be able to achieve low to mid single-digit comps on a continuing basis.", "If we get some wind at our backs, it could be higher. If the recession worsens, it could be lower. Again we pace ourselves and our concern was most of all with the developments of our franchise. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Liz Dunn \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Liz Dunn \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Congratulations on a great quarter, you talked about moderating channel mix, as we go forward, it seems like the distance between the factory and full price comp has narrowed, did less clearance impact your factory business and how should we think about that going forward as a factor that will impact the factory comp, also how should we think about the product pipeline as it will impact that factory comp. ", "Mike Tucci ", "What I would say is that the factory opportunity is one of balance and while we generated growth last year with a higher level of clearance activity our projection and the way we\u2019re buying the business going forward is to generate balanced growth this year with a different composition of inventory and a more dominant mix of made for factory product. ", "Its actually a much more flexible and productive way to run the business without that overhang burden of clearance. So we feel good as we\u2019re positioned going into the back half. I do think its important to understand that there\u2019s a balance here between sales growth and margin and profit growth and that we actually see and opportunity here to really manage our business for the long run and find a way to produce productivity gains in factory but also leverage margin opportunities so we can make more money and bring more profit to the bottom line. ", "In terms of the pipeline, we\u2019ve done a really nice job, the teams have really worked hard through the second quarter based on our trends and into opening up Q3 to accelerate receipts in the pipeline. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time on forecasting and carving our production needs with our supply chain and we\u2019ve gone in, particularly in late Q3 and Q4 and we\u2019ve been able to secure additional production in factory inventory to cover sales in the back half which we feel will allow us to go into our factory peak season, the summer season, in very good shape from an inventory standpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Randy Konik \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Randy Konik \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "A quick question on China, can you talk about positioning of the Coach brand within the Chinese luxury market, maybe just compare how that compares to markets in the US and Japan. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Briefly we position ourselves as an authentic quality New York fashion brand, and each of the words mean something so when we talk about authentic, we have deep roots. Our quality talks to workmanship and materials. New York talks to spirit and verve and when we talk to fashion it talks to relevance and that positioning resonates extremely well with our target Chinese consumer particularly because she is cosmopolitan. ", "And through the internet, media, movies, and the like, she sees herself as a citizen of the world and does love New York. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Can you talk a little bit about the expense impact of China and read and also the benefit of online to sales growth and margin impact there, and just lastly have you seen any of the Japanese consumers spending abroad given the strong yen maybe in Hawaii or Korea or anything like that. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "A few things on the Japanese consumer, first she\u2019s travelling less and second she\u2019s spending less while she\u2019s travelling and, which is a reflection of the general situation in Japan. Now having said that we do have a very robust business as you well know with Japanese travelers and we expect that to continue. ", "The big unlock for us is the opportunity from Chinese travelers and we\u2019re finding any offsets that we\u2019re experiencing, any losses that we\u2019re experiencing from reductions in Japanese sales from international travelers more than offset by increases from Chinese travelers. ", "Mike Devine ", "I think your first question was about the investment spending we\u2019re doing in Coach China and RK, we don\u2019t have any new projections for you. Said differently I think we\u2019re going to land about where we\u2019ve been talking about all year long which is that the two taken together will be about a $0.04 to $0.05 impact to our fiscal year 2010.", "Of course as we get later in the year and China gains momentum and we get closer to the launch of the RK brand, we\u2019re going to see the pendulum swing I guess a little bit where China will be working its way to profitability and our spending levels will increase in RK as we get ready for launch. ", "In terms, and the other question about the additional Japanese travelers, Mike sees the Japanese travelers visit his stores here in the US and I think the other question was about dot com, maybe I could ask him to take those two. ", "Mike Tucci ", "Just on the tourism idea more broadly we are seeing some health in what I would call very dominant tourist markets, New York City, Vegas, Hawaii, so we\u2019re digging into that to see what that\u2019s about and see how that trend sort of unfolds going forward. ", "On the digital side with our dot com business we actually see it as our most pure channel and interestingly we had a very nice quarter there and very significant rate of improvement in the business. Very, very strong traffic there and in particular what we are pleased with is that we got a very nice response to our email strategy within the quarter.", "Demand sales from emails was actually up nicely in the quarter and that helped us we believe to get some of our pricing message out, to get our positioning message out, potentially drive awareness and get a longer view in terms of driving traffic into our stores. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "", "Thank you everybody for joining us for our Q&A. I\u2019m going to turn this over to Lew for some closing remarks. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "I\u2019d like to just briefly make a few comments. Clearly there\u2019s a lot of questions around margin, around comps, around outlook, around China growth, and the bottom line is that we feel excellent about our prospects. The quarter that we experienced and the trends in January with rejuvenated growth gives us confidence that our growth model is in tact.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO, and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. Ian Bickley, President of Coach International, is also joining us. ", "Before we begin I must note that this call will involve certain forward-looking statements including projections for our business in the current or future periods. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations and historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth based upon a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our latest Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. ", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our third fiscal quarter 2010 results and will also discuss our strategies ", "Ian Bickley will then discuss the increasing globalization of the Coach brand. Mike Devine will continue with details on financial and operational results of the quarter. Following that we will hold a Q&A session that will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Lew will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I\u2019d now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman, and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks Andrea and welcome everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with third quarter results including excellent sales and earnings growth and a further strengthening of our full price businesses across all geographies. ", "Our performance reflects the continued attraction of the product and pricing strategies we put into place this fiscal year and bodes well for the future. Beyond our recent performance we\u2019re also very pleased to announce the doubling of our dividend at the one-year anniversary of its initiation signaling our confidence in our outlets. ", "We\u2019ve also offered authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. Finally we\u2019re encouraged with the progress we\u2019re making in transforming Coach into a global brand. As Andrea just mentioned we\u2019ve asked Ian Bickley to join today\u2019s call to talk about our initiatives notably in Asia, and our development strategy for Europe, initially focusing on the UK, France, and Spain.", "While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter were, first, earnings per share rose 40% to $0.50 compared with $0.36 in the prior year. ", "Second, quarterly net sales totaled $831 million versus $740 million a year ago, an increase of 12%. Third, direct to consumer sales rose 15% to $726 million from $634 million. Fourth, North American same store sales for the quarter accelerated rising 5% from prior year while total North American store sales rose 16%.", "Fifth, sales in Japan declined 1% in constant currency and rose 2% in dollars. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China. During the quarter we opened two North American retail stores, both in new markets for Coach, Burlington, Ontario, and Brownsville, Texas and closed two others. ", "We also opened one factory store. So at the end of the period there were 343 full price and 119 factory stores in operation in North America. Moving to Japan, we opened our first men\u2019s location as well as the factory store and [inaudible] location. At quarter end there were 166 total locations in Japan, with 20 full priced stores including eight flagships, 116 shop in shops, 24 factory stores, and 6 wholesale duty free locations. ", "Indirect sales decreased 1% to $105 million from $106 million in the same period of last year. This decline was due to the slightly reduced shipments into US department stores. We continue to manage inventories into this channel carefully although we\u2019ve seen significant improvement at retail as sales at POS rose 11%, the first quarterly sales gain in two years. ", "International POS sales also rose in the period driven primarily by distribution. We estimate that the addressable US handbag and accessory category rose at least 5% in the first calendar quarter continuing the improving trend noted over the back half of calendar 2009. Coach\u2019s bag and accessories sales rose about 15% across all channels in North America over the most recent quarter. ", "In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 18%. Our total revenues in North America rose at a similar pace as our overall top line, up 13% with our directly operated stores up 16% driven by both distribution growth and positive comp performance. ", "As noted Q3 same store sales rose 5% reflecting a further strengthening of our full price business. Fueling this total retail comp gain was significant gains in conversion from prior year while in aggregate traffic was equal to last year\u2019s levels. We were particularly pleased with the conversion improvement as it is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service. ", "And full price stores average transaction size was slightly lower compared to prior year as increased handbag penetration offset most of the impact of lower handbag and accessory pouches. Traffic trends improved from the second quarter and were only slightly down from the prior year. In factory where we continued to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing we saw increases in both traffic and conversion while ticket declined slightly. ", "While most of the quarter remains ahead of us we\u2019re tracking well and our excited about Mother\u2019s Day and the rest of the spring season. Its also important to note that we manage our North American store business in aggregate. As such we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels while maintaining the integrity of our full price proposition in retail stores.", "As you know we have resale price maintenance 365 days a year, a full price proposition. As noted in Japan we posted a 2% increase in dollars on a 1% decline in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a continued very weak category backdrop and reflect the relevance of our acceptable luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming much more value oriented. ", "We were also very pleased with our performance in China where our proposition of New York fashion and accessible luxury clearly resonated with both domestic consumers and with tourists and our Hong Kong and Macau stores. Clearly our double-digit comp store sales growth further demonstrates Coach\u2019s great potential with this emerging consumer group. ", "Finally as mentioned in our press release our sales are trending a year ahead of our original plan unveiled two years ago when we announced our intention to take control of this business. Moving on to products, during the third quarter we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. ", "Beginning on December 26 we transitioned to spring with the introduction of a Peyton collection offered across multiple fabrications and silhouettes anchored by both our carry all and shoulder bag styles. This was followed by the relaunch of Poppy in February and the new Kristin collection in March. With its new and distinctive hardware and soft feminine styling Kristin represents another [inaudible] design evolution for Coach and was supported by our spring ad campaign. ", "Just this month we introduced a collection of new [inaudible] along with new floral, graffiti prints, and Poppy. And yesterday we launched Julia, a modern tote and hobo story featuring new branding and leather op art and print concepts along with fresh colors and patterns in Madison which are the key statements for Mother\u2019s Day. ", "In addition this July on its anniversary, we will relaunch Poppy, in new and updated styles, new materials, patterns, and prints, with a comprehensive and integrated marketing campaign. Our strong product offerings and rebalanced assortment strategy continues to resonate with consumers. [inaudible] prices are down about 12% this quarter, similar to the first half of the year. These factors were the primary drivers of our conversion improvement in full price as handbag unit sales rose 22% on a comp store basis.", "Handbags represents a 59% of sales in our North American retail stores in the third quarter, up about 10% or five points from the 54% handbags represented in the same period last year. Moving to factory our business remained strong. Here we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative factory exclusive products combined with in store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best factory customers.", "Of particular note our factory business was a significantly higher penetration of factory exclusive products at 80% compared to last year\u2019s 60% levels. This improvement in mix favoring made for factory products as well as improved manufacturing costs resulted in significantly higher profitability in this channel. ", "More broadly our strategies remain largely unchanged focusing on expansion opportunities both here in the North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition as always we\u2019re focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach\u2019s share of our consumers\u2019 accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. ", "Starting in North America we plan to open an additional five stores this quarter bringing the total to 20 new American retail stores for the year. In addition we will open two factory stores. In total we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, down from about 13%. I\u2019d now like to introduce Ian Bickley, President Coach International to talk about our abundant opportunities outside of North America. ", "As many of you know Ian has been with Coach since 1993 and has been a key architect of our international growth strategies. ", "Ian Bickley ", "Thanks Lew, and good morning. I\u2019m very pleased to be able to talk about the globalization of the Coach brand. We now expect the global luxury handbag and accessories markets to reach about 29 billion during 2013. Today about 50% of global category sales and 90% of Coach sales are generated in North America and Japan, pointing to a very large opportunity outside of our core markets. ", "The most rapid growth is coming from the emerging markets notably in Asia, with China clearly our largest opportunity as it is expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to nearly 20% by 2013 contributing the lion\u2019s share of category growth. ", "The Chinese consumer loves Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we\u2019re consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. Coach\u2019s potential in the China market is reflected in our very low unaided brand awareness of 8% compared to 72% in the US and 63% in Japan, among target consumers.", "As mentioned our business is trending about a year ahead of the plans we originally articulated back in the spring of 2008. We\u2019re now targeting to achieve about $250 million in sales during FY12. And as a result of this growth we are now profitable in China, also ahead of schedule as strong unit economics have allowed us to leverage the considerable infrastructure investment.", "In China we expect to open five new locations during the remaining few months of the year. This will bring our net FY10 openings to 13 resulting in approximately 50% growth in square footage. As mentioned this week we\u2019re officially opening our first flagship location on the mainland in Shanghai, just ahead of the World Expo, which is expected to attract 70 million visitors to the city over six months. ", "This 7000 square foot store reflects Coach\u2019s latest flagship design. We believe this important store will further elevate the brand\u2019s image and is consistent with our strategy of raising awareness and aggressively growing market share with the Chinese luxury consumer. Next year we will accelerate new store openings with at least 20 new locations planned. ", "To support our growth in China and the region, we have just started up an Asia distribution center in Shanghai, allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region while reducing costs. Its important to note that our growth in China is not constrained by finding the right locations, but rather our emphasis on excellent customer service which requires recruiting and training the right retail teams to run our stores, a much greater challenge than finding store sites.", "In Japan the overall consumer market is very challenging and the category continues to see declines. Our focus remains on growing market share and we have done this quite well in our core women\u2019s business. We\u2019re now exploiting new categories such as men\u2019s, where we\u2019ve already seen early successes.", "For context the men\u2019s imported leathers at market is nearly $1 billion in size and has been less impacted by the macroeconomic environment than women\u2019s. With only a 3% share of the men\u2019s market today Coach is very under penetrated. And over the next few years we believe it has an opportunity to match our total market share of 14%.", "We will open two more locations in FY10 or seven net new locations for the year including the first two men\u2019s shops. In total we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase about 5% this year compared to about 8% in FY09.", "Finally beyond our directly owned international businesses in China and Japan, we do have significant and growing distributor run businesses in other Asian countries. For example, in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia, there are about 90 total Coach locations generating nearly $200 million of sales at retail. ", "Coach is already among the top five imported brands in these markets, with significant potential for further strong growth. During the quarter we plan to open six net new international wholesale locations. This would take us to about 25 net new international distributor operated locations this year. ", "At fiscal year end there will be about 180 Coach international wholesale locations in over 20 countries around the world, generating sales at retail of nearly $350 million. We\u2019re also pleased to announce our expansion plans into Western Europe. As you know Europe is a large market for women\u2019s and men\u2019s luxury accessories, representing about 25% of the global category sales. ", "Our experience with European tourists in combination with recent consumer research has given us confidence that our current design direction resonates with Europeans and that our price points will offer a compelling value proposition. Further Coach\u2019s heritage linked to New York fashion is appealing for most Europeans and creates a differentiated positioning compared to the traditional luxury brands. ", "As discussed in our press release we are starting with a two-pronged approach with strong local partners. Initially we will focus on France through a distribution agreement with the prestigious Printemps department store group. Through Printemps, we expect to open at least 14 shop in shops in their stores over the next three years.", "The first will be a 1700 square foot shop which will open in June in their flagship boulevard Haussmann location in Paris, followed by five additional locations by the end of the calendar year. We have also agreed in principal to establish a joint venture with Hackett Limited, the iconic British retailer to open in the UK, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland, creating a multichannel distribution model in these markets. We expect the first locations in the UK, Spain, and Portugal, to open during the next 12 months. ", "With that I will turn it over to Mike Devine.", "Mike Devine ", "Thank you Ian, Lew and Ian have just taken you through highlights and strategies, let me know take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 12% with direct to consumer which represents over three quarters of our business, up 15% and indirect down 1%, due to slightly lower shipments to US department stores. ", "Earnings per share for the quarter increased 40% to $0.50 as compared to $0.36 a year ago, while net income rose 37% to $158 million from $115 million. Excluding the one-time charge from last year\u2019s third quarter EPS rose 31% and net income increased 28%. ", "Operating income totaled $249 million, up 34% from the $185 million reported in the comparable year ago period, while operating margin was 30% versus 25.1% reported for the prior year. Excluding the one-time charge last year operating income rose 25% from prior year or double the rate of sales growth as the year ago operating margin was 26.9% on the same basis. ", "In the third quarter gross profit rose 17% to $616 million, from $525 million a year ago and gross margin rate increased to 74.1% versus 71% flat in the prior year. The primary driver of our substantial gross margin expansion was lower manufacturing costs. Product mix notably the increased sell through of handbags in our full price stores and the increase of higher margin made for factory product in factory stores was also a contributor to the year over year improvement. ", "SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales at 44.1% compared to 45.9% in the year ago quarter. Excluding the one-time charge in the year ago comparison, the expense ratio was equal year over year at 44.1%. Once again our two primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan both provided leverage not only to their own P&L\u2019s but to the corporate consolidated P&L as well. ", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $307 million, down about 14% from prior year on a comparable basis. On a unit basis inventory was up 3% reflecting our lower average unit cost. Cash and short-term investments stood at $908 million as compared with $551 million a year ago despite repurchases of $700 million worth of Coach common stock over the last 12 months. ", "During the third quarter we continued our repurchase activity buying nearly 11.3 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $35.52. As of the end of the period approximately $10 million remained under the company\u2019s previous repurchase authorization. As noted in the press release and by Lew earlier on this call the Board has authorized a new $1 billion repurchase program.", "As you know we\u2019ve also announced the doubling of our dividend rate from $0.30 to $0.60 annually, effective with our July payment. Its important to note that it will still represent only a fraction of our cash flow at about $180 million a year, leaving us more than ample cash to fund our growth and continue our buyback program. ", "Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $205 million, compared to $207 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $190 million versus $180 million in the same period last year, due to lower CapEx and a higher net income. Our CapEx spending was $15 million versus $27 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Naturally we were very pleased to report third quarter earnings that demonstrated our ability to achieve strong top line and accelerated income and earnings growth. Looking ahead I think it would be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when projecting our fourth quarter. ", "First, we would reiterate that our gross margin is expected to expand significantly in Q4 versus last year, although it will likely be somewhat lower than our Q3 rate due to channel mix as factory will be distorted in the 14-week quarter. ", "Second, as a result of our sales productivity gains and our ongoing operating efficiencies we continue to expect that our SG&A dollar growth will be quite close to our top line growth for the fourth quarter. We are targeting these levels in spite of more difficult compares from last year\u2019s fourth quarter due to our higher investment spending and increased incentive compensation accruals. ", "Third, we do expect to see some inventory growth as we plan to build inventories for the fall season and we begin to anniversary our average unit cost improvements. Separately based on some changes in project timing we now expect that this year\u2019s CapEx will be in the area of $90 to $100 million, down from our previous guidance of $110 million. ", "In summary, our double-digit growth demonstrates our ability to manage our business nimbly, while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities for the brand. We\u2019re accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the brand with discerning consumers globally. ", "And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally, while continuing to return capital to shareholders. ", "Thank you all for listening this morning, and we\u2019d be happen to open it up to Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "The one question that I have for you is when you look at the results this morning, very encouraging, do you view this quarter as in inflection point for Coach and why do you think.", "Lew Frankfort ", "We do see it as another inflection for Coach. I think in a year from now or two years from now we will look back upon this quarter, the initiatives that we announced in Europe, the acceleration of our business in China and the rejuvenation of our full price businesses and conclude that it indeed was an inflection point.", "We\u2019re extremely encouraged by the results across all channels and geographies last quarter. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Citigroup", "The comp acceleration this quarter was nice, I\u2019m wondering if you could give us any color on if the factory versus the full price comp, if that differential has been closing further and do you think that the go forward comp can be sustained here in the mid single-digit range or are you looking for a low single-digit going forward. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "In terms of fall\u2019s precision, when we say low single-digits, mid single-digits, to us that\u2019s just a very subtle change. What we said publically quite recently is that we do believe we can achieve during our LRP period double-digit top line growth with the bottom line growing at a faster rate. ", "And what we also said is that we\u2019re anticipating low to mid single-digit comps worldwide. If we get some wind at our back it will be higher, if we don\u2019t it will be somewhat lower. With regard to the earlier part of your question, yes there has been a convergence between full price and factory, its increasing, the convergence. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Schick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "David Schick \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Kind of a question going back on the broad thinking over a year, one of the reasons I think Coach didn\u2019t face comparisons that were dropped off the table was that you recognized the change, called it the new reality, had some strategic changes around that a year ago, so as you lap that and I know you mentioned that the handbag unit comp was 22 but the down 12% I think you said in price on the call, is there any reason to revisit the new reality or would any improvement off of the new reality be taken care of in the RK line, how should we think about your thinking on that strategic [ship].", "Lew Frankfort ", "I\u2019m going to ask Mike Tucci who\u2019s sitting in with us on the call to take that question. ", "Mike Tucci", "Specifically on handbags, the unit acceleration has been a key. Obviously with the rebalancing and repricing strategy and its stabilization of traffic, the key for us in getting productivity back is selling more units in handbags, we had a positive comp, high single-digit in our full price stores in dollars which was key.", "If we\u2019re looking out as we build our assortments through Q4 of this year and into the first half of next year, we actually do see some subtle opportunity to blend the product differently going forward and the key for us is really in the middle. Its sits between, in the Coach handbag hierarchy, between Poppy which is our introductory price offer and Madison which represents a higher price offer.", "The best representation of that today in the stores is Kristin and Julia which launched yesterday, really targeting that core leather and signature sweet spot between $298 and $358. As we built that in Q3 we saw the strengthening of our handbag business in particular and our overall business. ", "We will build on that significantly in FY11 and beyond and I think that bodes very well for us to give us three layers in our pricing and positioning hierarchy to meet three very distinct consumer segments. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "Congratulations on a great quarter, I wanted to ask about the international customer, as you go global going into Western Europe and then also focusing on China, what differences do you see between the customer across the country. Is the Chinese customer similar to the Japanese customer, does the European customer shop differently than the US customer versus the Asia customer and how do you think about that as you grow. ", "Ian Bickley ", "I believe that overall the differences between our customers are very subtle and we\u2019ve learned through our consumer research that consistently our heritage as a New York fashion brand as well as our accessible luxury positioning and compelling value proposition for the consumer is something that resonates globally. ", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "And then with respect to Europe, what are you doing differently this time other than partnering with key retailers than when you tried to grow in Europe in the past. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Let me take that one because this is our second try at Europe, as you know, I failed the first time and a few things. First it was the old world of Coach, it was online leather bags, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re old enough to remember them, but we\u2014", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company", "I remember, I\u2019m old enough. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Okay, well we actually developed a great business in North America but it did not resonate that well with the Europeans who wanted products that were more stylish and more sophisticated. Second, we did not have local partners and we did it remote without putting the level of investment into these markets that we\u2019re doing today.", "Today as we announced we have two great partners that we\u2019re starting with and we\u2019re very enthusiastic about what we can do together.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan ", "Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan ", "You had talked about the gross margin expansion you saw in the quarter and I think you pointed out the lower product cost, channel mix and made for factory product at factory as the primary drivers, is it possible to quantify those in terms of basis point impact. ", "Mike Devine ", "", "I would probably stay away from going with too much more precision but rest assured that of the 310 of margin expansion far and away the biggest contributor was from those two factors which we actually look at them, think about, as very closely related because they both end up resulting in a growing expansion between our average out the door pricing and the average unit cost for the item sold. ", "The other traditional big movers of our gross margin rate were relatively quiet this quarter versus last year. Our levels of promotions in the factory channel were very similar, TYO [wise] and also we\u2019re starting to see some easing of the pressure brought about by channel mix due to a number of factors, firstly the convergence that Lew just spoke to, and we discussed in our prepared remarks. Its taking a little bit of pressure off the channel mix and also the rapid growth while its still small to the total company, Coach China with its very healthy gross margin rates also helped move the needle on channel mix a little bit this quarter. ", "So the big story really is about price versus cost which is very exciting for us. ", "Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan ", "And with the increased penetration of the made for factory product and if you are able to continue to diverge the full price in the factory channel comps, is it reasonable to assume that you could possibly get back to a 75-ish percent gross margin.", "Mike Devine ", "Again we\u2019re not giving specific forward guidance, but what I would say is that we\u2019re feeling good about our gross margin rates heading into Q4 and for the coming quarters. We do expect to be able to deliver year over year gross margin expansion out over the next couple of quarters. We\u2019ve locked in many of our material costs at historically low levels.", "That being said we are beginning to see some inflationary pressures so that will be a challenge for us going forward, however we do have many opportunities to look to offset this pressure, whether its through alternate materials, counter sourcing, channel mix, as China grows as I mentioned earlier, and our convergence between full price and factory.", "So, we\u2019re feeling like there are opportunities but there are headwinds on the inflationary pressure side. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "I\u2019d also just like to add if I could, is that we actually internally nicknamed Mike Devine Mike Gross Margin Devine and we feel so [unsuccessful] but with all of you guys, migrating you to operating margins because we do think that\u2019s really the way you need to evaluate us. And that\u2019s a more comprehensive measurement, notwithstanding everything positive about our outlook on the gross margin side, I just urge you to move down the P&L.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Lorraine Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Can you talk about your thought process in choosing your new European partners, where exactly do you see the synergies with Hackett and Printemps. ", "Ian Bickley ", "Well first of all we really see the new partnership with Printemps as the cornerstone for going into Western Europe. France obviously is a very important market. It\u2019s a leading fashion market and we believe if we\u2019re successful there we really will build a halo effect for the rest of Europe. ", "Printemps for us is a perfect partner. We know that they get the vision for the Coach brand. They will help us to establish image enhancing locations and they will give us broad geographic coverage throughout France and enable us both to leverage the domestic consumer as well as international tourists which especially in their flagship Printemps location in Paris represent a very significant share of the business.", "In terms of Hackett with whom we are jointly developing other key Western European markets, we do believe again they are a group that understands Coach, understands the positioning in the market, has strong local expertise and also have a high touch customer service model that is very consistent with the way we drive our business. ", "Lorraine Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Can you provide some color on the markets you expect to target in terms of demographics. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "", "The question is can we talk about who we\u2019re trying to target, we actually have a very broad reach. As a democratized luxury brand where we\u2019re available to consumers who are aspirational trading up into Coach as well as consumers who are purchasing alternative brands at our levels and of course the European luxury brand.", "So we find that we\u2019re able to develop a broad and diversified consumer base in each of the markets we\u2019re in and that\u2019s one of the elements that\u2019s very compelling to our proposition. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Congratulations, can you talk a little bit about as you see the department store business or indirect business any updates there in terms of what\u2019s happening and then just to clarify on the positive high single-digit comp that you mentioned for full price, is that just in handbags, or is that overall. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "The positive comp was in handbag units, 22% more units. With regard to department stores, we had an excellent quarter at POS, our sales were up 11% driven by full price sales and that compared actually to down 22% just in the last quarter and I think that\u2019s both a reflection of Coach\u2019s strength and the strength in department stores.", "They have really backed away from the promotional proposition and are giving consumers a stronger every day value. We\u2019re benefiting from that of course and we\u2019re encouraged. We believe that we will stay in positive territory at POS in US department stores. It bodes well for not only Coach but other brands and their entire franchise. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company ", "Laura Champine \u2013 Cowen and Company ", "Given the CapEx guidance for the full year that\u2019s changed a little bit but the step up in Chinese growth and also the European plan, can you give us kind of an initial look at 2011 CapEx.", "Mike Devine ", "We haven\u2019t completed yet our complete CapEx planning for our new fiscal year 2011 out through next June. I can tell you that the reduction this year from the $110 to the $90 to $100 million is just project timing. So I would anticipate from that $110 million level if you look at that as a go forward number and then have the movement of $10 to $20 million, I think we\u2019re probably will end up coming forward with a CapEx plan that would be in the $130 to $150 million range for next year.", "But its very early in our detailed planning processes. The relationships that we\u2019re forming with our new partners and our growth in China will increase our CapEx spend but we\u2019ve done tremendous work around store construction costs and sourcing and so we feel like our CapEx spend will continue to be very well controlled.

Baird ", "I noticed that your unaided awareness in the US looks like its had a nice jump, could you talk about the factors there. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Our unaided awareness is extremely high. I\u2019m not quite sure what source you\u2019re referencing but our unaided awareness is I believe north of the 70% in the US, so seven out of 10 consumers who we target mention Coach as a top of mind brand.", "Perhaps it\u2019s a bit higher than it was, but we haven\u2019t seen the results of that effect. ", "Erika Maschmeyer \u2013 Robert W. Baird ", "I thought you had said 80% unaided awareness there, I\u2019m sorry if I misheard that. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "I think what we referenced was 80% unaided awareness in China compared to in the 60\u2019s in Japan and 70\u2019s in the US and the reason Ian made that point was to suggest that the opportunity for us to continue to grow rapidly as awareness builds is balanced in China.

We have a global calendar and when we update our windows in the United States we do the same in China, Korea, and every other market so the cadence is exactly the same. ", "What we did announce and Ian touched on it I believe today is an Asian distribution center which is just opening now and for the first time we will be shipping goods for Asian markets directly into a distribution center that will enable us to provide much more rapid response.", "Today for countries outside of Japan they\u2019re located in Asia, the goods go all the way to Florida, believe it or not and then go back to Asia. We\u2019re going to be cutting four to six weeks of transit out. We\u2019re going to be able to have a pooled inventory so that we can respond to country variations in demand in a much more spontaneous way. ", "So, we\u2019re trying real hard to strengthen our capabilities there. ", "Maria Driscoll \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s ", "And can I just ask you also have an e-commerce platform in Europe. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "Is that a question, we do not today have an e-commerce platform in Europe. We\u2019re actually launching later this week I believe if we\u2019re still on track, a Japanese e-commerce site. What we have in China and several other markets and will have in Europe once we launch, is an informational site that will provide updated information on product, newsworthy stories, as well as directions on where they can go within the respective countries and purchase Coach.

", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker ", "So I have just a couple of questions about France and Western Europe and even a little bit about China, could you talk about as you roll the brands into these areas, how are you approaching this from marketing but also product wise, are you rolling in with brands with sub brands, like Madison and Julia or is signature there too, is Poppy there, and do you have a full assortment as far as fragrance, jewelry, small leather goods, just a little behind that. And I know the stores in the department stores, the shops will be smaller, so if you could just talk specifically about that versus a store say in China. ", "Ian Bickley ", "Well first of all let me talk about product and marketing, we expect the assortments for Europe to be very consistent with our assortments globally. Of course there will be preferences that consumers have there particularly we expect leather to be more important in Europe for example than a [logo] product. ", "And in terms of marketing we\u2019ll be approaching each market that we\u2019re entering with a specific launch strategy. We are partnering as part of our agreement with Printemps on a shared integrated marketing and communications campaign to launch the brand in France that will focus a great deal on the Haussmann store leveraging databases, windows, but also some degree of national advertising as well as editorials. ", "We\u2019ll also be tapping into opportunities to leverage the international tourists in that market as well. And we\u2019ll take a consistent approach when we go into the UK and Spain and those markets in advance of opening the first locations. With regard to the store sizes, as I mentioned earlier our location in the Printemps flagship location on boulevard Haussmann, is going to be 1700 square feet in a very prime location.", "Actually when you go into the store it will have a three-room concept and will look very much like an elevated Coach freestanding store actually within a department store. In terms of the broader distribution we\u2019ll probably be looking at shop in shop sizes that will range between 50 and 80 square meters in size. ", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker ", "And then could you just follow-up on China and I\u2019m assuming just based on those store sizes that the assortment in France at least will be a little bit more limited and focused on handbags, is that correct. ", "Ian Bickley ", "No, it\u2019s the same broad lifestyle collection that we offer, its no different to China. ", "Marni Shapiro \u2013 The Retail Tracker ", "No I\u2019m sorry in France, China is getting now the full, is the full assortment but in France it will be smaller shop in shops, the assortments will be focused primarily on handbags. ", "Lew Frankfort ", "No what Ian was saying is that the smaller shops will have a comprehensive assortment. What we do in a smaller size flagship and we have many of them around the world, is have a more edited assortment of the comprehensive offering, but it will be a true flagship assortment which is a lifestyle expression of the Coach brand.

Remember at this time last year we were peeking in the level of delete activity in our stores as we were clearing through excess inventory. ", "That situation no longer exists. The promotional cadence in factory is absolutely flat to last year. We\u2019re trying some different methodology, it is a promotional channel. Its what drives traffic and drives purchase, that\u2019s where we play and we will continue to do so so that value proposition within the factory channels, we have stated and will be committed to a very, very strong and value oriented experience for our consumer there and we see that carrying through Q4 and the tactics we will lever those tactics as we need to.", "Mike Devine ", "And to build off of Lew\u2019s earlier point, we want to bridge you down to operating income here and the expansion of the gross margin coupled with the increased productivity is driving operating margin expansion that\u2019s driving earnings at an accelerated pace. The factory division itself actually, four-wall contribution is up 100\u2019s of basis points year over year.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS ", "Could you try to quantify any kind of calendar shift in the third quarter as well as whether we should expect one for our models into the fourth quarter.", "Mike Tucci", "There really was no calendar shift in the third quarter. The way we report, the Easter shift had no bearing between Q3 and Q4 so we feel very good about April and how the fourth quarter shapes up.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Resnick", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; Jerry Stritzke, Coach's President and COO; and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters for fiscal year. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors.", "Also please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. Please note that the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending July 3, 2010, included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in fiscal 2009 included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively. All discussions of comparable store sales are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each period; 14 weeks versus the comparable 14 week period for the fourth quarter, and 53 weeks versus 53 weeks for the fiscal year.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our fourth fiscal quarter and annual 2010 results, and will also discuss our overarching strategies. Jerry Stritzke will speak to our operations, sourcing and logistic plans, as we expand our infrastructure from global growth. Mike Devine will continue with details on financial and operational results [indiscernible] year.", "Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session which will be joined by Mike Tucci, President North American Retail. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Lew will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Andrea, and welcome everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with fourth quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth. This quarter's performance demonstrated a continuation of the strength we have been experiencing throughout the year as our market share expanded across all geographies. Our results reflected growing recognition of the Coach brand globally and consumers\u2019 strong response to our product offering, and clearly bodes well for the future.", "While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our year in quarter first. During FY '10, our performance was highlighted by increases of 12% in revenues, 18% in operating income and 22% in earnings per share. It was a year of many milestones, including first, a return to double-digit top and bottom line growth, driven by the successful merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies we put into place last year. Second, an increased emphasis on the globalization of our business through both distribution growth outside North America and the opening of our Asia Distribution Center, which will allow us to operate more nimbly. Third, the first full year of operation of our stores in China, where our sales at Retail doubled to over $100 million as the brand took hold. And fourth, we doubled our quarterly dividend and resumed our repurchase program, authorizing another $1 billion buyback this spring, demonstrating our financial strength and cash flow generation.", "This annual performance was capped off by an excellent fourth quarter. Some key metrics were: First, net sales totaled $951 million versus $778 million a year ago, an increase of 22%. Excluding the extra week, sales rose 13%. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.64, up 40% from the $0.45 reported in the prior year. Again, excluding the extra week, EPS rose 23%. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 23% to $842 million from $683 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose over 6% on a comparable basis from prior year, while total North American store sales rose 24%, augmented by distribution and the extra week. Fifth, sales in Japan rose 13% in dollars and 6% on a constant currency basis, despite a continued contraction in the category, as Coach continued to gain share. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales and comps in China.", "During the quarter, we opened five North American retail stores, including two new markets for Coach: Chattanooga, Tennessee and Halifax in Nova Scotia. We also closed six locations; two at lease expiration and the remaining four by exercising our termination rights. In addition, we opened two factory stores. At the end of FY '10, there were 342 Full Price and 121 Factory stores in operation in North America, a net increase of 12 Full Price and 10 Factory stores from the prior year, while total square footage grew 8%.", "Moving to Japan, two locations were added, including our second Men's shop, while one was closed and one was expanded. At year end, there were 167 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone Full Price stores, including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 25 factory stores and six duty-free locations. In total, a net of seven locations were added in Japan last year and three were expanded, yielding total square footage growth of about 5%.", "And in China, we added four net new locations, all in the mainland, including our first flagship in Shanghai. At the end of the quarter, there were 41 Coach locations in China, including 29 locations on the mainland in 13 cities. 15 of these stores were in Tier 1 cities, 10 in Tier 2 cities and four in Tier 3 cities. In addition, there are 10 locations in Hong Kong and two in Macau.", "Overall for Greater China, there was an increase of 13 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 50%. As we previously discussed, we are building a multi-channel distribution model in China, including flagships, retail stores, shop-in-shops and factory stores.", "Indirect sales, which for context now represent about 12% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 15% to $109 million from $95 million in the same period last year. This increase was driven by international wholesale shipments, while shipments into U.S. department stores were essentially consistent with last year's levels. At POS, international sales rose significantly, while U.S. department store sales were even year-over-year in the quarter.", "We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose 5% to 10% during the first half of the 2010 calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 20% across all channels in North America over the same period. In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 24%. For the fiscal year ended June, we estimate that the addressable category rose about 3% to 5% to about $8.3 billion, while Coach\u2019s North American bag and accessories sales rose 10% across all channels, and 18% in our own stores over the same period.", "Our total revenues in North America were up 21% in the quarter with our directly operated stores up 24%, as distribution growth augmented the comp performance. Excluding the additional week, North American revenues rose 12% and store revenues increased 14%. As noted, Q4 same-store sales rose over 6% on a comparable basis and Full Price stores\u2019 comps were driven by a sharp rise in conversion, on lower traffic year-over-year, while tickets were stable. In Factory, where we continued to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing, we continued to see increases in conversion and traffic, while tickets declined modestly.", "We were very pleased to generate positive comps in both channels of our North American Retail business. It's also important to reiterate that we manage our North American Store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels, while maintaining the integrity of our Full Price proposition and Retail stores. While the full season is just underway, we are pleased with current trends and consumers' continued strong response to our product and positioning.", "As noted for the quarter, we posted a 6% increase in local currency in Japan and a 13% gain in dollars. Excluding the extra week, local currency sales were even with prior year and sales in dollars were up 5%. It should be mentioned that our market share further expanded against a continuing very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 16% yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. Our growth in share this year, in a very tough Japanese market, reflects a strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer, who is becoming more discerning and value-oriented.", "Naturally, I want to call out China, which is our single largest growth opportunity. As many of you know, this was the first year that we were directly operating all of our China stores, having completed the acquisition of the mainland stores in 2009. During the fourth quarter, as for all previous quarters this year, we achieved significant double-digit comp growth, as the Coach brand is taking hold with increasing numbers of consumers.", "Moving onto product. During the fourth quarter, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. For April, we introduced a collection of Charm Totes, along with new floral graffiti prints and Poppy. In May, it was all about Julia; a fresh modern tote and hobo story featuring new C-branding and leather Op Art and print concepts, along with fresh colors and patterns in Madison, which were the key statements for Mother's Day. In June, we also had updates in Kristin and Brooke. And in July, on its anniversary, we successfully re-launched Poppy in new and updated styles, material, patterns and prints, supported by a comprehensive and integrated marketing campaign.", "As you know, FY '10 was a year of strong new collection introductions, targeting specific customer segments, including Poppy, which will be part of Coach for years to come. More generally, we adapted our merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies to respond to a changed consumer environment. Our strong product offering and rebalanced assortment strategy were the primary factors driving the conversion improvement in Full Price stores. Average handbag prices were down about 10% in the fourth quarter, while handbag unit sales rose 25% on a comp store basis. Handbag penetration represented over 55% of sales in our North American Retail stores in the fourth quarter, up nearly 10% from the same period last year. It's important to note that we're focused on maintaining our present price positioning in handbags in the $200 to $300 sweet spot, which is clearly resonating with consumers.", "Moving to Factory, our business continues to be strong. Here, we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative, factory-exclusive product, combined with in-store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best Factory customers. A particular note in our Factory business this quarter was a significantly higher penetration of factory- exclusive product at about 90%, compared to about 75% last year. This improvement in mix, favoring made-for-factory product, as well as improved manufacturing costs, further improved profitability in this channel.", "As we end FY '11, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged, focusing on expansion opportunities both here in North America and, increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers\u2019 accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.", "One new global initiative for us that we're particularly excited about is Men's, which we now believe will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead. For context, the Men's global premium bag and small leather goods market is about $4 billion to date, or about 15% of the total premium market. And in key Asian markets, it actually represents a much larger percent of the total. For example, in Japan, the Men's premium market is nearly $1 billion and over 20% of total sales. And in contrast to the contracting Women's market, Men's is actually stable in Japan.", "In Greater China, today, Men's represents about $900 million in sales, which is about 1/3 of the nearly $2.5 billion market, and is growing rapidly. At the same time, for Coach, Men's represents only about 3% to 4% of global sales today, depending on the geography. During FY '10, we began to pilot a more comprehensive Men's accessories assortment. In the U.S., we introduced our first Men's stand-alone store on Bleeker Street in New York City in May, next door to our Women's store. We've seen very strong initial results and will use key learnings from this store to inform our Men's product and merchandising in the 30 North American flagships where we offer a complete Men's accessories assortment. We also expect to further pilot the concept in a few select Retail locations in North America later this year.", "In addition, as most male consumers in the U.S. have essentially focused on value and function, we believe that there\u2019s also a large opportunity for Men's domestically in our Factory channel. Thus during FY '11, we will be opening about 10 stand-alone stores in the best outlet malls, most in close proximity to existing Coach Factory stores. First, we'll be opening in late August in Riverhead on Long Island in New York.", "In Japan, where the male consumer is more brand- and fashion-oriented, we've introduced a comprehensive Men's assortment in key Full Price locations and have opened two stand-alone stores. Our early results have been excellent. For example, our first Men's shop-in-shop in Umeda, Hankyu, which opened in March, is running at annual rate of over $1 million and 210 square feet. And our second store, just opened in June, is also performing very strongly. We also recently reformatted our Marunouchi flagship location, which is the business district of Tokyo, making the whole first floor Men's, and experienced an immediate and dramatic increase in sales driven by all key metrics; traffic, ticket and conversion.", "We also have placed an expanded Men's assortment into over 60 locations in Japan during the last fiscal year and saw an immediate and significant positive impact to results. We believe that over time, that our share of the Men's market in Japan can approximate our total market share of about 16%.", "Beyond North America and Japan, we believe that Men's can play a more prominent role in our international locations, especially in China, where it's noted the category is growing rapidly, with Men's playing a significant role, as well as in other Asian markets and in Europe. We are continually and currently assessing opportunities in these markets with an expectation of rolling out a more comprehensive Men's assortment globally and expect to double the number of international wholesale locations carrying Men's to about 90 during FY '11.", "Most generally, we will capitalize on the brand awareness Coach already enjoys in these markets to grow our penetration of Men's.", "Moving on to distribution growth. We expect that our square footage globally, and across all channels, will increase about 10% in FY '11, compared to 8% in FY '10. Starting in North America, we will again open about 30 new stores in FY '11, but the composition will be somewhat different with 10 Full Price locations, 10 Factory outlets and 10 Men's-only Factory stores, as I already mentioned. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year; similar to last year.", "Outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity. As it is expected to double from about 10% of the global market share today to nearly 20% in just a few years, contributing the lion's share of global category growth. The Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing consumers. As mentioned, our sales at Retail doubled in China this year to over $100 million as the market grew rapidly, and we increased our share as well from about 4% to 5%. And as a result of this growth, strong unit economics allowed us to leverage the considerable infrastructure investment, which enabled us to achieve profitability during FY '10. This year, we will accelerate new store openings with about 30 new locations planned, up from the net of 13 opened in FY '10, increasing square footage by about 60%. All of these locations will be in mainland China.", "In Japan, as I mentioned, the overall consumer market remains very challenging and the category continues to contract. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As discussed, we're now focusing on new categories such as Men's, where we have already seen early success. During FY '11, we expect to open about eight new locations in Japan, including two Men's and two Poppy locations. In total, we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 6% this year, compared to about 5% in FY '10.", "Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in China and Japan, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. During FY '11, we expect to open about 25 net new international wholesale locations, bringing our total number to nearly 210. And consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, we're pleased to announce that we reached an agreement to take control of our Domestic Retail businesses in Singapore and Malaysia. The agreement provides for a phased transition of the current Retail businesses over the next two years, beginning in July 2011. While the impact of the transition will be small, it is an important step towards controlling our future in Asia.", "As you know, last quarter, we announced our first expansion plans into Western Europe, which represents about 25% of the global category sales. Initially, we focused on France through  a distribution agreement with the prestigious Printemps department store group. Through Printemps, we expect to open a total of at least 14 shop-in-shops in their stores over the next three years. We opened our first location in June; a 1,700-square foot shop in their flagship Boulevard Haussmann location in Paris. We've seen excellent early results, attracting both domestic customers and international tourists. We have also now commenced a joint venture with Hackett Limited, the iconic British retailer, to open Coach in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and we\u2019ll be creating a multi-channel distribution model in these markets. The first locations will be opening in El Corte Ingl\u00e9s in Portugal and Spain this fall.", "Beyond the opportunities in the core Coach concept and brand, I'm excited about our upcoming Reed Krakoff launch. We believe that this concept has an opportunity to define new American luxury and engage a customer who is looking for exclusivity and limited distribution. The Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It is a stand-alone brand, separate and apart from Coach, though leveraging Coach's infrastructure. It also has a unique point of view and aesthetic, reflecting Reed's personal design philosophy. Reed Krakoff will be launched with a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as in prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and colette in Paris. In the coming week, we will be opening a store in Madison Avenue in New York, one in Tokyo, the first shop-in-shops in Saks, and the brand e-commerce site, reedkrakoff.com.", "What I\u2019ve just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace, given the strength of the Coach business and our increasing global expansion. In order to achieve these goals, naturally, we need to create the global infrastructure to support it and continue to evolve our supply chain.", "To discuss our operations initiative, I'd like to turn it over to Coach's President and COO, Jerry Stritzke. Jerry?", "Jerry Stritzke", "Thanks, Lew. To begin, I want to touch on our Asia Distribution Center in Shanghai. As you may know, the DC just opened in May. We successfully scaled up to handle 100% of the volume related to our Greater China Domestic business. Similarly, by fiscal year-end, we expect to be fully supporting our Asian Coach International Wholesale business as well. Finally, as we move into next year, we will be in the position to start providing services to Coach Japan from this Distribution Center.", "The Asia DC is already allowing us to better manage logistics in the region while reducing cost. We will obtain a significant advantage in speeds of market [ph] (43:57) and enables us to provide value-added services in regions, such as pick-pack [ph] (44:02) for China and other Asian countries. Of course, we could be much more nimble using one common inventory for Asia held in-region, taking advantage of the duty-free status to hold products until our demand forecasts are finely tuned by market. Simply put, the Asia DC provides the ability to flow inventory as needed to optimize sales in the region. Developing Asia DC in the duty-free zone, and in close proximity to our manufacturing base, has allowed us to optimize our tax and corporate structure as well.", "In addition to developing distribution and logistics capabilities in-region, we have used the last 12 months to establish a systems platform in China for planning, financial, data warehousing and CRM [Customer Relationship Management]. This systems platform, together with the Asia Distribution Center, will create the nucleus of what will be our shared service center in Shanghai to provide support to Asian markets in-region. This year, we will add procurement functionality as well as HR and finance capabilities. In addition to supporting China and Japan, it will allow us to seamlessly integrate new direct market as they come online, such as Singapore and Malaysia.", "While we're on the subject of global operations, I thought I would discuss some of the work we're doing to address sourcing opportunities. Like every company in our space who manufactures in China, we\u2019re now facing rising raw material prices and increasing labor costs. As always, we continue to design and engineer product with the goal of improving costs without compromising quality or value. Specifically, we are experiencing our raw material capabilities in areas such as leather, fabric and hardware. We have consistently sourced both alternative sources for raw materials, such as lower cost tanneries and fabric mills, while also developing alternative fabrication. Today, we're enhancing our capabilities to source raw materials close to manufacturing by investing in strong, on-the-ground presence.", "We\u2019re also accelerating the diversification of our manufacturing outside of China. We've already made excellent progress in developing a manufacturing base in Vietnam, which will account for 7% of our finished goods production FY '11. In India, we are intensifying our efforts to bring more facilities online and we continue to look at other opportunities, primarily in Asia. In order to effect this diversification, we have created a dedicated team which is solely responsible for bringing new sourcing facilities and countries online.", "In summary, we have made significant strides in becoming a more sophisticated global operator. The Asia Distribution Center, systems platform and emerging service capabilities will enable the growth that we have planned in Asia, while improving our costs associated with delivering that support.", "At this time, I'll turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?", "Michael Devine", "Thanks, Jerry. Lew and Jerry have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results.", "As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 22% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents about 88% of our business, up 23%; and our Indirect segment, up 15%. Net income for the quarter rose 34% and totaled $196 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.64, up 40%. This compared to net income of $146 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.45 in the prior year's fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, earnings per share were $2.33, up 22%, compared to $1.91; while net income totaled $735 million, up 18%, versus net income of $623 million reported in FY '09.", "The 53rd week in FY '10 contributed about $70 million to sales and $0.08 to earnings. Excluding that extra week, sales would\u2019ve risen 13% for the quarter, while sales for the year would\u2019ve been up 10%. Similarly, EPS would\u2019ve increased 23% for the quarter and 18% for the fiscal year.", "For the fourth quarter, our operating income totaled $297 million, 45% above the $205 million reported last year, while operating margin was 31.2% versus 26.3%. For the full fiscal year, operating income was $1.15 billion, an increase of 18% from $972 million generated a year ago. Operating margin for the year was 31.9% as compared to 30.1% a year ago. During the quarter, gross profit rose 27%, $697 million, versus $547 million a year ago. Gross margin rate, which exceeded our expectations, were 73.3% versus 70.4% a year ago. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 42.1% compared to the 44.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.", "For the full year, gross profit rose 13% to $2.63 billion from $2.32 billion a year ago. Gross margin rate was 73% even in FY '10 versus 71.9% posted in FY '09. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 41.1%, compared to the 41.8% reported in fiscal 2009. The primary driver of our substantial gross margin expansion in both the quarter and the fiscal year was lower manufacturing costs. Product mix, notably the increased sell-through of handbags in our Full Price stores and the increase of higher-margin made-for-factory product in Factory stores, was also a contributor to the year-over-year improvement.", "As we noted in our press release, we reported a number of unusual items, which impacted both the fourth quarter and full-year results in FY '09. Excluding these unusual items in the prior year's fourth quarter, FY '10 operating income rose 35% from the $220 million reported in FY '09, while FY '10 operating margin expanded to 31.2% from 28.2% in the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 42.1% in both periods on the same basis. Net income in the fourth quarter rose 43% from $136 million reported in the prior year, while earnings per share increased 49% from $0.43.", "Similarly, for the full year, excluding the impact of unusual items in the FY '09 results, operating income rose 15% in FY '10 from the $1 billion flat reported in the prior year, while operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 31.9%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 41.1% compared to 40.9% last year. Net income in FY '10 rose 18% from $622 million reported in the prior year, while earnings per share increased 22% from $1.91.", "Before I leave the P&L, I did want to touch on the tax rate, which for the quarter came in below 35%, bringing the full year to just over 36%, versus the 36\u00be% we've been accruing for the first three quarters of 2010. There were two primary factors which improved the FY '10 tax rate. Firstly, higher profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions; and second, a lower effective state tax rate.", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $363 million, up about 11% from FY '09 year end, consistent with our expectations. This inventory level allows us to support 22 net new North American stores, six net new locations at Coach Japan from the year-ago period, as well as our 41 Coach China stores.", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $696 million as compared with $800 million a year ago. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 10.9 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $41.43, spending a total of $450 million.", "For the full fiscal year, we repurchased and retired nearly 30.7 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $37.48, spending a total of $1.15 billion. At the end of the year, approximately $560 million remained under the company's present repurchase authorization.", "Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $182 million compared to $270 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $152 million versus $245 million in the same period last year. The primary factor impacting cash flow was a $90-million swing in cash for inventory, as we build inventories to support our growing business this year versus reducing inventories in last year's Q4.", "Our CapEx spending was $29 million versus $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year 2010, net cash from operating activities was $991 million compared to $809 million a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '10 was an inflow of $910 million versus $569 million in fiscal year '09. For the year, CapEx spending totaled $81 million. This compares to CapEx of $240 million in the prior year, which included the purchase of our company headquarters here in New York City.", "It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '11, we expect CapEx for next year will be up substantially in the area of $150 million, driven by the timing shift of certain projects, but primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies.", "While we're not giving specific guidance for FY '11, I believe it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year ahead. I would add that all of my comments are on a comparable 52 week-to-52 week basis, given that we have provided the sales and earnings contribution of the 53rd week in FY '10.", "First and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales and earnings growth as mentioned in our press release and in Lew's remarks earlier. Our top line will be driven in part by low-to-single digit comp store sales in North America, which will of course fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to calendar timing differences.", "Second, our gross margin is likely to expand in the first half of the year versus FY '10. The second half will be more difficult as we'll face headwinds on the raw materials and labor cost side and tougher second half compares, which will be offset in part by channel and product mix, as well as FX.", "Third, on SG&A, we would expect the expense ratio for the full year FY '11 to be about flat to FY '10 even, even as we ramp investment spend to include Reed Krakoff, Europe and building the infrastructure for global growth, while continuing to deliver leverage across the balance of the business. Taken together, the investments will impact FY '11 earnings per share by about a $0.05 more than investment spend did in FY '10.", "Fourth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 35% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies. Separately, I do want to note that we expect further increases in inventory at the end of next quarter as we build inventory against current trends to maximize sales this holiday season.", "In summary, our fourth quarter and FY '10 results demonstrate our ability to manage our business nimbly, while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with the particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we're in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally, while continuing to return capital to shareholders.", "At this time, I'd be happy to open the call to question-and-answer.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And first question comes from Bob Drbul [Barclays Capital].", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "I just had a question for this quarter's comp store sales results. Lew, can you talk maybe about the monthly progression throughout the quarter, including into July? And can you talk overall on whether or not there was a sequential improvement in the North American Full Price Retail stores versus the prior quarter?", "Lew Frankfort", "First, our Q4 overall comps were better than Q3. And our performance was consistent throughout the quarter driven, as we said earlier, by a sharp increase in conversion. And that trend continues through today.", "Michael Devine", "Getting to the second part of your question, while we don't disaggregate our comps, I think this was the first call in recent quarters where we did say both channels were positive during the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Neely Tamminga.", "Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Just a question for Jerry since we have him on the call. It would be great to have him talk a little bit more about the sourcing headwinds and pressures, and just get his perspective as to the potential pressures from raw materials versus labor versus transportation, and overall in container cost. I mean, could you just size that for us between those three buckets, where the real headwind is?", "Jerry Stritzke", "It\u2019s been a pretty dynamic environment in the last six months. The labor increases have already really taken place in China, I think. We, along with many others, have already kind of planned those in and incorporate them into our future costs. I also believe that the logistics costs have stabilized. If you follow that, there's quite a bit of press coverage and we\u2019ve taken a much more cautious approach and feeling pretty good about what we can anticipate there. Raw materials is the piece that's still bouncing around. We've been a little more successful offsetting some of that by being judicious about what we're using, where we're using it. The Euro bounced it around. We've been opportunistic in blocking in cost to the extent that we\u2019re buying product out of Europe, and to the extent that we can source product in places that offset raw materials costs. We're looking for opportunities to do that. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. It's an environment where we have to be very deliberate and more nimble, and even more thoughtful than ever to make sure that we're really looking at our key programs or we're making big investments, and that we're kind of wisely building our cost up. So you don't see a significant impact our business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson [BofA Merrill Lynch].", "Lorraine Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I just wanted to ask about pricing. I know you said you wanted to stay within that $200 to $300 sweet spot, but are there any levers you could pull here on the price points to offset some of these raw material pressures? And then a little bit of clarification on your back half gross margin guidance. Are you expecting margins to be down at this stage or do you think you can do enough to offset these pressures?", "Lew Frankfort", "Let me answer the first part of your question. The $200 to $300 sweet spot is very powerful, and as I mentioned earlier, handbag unit penetration increased 25% this past quarter. A remarkable level. And we're very pleased with that. And for us, as we revitalize the Full Price business, we look at operating margins, not gross margins, and we would rather trade off some basis points in gross margin because we know the consumer will return it to us in multiple ways by buying more units if we keep the prices sharp. And so that's been a focus in addition to all of the sourcing initiatives that Jerry has mentioned. Mike, do you want to take the second part?", "Michael Devine", "Sure. So we will be up against some very challenging gross margin rate compared to the second half. We recorded 74% in Q3 and north of 73% in this quarter we've just completed. So honestly, I think it's unlikely that we'll be able to hold to those levels in the back half, but we have all the confidence that we'll be able to continue to deliver gross margin rates in the 72% to 73% range, and likely have to have an opportunity, or let me say a chance, depending on how things fall out. Jerry said it's very dynamic. That year-over-year total year gross margin rate should approximate FY '10\u2019s rates in FY '11, with favorability first half and less favorable compared to [ph] (1:04:33) back half.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Chen [Needham & Company]", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "I wanted to ask about China. Can you talk a little bit in more detail about the customer? I mean, how often is she in the stores? Is the age range similar to here? Do you get an older customer, younger customer? And what is she buying? Is she also buying in that sweet spot? I know the prices there are higher, but I'm just thinking on a like-for-like bag.", "Lew Frankfort", "She's primarily in here 20s and early 30s. She is a young professional. She values shopping as one of her favorite pastimes and she does look at value and innovation and brand. And she really has embraced Coach. When we look of what she's purchasing, she's purchasing in the main, what consumers are purchasing in other parts of the world. And for its equivalent, the price points are pretty similar to the $200 to $300 sweet spot, adjusted of course for the pricing in China. She actually has, on the mainland in Shanghai and Beijing, she actually has a household income of about $35,000, which is exciting. And the middle-class, as you know, is growing at a -- last year 40%. We don't have the more recent numbers, but it could very well continue at a 40% level. What we're also particularly pleased about as we go into the second-tier and third-tier cities, being the first imported luxury accessories brand, the first imported accessories brand, we're doing extremely well. A lot better than our pro formas, and it bodes well from very substantial distribution in China. And just for context, there are over 300 cities in China with more than 1 million people. Quite remarkable.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "And how many bags a year does she purchase, high-end bags, versus Japan?", "Lew Frankfort", "She purchases one to 1\u00bd bags a year, high-end, compared to more than two in the U.S.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Tunick [JPMorgan].", "Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I was hoping to get your perspective on the opportunities to drive continued productivity gains at the very impressive Factory channel. It seems that's the biggest concern that we hear from investors. So maybe if you could talk about either marketing or in-store promotions, discounting. Anything you could share on that front would help us get some perspective. And then on the Indirect channel side, I think there was some media reports last quarter about a possible deal to do a private label program with JCPenney. And just wondering if this was a growth area, using your expertise, that you would explore?", "Lew Frankfort", "I'll answer the second part first. I saw the mention in Women's wear. I actually got lots of e-mails. And there's absolutely no truth to that. You can't believe everything you read. And in fact, it's not something that we're contemplating, private label. We have abundant opportunities organically to grow the Coach brand and that's what we're focused on in addition to the launch of the RK brand. I'm going to ask Mike Tucci to take the first part of your question, Brian.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. Brian, it's not surprising that as our Full Price business strengthens, that people begin to worry about the sustainability of our Factory model. We really believe that our merchandising strategy, our positioning in Factory and the customer behavior in the Factory channel continues to show opportunities. Examples of that are the continued focus on shifting of mix to major Factory product, which offers a much more dynamic price leverage opportunity for us; innovation and newness in Factory products, which offers an opportunity for repeat purchase, multiple purchase, and also drives traffic and conversion. And then longer-term, looking at the Men's opportunity in Factory as a growth- and productivity-driver, not only for the new opportunity to grow the Men's category on a stand-alone basis, but also as an opportunity to further improve the productivity in our existing Factory base, which is stretched to capacity based on current traffic and throughput. So we feel very good out there and the model is very clean. We don't discount in our Full Price channel. If the customer wants value from Coach and wants Coach at a promotional price point, she knows she can get it in a very vibrant Factory environment with high service levels and very high product flow. And that seems to be really, really working for us. So we feel good about where we are there.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dana Telsey.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "As you think about product extensions and enhancing the productivity in the Full Price business, how is the Shoe business, Watches, Sunglasses, and any other product extensions we should be thinking about? And how the fragrance has done? And then lastly, Lew, you talk a lot about the Men's opportunity. How should we think of that eventually becoming a part, what percentage of sales, U.S. and globally, and the margin opportunities there?", "Lew Frankfort", "First, with regard to Shoes, as Shoes, Fragrance, Watches, Sunwear and the like, all of the categories are doing very well both at wholesale and, from our point of view, more importantly, in our own distribution. We're actually going to be expanding footwear into Asia with an Asian fit, which we know will be enormously helpful. Dana, in terms of Men's, we believe that Men's isn't going to be another major growth area for us. And it's early days, but we would be disappointed if the Men's global sales did not reach and exceed 10% of our overall sales over the next few years, up from the 3% to 4% this past year. So if you do the math, it\u2019s going to add $300 million to our business as we approach $500 million. So it will be significant. As far as the margins are concerned -- just lastly, margins, we use the same rigor and the same approach, and the margins are consistent with the Women's side.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer [Robert W. Baird].", "Erika Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Could you talk a little bit about how your Full Price traffic compared to last quarter? And then also, did the differential between Factory and Full Price comps continue to narrow?", "Michael Devine", "I think what we said all through the quarter and with the release is that we had positive comps in both Full Price and Factory that the channels performed very well. And more consistently, as that performance converges, it's obviously a positive for us in overall productivity. And as we saw traffic in Q4, very consistent with where we were for Q3. And while it's very early in the quarter, our trends in July have remained very consistent. We feel very good about where we are.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Randy Konik [Jefferies & Company].", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Lew, just curious to get your sense on -- we had this call three months ago. What\u2019s your view on the consumers today versus three months ago? And what's your kind of outlook on the consumer, especially for the Full Price mall business, heading into the back half of the calendar year here?", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, first, for context, we just interviewed 5,100 active Coach users as part of a semiannual survey in June. And our consumers are feeling better than they have in over two years. And it\u2019s quite encouraging that 30% of consumers, as an example, feel that the economy is getting better. And if you just roll back one year, it was only 8%. So for the first time in two years, a majority of consumers believe the market, the economy\u2019s either going to stabilize or improve. And that's compared to a low point last year around the 20%. So consumers are feeling a lot better. I also feel that we will continue our moderate recovery. And even if we do slip into a slight GDP decline, we don't think it's going to materially affect the discretionary spending on Coach. Because what consumers are telling us also in the survey, that their intention to purchase Coach over the next 12 months has dramatically increased from six months ago, which bodes well. Lastly, of course, we are increasingly global and there's a lot of strong growth for us in Asia. Men's, we're in really the formative stages and you will hear us talking about Men's as another major platform in the months ahead.", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So is it fair to characterize you feel that the U.S. consumer is better-positioned for the back half of the year? And then the Accessories business is even better than that? Or how should you think about the key [ph] (1:16:05) accessories?", "Lew Frankfort", "Absolutely. I mean, there's a variety of ways to look at it. Compared to last year, she's far more optimistic and I think that will be reflected in spending; not necessarily across all brands and concepts, but those who innovate and call for good value. I also think sequentially, from the first half to the second half, we see also improvement.", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Andrea Resnick.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. I'm going to turn it back to over to both Mike Devine and then Lew for their closing comments.", "Michael Devine", "Thank you, Andrea. This is Mike. I just wanted to make a clarification from some of the prepared remarks that I gave earlier, particularly around expectations for our North American comp. I wanted to make sure that it was clear that our expectation has delivered low- to mid-single-digit comps for North America, and that they will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of calendar timing. So thank you. And, Lew, I'll turn it over to you.", "Lew Frankfort", "I think our results speak for themselves. Our outlook is robust. We feel are coming out of this year extremely strong as a team. Wherever we travel and speak to consumers, we feel we've never been better-positioned for the future than we are today. So as I said last quarter, stay tuned. And thank you, and have a good day.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you, everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude the Coach Earnings Conference.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Resnick", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. Mike Tucci, President of North American Retail, is also joining us for a holiday preview.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters of fiscal year. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our first fiscal quarter 2011 results and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives. Mike Tucci will review our key programs for the holiday season. Mike Devine will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session that will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. We will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I'd now like to now introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we posted an excellent quarter as key financial metrics show double-digit growth and bottom line results that well exceeded top line sales. All of our business units posted strong performances despite muted consumer spending as the merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies, we put into place in FY '10, continued to drive growth.", "In addition, we made continued progress against our global business initiatives including international expansion, men's and digital media. We experienced strong response to our collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide.", "Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high-level of profitability and substantial cash generation in the first quarter. Looking forward, we're very pleased the current trends we're experiencing in the business and are well positioned for the upcoming holiday season.", "While I would get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.  Some highlights were: First, net sales totaled $912 million versus $761 million a year ago, an increase of 20%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.63, up 43% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 19% to $775 million from $654 million in the prior year; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.5% from prior year while total store sales rose 17%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 14% in dollars and 3% on constant-currency basis despite the difficult environment; and finally, in China, we continue to generate very strong sales growth with a continuation of significant double-digit comps.", "During the quarter, we opened three North American retail stores, including one in the Newmarket for Coach, Corpus Christi, Texas. In addition, we opened seven factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 full price and 128 factory stores in operation in North America.", "Moving on to China, we opened eight locations, all in the Mainland during the quarter, bringing the total number to 49 locations. And in Japan, two locations were added during the quarter, including our first Men's stand-alone factory location. At quarter end, there were 169 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full Price stores including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 27 factory stores and six distributor-operated locations.", "Indirect sales, which the context now represents about 12% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, decreased 27% to $136 million from $108 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into U.S. department stores and international wholesale locations, given positive POS sales notably in our international businesses and expectations for a stronger holiday season for Coach.", "Specifically, sales at POS in U.S. department stores rose slightly for the quarter. At the same time, international Retail sales grow sharply, driven by both distribution growth and comparable store sales. The international traveler represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence expands.", "We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter, similar to the increase we experienced in the first six months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 16% across all channels in North America over the same period. In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 20%. It's worth noting that our customers' future purchasing intent is at the highest level we have seen in the last two years.", "Our total revenues in North America rose 18% for the quarter, with our directly-operated stores up 17% as distribution growth augmented the positive comp performance. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 8.5% fueled by conversion, and we were very pleased with the positive comps posted for both channels. In Full Price stores, both conversion and ticket rose, partially offset by traffic. In Factory, conversion and traffic rose, partially offset by average transaction size.", "As noted in Japan, we posted a 14% increase in dollars on a 3% increase in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 16% yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. This share growth in the very tough Japanese market reflects the strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who has become more value-oriented.", "Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest growing business, which represents the single largest geographic opportunity to Coach. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who was participating in this category in rapidly increasing numbers.", "While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?", "Michael Tucci", "Thanks, Lew. During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. In addition to a relaunch of Poppy in July, we brought in Mia, a new soft-tailored collection which featured Maggie, our most popular hobo, as well as the carryall silhouette. We also delivered new choices in Madison and Kristin. Madison and Poppy continued to be our lead collections for the period, with both collections performing well.", "More generally, the merchandising and pricing strategies we initiated one year ago to create a more balanced and productive handbag assortment are proven sustainable growth drivers in North America.  Both handbag and women's accessories achieved positive comps in the quarter with handbag penetration holding at 57%, with a slight increase in average unit retails.", "Earlier this month, we started flowing in our holiday assortment, including a relaunch of the Madison collection, featuring the new Sophia satchel in core leather, gathered leather and novelty applications, along with a fresh dotted Op Art logo.  The initial reception has been excellent. You will continue to see a high level of newness over the next few months, with updates to Poppy and new colors in Madison and Kristin.", "In mid-December, we'll be introducing the Alexander tote to capture peak sales with new products just before the holiday. We're also excited about the trends in small bags, which will be great gift-giving items and help to balance our price offer. In addition to our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, building on the successful elements of the campaigns of the last year.", "We will execute a targeted strategy beginning in mid-November to highlight a powerful gifting message for the holiday shopping season. The emphasis of our marketing will be product- and item-driven across handbags, women's accessories and other gifts ideas.  Our efforts will span coach.com, digital media and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic.", "I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy, and the benefits that we're deriving from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness and drive store traffic, while also maximizing e-commerce opportunities.", "In addition, our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. Social media has become an important component of our marketing strategy, including Facebook, where we now have over 1 million fans who enthusiastically engaged with our relevant messaging and exclusive offers such as product reviews and free shipping. We've also expanded our digital footprint in advertising, highlighted by our recent Poppy project campaign, and our rich media takeover adds featuring the Sophia bag. These are just the few of the initiatives that drove double-digit year-over-year increases in sales and traffic to our North American site in Q1.", "Building on our strong digital platform, visitors to coach.com this holiday will be able to engage with our virtual gift guide, featuring a robust selection of compelling gifts. They'll pick their favorites, add it to a wish list and even share it through social media. We're also excited about enabling customer comments and likes for our Poppy product pages. Inviting our guest to participate in our brand message becomes viral, ultimately driving traffic and sales to our website and stores. Finally, we'll soon introduce our e-Gift card feature, perfect for last-minute shoppers.", "While this is a snapshot of our North American digital business, our web presence is global. During the quarter, we launched coach.com informational sites in 10 important countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, France and Spain. This brings our total web presence to 14 countries, three of which are e-commerce platforms. We will continue to use our digital capability as an enabler in customer touch points as we expand the Coach brand globally.", "Moving back to our stores, as Lew mentioned, we opened three new retail stores in Q1, which are performing well and ahead of plan and seven new factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. Updating our Men's store opening plans for fiscal year '11 and full price based on the initial success of our first store on Bleecker Street, we will be opening a few additional Men's retail stores later this fiscal year, as we secure premium locations in our most productive centers in North America.", "On the Factory side, our new Men's stores located in dominant factory centers such as Woodbury Commons, Riverhead, Chicago Premium, Ontario Mills and Orlando, are off to a great start. We believe the initial strong response reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the consumers focus on value and function. It underscores our belief that there is a large opportunity for Men's domestically in our factory channel as well. During the remainder of FY '11, we'll open at least five more Men's factory locations.", "In summary, we're excited with the progress we've made in our Full Price productivity improvement and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the holiday season, given current sales trends in both our Full Price and Factory channels. With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Mike. Our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.", "Mike just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and international markets. As we noted in August, the Men's global premium bag and small leather goods market is estimated to be about $4 billion today or 15% of the total premium accessories market, with the addressable market much larger.", "At the same time, Coach's Men's sales represent only 3% to 4% of our total sales today. Given our long-standing heritage in Men's, including a diversified archive of iconic styles, we're well positioned to grow in this category. Clearly, we have a significant opportunity for Coach to substantially increase its share in the Men's accessories market.", "In Japan, where the male consumer is more brand- and fashion-oriented than in the U.S., we have introduced a comprehensive Men's assortment in key full price locations and have open two stand-alone stores. This quarter, we opened our first freestanding Men's factory store, which is off to a great start. We believe that over time, our share of the Men's market in Japan can equal our total market share of about 16%. Beyond North America and Japan, we believe that Men's will be a major growth driver for international business, especially in China and other Asian markets. We are currently accepting opportunities in these markets and plan to introduce a broad and comprehensive Men's assortment in all new Coach locations where size permits.", "Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year compared to 8% in FY '10. Starting in North America, we will open about 30 new stores this year, including the 10 locations we opened in Q1. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, similar to last year.", "As we've said many times, outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity, as luxury accessories are expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to about 20% during the next four or five years, contributing the majority of worldwide category growth.", "Last year, our sales at Retail doubled in China to over 100 million as the market grew rapidly and we increased our share from 4% to 5%. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 25 new locations planned, up from the net of 13 open last year, increasing square footage by about 60%. All of these locations will be in Mainland China.", "In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our goal continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's where we have seen some significant early successes. This year, we expect to open about seven net new locations in Japan, including the two opened in the first quarter. They include three Men's and one Poppy location. In total, we estimate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year, similar to FY '10.", "Earlier this month, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with three major Asian hubs: Japan, Mainland China and other Asia markets. We also announced the addition of three senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key in this new organization has been the promotion of Victor Louis to the newly created position of President, Coach Retail International, with responsibility for all of Coach's directly-owned businesses outside North America.", "Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in China and Japan, we have significantly been growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. During this fiscal year, we expect to open about 40 net new international wholesale locations, including the three opened last quarter, bringing our total number to over 220.", "As most of you know, in April, we announced the two-pronged approach to address Europe through the establishment of a joint venture with Hackett for distribution in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and a wholesale distribution agreement with Printemps for France. To date, we opened three boutiques in Printemps Department Stores in France, including a 1,700 square foot location on the main floor of Printemps' iconic flagship on Boulevard Haussmann last June. We've seen excellent early results where the shop is attracting both local consumers and tourists. We expect to open an additional five locations within Printemps during the balance of the fiscal year.", "We're also very pleased to announce our initial stores in London. Our stand-alone store in the Westfield White City Mall coming in early spring and a 5,100 square foot flagship on New Bond Street, our first global flagship store in the region coming next summer. Finally, in Spain, we opened our first boutique in El Corte Ingl\u00e9s in Madrid earlier this month and two others in Barcelona and Valencia just last week. During the balance of the fiscal year, we plan to open at least three more Coach shop-in-shops within El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, and we're exploring additional opportunities as well.", "Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, we just launched Reed Krakoff in September. The Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It has an opportunity to define new American luxury and engage a customer who was looking for exclusivity and limited distribution. The brand was launched with a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, including a store in Madison Avenue and shop-in-shops in Saks Fifth Avenue as well as two prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Colette in Paris. While it's still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer.", "What I've just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace given the strength of the Coach business and our increasing global presence. At this time, I will turn it over to Mark Divine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?", "Michael Devine", "Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.", "As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 20% with direct-to-consumer up 19% and indirect up 27%. Excluding the currency benefit during the quarter, sales rose 17%. Net income for the quarter totaled $189 million, up 34%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.63, up 43%. This compared to net income of $141 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.44 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $286 million, 28% above the $223 million reported last year while operating margin was 31.3% versus 29.3% last year. Naturally, we were extremely pleased with this level of growth and our higher level of profitability.", "During the quarter, gross profit totaled $676 million versus $550 million a year ago, an increase of 23%. Gross margin rate was 74.2% versus 72.3% a year ago. The year-over-year change in rate was a function of sourcing cost improvements, notably in the factory channel where mix continued to favor higher margin made for factory products.", "We were pleased with our expense ratio in Q1 as SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 42.8% compared to the 42.9% reported in the year ago, a 10 basis point improvement despite heavier investment spending. Inventory  levels at quarter end were $459 million, 36% above the $338 million reported at the end of last year's Q1 but up only 14% on a two-year basis. This planned inventory build supports strong underlying business trends to maximize sales this holiday. Further, this inventory level allows us to support the 17 net new North American stores, six net new locations at Coach Japan and 16 net new Coach China stores, as well as our new Asia distribution center, all of which are increases from the year-ago period.", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $712 million as compared with $995 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 3.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $38.35, spending a total of $137 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchased total to nearly 34.3 million shares equaling about $1.3 billion. At the end of the quarter, approximately $420 million remained under the company's present repurchase authorization.", "Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $177 million compared to $241 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $154 million versus $221 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $23 million versus $20 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our August call, based on our current plans for the year, we expect that CapEx will rise to about $150 million, driven by the timing shift of certain projects but primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies.", "Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike have said, we feel we're very well positioned for the holiday quarter and the remainder of the year.  While we do not give specific guidance, I believe it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year.", "First and most generally, we expect to achieve double-digit sales increases in North America and globally, with double-digit earnings growth. And given the strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve mid-single digit comparable sales growth in North America for the balance of the fiscal year, up from last quarter when we projected low to mid-single digit growth.", "Second, we are encouraged by the rate of profitability improvement in Q1 and excited about our top line sales growth. And while our previous comments regarding second half gross margins still stand, this sales growth coupled with controlled spending will help offset cost pressures, enabling Coach to deliver in FY '11 an operating margin at about last year's level. And third, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 34% for the balance of the year as we further refine our international tax strategies.", "In summary, we feel our first quarter results clearly demonstrate the vibrancy of the Coach brand and our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently for the longer term. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunities with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally.", "And with the business model that generates significant cash flow and virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities while continuing to returning capital to shareholders. Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, will be happy to take questions followed a brief comment from Lew.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Drbul. [Barclays Capital]", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Lew, I guess the first question I'm going to have is were there any surprises for you this quarter, given the surprising strength in the trends of the business overall?", "Lew Frankfort", "I think the only, if we want to call it a surprise, the wind was at our back. And we actually found that the category group 5% to 10% in North America, and we were able to grow at a much faster rate in the category. And what's most interesting about that is that after six quarters of decline in the premium handbag and accessory category, last quarter was the third quarter in a row where we grew 5% to 10% led by Coach, and that's obviously very encouraging. But more generally and overarchingly, we did have, of course, had an excellent quarter and what that did for us as a team is reinforce our confidence that the road map that we've articulated as a growth company can and will be achieved.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "And then, I just have a question on inventories and just sort of the outlook for the holiday. On the inventory side, Mike, can you talk about units versus pricing, and if you have opportunity for higher averaging at retails in the holiday season? And you talked a little bit about, feeling great about Full Price and Factory. Was there a sequential improvement or anything we could talk about throughout the quarter into October so far?", "Michael Tucci", "I'll take -- you got a lot in there, Bob. It's Mike T. I'll take a few of those, and then I'll hand it to Mike Devine. On the business overall, we did see an important mix shift in the Factory side, again, capitalizing on made-for-factory opportunity. They had drove higher penetrations in handbags, gave us a lot of productivity opportunity, and we do see that as an opportunity going into Q2. More generally and on the Full Price side, we were pleased with conversions as well as average unit retails in handbags, which were up slightly. That's a nice opportunity for us in Q2. And on the inventory side, I think, from a business unit perspective, there are a few really important points to make. One is that we are very clean. We have extremely low levels of clearance in the stores, and we're driving very productive sales in our factory stores through better mix. Our two-years stack on inventory, Bob, is actually up about 14% where we feel last year we were light going into the holiday quarter. And in fact, we did an enormous amount of pull forward of factory products, spring products that we've pulled forward last year to sell in Q2. We've corrected that this year. Additionally, we have more flow in the quarter, so the inventory supports that. And of course, you've heard about some increase in door account with the Men's strategy and some of the global initiatives that we have on new stores. And that, specifically, is driving some of the inventory increase as well. So we're in very good shape. We feel good about what we're seeing in the business today in October. We did see a strong finish in the quarter with the launch of Madison at the end of September. And that, of course, carries forward. Mike?", "Michael Devine", "So Bob, to answer to your mathematical question, coming out of Q1, the increase in inventory is overwhelmingly skewed towards the increase in unit. We have a low single-digit increase in average unit costs, right and so, of the year-over-year inventory dollar growth. The vast majority of it is, in fact, units, which Mike spoke to. I'll also add on that, of course, since a year ago, we've opened the Asian distribution center, which has required a inventory investment, but now allows us to operate far more nimbly and take advantage of growth opportunities in regions in Asia.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Schick. [Stifel, Nicolaus]", "David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Lew, a very sort of long-term or structural China question for you. You've just talked about your share going from 4% to 5% and the market itself is growing. Just structurally, as you look at your place in that market, I know you've talked about 16% share in Japan and your share is higher here. Five or 10 years out, what's the right share to think about for where you guys should be in the China market?", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, I mean the higher, the better, of course. But I think that it's realistic for us to assume that if we continue on our trajectory and enjoy the same level of success that we've enjoyed in other new markets that we've penetrated then we could achieve our 15% market share.", "David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And there's been, it's just been a quarter but there's been no change in the pace of market growth there, it sounds like?", "Lew Frankfort", "No. The market is moving. Quickly, Coach is growing much faster than the market but the market is, as we said earlier, it's going to double over the next four to five years.", "Michael Tucci", "David, I'll just remind you, sorry, Lew, to jump in here, but when we took over the Coach Japan business in '01, we had about 2% market share. And as we just reported, we're at 16% today. So we're excited about the opportunity that it kind of represents.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson. [BofA Merrill Lynch]", "Lorraine Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I was just hoping for an update on the sourcing environment. I know you mentioned margins would be down in the back half, but if you could just talk about the specific drivers here? And then also in the context of the higher handbag AUR in the full line stores, is this your strategy for offsetting some of the cost increases? And will we see continued higher prices going forward?", "Lew Frankfort", "I'll tell you what, I will take the sourcing cost question, and then I'll have Mike Tucci to answer the AUR question. But obviously, coming out of the quarter, we're absolutely thrilled with the levels of profitability in the business, gross margin and SG&A, both delivering 200 basis points of operating margin improvement. But as we've been talking about for three quarters now, we do anticipate seeing inflationary cost pressures that will impact our gross margin rates. We spent a lot of time on the last call going through a number of the initiatives we have in place to look and offset those, longer term, things like counter-sourcing, moving to production to Vietnam, to India, et cetera. So all of those activities continue ahead at full speed, and we just are enormously encouraged by the quarter that we just put in the books and feel that we can keep the top line growth going. We can deliver SG&A leverage that will help it offset some of these gross margin pressures and deliver very, very strong operating margin to the bottom line, similar to last year's level in spite of the pressures.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. on the AUR side, particularly within handbag, what we're experiencing is very balanced growth in handbags. We had a nice comp performance in handbags in Q1, and we're positioned well in Q2. There is some opportunity to raise or to get higher handbag AURs and we're very, very much focused on achieving that. It's mostly a function mix and how we own the goods. And what we're seeing is a very strong response to leather, to gathered leather, to novelty leather applications. Those, by nature, carry higher retails and the customer is voting yes on those. So while we're very committed to protecting our opening price point positioning, we're also seeing some upside in some of the elevated products. And we do believe that there's opportunity for us to nuance that going forward, and we'll take full advantage of it.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christine Chen. [Needham & Company]", "Paula Torch - Needham & Company, LLC", "This is Paula Torch calling for Christine. I wanted to ask a question about Europe. What is the long term potential there? And do you intend to have your own stores eventually besides flagship, or just through partnerships? And also if I may, on Europe, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on the customer. I know you said that she's a local and a tourist, but wondering more so what her purchases are like? How often does she shop? Any sort of price point differences, and anything that stands out in terms of collections that she's resonating towards versus the U.S. customer?", "Lew Frankfort", "There's a lot of talk to that. Let me begin by saying that Europe does represent a very substantial opportunity for Coach. Each market has its own unique differences over, on most generally, we will enter Europe with a multichannel strategy as we have in other countries. So you will see us having flagship stores, freestanding stores, shop-in-shops and outlet locations in addition to, and Internet presence. The way in which we're looking to establish the brand initially, it's through flagship locations in such markets as London and in Paris, whether the flagship is within a prestigious department store such as Printemps, or freestanding location. We are working with our local partners who have considerable know-how in the market, and we will continue to do that. I'm very pleased with the way things are going. I actually was in Spain and France just the other week, and it was exciting for me to visit our first shop which opened in Madrid and have a chance to see our little jewel and speak to consumers. And the consumers surprisingly, actually, have a very high awareness of Coach, and they did because of international travel. They appreciated the quality, the styling, the pricing, certainly, and the overall in-store experience. In addition, we're also benefiting from our growing awareness globally in the form of international travelers. So when we were in Printemps, just a day or two later, we saw a very broad mix of consumers, including, of course, substantial French consumers, but also international travelers particularly from China and Japan. And we believe that will help us form a very profitable business from the inception.", "Paula Torch - Needham & Company, LLC", "And just in terms of the collections so far, I mean, I realize that it's early. Maybe any price point preferences? Is she looking at a sweet spot?", "Lew Frankfort", "In general, she likes leather, and she likes stylish products. And Mike said earlier that we've had a very strong success in North America in Madison, particularly with our gathered leather, the Sophia style. That is our runaway number one style around the world. And we're actually chasing inventory for it. So we're finding that she is more sophisticated, more stylish and is looking for product that meets her current needs.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Tunick. [JP Morgan]", "Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just two quick ones, for I guess, Mike Devine. First one on the flat EBIT margin guidance, does that include or exclude the 53rd week from last year? And when does the SG&A leverage point really start to come down here? When is the max spending quarter for the year?", "Michael Devine", "Sure. That's a good question Brian. We really think about a 52-week compare in the main. Of course, that will only influence Q4, which during FY '10 was a 14-week quarter for us versus our usual 13 weeks. So as i speak to that, I really think it's appropriate to look at it on a comparable basis, so good clarifying question. In terms of at peak SG&A, actually, we're going to continue to open stores and invest in the business, so we'll continue the SG&A's dollar growth year-over-year. What I will say is that our second quarter, our December quarter, is obviously our most mature and evolved quarter. We've been a gift-giving resource for many, many years. So we'll be, this year as it has been in years past, the most difficult quarter to achieve SG&A leverage because we have so much leverage to begin with because of the high sales volumes. And where we'll really see that SG&A leverage kick in year-over-year as the top line continues to grow will be in the second half Q's 3 and Q4.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Randal Konik. [Jefferies & Company]", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Lew, is the consumer becoming less price-sensitive out there? What's your thoughts there? And then I guess to Mike Tucci, it sounds like we're getting a little bit closer to an inflection point on traffic in the Full Price business? Can we just get an update on where we are with that Full Price traffic trend, when we think it can reach that inflection point to a positive number?", "Lew Frankfort", "Randy, the consumer is cautious and she is price-sensitive. And as we've said before, what we have found is that she's looking for a combination of innovation, relevance and value. And the modified merchandising, pricing and marketing strategies we put into place over a year ago were effectively through the rebalancing of our assortment, we lowered our average price by about 10%, is resonating extremely well. And that positioning is our long-term strategy, to give consumers great product that stylish, well-made, out of excellent materials, at a very compelling price point. Mike?", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. Randy, Q1 was encouraging to us from a traffic standpoint. We did see some improvement from a sequential standpoint coming out of Q4. And I believe that these trends are cyclical. We are starting to lap our repositioning strategy, and I think that, that's an important opportunity for us to continue to build traction. This is a long-term game. And as we've established much more balance in our assortments, and I believe our product from an innovation standpoint continues to improve, it feels like traffic is moving in the right direction. It's very difficult to put a stake in the ground and predict exactly when the inflection point will occur. But we're feeling very good from a Full Price standpoint that we are both impacting traffic with internal initiatives that we're putting out there, pilots and marketing initiatives, as well as seeing the long-term benefit from our repositioning.", "Randal Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just to Lew, back on the pricing. It just seems that you're getting more response to some of these higher price-point products. You've talked a lot about the Madison collection, et cetera. It's been strong. Is it just a function of the fashion, the assortment's gotten a lot better from your standpoints, happens to be a little more priced? You get the leather in there. Is that what's really happening here?", "Lew Frankfort", "I think the answer is yes. I mean, Randy, when you look at the closet of our customer and while on average, she might have 10 to 12 bags in active use, and even a Coach loyal consumer would have, let's say, a few bags from other brands, in many households where the consumer is not price-sensitive, she's also carrying European luxury brands. And what we're finding by rebalancing our assortment, as Mike T has indicated in giving consumer a wide range of choices, we're able to let the consumer vote in the store at what rate she wants to purchase. The key for us was to rebalance our assortment. The strength that we're experiencing in the higher price points comes from incredibly appealing product in leather that represents great value.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Laura Champine. [Cowen and Company]", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC", "It seems that obviously, in the wholesale channel, that some of your customers are excited about holiday. It seems like you're stocking up as well in advance of holiday. What is it about your holiday assortment that makes you more positive going into the season?", "Lew Frankfort", "There's a variety of factors. First and most importantly, it's product. And the product that we are introducing for holiday, we have done substantial pilots, and early reads show that it's selling extremely well. So the sell-through that we're experiencing in Madison, in particular, and the expectation we have to other groups that we'll be introducing in November and December, are quite strong. And it's product that gives us that confidence.", "Michael Tucci", "Michael Tucci. Let me just add something, and I'd encourage you guys to keep an eye on it in your channel checks. We have also built a slightly different flow strategy for Q2. And you'll see us updating our product assortments more boldly throughout the quarter. So as we typically front loaded the quarter with an enormous October repositioning, while we did that with the relaunch of Madison this season, we also have strong newness hitting over the course of the next eight weeks, eight to 10 weeks. And that's really important, particularly in December where we're flowing in Alexandra, which offers us a real opportunity to capture sales on newness going into our peak 10- to 14-day period.", "Laura Champine - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And then just quick housekeeping for Mike Devine, is that 34% tax rate what we ought to model long term as well?", "Michael Devine", "Yes. We feel like the strategies we've put in place largely around our international tax strategies should hold for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dana Telsey. [Telsey Advisory Group]", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "As you expand your channels and geographies, how do you see it changing the operating margin parameters over the long term? Does your business get back to its former operating margin levels? And also, as you think about next spring in this next year with innovation being so important, what do you see for spring '11 in terms of envisioning new assortments, maybe by category or by price? How is it changing?", "Lew Frankfort", "Mike?", "Michael Devine", "I'll take the first half of the question, Dana. And I think we're very optimistic about the trajectory and shape of the curve long term around our operating margins. And what we'll see is as Full Price business reinvigorates and as our international businesses begin to take a bigger share of the total sales pie, those two positive things will begin in the main move gross margins forward or higher. And in terms of delivering SG&A leverage, again, if we continue to see the top line growth that we enjoyed in Q1, it's clear that we'll be able to deliver additional leverage. During the quarter, Mike Tucci's P&L and our P&L in Coach Japan, delivered a tremendous amount of SG&A leverage, allowing us to show the 10 points of leverage across the whole company as we continue to investment spend. As an example, the Coach China P&L showed 15 points of SG&A leverage against itself from a year ago. We're still growing our spending there faster than the top line, so it was a modest de-lever for the company as a whole. But just as an example, as Coach China begins or continues to grow top line and their spending year-over-year slows, they will continue to deliver operating margin expansion. So will we get back to record levels of '07? It's probably a few years out into our long-range plan but definitely the direction that we will head over time.", "Michael Tucci", "Dana, on the products side, we're pretty focused on Q2 but just to foreshadow the back half, we believe Poppy and Madison, as anchor collections, have continued strength through the back half. We're also very excited about Colette and Kristin as platforms that we can build on. And they really target a very important sort of classic-tailored consumer. There's obvious opportunity for us to continue to build on the Men's innovation piece in our existing stores and our Men's concept stores and our freestanding stores. And directionally, I want to really emphasize that we do believe there is pricing opportunity for us not in an enormous way, but we are projecting AUR improvement in handbags in the back half. We also are extremely pleased with the strength of our women's accessories business, which is trending really, really well. And we put a ton of innovation and function into that category, particularly in wallets and small bags, and that's checking very, very well, and that will continue.", "Andrea Resnick", "At this time, we're going to conclude our Q&A session so that we have time to have Lew make a couple of concluding remarks before the market opens today.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you, Angie, and thank you everybody for participating in the call. I think the quarter speaks for itself. And as I said at the very beginning of the question period, the confidence that we have coming out of this quarter after several quarters of continued double-digit growth really reinforces our confidence as a team. That the road map that we've articulated, as a growth company looking to achieve double-digit top line and bottom line growth over the next several years, is well within our sights and within our reach.", "Thank you, everyone, and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; and Mike Devine, Coach's CFO. Victor Luis, President, International Retail, will report on our Asia direct opportunity. ", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors.  Also please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. ", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our third fiscal quarter 2011 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Victor Luis will speak to our Asian direct businesses, providing an update on China and other markets in the region. Mike Devine will continue with details on financial and operational results of the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session where we will be joined by Mike Tucci, President, North American Retail. We'll end the Q&A shortly before 9:30 a.m. Luke will then conclude with some brief summary comments. ", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our quarterly results, including store sales and earnings growth and the continuation of excellent comparable store sales in our North American Retail businesses. ", "Our performance clearly demonstrates the brands of vitality across channels, geographies and bodes well for the future. Further, the ability to generate these results in light of the tragic events and their aftermath in Japan speaks to the diversification of our business model and the strength of our brand proposition globally. Beyond the top line, we are also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation.", "In addition, we make continued progress against our global business initiatives, including international expansion, men's and digital media. We experienced strong response to our new collection, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. Further, the announcement today of the increased dividend reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future.", "Before I review the quarter and provide an outlook for the category and our business, I would be remiss not to touch on the tragedy in Japan. Of course, we have been saddened by the devastation in Japan, but we're relieved to learn within days of the earthquake and tsunami that all Coach colleagues was accounted for and safe. ", "When I visited Japan  early April, I was impressed by the resiliency of the people and the progress made in restoring more normal conditions. And I was moved by the incredible spirit and tenacity of our own Coach Japan colleagues, who rallied together during a very difficult time.", "Moving on to some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter. First, earnings per share rose 23% to $0.62 compared with $0.50 in the prior year. Second, quarterly net sales totaled $951 million versus $831 million a year ago, an increase of 14%. Third, Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 15% to $832 million from $726 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter are robust, rising 10% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 16%. And fifth, sales in Japan were down 9% to prior year in constant currency and rose 1% in dollars. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China.", "During the quarter, and as part of our regular real estate review, we closed 3 North American Retail stores, while we opened 5 factory stores. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 344 full price and 134 factory stores in operation in North America.", "Moving to Japan. 4 locations were opened and 1 was closed. At quarter end, there were 174 total locations in Japan with 19 full price stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 29 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated travel retail locations. As noted in our release, 7 stores in the Sendai area remained closed due to damage at quarter end, with 3 reopened this month. And in China, we added 4 new locations all in the mainland and closed 1 store in Hong Kong. ", "At the end of the quarter, there were 55 Coach locations in China, including 9 in Hong Kong, 2 in Macau and 44 locations on the mainland in 18 cities. As we've discussed previously, there are nearly 120 cities in China with a population of 1 million or more, and we are building a multichannel distribution model with a focus on the mainland to leverage this opportunity.", "Indirect sales increased 14% to $119 million from $105 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments and to international wholesale in U.S. department stores given positive POS sales trends in both businesses. Specifically, sales for the quarter at retail in international wholesale locations was strong, driven by new distribution, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores rose 4% for the quarter.", "We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the third quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in calendar year 2010. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 13% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, handbag and accessory sales rose 17%. We continue to estimate that the category will increase to $9 billion this year, surpassing its previous peak achieved 3 years ago.", "Separately, it's worth noting, our customers' outlook for the economy has been stable over the last few quarters, with a third of those surveyed still believing that the U.S. economy is improving. Their intention to purchase Coach remains high with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. ", "Our total revenues in North America rose 16%, with our directly operated businesses up similarly, driven by 10.3% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. Fueling these overall store and comp results were similarly strong gains in both channels with significant gains in conversion from prior year and a modest growth in average transaction size, partially offset by a decline in traffic due to the calendar shift. We were particularly pleased with the improvement in conversion rates since it's a driver that we have the most control over in product and service.", "We have also been delighted by our traction on the Web notably the North American coach.com business. While we view this channel primarily as a marketing vehicle, traffic and sales at our site continue to grow at a double-digit pace during the third quarter, driven by our base business, as well as our efforts in social media where we now have over 1.8 million Facebook fans. ", "Additionally, next month, we're looking forward to the launch of mobile commerce in North America, another digital platform for customers to engage with our brand. As noted in Japan, we posted a 1% increase in dollar, a decline of 9% in constant currency. It's worth noting that prior to the events of March 11, we were on track to deliver another quarter of slight growth in yen terms. Our market share further expanded against continued contraction in the category. ", "Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest-growing business. During the quarter, our sales continued to rise rapidly from prior year, fueled by distribution growth and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who is participating in this category, increasing numbers. Victor will talk more about our opportunity in China shortly.", "Across all Full Price businesses, our robust results reflect the strength of our offering. As always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Beginning on December 24, we transitioned to spring with the introduction of the Colette collection offered across multiple fabrications and silhouettes anchored by both our hobo and tote styles. This was followed by the relaunch of Poppy in February and the new Kristin collection in March. ", "With its distinctive hardware and soft feminine styling, Kristin is an important collection for Coach and has been the feature of our spring ad campaign. This season's product was very well received, and both handbags and women's accessories achieved strong comps in the quarter with handbag penetration in our North American retail stores rising to 60% from 59% last year, driven by unit comp sales increases and a slight increase in average unit retails.", "Just this month, we introduced the collection of Natalie novelty store totes along with new colors  and a Dream C print and Poppy. And last week, we launched Audrey, a modern tote story featuring perforated leather, op art and print concepts. Additionally, our lead collection for Mothers' Day is Madison offered in fresh colors and patterns. For June, we're introducing new leather and pattern colors at Kristin, as well as a strong new op art  print. Our Kristin hobo continues to be the key item within the collection.", "In addition, this July, we will launch a new Chelsea collection and evolve Poppy with updated styles, patterns and prints. ", "On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Additionally, our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the quarter. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns.", "I also wanted to spend a moment", "[Audio Gap]", "Which are located next to or nearby our most productive factory locations, are performing extremely well. We believe the strong consumer response we're experiencing reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the factory consumers' focus on value and function. It confirms our belief that there is a particularly large opportunity for Men's in our factory channel. ", "In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our overall full price productivity. In addition, we're very pleased with the current sales trends in both our full price and factory channels and are well positioned on Mother's Day and the balance of the spring season. ", "Our strategies continue to be focused on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we are focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. I just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to global growth in the seasons and years ahead.", "Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in previous earnings calls, we expect that our  square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year, compared to 8% last year. Starting in North America, we will open 3 stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, bringing the total to 8 new North American retail stores for the year.  In addition, we will open 9 new factory stores during the balance of the year, primarily on our Men's initiative, bringing the total to 14 dedicated men's factory stores and 8 traditional factory stores for the year. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year.", "I want to finally touch on Europe, a new region of expansion for Coach. To date, we have opened 7 boutiques and Printemps department stores in France. And through our JV with Hackett, we launched the brand with 4 shop-in-shops in Spain and 1 in Lisbon, with 1 more to go before year-end, all within El Corte Ingles. Last month, we opened our first retail store in the U.K. in the Westfield White City Mall and have been very pleased with its early results. ", "Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff in September and a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as through prestigious international specialty retailers, While still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer, and we were very pleased to announce the appointment of Val\u00e9rie Herman as President and CEO, Reed Krakoff, who joined us just this month from YSL.", "Earlier this fiscal year, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with 3 major Asian hubs: Japan, mainland China and other Asian markets. We also announced the addition of 3 senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key to this new organization was the promotion of Victor Luis to the newly created position of President, Coach Retail International, with a responsibility for all of Coach's Directly-owned businesses outside North America. ", "I will now and the turn the call over to Victor. Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Thanks, Lew. To put the opportunity in perspective, the premium bag and accessory market in Asia, including Japan, is nearly $12 billion today. And in contrast to the global market, which is about 85% women's and 15% men's, in Asia, Men's represents nearly 1/4 of the spend. ", "Excluding Japan, the market is growing at a double-digit rate led by mainland China. In addition, Hong Kong, Korea and Southeast Asia are all expected to grow at more than 10% for the next several years, while Taiwan is projected to grow at a slightly slower pace. Overall, the region offers excellent potential where we can leverage our well-honed retail skills and international experience to drive the business, as we have done in Japan and are now doing in China. Coach is already among the top 5 brands in these markets with at least a mid-single digit share, and we have proven strategies in place to increase brand awareness and grow sales.", "In Japan, the overall consumer market has been challenging for some years, and the category has contracted. Our goal was and continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's where we've already seen early success. ", "As Lew noted earlier, we do expect the continued impact from the tragedy over the next few months, primarily a function of reduced traffic as the infrastructure problems in the northern and eastern parts of the country remain, resulting in transportation and power issues. ", "However, barring  further significant aftershocks or worsening of the nuclear crisis, we expect our business to continue to show steady improvement. We expect to open 2 more stores in the fourth quarter for a total of 9 new Coach Japan locations, including 5 Men's stores for the year. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 4% this year, similar to last year.", "Moving on to China, our largest geographic growth opportunity, where our sales are growing rapidly against a strong market backdrop. We will be adding 11 locations in the fourth quarter, 9 on the mainland and 2 in Hong Kong, taking us to 26 openings for the year and a total of 66 locations. As you know, we doubled sales in FY '10 to over $100 million and are now on track to generate sales of about $185 million this year, up from our estimates of $175 million shared on our last earnings call. We are targeting a 10% market share of what is projected to be over a $5 billion market or about $500 million in sales by FY '14, up from about a 5% share today.", "Driving this growth, we expect to add about 30 new locations per annum during our planning horizon, focused on the mainland and across a multichannel model, including flagship, stand-alone retail stores, shop-in-shops and department stores and factory stores. ", "In addition, based on our conversion opportunity against already strong traffic trends as the consumer becomes increasingly qualified to purchase luxury accessories, we expect to continue to achieve double-digit comp rates over this planning horizon. ", "In fact, our research indicates that the purchasing  population is growing at nearly 20% annually, driven by the growth in the target segment, primarily through income gains and the increasing participation rate in the category itself. ", "We would also note that in China, men participate heavily in the category both for self purchase and for gifting to other men and represent nearly half of the spend and up to 50% or more of our competitive set sales, yielding another opportunity for Coach. ", "Further, as we grow awareness in China, we benefit globally from the growth in mainland China tourists as they visit and shop in key capitals around the world. In fact, we estimate that sales to mainland Chinese nationals represent as much as 25% of sales globally to our major competitors. ", "Today, sales to Chinese nationals represents only 5% of Coach's global sales. Therefore, there is tremendous opportunity for us to take a larger share of a growing market where our proposition is clearly resonating and where building our distribution, team and awareness will lead to continued growth. As you may remember, China is the market where Coach enjoys its highest repurchase intent among existing consumers with over 90% of Coach shoppers expressing a positive intent to repurchase.", "In FY '12, we will make significant investments towards awareness building as we leverage a 70th anniversary campaign as a foundation to build on our positioning as the New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign will have several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. Beyond our Directly-owned business in China, we have significant wholesale businesses throughout Asia, and Lew referred to the strong sales growth we're experiencing in this channel earlier", "Some months ago, we announced that we've signed an agreement to take control of our Domestic Retail businesses in Singapore and Malaysia, which, together, generate annual sales at retail of about $50 million. The agreement provides for a phase transition of the current Coach Retail businesses over the next year, beginning this July with Singapore. While the impact of the transition will be small, it is an important step towards controlling our future in Asia. ", "We are especially excited about a new Singapore flagship on prestigious Orchard Road, which will be a directly-operated store opening in spring 2012. It will immediately raise brand awareness as Singapore is an important tourist gateway in Southeast Asia, serving the Indonesian and Indian shopper, while increasingly attracting mainland Chinese consumers as well.", "We also have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in Korea, the second largest market for premium leather goods after Japan and the region; and Taiwan. Together, they represent about $200 million at retail for Coach in FY '11, serving both the domestic and travel retail customer through about 80 locations, over 50 in Korea and 30 in Taiwan. ", "Given our focus in the region during this fiscal year, of the nearly 40 targeted new international wholesale locations, more than 20 will be in Asia. ", "Separately, it's important to note that our Asia distribution center and Asia shared services center are online, shipping globally and prepared to provide savings, while also serving as a back office backbone for Coach China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and any future directly operated markets in the region. Simply put, it is ready to be scaled for leverage across the region. ", "In summary, we are excited about the global opportunity for Coach, especially the emerging market potential given the rapid growth of the category and the foundation which we have begun to build in the key Asia region. ", "At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Mike?", "Michael Devine", "Thank you, Victor. Lew and Victor have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. ", "As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 14% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over 3/4 of our business, up 15% and Indirect up 14%. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 23% to $0.62, as compared to $0.50 in the year-ago period, as net income rose to $186 million from $158 million. ", "As noted in the press release, we estimate that the events in Japan impacted sales by approximately $20 million and earnings per share by about $0.025 during March and the third quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating income totaled $280 million in the third quarter, up 12% from $249 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 29.4%, compared to 30% even in the year-ago period.", "In the third quarter, gross profit rose to $692 million from $616 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.8%, compared with 74.1% a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing costs.", "Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain 70 basis points of leverage in the quarter. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, also on a non-GAAP basis, improved from prior year levels in the third quarter and represented 43.4% of sales versus 44.1%. ", "Once again, our primary Direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.", "As noted in our press release, we recorded certain one-time items during the third quarter, which resulted in a substantially lower tax rate of 26.5%. These included a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination, which decreased Coach's provision for taxes by $16 million. ", "In addition, the company made a $21 million contribution to the Coach Foundation and also contributed JPY 400 million or just under $5 million to the Japanese Red Cross. Together, these contributions totaled nearly $26 million pretax, impacting GAAP SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and EPS.", "Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at quarter end were $391 million, up 28% from the end of last year's Q3, but up 9% on a two-year basis. Our current inventory support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this spring. Generally, it's worth reminding everyone that we've been rightsizing our inventory this year, bringing it up to more appropriate levels to support our growth. Including new initiatives such as Men's, global square footage expansion, Reed Krakoff and our new distribution center in Asia. ", "Cash and short-term investments totaled $886 million, as compared with $908 million a year ago despite repurchases of nearly $1.2 billion worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 3.5 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $54.51 per share, spending a total of $192 million. At the end of the period, approximately $1.3 billion remained under our repurchase authorization.", "Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $227 million, compared to $205 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $186 million versus $190 million in the same period last year due to higher net income, offset by working capital and fixed-asset expenditures. ", "Our CapEx spending was $42 million versus $15 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our last 3 earnings call, based on our plans for the year, we expect that CapEx would be about $150 million, primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies. ", "Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew has said, we're well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. While we do not give specific guidance, as you know, I always think it's helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when forecasting the finish of our year.", "First and most generally, we continue to target double-digit sales increases globally with double-digit earnings growth. And given the ongoing strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve high-single digit same-store sales growth in North America for the fourth quarter, even in the face of more difficult compares. Additionally, we expect the continuation of our positive POS trends in our Indirect businesses. ", "As noted in our release, given current conditions and projections for Japan, we expect a similar impact in the full fourth quarter of about $20 million or 2% to total Coach sales and about $0.02 to $0.03 to earnings per share. However, as discussed on prior calls, our fourth quarter comparisons will be impacted by the timing of shipments in our Indirect businesses and the extra week in the prior year's fourth quarter. As you may recall, this extra week contributed $70 million of sales and $0.08 of EPS to last year's Q4.", "Second, we were excited that our top line sales growth drove higher levels of profitability in the first 9 months of the year. While our previous comments regarding gross margins still stand, our sales growth, coupled with controlled spending, will help offset both cost and channel mix pressures. ", "Therefore, we're reiterating our previous guidance of a full year FY '11 operating margin at about last year's levels of about 31.5% on a 52-week basis, despite the quake-related shortfall in our very profitable Japan business. ", "Third, our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to stay in the area achieved in the first 9 months for the balance of the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies. And fourth, I did want to update our share count guidance. We now believe that our fourth quarter average will be similar to 3Q at about $302 million on a fully diluted basis.", "Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earliest words. This was another excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains for the foreseeable future. ", "Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. And now Lew, Victor, Mike Tucci, Andrea and I will take some questions, which will then be followed by a brief comment from Lew, who is, I'm sure you can tell, is suffering from a touch of laryngitis but is hanging in boldly. So now we'll open the floor up to questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "I guess I'd like to ask the team a question about China, really [indiscernible]  spent a lot of time on it. Can you size the opportunity longer term? Do you think it can be bigger than your North American business? And can you address any goals or your thinking around the profitability of that region in a near term, but even longer term?", "Lew Frankfort", "Why don't I begin, and then turn it over to Victor. First Bob,  the opportunity in China is boundless. It's still early days. Our market share is only in the area of 5%. Our category is growing rapidly. We like to set our reasonable milestones. So our first challenge is for China to surpass Japan, which today is at over USD $700 million, and China this year, as we reported, will do about $185 million. On an effort to actually eclipse the U.S., we will need to become the # 1 brand in China at a time when the China accessories  market is large enough to support our such sales. Is it something that might occur? Perhaps, but we in the end have a long way to go. Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. I would add that today, we're looking at a market in China that's approximately $3.2 billion, including travel retail, which we expect to grow to approximately $7 billion by FY '15. So already larger than Japan, which today is approximately $4 billion and where, as Lew mentioned, we today are over $700 million in sales. So we do see tremendous growth in a market where, as Lew mentioned in his remarks, we have at least 120 cities with a population of 1 million or more and truly tremendous opportunity in terms of distribution as well. China is developing as a wonderful market for multichannel distribution, both in department stores where we have tremendous opportunity. There are today approximately 600 department stores in China, of which approximately 100 of them already have luxury cosmetics, with sales approaching the top 100 department stores in Japan as another great measure, as well as the rapidly-developing shopping mall and slowly but surely developing factory outlet mall channel, which will be another terrific opportunity for us. So we're truly excited, and I would echo Lew's comments that we do feel the opportunity to truly be boundless. I'll turn it over to Mike for some comments on profitability.", "Michael Devine", "Yes, Bob, as you've heard us say many times on these calls and in other forums, we're very excited about the level of profitability we feel the China business can   achieve for a couple of fundamental reasons. Firstly, we do sell through at a premium to North America pricing in the region, not premiums as rich as Japan's but in the neighborhood. And so our gross margin rates in China are quite robust rivaling even that of the Japan business. In terms of store four-walls, we are already seeing four-walls nicely into the 40% range and so that's driven of course by that gross margin rate. But also as you might suspect, our store wages are lower in China than they are anywhere else in the world, contributing to a healthy  four-wall. And as we gain in productivity and the brand gains awareness with landlords, we'll see our occupancy rate. The other big expense items on the store P&L begin to decline as a percentage of sales further enhancing store four-walls. Victor mentioned in his prepared remarks our approach to the region with a Asia distribution center and an Asia shared service center. So we're keyed to drive an efficient back office infrastructure to support both the China business and Pan-Asian approach. So all of those things taken together a lot of words will drive very, very healthy rates of profit and volume of profits from the region as we move into '12 and beyond.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you, Mike.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "And Mike, I just have one quick follow up. On the $0.025 hit from Japan this quarter, can you give us an estimate on how detrimental Japan was to the gross margin that you reported this morning?", "Michael Devine", "Yes, it could be helpful, Bob. Clearly, with Japan being one of our highest gross margin regions, losing that $20 million was hurtful of the gross margin rate but relatively immaterial. We certainly would've recorded a modestly higher gross margin rate, but it is a small percentage of the total company's business, and we were able to absorb it. I would add, though, I have to take this opportunity, that had we had that $20 million of sales and about $0.025 of earnings, we would have actually seen operating margin that leverage. We were -- did come up just short of Q3's op income level. Had we had the $20 million of that very profitable Japanese business, we would've seen operating margin improvement, which I have to say coming into the quarter, I do not think was going to be possible. So the business operated very efficiently across all geographies and mature businesses during the quarter. Similarly, I would just say for the fourth quarter, same dynamic. In our own projections that we've just kind of shared with you, we will see some very modest operating margin deleverage for the quarter. We would have gotten operating margin leverage had we not had the quake impact. Of course these are all forward-looking statements now to talk about fourth quarter. But I do think it demonstrates the diversity of our business model globally that we're able to absorb this profitable loss and still project that we can hit 31.5% op income for the year, kind of what we've been pointing to for a number of quarters now. So in a way I'm thinking about that as an increasing guidance, if you will, adjusted for the quake impact.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. Congratulations on a nice quarter.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you, Kimberly.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "I'm wondering if you can talk about your outlook for sourcing cost inflation and the pricing strategies as you look into the back half of calendar 2011. And Mike, if you could just remind us about your gross margin outlook here for the remainder of the calendar year, that would be helpful.Thanks.", "Michael Devine", "Sure. Kimberly, we're essentially in the same place on gross margin as we have been in terms of our guidance for the balance of FY '11. You'll recall that we were one of the first companies to talk about inflationary pressures well over a year ago, and that's holding. That being said, there are a number of positive things going on within gross margin to help offset these pressures. And we're guardedly optimistic that we'll see some modest sequential improvement actually in the first half of our FY '12, the back half of this calendar year versus the second half of our FY '11. It's because of counter-sourcing efforts, material inflation will not hit us as hard as others. The other thing that will be helpful is we'll also begin to anniversary those higher input costs from early last year's fiscal '11. Wage inflation is our biggest issue and we're battling that by moving products into lower-cost countries. We're ahead of schedule on this initiative, but it is still very early days there. And so while we are protecting our opening price points, we are also surgically taking advantage of pricing power, and we're doing this in both channels, both in our full price and our factory channel. The other thing we'll start to see which will be very helpful, is channel mix will actually begin to help us, we believe, as we move into FY '12, which will be a nice thing as growth in the Asian region that Victor spoke to helps channel mix there. And also just the underlying trends in our Full Price business in our mature markets of North America and Japan will also help channel mix. So we still are feeling good about our previous guidance gross margin in the boundary of 72% to 73%, going forward. We feel it very achievable.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks, Mike. Is it helpful at all that global automobile production is expected to fall short, this year, of the prior expectation? I think that the auto industry is one of the largest consumers of leather.", "Lew Frankfort", "It's a very good point, Kimberly. It's a supply and demand equation of course, as you would imagine. And so if demand is down, that will certainly help buyers of leather. Our team has done an amazing job counter-sourcing, and leather is not a big driver of our inflationary cost pressure, especially year-over-year. So the issue you bring up will be helpful to us but somewhat immaterial to the total reported gross margin with all the other factors that impact it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.", "Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Let me also add my congratulations on a great quarter. Victor, thanks for joining the call. And I'm just wondering if you can walk us through a little bit more on some of the evolution of this company as you go from just being primarily 2 geographies to multi-geography? Clearly, you spoke to the back office aspect as in the shared services but could you give us a sense again and just let us know how you guys are designing for the different geographies and buying from designs? Are you doing a good global design and then having regional people purchase towards the preferences of each individual consumer? Just help us understand that a little bit more as the company continues to clearly grow globally.", "Victor Luis", "Sure, as you all know of course, we have 1 design team, which is based here in New York, and that design team does design globally. In each of our geographies, we have in-market merchants who, constantly, with the support of our consumer insights team, are looking to understand the consumer and provide the design team with some logic to add to the magic that they of course do in designing the product. We have a very strong merchant team in Japan. We have today a merchant team in Shanghai, as well as Hong Kong, that is developing. And those teams provide the inputs into New York and then we'll buy from a global assortment, which occasionally, of course, is tweaked to meet local needs. On the whole, though, I would say that our assortments are rather global. In Japan, China, collections such as Madison, Poppy and Kristin, which are today  the main drivers in the North American business, are also main drivers for us in the region. There may be some functional areas that we have to tweak, whether it be in smaller goods or in handbags. As an example, for example, in handbags across Asia, across body bags, given the amount of commuting that takes place, do tend to have a higher penetration than say here in North America. That is something that we simply input into our buys locally. And I think one of the most important differences, as I've mentioned in my remarks, is the Men's opportunity. In Japan, the Men's market of that $4 billion size today, represents approximately 20%. In mainland China, it can represent 50% to more for most of our competitor brands, and it's approaching about 50% of the market, again. In Hong Kong, Macau and the rest of the region, and we're looking at 25% to 30% as well. And so our, in-market merchant teams are working very, very closely with our central merchandising teams and our design team to ensure that those very specific needs of that specific Asian male consumer are met. And so it's a highly collaborative effort with a tremendous amount of consumer insights, as well as, of course, the design talent, which is very much focused on presenting 1 New York Coach aesthetic to the world based here in New York.", "Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies", "That's really helpful, Victor, thanks. And good luck and feel better, Lew", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Rick Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Rick Patel in for Lorraine. Can you just update us on your mix of handbags priced below $300? Do you feel this mix is appropriate today, given what you're seeing in the marketplace? And how should we expect that to change over time?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. We have -- we've been very dedicated to this overarching $300 price positioning. Our handbag under $300 penetration and offer is right at about 50%. We see that as being a really important level for us, and we also see some trend growth happening in leather, which is impacting price point, gives us an opportunity to nuance some of our pricing in a positive way. There's some margin opportunity there. And we had very, very nice growth incidentally in handbags over $400. With that penetration, it went to about 18% versus 10% in the prior year. That's a big deal and driven very much by this leather trend that we're seeing. I think just to add a sense or two on factory, very similar trends there, strong leather trends. And we had a very nice AUR increase in handbag in the Factory business, while maintaining what we think is the competitive positioning in that channel.", "Rick Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch", "That's helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Christine Chen, Needham & Company.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Thank you and congratulations on a good quarter.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you, Christine.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "I wanted to ask about your Factory business. Your factory channel seems to be really clean of full price inventory. Wondering what the percentage of factory, specific factory exclusive it was in the quarter versus last year? And then wondering about footwear, what is it as a percentage of your total? And is it driving the increases at the department store level? Or is it pretty equal between bags and footwear there?", "Victor Luis", "Christine, I think you're breaking up a little bit, but the essence of your question was around mix of product in Factory.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Yes.", "Michael Devine", "Where we saw again a very, very strong contribution from factory exclusives, terrific response to newness there. The level there was 86%, and that's been a running average for us, in about that zone. Again, a forward [indiscernible] pricing and margin flexibility there, and we see that continuing. Our Footwear business is very good, stable. We don't have a significant Footwear business in our factory channel but on the Full Price side, our Footwear business continues to be positive.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "What about at the department store level?", "Michael Devine", "On the department store side, our Footwear business has also been healthy. We haven't seen account growth there, but we're very much focused on what we see as an assortment productivity opportunity in the wholesale channel, and that has been very successful for it this spring.", "Lew Frankfort", "We enjoyed that 5% market share in that channel.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "And have you been able to pull back on some of the promotions at Factory?", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "I'm sorry, I said were you less promotional at the factory channel?", "Michael Devine", "In fact, our margins in Factory were slightly better, and our promotional levels were pretty much even with the year prior.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC", "Great. Thank you, and good luck.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Schick, Stifel Nicolaus.", "David Schick", "When we hear about 40%-plus I think you said four-wall contribution in China and that's the fastest-growing business you have, and it feels like Men's is partially what Coach is doing around Men's but also maybe a growing global marketplace for Men's or demand for Men's. And we look back at what you've done margin-wise. How should see operating margin-wise? What should we think about ,for operating margin 5 or 7 -- not in the immediate planning future but 5 or 7 years out, should it be higher than what you've achieved in the past? Given those new businesses growing at higher margins?", "Lew Frankfort", "It's a provocative question, David. There are so many factors that go into  determining operating margins including, of course, our raw material cost. Our general view is that operating margins should continue at the 30%-plus level and could very well approach the mid-30s over the next few years.", "David Schick", "You've done better than that. Beyond that given the growth [indiscernible]", "Lew Frankfort", "Think boldly, David.", "David Schick", "Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Paul Lejuez with Nomura.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Thanks, guys. Just wondering as you think about the European expansion how much of your store growth will be centered on tourist-type destinations versus stores that are more likely to attract a more local customer? Thanks.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good question. And initially, a good portion of our business will be focused on tourists because we're opening major locations in major cities where tourist accounts for a majority of business within those markets. As we develop awareness and interest on the brand among locals and expand our fleet to the secondary cities as well as the suburbs, we will see that mix change.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Thanks, and good luck.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you for your attention, and now I'll turn it back to Lew for a few closing words. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "Just a few. I wasn't sure whether my voice was going to last through the call. Of course, we posted an excellent quarter. As you well know, I think all of you are familiar with our track record. We feel very good about where we're positioned for the rest of the spring season and for the fall and do look forward to double-digit top line and bottom line growth and would like you along for the journey. Have a good day.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you everyone for your attention. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude the Coach earnings conference call.

", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth. This quarter's performance demonstrated a continuation of the momentum we have been experiencing throughout FY '11, as we continue to improve productivity while expanding our distribution in new and existing geographies. Our results reflect a growing recognition of the Coach brand globally and the success of our new initiatives. ", "Before I review the highlights of the quarter, I wanted to mention our CFO transition. First, as you know, Mike Devine announced his retirement earlier this year effective later this month. This will be his last earnings call with Coach, and we will miss Mike greatly. Mike has played a critical role in developing and executing the strategies that have driven our superior sales and earnings growth during his tenure with the company. We wish him every success in the future. At the same time, we're pleased to welcome Jane Nielsen as our new CFO who will be officially starting in early September.", "Moving on with some key highlights of our quarter and fiscal year. Our performance in FY '11 was highlighted by increases of 18% in revenues, 20% in operating income and 30% in earnings per share, all on a comparable 52-week basis. It was a year of many milestones including, first, Coach surpassed $4 billion in sales, driven by gains in all of our business units. Second, we placed an increased emphasis on the globalization of our business, as we accelerated our international distribution growth, especially in Asia while we continued to open new stores and gain market share in North America. Third, we successfully refocused on the men's opportunity for Coach, as we began to open dedicated men's and dual gender locations globally, doubling the business year-over-year. And fourth, we increased our quarterly dividend by 50% and authorized another $1.5 billion buyback in January, demonstrating our financial strength, cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholder return. ", "This annual performance was capped off by an excellent fourth quarter. Some key metrics were: first, net sales totaled $1.03 billion, an increase of 17% on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.68, up 22% from the $0.56 in the prior year on a same 13-week basis. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 18% on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 10% on a comparable basis from prior year while total North American store sales rose 18%. Fifth, sales in Japan rose 6% in dollars and declined 7% in constant currency, also on a comparable basis, modestly impacted by the ongoing effects of the earthquake and tsunami. And finally, we continue to generate very strong sales and comps in China.", "During the quarter, we opened 3 North American Retail stores, including 2 in new markets for Coach, Fredericksburg, Virginia and Albuquerque, New Mexico, as well as our first mall-based men's store in Copley Plaza in Boston. We also closed 2 locations. In addition, we opened 9 factory stores, including 6 men's dedicated locations. ", "At the end of FY '11, there were 345 full price and 143 factory stores in operation in North America. This was a net increase of 3 full price stores, including one men's retail store, as well as 8 factory stores and 14 men's factory stores from the end of FY '10. Total square footage grew 7% for the year. ", "Moving to Japan, 2 locations were added, a shop-in-shop and a men's factory store. Separately, all but 2 of the stores that were closed due to the earthquake and tsunami had reopened by year end. And over the last month, the remaining 2 have reopened. ", "At year end, there were 176 total locations in Japan, with 20 stand-alone full price stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 30 factory stores and 7 Duty Free locations. In total, a net of 9 locations were added in Japan during FY '11, and 3 were expanding, yielding total square footage growth of about 4%. ", "And in China, we added 11 new locations, 9 on the Mainland and 2 in Hong Kong. At the end of the quarter, there were 66 Coach locations in China, including 53 locations in the Mainland and 22 cities. Additionally, there were 11 locations in Hong Kong and 2 in Macau. In aggregate, there was an increase of 25 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 62%. ", "Indirect sales, which represent about 13% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 12% on a comparable 13 to 13-week basis or 4% as reported to $113 million. This increase was driven by both international wholesale shipments and shipments into U.S. department stores. ", "At POS, international sales rose significantly, driven by both distribution and comps, while U.S. department store sales rose high single digits. ", "We estimate that the addressable U.S. women's handbag and accessory category rose 5% to 10% during our fiscal fourth quarter. Over the same period, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 14% across all channels in North America including in our own stores. ", "For the fiscal year ended June, we estimate that the addressable category rose about 10% to approximately $9.3 billion, while Coach's North American bag and accessories sales rose 14% across all channels and 17% in our own stores over the same period. ", "Separately, it's worth noting our customers' outlook for the economy has been stable over the last few quarters with 1/3 of those surveyed still believing that the U.S. economy is improving. Our intention to purchase Coach remains high, with over 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months.", "Our total revenues in North America was up 17% in the quarter on a comparable 13-week to 13-week basis, with our directly operated stores up 18%, as distribution growth augmented the comp performance. ", "Fueling these overall comp results were strong gains in both the full price and factory channels, driven by significant increases in conversion from prior year while ticket and traffic were essentially the same. We were particularly pleased with the improvement in the conversion rate since it is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service. ", "We also have been delighted by the very strong sales trends we're experiencing in our North American coach.com business, our largest store which, of course, is also extremely profitable. While we have long viewed this channel primarily as a marketing vehicle, sales growth accelerated at a significant double-digit pace during the fourth quarter. We expect that Internet sales will grow rapidly in the years ahead while also importantly driving consumers into the stores. ", "While the fall season is just underway, we are pleased with our current trends and consumers' continued response to our product and positioning. As noted for the quarter, we posted a 7% decrease in local currency in Japan and a 6% gain in dollars, excluding the extra week from last year's results. Five of the 7 stores that remain closed at the end of March due to earthquake and tsunami damage reopened during the fourth quarter, and the remaining 2 just reopened this month as mentioned. Generally, business in Japan is trending where it was prior to the events of March 11, as business improved over the period. ", "Naturally, I want to call out China, which is our single largest geographic growth opportunity. During the fourth quarter, as for all previous quarters this year, we achieved significant double-digit comp growth. And as I referenced earlier, we are opening stores primarily on the Mainland where increasing numbers of consumers are participating in the category. ", "Moving on to product. During the fourth quarter, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. In April, we introduced a collection of Natalie novelty straw totes along with new colors and a Dream C print in Poppy. In May, we launched Audrey, a modern tote story featuring perforated leather, op art and print concepts. Additionally, our lead collection for Mother's Day was Madison, offered in fresh colors and patterns. For June, we introduced new leather and pattern colors in Kristin, as well as a strong new op art print. Our Kristin hobo continues to be the key item within the collection. This season's product was very well-received, and both handbags and women's accessories achieved strong comps in the quarter with handbag penetration in our North American Retail stores remaining at 55%. ", "In addition, in July, we launched the new Chelsea collection and evolved Poppy with updated styles, patterns and prints. The Chelsea collection features a modern faceted turnlock inspired by our heritage and offered in timeless silhouettes. Poppy has an updated look with new leather and local fabrics and new pushlock closures. ", "In August, we're offering new fall fabrications, colors and patterns in Madison and a new shoulder bag in Chelsea. On the factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introductions with key styles offered at great prices. Additionally, our inventory investment strategy enabled us to capture sales upside throughout the quarter. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. ", "Naturally, I also want to touch on men's, a global initiative. As many of you know, we decided about 18 months ago that we would create a strong capability to leverage our reputation in the marketplace for quality leather men's products. Over this period, we've built a team and the infrastructure to become a market leader in the men's category. And we\u2019ve begun to expand our global footprint in men's. In the U.S., we've opened 3 full price dedicated men stores: Bleecker Street in New York, Copley Plaza in Boston and, most recently, Garden State in New Jersey. In addition, we've created about 40 dedicated men's concept shops in select full price flagships. We also opened a total of 14 North American men's dedicated factory stores as mentioned. Our results have exceeded our expectations and underscore the opportunity for Coach men's in the U.S. ", "Outside of the U.S., where the male customer tends to be more style conscious, we've also opened a number of men's dedicated stores, notably in Japan where we have 7 men's stores today. Our future store growth in Japan will primarily be dedicated men's locations. More generally, in Asia, including China, we are seeing excellent early results from dual gender stores. ", "Our first year results have been excellent, as our men's sales doubled to over $200 million in FY '11. This performance underscores our confidence in men's as a significant growth driver for Coach, and we now believe it could contribute 25% or more of the company's growth over the next several years. ", "As we enter FY '12 beyond the men's initiative, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We will continue to focus on expansion opportunities, both in North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.", "Moving on to distribution growth. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% in FY '12 compared to 9% last year. ", "Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores in FY '12 with more than half being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect to open about 15 net new full price locations, about half will be men's, and 25 factory outlets, including 15 men's stores. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 7% this year in line with last year and driven by men's.", "As we've discussed many times, outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity, given the size of the market and the rate of growth. The Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. ", "Our sales in China totaled over $185 million, up from $108 million last year, as the market grew rapidly, and we increased our share to 6% on the Mainland. In addition, our unaided brand awareness among P.R.C. consumers jumped to 16%, about double last year's level. This year, we will accelerate new store openings with about 30 locations planned for the Mainland. The vast majority will be dual gender stores, given the size of the men's opportunity in China. Overall, we're now projecting sales of between $280 million and $300 million for FY '12, up from our previous guidance of $250 million. We also intend to open a few locations in Hong Kong in FY '12, along with 1 or 2 in Singapore where we just acquired the operations of our distributor last month as planned. ", "In FY '12, we will make significant investments towards increasing awareness in China, as we leverage our 70th anniversary campaign to build on our positioning as a New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign will have several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. ", "In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. As discussed, we're now also focusing on men's where we have seen early success.", "During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan, nearly all of them dedicated men's doors. In total, we expect the net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 3% last year. ", "Finally, beyond our directly owned international businesses in Japan, China and now Singapore, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. We're also pleased to announce distribution agreements to open the first Coach stores in Brazil, which are expected to open next spring, and in Vietnam with the first openings expected late this calendar year. During FY '12, we expect to open between 35 to 40 net new international wholesale locations, bringing our total number to nearly 250. ", "Touching on Europe. Last year, we opened a total of 14 locations, including 7 in Printemps in France and through our JV with Hackett, 6 shop-in-shops in El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, 5 in Spain and 1 in Lisbon, along with 1 retail store in the U.K. We've been pleased with our initial performance and the early reaction of domestic shoppers and international tourists to the Coach proposition. For FY '12, we expect 3 additional openings in Printemps, including 2 men's shops, as well as a number of new locations in Spain, the U.K. and Ireland through our joint venture. Naturally, we're very excited about our New Bond Street flagship, which is on target for a September opening and will be supported by our new ad campaign featuring Gwyneth Paltrow. ", "Beyond the opportunities in the Coach brand, as you know, we launched Reed Krakoff last September in a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as through prestigious international specialty retailers. We are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer. As we mentioned on the 3Q call, Val\u00e9rie Hermann joined Reed Krakoff as President and CEO this April from YSL and has been a valuable addition to the leadership team. ", "What I have just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace, given the continuing strength of the Coach business and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us, both in North America, which remains a growing market, and worldwide, while our refocus on men's provides an additional opportunity for growth. At this time, I will turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Mike?", "Michael Devine", "Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results. As mentioned, on a comparable non-GAAP basis, our quarterly revenues rose 17% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents about 87% of our business, up 18%, and our indirect segment, up 12%. ", "Similarly, operating income rose over 20%. Net income for the quarter increased 18% and totaled $202 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.68, up 22%. On a reported basis, sales rose 9%. Net income rose 4%, and earnings per share gained 7%. For the fiscal year, sales rose 18% on a comparable non-GAAP basis, totaling $4.16 billion, while earnings per share were $2.92, up 30%, and net income was $881 million, up 24%. On a reported basis for the full year, sales rose 15%, net income gained 20%, and earnings per share increased 26% from fiscal 2010.", "For the quarter, operating income totaled $312 million, up 20% from the prior year on a comparable non-GAAP basis and 5% above the $297 million reported in the year-ago period. Operating margin was 30.3%, 80 basis points better than the 29.5% generated in the prior year on a comparable basis and versus 31.2% on a reported basis.", "During the quarter, gross profit rose 6% to $740 million from $697 million reported a year ago, while gross margin rate was 71.8% versus 73.3%, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing costs, partially offset by channel mix and modestly lower levels of promotional activity in our North American factory business. ", "SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 41.5% compared to the 42.1% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were pleased that we were able to gain 60 basis points of leverage on a reported basis in the quarter, as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.", "For the full year, operating income totaled $1.3 billion and 32% of sales, up 20% from the prior year on a comparable basis and 14% above the $1.15 billion reported in the year-ago period. On a comparable basis, operating margin expanded 50 basis points and was above our stated objective and last year's actual margin of 31.5%. On a reported basis, operating margin was 31.4% versus 31.9%. ", "During the year, gross profit rose 15% to $3.02 billion from $2.63 billion a year ago. Gross margin was 72.7% versus 73.0% a year ago. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 41.3% compared to the 41.1% reported in fiscal 2010.", "As a reminder, there were a number of items that affected comparability for the fourth quarter and the full year. First, the 53rd week in FY '10 contributed about $70 million to sales, $24 million to net income or $0.08 to earnings. ", "In addition, as noted in our press release, we recorded certain onetime items during the third quarter of 2011 which resulted in a substantially lower tax rate of 26.5% in that quarter. These included a favorable settlement of a multiyear tax return examination, which decreased Coach's provision for taxes by $16 million. In addition, the company made a $21 million contribution to the Coach Foundation and also contributed JPY 400 million or just under $5 million to the Japanese Red Cross.", "Together, these contributions totaled nearly $26 million pretax, impacting GAAP SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the benefit of the tax settlement to both net income and EPS.", "Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $422 million, up about 16% from FY '10 year end, consistent with our expectations and sales growth. This inventory level allows us to support 25 net new North American stores, 8 net new locations at Coach Japan and 25 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period, as well as the Asia distribution center, the Reed Krakoff brand and our men's initiatives. Further, our current inventory support the strong underlying business trends and will allow us to maximize sales this summer and fall. ", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $702 million, essentially even with $696 million a year ago after $1.1 billion of share repurchase in the interim 12 months. During the fourth fiscal quarter alone, we repurchased and retired about 6.3 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $60.08, spending a total of $381 million. At the end of the year, approximately $962 million remained under our present repurchase authorization.", "Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $221 million compared to $182 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $164 million versus $152 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $57 million versus $29 million in the same quarter a year ago. ", "For the full fiscal year 2011, net cash from operating activities was $1 billion compared to $991 million a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '11 was an inflow of $886 million versus $910 million in fiscal year '10. CapEx spending totaled $148 million for the year compared to $81 million in the prior year. ", "It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '12, we expect the CapEx for next year will be up in the area of $200 million -- up to the area of $200 million, driven by the timing shifts of certain projects or primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our global expansion. ", "While we are not giving specific guidance for FY '12, we see the year unfolding very similarly to FY '11 with strong revenue trends, robust core businesses delivering leverage while we continue to invest in the future. ", "First, and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp store sales in North America. Second, as we've said before, our gross margin is likely to improve sequentially in the first half of the year versus the second half of FY '11, though it will still contract on a year-over-year basis. The second half is expected to be slightly easier as we anniversary increased sourcing costs, while channel mix and our sourcing initiatives contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margin to remain high and in the 72% to 73% range for FY '12. Third, on SG&A, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies.", "In summary, our fourth quarter and FY '11 results demonstrated our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity, with a particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. We are also optimizing the brand's potential on men's, leveraging our long heritage in this category. And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally while continuing to return capital to shareholders.", "As Lew mentioned, this will be my last earnings call. So before I open it to questions, I just wanted to say that this has been the most remarkable and rewarding 10 years of my professional career. I'm quite proud of what Coach has accomplished over this time. And in addition to all the many people at Coach I need to thank, at this time, I'd especially like to thank all of my many, many good buy-side and sell-side friends out there. Your support has been tremendous. I'd also like to welcome Jane, who I know is listening as she takes the best CFO job in global branded retail, and close by saying that I plan to be a long-time shareholder as Coach's prospects have never been brighter. And I look forward to watching its continued success as I pursue my board work and spend more time with my family. Thank you. I would now like to open it up to questions and answers.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you, Mike D.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "I guess the first question that I have is on the comp results for this quarter, what really drove the upside to your plans? And do you think those drivers should remain intact for potential for upside in your plans for the next fiscal year?", "Lew Frankfort", "Mike Tucci will take that.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. We had -- we're very pleased with the quarter. We're very pleased with the year. The drivers behind it, conversion\u2019s significant, more importantly behind conversion, improved handbag productivity through pricing where we had average unit retail increases as well as unit comps. That was a significant driver, and I think it speaks to the longer-term rebalancing of the assortment and driving a focus on balance in our assortment in handbags. Additionally, we're starting to see men's become a comp driver, contributing to overall productivity in our stores, particularly in the significant high profile stores where we have men\u2019s in a more definitive and larger format within those stores. As you well know, we tend to be conservative planners. And while it's early in the quarter in Q1, the trends and tempo of the business that we saw coming out of Q4, we really see that continuing in the early stages of July. We like what we see happening with the response to product, largely driven by Chelsea, a very strong response to what I would call a more a refined look within Poppy and continued reaction to newness in our factory channel where we continue to refine our flow strategies there. And I think the other important channel to mention is that our digital opportunity continues to be a growth driver for us, not only from a sales and revenue standpoint, but in terms of visitation and browse. And we know that a large reason for our consumers coming to our site is to pre-shop our stores, so we see that as a continued opportunity as we enter into Q1.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Great, and just one follow-up question is, I think, Lew, you mentioned strong gains on a comp basis in both full price and factory. Was there a variance between the 2 this quarter?", "Lew Frankfort", "It was roughly the same.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc.", "Quick question on your international wholesale business. It sounds like there's some -- a little bit of acceleration in the store growth plan for this year, especially in light that a couple more of those businesses are now in-house. Could you kind of put that in context, what's going on there, especially with the announcement today on Brazil and in Vietnam?", "Lew Frankfort", "I mentioned earlier that our growing awareness globally has created substantial opportunities for us. And so first, in existing markets, we're finding that we're gaining on higher awareness, increased traction, which gives us confidence that we can continue to open new locations. We're also benefiting in many markets from the global tourist who is contributing substantially to our sales in many locations. Due to the new distribution agreements and increased traction, we're in a position to open many more locations than we have had -- than we have opened in the past.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc.", "And how will the sourcing work in Brazil? I know there are sometimes some tariff issues for imports. Is your partner there going to source locally?", "Lew Frankfort", "We're going to be -- consistent with the way we run our business, we're going to do outsourcing [ph]. We're going to deal with the tariffs as we need to. The assortment will be a global assortment.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, great. And then one quick question on men's. Could you remind us what it was historically at its peak in terms of a percent of total Coach sales? And do you think it could get back there someday?", "Lew Frankfort", "I'm sorry, men's...", "Andrea Resnick", "20% to 25% of our sales as recently as the late 90s, Omar.", "Lew Frankfort", "It's conceivable that we could. I mean, right now, we're looking to grow our business from about 4% to over 10% during our planning horizon.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger, Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "I wonder if you could talk about your pricing and your mix strategies in North America. And are you planning to increase price in order to offset rising cost of goods sold? And then Mike, could you just help me a little bit on your gross margin outlook? Can I read your comments to mean that you're expecting flat gross margin in 2012? Or do you think there's a possibility you could see some recovery in the year, obviously, with the improvement in the second half of the fiscal year?", "Michael Devine", "Why don't I take the latter half of that first, and then, perhaps Mike or Lew could jump in on the first part of the question? But Kimberly, we're -- yes, what we're asking people to model is essentially a flat gross margin rate. At this point in the year, it's still very early days of the year, but we're actually feeling guardedly optimistic about gross margin. We do believe that the quarter just reported is likely the low point. And we feel that we can continue to deliver margin rates similar to '10 and '11 for FY '12 with some gradual upside improvement in the out years, and that's in spite of continued sourcing pressures, the most worrisome of which is wage inflation in China. As we've talked about, we're at the beginning of a very aggressive program to move 50% of our units produced out of China. And while it's early days, we're ahead of schedule on this one, and we'll continue to battle it as we're now actually hearing some rumblings of wage inflation elsewhere. But in terms of materials, our design, merchandising and sourcing teams have done just a remarkable job in designing into cost and counter-sourcing. And of course, our cost of materials are not as dramatically impacted as some of the apparel brands you might be following. And we do feel like as we move into the second half of the year, we'll be anniversary-ing the worst of the material cost inflation. Really, all the other dynamics of the business will be helpful to gross margin as we move forward, most notably, channel mix, as our full price businesses in our mature markets continue to trend positive. And notably, China grows far more quickly than total Coach. Also the conversion of these distributor businesses, namely Singapore thus far, with Malaysia on horizon will also be helpful to gross margin rate. And I think, ultimately, long term as men's shares increases, we can also drive gross margin rate longer-term, as our relatively new men's team gets their legs under them. And frankly, we believe that our male consumers are not as bargain-obsessed as their wives and girlfriends. So the last thing I think that can be helpful to gross margin rate is as the overall economy generally improves, I think we'll continue to see full price trending nicely and perhaps over time have a little bit of pricing power in the factory channel as well. So we're looking for -- to model relatively flat FY '12 as the year plays out. The wildcard will be the promotional levels probably in factory, but there is gradual improvement in upside into the out years.", "Michael Tucci", "Okay, on retail pricing, the answer is we absolutely see opportunity for pricing, and it's not absolute price increases. It's driven by mix and offer. Couple of things that are happening in the market that are favorable to us. One is we're in a strong leather cycle, which affords us the ability to get higher retails, and that will drive average unit retails up in our handbag category, had an impact on Q4 where you see average handbags over $400 contributing 17% to our overall handbag sales versus '11 in the prior year. That's a big deal. The refinement of the Poppy strategy allows us to work the mix with inside of Poppy for some potential retail upside. And one other significant opportunity is what we're calling small bags and cross body, which offers us a pricing opportunity and also protects our opening price points both within Poppy, as well as in the overall mix. That's a very important element. So while we dialed back to a target of $300 and landed in the $280 range a couple of years back, we're now working our way back in trying to capture that $20 of upside in average unit retail in handbags. And I think overtime, we see that as a real opportunity. On the factory side, it's a similar story with a strong leather trend and also being very creative there on our pricing strategy to create differentiation in our retail strategy between leather offer and signature offer which the customer accepts on the factory side and allows us to gain average unit retail increases in our handbag category. That was also helpful and a driver, and we see that continuing.", "Michael Devine", "And a driver of gross margin rate as well, particularly in factory.", "Lew Frankfort", "I'd like to just add one clarification, Mike D. When we talk about 50% of our units coming from outside of China, what we're really referring to was incremental production requirements. We plan to maintain the same level of jobs in China that we have today, but all of our future requirements we're planning to come from outside of China.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan Chase.", "Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I guess my question's on the SG&A side. Just maybe talk about the investment spending this past year on RK in Europe and the continuation of the design buildout. How much of a drag was that this past year? And how should we think about that going forward in FY '12? Can this business get back to that 38% SG&A, as a percentage of sales, especially if you guys get to that $5 billion in revenue target over the next couple of years? And just quickly, on the Hong Kong listing, is there any update on timing of what we should we be looking for and your time -- your thoughts on that?", "Michael Devine", "I'll take the simpler one, the Hong Kong listing first, although actually it's not simple. It\u2019s proving to be complex. And we're currently going back and forth with the exchange answering some questions based on the documents we've submitted, required to get listed. I think we're looking probably for a listing sometime in the early fall. But going back to SG&A, we were very pleased actually in the fourth quarter and the way we just delivered, as we talked about, we delivered, on an as reported basis, 60 basis points of leverage to the SG&A line, and we did that in spite of losing some of our healthiest revenue from Japan as a result of the earthquake. And again, that's on the 14 versus 13-week compare. So we're continuing to see great leverage being delivered by our mature businesses here in North America and in Japan while we continue the investment spend. So we talked about that investment spending as it was directed for RK, the infrastructure build in China and in other parts of Asia to allow us to capitalize on the opportunity there as being an investment in the neighborhood of about $0.08 this most recent year. I think we can look to see that investment continue to improve into '12 and into the out years. Val\u00e9rie Hermann has come in and is really doing, I think, a number of the right things around RK.  We're likely to pick up a couple of pennies of investment spend there. What will happen is that in the first half of the fiscal year, we will pick up the Singapore direct expenses. And while relatively modest to total Coach, that will be a drag to the SG&A rate. It will take Victor Luis and his team a little bit of time to bring that business to its full profit potential. We will get there, but to get there quickly, it takes a while for us to install our retail processes, adjust the assortment. And remember, when we transition a business from the distributor to a direct business, we're buying that inventory back at wholesale prices. So the first 6 months of selling is also at somewhat reduced gross margin rates. But going forward into FY '12, the balance of all these investments and the leverage we expect to get from our mature businesses looks like we're going to have a pretty flat SG&A rate for the year while we grow the business very strong double-digit top line.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson, Bank of America.", "Lorraine Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just wanted to follow up on the men's business. And how are you thinking about the total store base for both factory and full price domestically and then in Asia?", "Lew Frankfort", "Mike T?", "Michael Tucci", "We\u2019re a little further along on the factory side only because it's more demonstrated there. We do have 15 stores opened. We opened a handful of stores this past several weeks, so we're adding to that. The factory opportunity from a store count standpoint is significant. And while we're not committing to a long-range number, we will be nimble and aggressive in terms of taking opportunities in the marketplace to gain space on the factory side. On the full price side, we're really pleased with what we see happening in the couple of stores that we have open outside of Bleecker Street, and we\u2019ve committed to a handful of stores this year that we're working on, including a format where we have men's and women's side-by-side with a pass-through that will open in the spring in Pentagon Center Mall outside of D.C. That's when we talk dual gender. That's the format that we want to get into the marketplace. It's a format that we're seeing a lot of success with internationally, and we think that opportunity may play itself out in North America as well. I think it's important to note on the full price side that men's is a more premium proposition for us, and we're going to target the absolute best real estate within the full price arena. As we get more experience, we'll be better informed, and we'll approach the men's full price opportunity accordingly.", "Lew Frankfort", "Victor, would you touch on Asia for us, please?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. First, from the size of opportunity perspective, I think it's important to understand the scale of the opportunity that stands in front of us. We're looking at a premium handbag and accessories market in Asia of about $12 billion today, of which approximately 25% is men's. That would be the approximate penetration in Japan and in P.R.C., in Mainland, China, we see the penetration of men's closer to 50%, so a truly tremendous opportunity for us. From a distribution perspective, of course, you're all aware that we have a more mature distribution in Japan. And as Lew mentioned in the speakers\u2019 notes, today, we have already 7 locations in Japan, 3 full price locations and 4 factory locations. We're planning to open 15 doors in FY '12, the vast majority of which will be men's freestanding locations. Increasingly, we're also experimenting with bringing men's into current women's doors where it makes sense from a distribution perspective. This is slightly more difficult in Japan, given that most of our locations are in department stores, where often we're on the women's handbag floor. In China, the opportunity is truly boundless, as we like to say. We have, today, 53 locations in the Mainland combined with 13 in Hong Kong and Macau, as you know. Of those 53 locations in the Mainland, already 23 of those are those dual gender locations that Mike referred to earlier. And of the 30 locations that we\u2019ve plan to open in FY '12, approximately 27 of those will also be dual gender locations, so it is very much at the center of our strategy.", "We have the opportunity to go boldly there, given that, of course, we are building distribution from scratch. Across other Asian markets, we are looking at both strategies as we are in Japan and here in the U.S. where we have the opportunity to start with new doors and it works, we're going in with the dual gender location, and where not, we're going in with the men's standalone locations.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dana Telsey, Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "I wanted to -- a couple of things, how much production are you planning to shift out of China in this upcoming year? And if you think about the outlook [ph] business and the returns, what was the penetration of the main 4 products this quarter versus last year, and how you see those margins?", "Lew Frankfort", "The first question, in terms of -- over 85% of our production will be coming out of China this year. And if I understood your question correctly, Mike, in terms of made for factory?", "Michael Devine", "About 85%. [indiscernible] was where we've been.", "Lew Frankfort", "And to close out on that, yes, Dana, that does carry a slightly higher margin than the full price transfers into the channel.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Great, and any thoughts on any remodels for the full line stores for this year with CapEx dollars?", "Michael Tucci", "We are -- there are a couple of things happening. One is we're actually in the process of taking a look at the entire fleet on a full price side and, in particular, looking at potential locations where we either have lease opportunity or space opportunity to better position men's and renovate the stores at the same time. And an example I would give you, a couple of examples locally, one would be we're about to reopen our store at 342 Madison where we were able to reformat the space and add a men's point of view and shop in that space. We did a very significant project at 595 Madison. So we have at least allocated slightly more capital to the idea of renovation and remodels within North America, particularly around taking advantage of the men's opportunity.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. That will be our last question. I'd like to turn it back now to Lew for a few closing words. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "I think our results and our comments speak for themselves. We're off to a great start in fiscal '12, and we believe we have the strategies in place to continue to grow at double digits with the bottom line growing faster than the top line. And as I've said many times before, stay tuned. Thank you, and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you, and this does conclude the Coach Earnings Conference. We thank you for your participation.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; and Jane Nielsen, Coach's CFO. Mike Tucci, President of North American Retail, is also joining us for a holiday preview.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth rates may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will begin with an overall summary of our first fiscal quarter 2012 results and will also discuss our progress in global initiatives. Mike Tucci will review our key programs for the holiday season. Jane Nielsen will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session where we will be joined by Jerry Stritzke, our President and Chief Operating Officer. This Q&A will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. We will then conclude with some brief summary comments. ", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning, and thank you, Andrea. And welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we posted another strong quarter, reflecting the global resonance of our brand proposition with both women and men, based on innovation, relevance and value, as well as the vitality of the category in all markets as our customers look to update their wardrobes through our fashion right, leather goods and lifestyle accessories.", "In North America, we are continuing to grow our share of an expanding market, while in developing geographies, we are leveraging the inherent opportunity, investing in distribution and marketing initiatives. Beyond the top line, we are also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation in Q1. Looking forward, and given the strength of our product pipeline, breadth of our assortment and shoppers' strong interest in accessories, gifts and self-purchase, Coach is clearly well positioned for another excellent holiday season.", "While I will get into further detail of our current condition and the outlook of business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights were: first, net sales totaled $1.05 billion versus $912 million a year ago, an increase of 15%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.73, up 16% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales, which now include our Singapore business rose 17% to $910 million from $777 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 9.2% from prior year, while total store sales rose 15%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 1% on a constant currency basis and 10% in dollars; and finally, in China, we continue to generate very strong growth with the continuation of significant double-digit comps.", "We're also very pleased to announce the acquisition of our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which is expected to occur in early January. During the quarter, we opened 2 North American retail stores, including one in the new market for Coach, Winnipeg in Canada, and the men's mall store in Garden State Plaza in New Jersey. Two retail stores were also closed. In addition, we opened 9 factory stores, including 8 men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 full-priced and 152 factory stores in operation in North America.", "Moving on to China. During the quarter, we opened 5 net new locations, 4 in the mainland, one in Macau, bringing the total to 71 locations. ", "In Singapore, as planned, we took control of our retail businesses this quarter and opened one new store as well. We now have 6 company-operated locations in that country.", "And in Japan, 3 locations were added during the quarter, all of them dedicated men's shops, while one retail location was closed. At quarter end, of 178 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full-priced stores, including 8 flagships, 119 shop-in-shops, 32 factory stores and 7 distributor-operated locations.", "Indirect sales, which for context represent about 13% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 4% to $140 million from $134 million in the same period last year on a comparable basis. At POS, U.S. department store sales rose slightly on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. At the same time, international retail sales rose at a double-digit pace, driven primarily by distribution growth. It should be noted that the international traveler represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence increases.", "Moving on. We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter. At the same time, in our own North American stores and on the Internet, Coach's handbag and accessory sales rose 12%. It's worth noting that our men's business was a significant driver of our overall all sales growth in Q1. Our North American performance is also benefiting from our rising global awareness, which is visible by the sharp increase of tourists in select stores in travel markets around the country, including Hawaii, Las Vegas, Florida, and of course, New York. In these locations, Coach has become a key shopping destination. ", "Our total revenues in North America rose 13% for the quarter with our directly operated stores up 15% as distribution growth augmented comp. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 9.2%, fueling the strong overall comp with similarly strong gains in both channels, driven by significant increases in conversion from prior year, while tickets rose as well and store traffic declined.", "It's important to note, however, that we continue to experience significant gains in traffic and sales on the Internet. Looking at online traffic in combination with store traffic, it's more representative of our consumers' shopping behaviors in this growing digitally enabled environment, notably for the full-priced channel. In aggregating this metric, traffic into our retail channel actually rose with increases on coach.com more than offsetting the modest declines in store. This is consistent with our increased emphasis on digital, both through our own website and social media.", "In Japan, we posted a 1% increase in constant currency and a 10% increase in dollars, as mentioned. Coach now holds the #2 place within the Japanese imported accessories market with a 17% yen share. Our position reflects the strength and relevance of the Coach brand, as the Japanese consumer will become increasingly value oriented. ", "As we've discussed many times outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic growth opportunity given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers.", "While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?", "Michael Tucci", "Thanks, Lew. During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driving higher conversion levels and improved productivity. In addition to our relaunch of an evolved Poppy collection in July with updated styles, patterns and prints, we launched the new Chelsea collection featuring a modern, faceted turnlock inspired by our heritage and offered in timeless silhouettes. In August, we offered new fall fabrications, colors and patterns in Madison and a new shoulderbag style in Chelsea. During September, we focused on Kristin with several new totes and satchel styles. Clearly, our balanced and more refined handbag assortment continues to drive sustainable growth in North America.", "Handbags once again posted strong comps in the quarter, the penetration rising to 58%, the low single-digit increase and average unit retail. To open the second quarter, we brought in Madison, our core holiday collection, completely updated and featuring several new silhouettes. Lindsey, a new style and feature of our holiday ad campaign, was an immediate hit with consumers. Abigail is also a new fashion silhouette and key item. Both are available in the range of fabrications, including gathered leather, and price from a $358 up to $898 for limited edition.", "Also new to Madison are the Mini Sophia, the smaller version of this foundational style, the flat carryall and the Caroline Dowel satchel. With this being the most fully developed the Madison offering, we are seeing the highest penetration level for the collection ever, eclipsing its highly successful launch 3 years ago.", "For November, we're excited about Poppy, offered in new styles including 2 totes, a foldover crossbody silhouette, a hippie and a satchel. Liquid gloss or soft patent lightweight fabric, we'll bring additional excitement and color to the collection. We'll also be adding some newness to Chelsea. Only introduced this fall was a tote that features chain detail at compelling price points. Right before Thanksgiving, we'll refresh the assortment with updates to Madison and Kirsten, along with a new drawstring tote in Chelsea, giving her additional reasons to revisit and repurchase during the key holiday season. Of course, we'll also have a comprehensive assortment of great gifts, from iPad covers to wrist list and a wide range of items under $100 as well.", "In addition, our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan beginning in mid-November featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing will be product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign will span coach.com, social and rich media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic. We'll also be adding digital media to select high-profile store windows as the new element of our in-store marketing.", "I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital strategy and the benefits that we're seeing from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness while maximizing e-commerce opportunity. In fact, within North America, coach.com is our fastest-growing retail store with double-digit sales growth. ", "Additionally, we're especially pleased with the early results of our mobile commerce site with over 15% of coach.com's total site traffic coming from a mobile device. Our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. We continue to evolve our engagement with our customers in a very relevant and authentic way through social media, with Facebook being the most important platform where Coach enthusiasts actively participate in our brand. ", "Also in the U.S., we recently launched our factory flash sale site. Offered by invitation-only to our factory loyal consumers, this highly-profitable 48-hour private sale events complement our store strategy and give our customers another way to engage with that channel. While this is a snapshot of our North American retail digital initiatives, our web presence is global. We also have an e-commerce site in Japan and informational site in 16 important countries. We'll continue to use our digital capability to build awareness and as a customer touchpoint as we expand the Coach brand globally.", "Moving to our stores. Lew already mentioned our store openings in North America this quarter. As you heard, our new distribution is primarily focused on growing our men's business, with 9 of the aggregate 11 stores opened in Q1 dedicated men's locations. While we're only 1-year into our focus on the men's initiative, we've been extremely pleased with our results as our business doubled on a global basis last year. In North America, we see men's as both a comp driver in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity.", " Similar to the way we viewed the brand's potential in the women's category in the late 1990s, we believe that Coach can be the authority in men's bags and accessories in the years ahead. As we created the world of Coach for women across categories, we're now doing the same for men, designing collections with a distinct point of view, sharing the modern, classic aesthetic that is a hallmark of Coach. Clearly, the male shopper is engaging with the brand in increasing numbers.", "In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving our full-priced productivity and our growing men's business. We're feeling great about the holiday season given the current sales trends in both our full-priced and factory channel. ", "With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategy and further opportunities for growth.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Mike. Mike just discussed a number of our productivity initiatives, including men's, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. ", "I would like to now focus on distribution growth.  As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% this year compared to 9% in FY '11. Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores this year, including about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets with more than 1/2 and each channel being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 7% this year, in line with last year but primarily driven by men's.", "Turning to China. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or an additional 25 for the balance of the fiscal year, with the vast majority on the mainland. Virtually, all of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the men's opportunity. Given the continued strength we're experiencing in China, we are now projecting sales of at least $300 million for FY '12, the top end of the range we articulated in August.", "As previously mentioned, we are making significant investments towards increasing awareness in China as we leverage our 70th anniversary campaign to build on our positioning as a New York fashion brand grounded in heritage and history. This integrated campaign has several key elements, including an international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, who has proven relevancy in China and other international markets. In November, she'll be traveling to China with us and participating in several key press events.", "In Japan, spending has stabilized from the post-earthquake and tsunami period. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share. During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan, nearly all of them dedicated men's stores. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to 3% in FY '11.", "Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, and as I mentioned briefly, we are pleased to announce that we've reached an agreement to take control of our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which has 24 locations and generates about $50 million of sales at retail. This transition is expected to occur in early January. And as previously announced, our Malaysia distribution will be acquired next July.", "It's important to note that these acquisitions will allow us to leverage the investments we've already made in the region, utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asia distribution center. Outside of our directly operated markets, we do have thriving distributor-run businesses in other countries. During FY '12, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations, expanding to new markets, including Brazil and Vietnam, as noted on our last earnings call.", "Touching on Europe. During Q1, we added one location within Printemps in France, 2 in Ireland and one in Spain. Of course, we're excited about our new Bond Street flagship, which opened last month. Our international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, co hosted a number of events heralding our opening, which helped raise brand awareness. During the balance of FY '12, we expect to open about 8 additional locations in Europe.", "In closing, as most of you know, we have 3 over-arching growth strategies: build -- first, building our women's business in the growing North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the large and growing men's category. Taken together, we are confident that they will drive our business at a double-digit pace during our planning horizon.", "At this time, I would like to introduce to you Jane Nielsen, our new CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Lew. It's great to be with all of you on my first Coach earnings call. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results. ", "As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 15% with direct-to-consumer up 17% and indirect up 4%. Net income for the quarter totaled $215 million, up 14%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.73, up 16%. This compared to net income of $189 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.63 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $322 million, 13% above the $286 million reported last year, while operating margin was 30.7% versus 31.3%. We were extremely pleased with this level of growth and at the high level of profitability.", "During this quarter, gross profit totaled $765 million versus $676 million a year ago, an increase of 13%. As expected, gross margin rate was 72.8%, a sequential improvement from the 71.8% reported in Q4 '11. This compared to 74.2% a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher sourcing cost this year.", "Our expense ratio in Q1 totaled 42.1% compared to 42.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were able to gain 70 basis points of leverage in the quarter as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L, more than offsetting the impact of our investment spending. We believe we're striking the right balance between driving future growth opportunities and operating efficiencies.", "Inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $520 million, 13% above the $459 million reported at the end of last year's Q1. This inventory level allows us to support 24 net new North American stores, 8 net new locations at Coach Japan, 22 additional Coach China stores, the 6 stores from our acquisition in Singapore and our men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to maximize sales this holiday. ", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $848 million as compared with $712 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $55.30, spending a total of $59 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchase total to nearly 18 million shares, equaling about $1 billion.", "At the end of the quarter, approximately $900 million remained under our company's present repurchase authorization. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $225 million compared to $177 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $194 million versus $154 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $31 million versus $23 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for the year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results, and as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the holiday quarter and the rest of the year. ", "To elaborate, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp store sales growth in North America for the balance of the year. Second, as we said before, we still expect our gross margin to improve sequentially in the first half of the year versus the second half of FY '11, though our gross margin will still contract in the first half on a year-over-year basis. However, the second half is expected to improve over last year as we anniversary increased sourcing costs. On balance, we anticipate the gross margin will remain in the 72% to 73% range for the year. Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the remainder of the year.", "In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We have accelerated our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increased popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. We are also optimizing the brand's potential in men, leveraging our long heritage and equity in this category. And with the business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are positioned to take full advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.", "I'd now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Lew, the first question that I have is on China. You just reported strong China results and took your numbers up. What are you seeing there that gives you such confidence? And are you at Coach at all concerned about a hard landing or a slowdown in China?", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, first, we're focused on Coach, and our performance continues very strong. We've seen no slowdown in our rate of growth in China. As I mentioned, the repurchase intent is extremely high, and we're continuing to realize significant double-digit comp sales. And as we've discussed, we are opening 30 new locations. More broadly, I'm confident there will not be a hard landing in China. I think it's going to be a soft landing that will largely exempt the emerging middle-class population, which is our target consumer. She's a professional. She's young. She sees herself as part of the global marketplace. And she's going to be least affected.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. And then just a follow-up question is, in the U.S., Mike, can you talk about the trends above $300 and below and sort of any changes that you see and how you think the fourth quarter -- or the second quarter for you guys will play out from that perspective?", "Michael Tucci", "Sure, Bob. Using Q1 as the proxy where we kicked off the year, we are right at $2.99 in average unit retail. So we were up slightly over last year, which is very important. We had some pricing advantage. That was driven by an increased contribution penetration of handbags over $400, particularly on the back of the strength of Madison. And as you know, Madison is our lead collection for Q2. It's performing very, very well out of the gate. And I believe that, that affords us some pricing opportunity within the second quarter, albeit our second quarter is a little bit more of a price-sensitive quarter given the gifting nature of the business. So we're very, very enthusiastic about where the mix is landing, and we see Madison as a key driver.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christine Chen with Needham & Company.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on that question. You mentioned that greater contribution from bags over $400. What was that contribution? And what was it last year? And I'm wondering with the whiplash in the market, have you seen particular volatility in your traffic trends at either full-priced stores or factory stores?", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. $400 -- over $400 handbag offering was up, represented about 22% of handbag sales versus 16% last year in Q1. That's a nice increase. Traffic volatility is not something that we're seeing at all. We see a very consistent pattern.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Schick with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Question. You mentioned, Lew, at the beginning that the women's market itself is going 5% to 10%. You grew faster at 12%. Where would you peg the growth rate of the men's market in North America or globally?", "Lew Frankfort", "We actually don't have any good numbers there. We think we're going to make the market in North America. It's highly fragmented and very small. We're really confident that we're already growing the market in North America and it will be more pronounced in years to come. Outside North America, we're playing real catch-up. There's a very developed market in China where roughly 40% of total luxury spend is on men's products, and we want our rightful share. Today, it's only 15% of our sales in China. And similar levels of spending occur in other East Asian countries, in Japan where it's about 15% of our sales as well that we believe we can grow our share there, too. So we're very optimistic that internationally, it's a catch-up. And the new markets, which we're entering, such as Europe and China, it's a major emphasis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson, Bank of America.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "You mentioned on the call that your e-commerce this year, 16 informational sites in various countries. Should we expect to see those moved to full e-commerce channels, particularly in China? And what are the hurdles that you face in doing so?", "Lew Frankfort", "Mike.", "Michael Tucci", "As we develop our business in these countries, particularly from a retail presence, we build the market from a store basis, and we're really accenting our position in the market with informational sites. As the business develops, we will convert our informational sites to e-commerce sites. So for example, China will convert to e-commerce later this year. We have an e-commerce site in Japan. So it will be market by market and it will be enabled by the opportunity that we have in countries from a distribution and fulfillment standpoint. Also, the informational sites allow us to drive awareness to our stores, traffic to our stores and capture customer information e-mail and other productive information.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Randy Koenig from Jefferies.", "Amanda Sigouin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "This is Amanda Sigouin in for Randy. Question also on China. Roughly how much is the pricing premium there versus the North American business? And also on the product there, do you see any differences between the handbag penetration in China versus the U.S. or kind of the average price points there?", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, first, on the second part of your question, what we're finding within our global assortment are very little differences. So that handbags have a similar level of penetration that we have in the United States. However, as I mentioned, we are distorting our development towards men's. As we open our future stores, we expect virtually all of them to be dual gender. So very quickly, men's penetration will rise dramatically. In terms of our pricing, we have a global pricing strategy, and it is consistent with other luxury brands.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dana Telsey, Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Jane, welcome, look forward to working with you. Jane, can you give us your initial take on Coach, a little bit about what your priorities are in the role now? And Lew, I was in the store on -- and Mike, I was in the store on Bond Street on Sunday. It looks terrific. I saw the 41 Bond Street collection and I could see why you're going to do well there. Can you talk a little about overseas and where you expect overseas sales and profits to be as a percent of total over time?", "Jane Nielsen", "Well, I can take the -- I'll take the first question since it was directed at me. I guess what I found at Coach is a lot what you see in our Q1 earnings. Great, just incredible passion for the business. It's an incredibly knowledge-driven management team that's both numerous and really knows the business cold. As CFO, I really appreciate the disciplined and rigorous processes that really support all the decision-making but really retains the sense of flexibility to respond to the market. And I guess what I appreciate most is the passion that everybody approaches the business with and that everyone has for the brand. As CFO, I really think that finance can contribute in 4 important ways. I'd love for the finance team to be viewed as a business partner that really takes great ideas and makes some great businesses, to really be a model of stewardship and that leads by example and to really be a driver of a well-controlled organization that's committed to delivering results the right way.", "Lew Frankfort", "Okay. When we say overseas growth, I'm going to reference business outside North America. First, the good news is that Coach continues to be a growth market. So it's hard to beat the overall growth in North America. But as we develop scale, particularly in China and East Asia, we expect that 50% of our growth over the next 5 years will be outside of North America. And what that means is that we will go roughly, and I'm going to give you a rough number, from about 30% of our sales today outside North America to over 40%. The other element I'd just like to emphasize is that as we grow internationally, there is a spillover impact into the United States, and we're really benefiting enormously from the surge in awareness and brand cache among tourists, as I said earlier, in key markets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez, Nomura.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Can you talk about in which businesses you saw year-over-year improvement in the EBIT margin line, if any? I'm just trying to understand how much the EBIT margin drag was from mix versus actual declines in those individual segments.", "Jane Nielsen", "Paul, we don't discuss EBIT margins for our individual business units. The individual business units' operating margin for the 2 major channels, direct and indirect, will be provided in the Q.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And just maybe one follow-up. I was a little surprised that you didn't buy back more stock during the quarter. Just wondering what your thoughts are there.", "Jane Nielsen", "Well, I wouldn't interpret too much from our Q1 buyback. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders and fundamentally believe that share buybacks are a good means of doing that. We're always balancing the working capital needs of our business to fuel growth with the open window that we have to buy back our shares. And as you know, Q1 is our shortest window to do that buyback.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.", "Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research", "As it relates to your men's business, can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the openings in the U.S.? Are they clustered in sort of tourist locations? And how does the productivity of the men's business in the U.S. compare to the productivity of your women's business?", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. I'll break this out. Let me start with full price. We are seeing the opportunity in full price to add men's presence in our best locations in the United States. And that's either going to occur with an expansion within our most productive stores or malls or taking existing real estate in those most highly productive stores and dedicating more space to men's, as we've done, for example, in our Madison Avenue store at 57th Street, at 342 Madison store and others throughout the country. The approach in men's will be top-down. We're going to go from our most productive locations, most highly productive, highly traffic, most premium locations in North America and attack those first. And that is really what we're working on. A format that we're most excited about that we need to get built out is what we're calling a side-by-side format where, for example, in Pentagon Mall in Washington this spring, we'll take our existing store, which is a women's-only store, relocate it to a larger format with a side-by-side men's, women's location in about 3,700 square feet, bringing men's to the lease line and creating a dual-gender view to the customer. We believe that, that, on the full-price side, is an enormous growth opportunity for us. In factory, we are seeing incredible response to our men's. And there, we have 2 formats: one is a separate men's store in the neighborhood of our women store; or again, combining our men's and women's presence under one roof side by side. And we see both of those opportunities as viable and I think, long term, going deep into our fleet in terms of penetration. Our men's productivity is significant. It's very comparable to women's at very high margins and very high returns.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer with Robert W. Baird.", "Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just one clarification to start. We are at least mid-single-digit comp guidance. Is that what you're thinking about for each quarter over the rest of the year just? Or the remainder of the year as a whole? And then can you talk a little bit about the trends that you're seeing on the wholesale side? I noticed that you kind of moderated your language around the shipments and the U.S. department store POS are up less than they had been. So I guess anything that you're seeing there?", "Jane Nielsen", "Yes, the guidance for the mid-single-digit that we're giving is for the balance of the year.", "Lew Frankfort", "At least mid...", "Jane Nielsen", "At least mid-single-digit balance of the year.", "Lew Frankfort", "With regard to wholesale, again for context, it's 13% of our sales. And that does include our international wholesale business, which is growing double digits at POS. And our U.S. department stores, we were pleased to post a 3% comp performance in what we consider a very developed channel and a very strong promotional environment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "With so much of your growth coming in the North American business from men's, can you talk a little bit about how you're changing your marketing to focus on men and how you're trying to introduce the brand to that man customer that doesn't know that there's a men's product for them at Coach?", "Michael Tucci", "Okay. Well, first, the context. A significant majority of our growth in the first quarter came from women's, not men's. So women's is really continuing to grow rapidly. As we quickly develop scale in men's, we expect naturally to see a greater proportion of our growth come from men's. In terms of our marketing to men, we are going to distort spending starting this holiday season here in the States towards men, particularly both in publications that men tend to read, as well as through focused digital opportunities. So for us, key is really building awareness that we have a very broad and excellent assortment and for those men on the call we invite you to visit our stores or the Internet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Well, it sounds like your North American growth is going to be largely driven by men's here in the near term. I'm wondering if you can just step back and look out at the next 2 to 3 years and tell us what do you think the total men's store opportunity is here in the North American market and how does that compare with the total women's opportunity? And then just a clarification on your earlier commentary, if you can help us understand in that 9% North American comp how the full-priced business and the factory business compare to one another?", "Lew Frankfort", "I'll let Mike begin, and I'll amplify.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. While the easy one is on the comp performance between the 2 channels, very, very consistent with prior quarters and both channels performing very, very similarly. On men's, I think it's important to understand that it's still early. We're very enthusiastic about what we're seeing. The men's opportunity on the factory side of the business is demonstrated. And there, I would say we are in more than a rollout in distribution growth mode. On the full-price side, real estate acquisition and positioning in the marketplace, frankly, is more of a long-term challenge and will take more time. And we continue to experiment with what the optimal format is in men's on the full-price side. So I would say there, we need a little bit more time to commit to how large the opportunity can be. Confidently, we're going to double our men's business this year in North America and build it to a meaningful base and a meaningful penetration to our total company business. It is also providing comp and productivity to the overall channels in full-price and factory. Long-term target, I see men's as being -- I would go out on a limb and say that men's can be 15% to 20% of our women's business over time, which obviously sets it up as a substantial growth opportunity, both within North America, as well as from a global standpoint. Lew, do you want to add?", "Lew Frankfort", "I would only add that I do believe that markets such as China and select Western European and Middle Eastern and East Asian markets will actually be higher. And in fact, this year, we expect the penetration of men's to exceed 15% both in Japan and China, heading quickly towards 25% in China.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad", "Quick question. The markets continue to be a little bit concerned about the fragility of the economic environment, and the U.S. consumer continues to defy gravity in some sense. And retail sales numbers tend to be good, especially for some of the great brands out there like yours. How do you feel about that kind of aspirational consumer and their health? And are you seeing anything in your research or in your trends in the stores that lead you to believe that this strength is temporary?", "Lew Frankfort", "We can offer a very broad commentary, but I'll just hit a few different points. Consumers are cautious and concerned. However, unlike what occurred in '08 and '09, there's been no increase in the percentage of consumers that believe we're going to go into a deep recession. So even though there is worry, there isn't a feeling that the bottom is going to fall out, point one. Second, when we look at our consumer, she and he skews towards college graduates. And when we look at college grads, which represents about 1/3 of the total labor force, the unemployment rate is only about 4,%, higher than it should be, but it's only 4%. So the middle and upper middle class as the professional classes are doing a lot better than America overall, and those brands that are able to provide innovation, relevance and perceived excellent value are continuing to thrive. And we, as an acceptable luxury brand, are extremely well positioned to do that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Faye Landes with Consumer Research.", "Faye I. Landes - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Can you just -- a couple of sort of cleanup questions at this point. First of all, I just want to make sure because I think there may otherwise be some confusion, just clarify, just, I guess, lead to lead the witness, how little the contribution is of Singapore to the total?", "Lew Frankfort", "Go ahead, Andrea.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "It's de minimis, Faye. At this point, you'll recall that in Jane's section, I think we talked specifically to the fact that we acquired 6 stores. So it is really extremely small. We did note and we state our prior-year number indirect to direct by $2 million so we can give you an idea of exactly how small that business is.", "Faye I. Landes - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Okay. And also, Lew, I was hoping -- if you can just elaborate a little bit more on China. I heard what you said and I appreciate it. The results speak for themselves, but needless to say, investors need a lot of handholding on this. And I think even the term soft landing is something that might unintentionally spook people. So I know you do a lot of insight work here, so if you can...", "Lew Frankfort", "Okay. I got it. When we say soft landing, we're talking about 8% growth rate falling to 6% or 5% for a short period of time. We're not talking about anything significant. Yes, there's a perceived bubble in the extremely high-end real estate market. That is not our consumer. So we're not feeling anything, and we don't expect it to be material. And just in closing, we actually increased our guidance for performance for the year to the top end of our range. So if anything, our performance is exceeding our expectations of 3 months ago.", "Faye I. Landes - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Okay. And also just one more quick follow-up on that. You talked -- I mean you do -- you are leading the charge in a certain sense outside of the Tier 1 cities and you've been very farsighted on that. Can you just talk a little bit about what the differences you're seeing in consumer behavior, in general, among the different -- in between the different tiers?", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, first, we have lower -- Coach has lower brand awareness in our second-tier cities, second- and third-tier cities, so we've been partnering with the department stores or with the malls to develop special programs to introduce Coach. Out of the gate we're performing extremely well beating our expectations. More broadly, we find that there's an appetite for a limited-edition product as well, even in situations where we're the first international accessories brand within the areas. And what we're finding is we're enjoying great success and very high repurchase intention. And I'll just close with a lasting comment, a broad general comment, which is shopping is the #1 pastime in the secondary and tertiary markets, as it was in the United States 30 years ago. So when we visit our malls, we find multigenerations of consumers browsing, and we're building awareness and driving sales.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thanks, everybody, for joining us on our conference call today. As Mike noted, I'd now like to turn back to Lew for a few closing words. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "I think we said it all. The quarter was good. We are on track for an excellent holiday season. You can tell by our -- beyond the words, the energy that all of us have that, we're feeling really good about our over-arching strategies. Growth in North America, which is expanding share in a growing market, the incredible international opportunity with the sharp focus in China. And lastly, of course, men's, which is going to be a roar for Coach. Thank you, everybody.", "Operator", "This does conclude the Coach earnings conference.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; and Jane Nielsen, Coach's CFO. Mike Tucci, President of North American Retail, is also joining us to discuss our holiday performance and brand initiatives.

Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2012 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Mike Tucci will review the holiday season from a U.S. Retail perspective and discuss key initiatives for the spring season ahead. Jane Nielsen will continue with details on financial and operational results for the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session where we will be joined by Jerry Stritzke, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Victor Luis, our President of International Retail. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. We will then conclude with some brief summary comments. ", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we're very pleased with our holiday results, including strong sales and earnings growth and in our North American Retail businesses. Our performance clearly demonstrates the strength of our franchise, our broad and diversified product platform and our multichannel international distribution model. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high level of profitability and substantial cash generation. ", "In addition, we made continued progress against our key global business initiatives, including expanding our share in the growing North American bag and accessory market, increasing our international presence, leveraging our heritage in the men's business and expanding our digital presence. We've experienced strong response to our new collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continues to resonate with consumers worldwide. We're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share. ", "While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the categories and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 18% to $1.18 compared with $1 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.45 billion versus $1.26 billion a year ago, an increase of 15%; third, Direct-to-Consumer sales, which represent over 85% of total sales, rose 17% to $1.3 billion from $1.3 -- from $1.1 billion in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.8% from prior year, while total North American Direct-to-Consumer sales rose 17%; and fifth, sales in Japan were even to prior year in constant currency and rose 6% in dollars; and finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth with significant double-digit comps in China.", "During the quarter, we opened 5 Retail stores and 5 Factory stores in North America, including 2 men's Retail stores and 1 men's Factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 350 Full Price and 157 Factory stores in operation in North America.", "Moving to Japan. Six locations were opened, including 4 men's locations. At quarter end, there were 184 total locations in Japan with 22 Full Price stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 33 Factory stores and 7 distributor-operated travel Retail locations. ", "And in China, we added 9 locations: 8 in the mainland and 1 in Hong Kong, our Nathan Road flagship, which, I might add, is doing very well. At the end of the quarter, there were 80 Coach locations in China, including 12 in Hong Kong, 3 in Macau and 65 locations on the mainland in 28 cities. As we discussed previously, we are building a multichannel distribution model in China, including flagships, Retail stores, shop-in-shops and Factory stores. ", "Indirect sales were even with prior year on a comparable basis at $166 million. Results reflected shipment timing differences from prior year in our international wholesale businesses. Sales for the quarter at Retail and international wholesale locations increased at a double-digit pace, while sales at POS and U.S. department stores were even with last year's holiday quarter. ", "We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at a 5% to 10% rate in the holiday quarter, similar to the increase it experienced in the preceding 9 months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's women's handbag and accessory sales rose about 12% across all channels in North America during the most recent quarter. In our Direct businesses in North America, handbag and accessory sales rose 15%. ", "Separately, it's worth noting that we saw modest improvement in our customers' outlook to the economy compared to a quarter ago, with about 60% of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is stable or getting better, up from 48%. Her intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with about 2/3 of consumer surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. ", "Our total revenues in North America rose 15%, with our directly operated businesses up 17%, driven by 8.8% in same-store sales increases and new distribution. As noted in our press release, all direct channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy, spanning our own websites, mobile platform and social media, which enabled customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brands. Mike will provide additional details around some of these initiatives in just a moment. ", "Fueling these overall strong comp results were similar gains in both store channels, driven by conversion and average transaction size, and continued strength in our e-commerce business. Overall Retail traffic rose with in-store trends consistent with prior quarters, while traffic on coach.com continues to gain momentum. ", "As we've discussed many times, outside of North America, China is our largest geographic opportunity, given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales rose again sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the excellent comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. ", "Consistent with our strategy of building brand awareness in China, we took a number of important steps during the second quarter. First, we launched an integrated marketing campaign with our international brand ambassador, Gwyneth Paltrow, that included advertising across print, outdoor and the web, as well as the 70th anniversary gala dinner and gallery event in Beijing. Another key components of the campaign were the successful launch of our presence on Sina Weibo, the leading social networking site in China. In December, we also became the first U.S. incorporated company to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. ", "All of these events helped to drive increased awareness for our brands. While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail business. Mike?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Today, I'd like to review what was an excellent holiday season. Clearly, our balanced and more refined handbag assortment continues to drive sustainable growth in North America. There were 3 important productivity drivers within our North American business: overall product performance, our digital strategy and coach.com results and continued progress on our new men's initiative. ", "During the holiday quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, ensuring that we had a steady flow of new product throughout the period. Our strategy to flow more product later in the quarter versus previous seasons was also very successful. ", "To open the second quarter, we brought in Madison, our core holiday collection, completely updated and featuring several new silhouettes. Lindsey, a new style and feature of our holiday ad campaign, was an immediate hit with consumers. Abigail was also a new fashion silhouette and key item. Also new to Madison were the Mini Sophia, the flap carryall and the Caroline Dowel satchel. This was our most fully developed Madison offering, and we saw the highest penetration level for the collection ever, eclipsing its highly successful launch 3 years ago. ", "For November, Poppy was the focus, offered in new styles, including 2 totes, a foldover cross-body silhouette, a hippie and a satchel. Liquid gloss, a soft patent, lightweight fabric with diamond quilting and chain straps brought additional excitement and vibrant color to the collection. We also added some newness to Chelsea, only introduced last fall, with a classic tote featuring chain details at compelling price points. ", "Right before Thanksgiving, we refreshed our offering with updates to Madison and Kristin, along with a new drawstring tote in Chelsea, giving her additional reasons to revisit and repurchase during the key holiday seasons. Our mid-December significant Madison refresh also delivered newness closer to our peak selling period. ", "Of course, we also had a comprehensive assortment of great gifts, from iPad covers to wristlets, and a wide range of items under $100. Our holiday product was supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, which began in mid-November featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing was product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign spanned coach.com, social and rich media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing. Our addition of digital media to select high-profile store windows was a new element to our in-store marketing and was very well-received. ", "Looking forward, we're excited about our spring product initiatives as well. Just last week, we launched an updated Poppy collection with a fresh point of view with several new silhouettes, including the hippie, hobo and the Poppy Willis, which harkens back to classic Willis bag of the '90s. We also introduced a fresh spring palette in Madison. In late February, the focus will be on Kristin, with 4 new styles across multiple fabrications and a beautiful new woven leather concept in soft feminine colors. ", "On the Factory side, our strong results were fueled by a powerful combination of new product introduction with key styles offered at great prices. Our product assortment was also supported by our in-store and direct marketing campaigns. ", "I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy and the benefits that we're seeing from it. As you know from previous calls, our digital objective in North America is to drive traffic and build brand awareness while maximizing e-commerce opportunities. Some of our key online initiatives are, first, mobile commerce. We launched our mobile commerce platform this past May, and almost 20% of our web traffic came through a mobile device this holiday season. ", "Second, social media. With over 2.7 million Coach fans on Facebook, this social platform continues to evolve in its contribution to our overall brand message and success. Facebook provides us with additional marketing and potential revenue opportunities as we continue to learn how to engage with our customer in this space. ", "Third, Factory online. As mentioned in our last call, in the U.S., we introduced our invitation-only flash-sale site, targeted only towards our most loyal Factory-exclusive consumers. This provides them with the convenience of shopping online while enjoying the same product and value as found in our stores. We're quite pleased with the results of this highly profitable initiative. ", "While this is a snapshot of our North American Retail digital initiatives, clearly, the Internet will continue to increase in importance globally as both a marketing and communication vehicle and a sales driver. We now have a web presence in 20 countries, 3 of which are commerce-enabled, and we welcome several million visitors outside of North America in the quarter. In China, we're continuing to develop our digital programs and capabilities, which include a planned launch of e-commerce. Additionally, as we grow our international database, we're programmatically communicating with our international consumers via e-mail and seeing engagement at the levels we enjoy here in the U.S. We believe in digital and are clearly recognizing the benefits of this growth vehicle. Our intent is to drive further innovation in this channel, both in the near and long term. ", "As we mentioned in our press release, we're also really excited about the results we're achieving in our men's business, which is on track to double again in fiscal year '12 to over $400 million globally. We experienced success in men's across all concepts and store types, including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. ", "In North America, we see men's both -- as both a way to drive productivity in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. We believe that in this fragmented category where there's no dominant player, Coach has the opportunity to become the market leader. Our approach to growing men's is to create great product, present it in exciting formats, combined with the rigor that we use to understand our consumer and his buying preferences. We also believe based on our surveys that beyond simply taking share, we will actually grow the men's category in North America. ", "In summary, we're excited with the continued progress we've made in improving productivity and our men's initiative. We're feeling great about the spring season, given the current sales trends in our Retail businesses. ", "With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Mike. As most of you know, we have talked to 3 overarching growth strategies: first, building our women's business in the North America market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; and third, tapping into the largely growing men's accessory category. A fourth has emerged as a global business driver and was also mentioned by Mike, and that is leveraging the growing power of the digital world. ", "Coach's digital initiatives are an important and effective complementary strategy to our distribution growth as we continue to grow our store base in North America and worldwide. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 14% this year compared to 9% last year. ", "Starting in North America, we will open about 40 new stores for this year, including the 21 opened in the first half. The FY '12 opening includes about 15 Full Price and 25 Factory outlets, with about half being dedicated men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 10% to 11% this year driven by men's. ", "Turning to China. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or, at least, an additional 15 for the balance of the fiscal year, with the vast majority on the mainland. Virtually all of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the men's opportunity. Given the continued strength we're experiencing in China, we remain confident that we will achieve at least $300 million in sales during the current fiscal year. ", "In Japan, spending has remained stable after the first 2 quarters of volatility in the post-earthquake and tsunami period. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, notably in the men's business. During FY '12, we expect to open about 15 net new locations in Japan or an additional 7 net new stores for the balance of the year, nearly all of them dedicated men's locations. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to 3% in FY '11.", "Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, at the beginning of this month, we successfully transitioned our Domestic Retail businesses in Taiwan, which has about 25 locations and generates about $50 million of annual sales at Retail to Coach's direct control. This follows our acquisition of the Singapore business last summer and will be followed by the acquisition of the Malaysia Domestic Retail operations next July. It's important to note that these acquisitions allow us to leverage the investment we've already made in the region, utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asian distribution center. In addition, we find that these stores experience a significant improvement in productivity when they become directly managed, as we control the total brand experience. ", "Outside of our directly operated markets, we continue to have driving distributor-run businesses in other countries. During FY '12, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations, expanding to new markets, including Brazil, Vietnam and Kuwait. We're also pleased to announce other distribution agreements for Latin America, initially including Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Chile, and to Indonesia, where the first store's opening next year. ", "Touching on Europe, we are building a foundation for long-term growth. First, in the U.K., we are beginning to build our multichannel model. Today, we have 3 stores, all opened in the last 12 months, including a mall store in Westfield, our new Bond Street flagship and a Factory store. We will be opening our second London flagship on Regent Street this spring. Importantly, we are gaining traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and a majority of our business is coming from local customers. And second, in France, where we have partnered with Printemps, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourist, as we continue to grow our brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. ", "In closing, we're confident that our 4 overarching growth strategies will continue to drive our business at a double-digit pace. ", "At this time, I would like to turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our second quarter results. ", "As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 15%. Our Direct-to-Consumer, which represents over 85% of our business, was up 17%, and our Indirect business was even with last year due to shipment timing into international wholesale accounts. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 18% to $1.18 as compared to $1 in the year-ago period as net income rose to $347 million from $303 million. ", "On a non-GAAP basis, our operating income totaled $521 million in the second quarter, up 15% from $453 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 36% compared to 35.9% in the year-ago period. In the second quarter, gross profit rose 14% to $1.05 billion, up from $915 million a year ago, and gross margin rate remained strong at 72.2% compared to 72.4% the prior year. As expected, we showed a continued sequential improvement in the year-over-year variance. ", "Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to gain modest leverage in the holiday quarter, which is our toughest quarter to do so. Specifically, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales improved from the prior year level in the second quarter and represented 36.2% of sales versus 36.5%. ", "As mentioned in our press release, during the second quarter, we recorded certain items. They included the onetime effect of a reevaluation of deferred tax balances due to a change in the Japanese corporate tax laws and the favorable completion of a multiyear pricing agreement with Japan. Taken together, they yielded a substantially lower tax rate of 30.4% for the quarter, which decreased our tax provision by $12 million. As a result, we made a contribution of $20 million to the Coach Foundation, increasing SG&A expenses by that amount and precisely offsetting the effect of the onetime tax benefit to net income and earnings per share. ", "Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at quarter-end were $429 million, up 17% from the end of last year's Q2 and consistent with our sales growth. This inventory level allow us to support 31 net new North American stores, 13 net new locations at Coach Japan and 23 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period as well as the acquired stores in Singapore and Taiwan and our men's initiative. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to maximize sales this spring.", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.1 billion as compared with $940 million a year ago, despite repurchases of over $900 million worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired 4.8 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $62.48, spending a total of $300 million, taking our first half total to about $360 million. At the end of the quarter, about $600 million remained on our current repurchase authorization. ", "Net cash from operating opportunities -- activities in the second quarter was $604 million compared to $408 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $555 million versus $382 million in the same period last year. ", "Our CapEx spending was $39 million versus $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for this year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. ", "We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the rest of the fiscal year. To elaborate, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales growth with earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. Our sales will be driven in part by at least mid-single-digit comp sales in North America for the second half of the fiscal year. Second, as we said before, we expect our second half gross margin to improve over last year as we anniversary increased sourcing costs. Therefore, we anticipate the gross margin for FY '12 will be essentially level with prior year. Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Fourth, we are committed to delivering an operating margin similar to what we've generated over the past 2 years, at about 32%. And fifth, our tax rate is still likely to be in the area of 33% for the remainder of the year.", "Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future, and we're confident that we will continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. ", "Thank you for participating in our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, joined by Jerry Stritzke and Victor Luis, will take some questions, which will be followed by a brief comment from Lew.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bob Drbul with Barclays.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "The question I have is on the men's. You talked about a lot of the growth and a lot of drivers for the growth. You talked about the $400 million for FY '12. Can you update us on what you think the long-term opportunity is for that business and the timing of it?", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. Well, the first word that comes to mind is it's boundless. But to actually try to dimensionalize it, as Mike said, we're experiencing success wherever we're offering a comprehensive assortment of men's, again, across all geographies and all channels, and it's extremely exciting for us. Second, men's spending globally represents about 15% of the global luxury spend. For Coach, with our sales expected as -- men's sales expected at $400 million, that will represent about 8% of our overall sales for this fiscal year. We believe that we can very comfortably get to our rightful share of at least 15% of a larger business over the next few years. So we think $1 billion is well within reach over the next 3 to 5 years, and that's our internal mantra.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great, Lew. And the other question I have, just a quick follow-up, did you guys give ticket and traffic for North American comps?", "Lew Frankfort", "I'm sorry, Bob, your question?", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Can you give ticket and traffic for the North American comps?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Tickets.", "Jane Nielsen", "And traffic.", "Michael D. Tucci", "Tickets in North America from a comp standpoint was up slightly. And traffic, as we said, was very consistent with prior quarters. Overall traffic was greater when you factor in across all channels. Our store traffic in Factory and Full Price stores sequentially improved from Q1, which was a benefit to us. However, it was still down in Full Price and up in Factory.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.", "Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Let me add my congratulations to the whole team as well. I also have a question, very specific question on your mantra on your men's business. Lew and Mike Tucci, maybe if you guys could give us some explanation in terms of the rollout on the North American side. It's been our understanding that you guys are actually pretty under-penetrated within the North American Retail footprint. I'm just wondering, more specifically, what kind of the game plan is maybe as we head into Father's Day this year in terms of getting more products in the stores.", "Michael D. Tucci", "Sure. There are a lot of components to that. And I think what we plan to do with the investor community is share a very detailed global view of our approach to men's expansion for FY '13. But let me give you some grounding and some headlines on what we're doing. First, we're very pleased with the results of our freestanding men's stores. There are a handful of them out there. They are great learning platforms for us, and the performance in those stores is excellent. The larger opportunity that we see is actually expanding our men's business in existing Retail locations through shop-in-shops, what we call concept shops and, in fact, selling more men's products in all stores globally. We're doing this through increased presentations through actually selling our product via our website, enabled in-store through laptops. There's a very broad opportunity for us to sell more product in men's. Where I see us going in Father's Day is several new men's shops which will be installed this spring. The opening of our Pentagon dual-gender location, which will happen in May. That's a women's and men's side-by-side location. And as we enter FY '13, a significant rollout of men's shops in existing Retail locations. So where we see the growth is driving productivity in our existing stores, taking advantage of the men's momentum that we're seeing through CBSR, our Coach By Special Request program, as well as growing freestanding men's stores. Victor, if you want to add little bit on the global side, what we're doing in Asia?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. When we look at -- Lew had mentioned in his remarks that the men's opportunity globally is approximately 15% of the global premium handbag and accessories market, which is at about $28 billion. The Asia opportunity today is about 25% of a $12 billion market. Of that, Japan is approximately $4.4 billion; China at $3.2 billion, including Hong Kong, Macau, including duty-free; and then the rest in -- the rest of Asia. Japan, the men's penetration is at about 25%, and we're still very much in a rollout stage. Today, we have 14 dedicated men's locations, 7 in Full Price, 7 in Factory. As many of you know, most of our distribution in Japan is within department stores where we are on the women's handbag floor, and there, the opportunity will be to increase distribution with the men's floors, which we are now commencing. And initial results have been quite promising. China is really a massive opportunity for us. When we look at mainland China, for many of our competitor brands, men's represent 50% or more of their sales. And there, of our 65 mainland China locations today, 28 of them are dual-gender locations where we have, basically, stand-alone men's presences. Of the 30 locations we are opening this fiscal year, practically all of them will be dual-gender locations. So we're starting with -- very early stages, as basically a global men's and women's brand. And we are seeing truly terrific results with very early stages, 25% to 30% penetration for men's in these locations at a point where we really still don't have an awareness as a men's brand. As many of you know, in the past, we've discussed our brand awareness, our unaided brand awareness at 16%, up from 8% last year, and we're really just starting in the men's space. So to achieve these penetrations this early is truly exciting and bodes well for the future. And in the rest of Asia, we're still at our very early stages. We have, of course, as Lew announced, just taken back our Singapore business and Taiwan only a few weeks ago. And there, we are commencing the men's rollout as well, and that -- and expect to see similar penetrations to what we're seeing in China in the medium term, in the next 2 to 3 years.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Schick from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And let's congratulate you by asking the third question in a row about men's. Just -- the growth is so dynamic, and I'm sure we all have these questions because it sounds like we're going to be talking about it for a long time. Maybe some other metrics we could get into. Gifts versus self-purchase, is it bringing in a new customer or is it a customer making a different trip? Is there a different proportion of gifts versus self-purchase for the men's as you're seeing it? This is just shorter term, but the comp versus distribution growth, just in the number you're talking about, the $400 million. And then lastly, just anything you can tell us about ticket just to sort of round out our view a little bit more again about the characteristics of the men's business.", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. Well, first, gift versus purchased, it varies a lot by market. What we're-- and by channel. At present, I would say it's -- in North America, a slightly greater proportion of men's is for gift than self-purchased, we estimate self-purchase. Among women -- I'm sorry. Gifting for women is about 20% of our sales. I would estimate men's might be 30%. It's obviously a great marketing opportunity for us, and you'll see us just distorting a good portion of our marketing globally, both on the Internet and in traditional media, as well as social networking towards men's to both build awareness and to encourage gifting. And in terms of existing consumers versus new consumers, we are in North America attracting a higher rate of new customers into the franchise through men's than we are women's. But that should be expected, because the women's business is, of course, extremely developed with growth opportunities ahead. But in men's, it's early days. In terms of distribution growth versus same-store sales growth, what I -- I am being cautioned not to provide much detail. What I would say is that we are achieving significant double-digit same-store growth in the men's area.", "Michael D. Tucci", "So let me come in on this one. And what we understand is that the concept is prudent. We have enough exposure in the marketplace and enough experience with consumers to know that the concept is a very proven concept and the category is very real. We need a little more time to very tactically break out the opportunity from a distribution standpoint: our digital opportunity with our men's website; our global opportunity in terms of store footprint, both the existing opportunity in large-format flagship stores to add men; the new opportunity to develop men's and women's dual-gender stores; and how we can provide a men's presence in all stores where we trade that are currently women's stores is something we need to sort out. So we need to really work through the entire fleet in Full Price in North America alone. That's 350 stores. We're doing that work today, and we have traction in each of the formats, which gives us a path for growth. On the product side, what's interesting is that as we expand this category, it's not all about bags. Bag is still the anchor, but we're seeing very strong response to Accessory, to lifestyle category, to emerging categories like by footwear, outerwear, small travel pieces. So we believe that this concept hangs very well on its own and drive very strong productivity metrics comparable to our women's business in terms of ticket size and from a margin structure very comparable as well.", "Lew Frankfort", "You probably heard more about men's just now than you wanted to.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Christine Chen with Needham & Company.", "Christine Chen - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Wanted to ask in women's, handbags, $400 and up. Was curious if you were able to increase the penetration for the holiday season. And I'm wondering what your outlook is for that part of the handbag business going forward for the rest of the year.", "Michael D. Tucci", "Sure. Our overall handbag performance was actually very strong. Comps were positive. We saw growth there. Our mix in handbag, average unit retail was about flat for the quarter, and that was very intentional around our gifting strategy and a mix strategy where some of our core price points at $298 and $198 were extremely successful. The handbag performance at over $400 is actually down from prior year, although our outlook going forward would suggest that, that is still a growth opportunity for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.", "Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I'm more -- I'd like to have some more color on China. What are they selling versus the other markets? You talked about men's and women's, which is fine. How many stores do you think you can have in China in the next 3 to 5 years? And then is there a chance that travel Retail would be a candidate for you to take in-house?", "Lew Frankfort", "Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. First, maybe we can talk a little bit about the distribution. We are, as Lew mentioned in his opening remarks today, 80 doors, with the vast majority of those, 65, on the mainland. When we look at the opportunity, it is truly boundless. And, Barbara, you know well the socio-demographic socio-economics of the market, 1.3 billion population, of which 50% is urban and continuing to urbanize, already 120 cities with a population of 1 million or more. We are today only in 28 of those cities. And with our broad collection from a style perspective as well as our broad price points, we're able to much more easily than traditional luxury brands, of course, to go into the second- and third-tier cities, where we're seeing success. Of course, we are also seeing a rapidly growing middle class, and we're not seeing many limitations from a distribution perspective. When we start looking at Coach's strategy towards a multichannel -- towards multichannel rollout, China really fits nicely. We have approximately 600 department store doors today in China, of which already over 110, 120 are doing incredibly well in the imported luxury cosmetics space, which serves as a barometer for us. Malls are continuing to develop nicely, both in the Full Price as well now an increasing rollout of Factory outlet malls, of course, which we know well. Looking at the rollout for this year, as we've announced, 30 doors, and we see us continuing at that pace for the foreseeable future. I think the second question was on products, and there, we really don't see a tremendous difference globally, quite frankly, in terms of our collection. Madison, Poppy, Kristin are truly global collections for us. The difference and what truly differentiates Coach from many of our competitors is that we have a group of very talented merchants in each of our markets. We're supported by a truly -- a superb consumer insight team. We're constantly listening to our consumers, and that allow us to tweak our collections, whether it be from color, size, shape, style, and, therefore, maximize the opportunity in each of our markets. But the difference, as I touched to earlier, of course, in China is really the men's opportunity, and we're starting out from the beginning in these very early stages as a dual-gender brand. Whereas we have been 3, 4 years earlier opening 1,000- to 1,500-square-feet locations that were basically women's only locations. Today, we're targeting 2,000- to 2,500-square-feet on average. Locations with a men's and women's entrance in most cases and getting truly terrific results in seeing our products resonate, even though we still have very low awareness levels at these early days. Touching on duty-free, and specifically, we're looking at, I would say, 2 parts of the travel Retail piece. Of course, for China, the big opportunity is, outside of China, approximately half of Chinese luxury sales occur outside of China. We're very active in this, developing our distribution in Asia, and we're seeing tremendous benefits from that, of course, within China itself, in Hong Kong and Macau, and beginning to see some of that in other markets as well. Within China domestically at the airports, there will be opportunities, both in the duty-paid as well as in the duty-free spaces as airport authorities begin to put the infrastructure in place. It's something we're investigating. We haven't made a move in that space at the moment, because there's so much opportunity in the urban areas themselves that we're going after, but it is something that we're paying attention to.", "Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Great. Can I just ask one more question about the China outlets? How many malls are there now? How many are you in?", "Victor Luis", "We, today, are in 9 malls, including Hong Kong and Macau, 7 in mainland China. Only a few months ago, I attended a conference with global Factory outlet developers in the city of Suzhou, where there were talk of 100 or so outlets being developed in the next 5 to 10 years. So we expect the channel to develop rather quickly and to be a substantial opportunity.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Randy Konik with Jefferies.", "Randal J. Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "First, Lew, how do you think about the U.S. consumer for 2012 versus 2011? What's your thoughts there? And then I guess, Lew or Jane, if we kind of think about the various moving pieces of increasing Asian -- increasing China as a percent of sales, increasing men's as a percent of sales and then taking back these various Asian geographies, how do we think about the long-term operating margin structure for the company? They're very consistent, in the low 30s the last couple of years. How can we think about where that -- those operating margins end up over the next few years?", "Lew Frankfort", "Firstly, Randy, as I mentioned, the consumer sentiment has really improved over the last 90 days. And actually, 60% of consumers now in North America believe the economy is stable or improving, and that's up from 48% just 3 months ago. In -- it's also evident that consumers are beginning to borrow more and save somewhat less. Savings rates, as you know, are down to about 3.5% from 5%. And year-on-year non-mortgage borrowing is increasing, which says that the consumers are more encouraged than they -- at any point than they have been in the last 6 to 12 months. So we feel, barring any unexpected event, that the consumer sentiment will continue to be positive. Obviously, the recovery is very uneven. While unemployment is still at a terribly high rate of 8.5%, unemployment for college graduates over the age of 25, who is our primary consumer, is only in the mid-4 range. So we are benefiting from our positioning, which is to offer excellent product at accessible and affordable price points, and our very diversified consumer base is responding well. So guardedly optimistic.", "Jane Nielsen", "And I think as we look at the components of operating leverage, I think that the net -- long-term positives that we have are: our growing international business driving overall operating margin as it continues to grow and achieve scale, our men's business as it grows internationally, achieves scale, will also be a positive operating driver and will continue to drive productivity initiatives and efficiency initiatives that we've delivered over time to keep our high operating profit and to continue to invest in growth. As we say -- as you know, as we've talked before, as we take over markets like Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, there is -- we -- there is the initial few quarters as we purchase the inventory at wholesale rates and we cadence our flow of merchandising and take over the store operations. Over time, those become very good businesses for us.  But we have the first few quarters of transition before their operating margin stabilizes and becomes a net benefit for us.", "Randal J. Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Is it -- can you hear me?", "Lew Frankfort", "Yes.", "Jane Nielsen", "Yes.", "Randal J. Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I'm sorry. Is there just a number we could look towards? Is there like a 35 number or anything like that you'd want to kind of...", "Lew Frankfort", "Randal, we don't have an aspirational goal. You know us well.  We drive to build a lasting franchise and give our shareholders an excellent return. And it's -- and obviously, we're working in all areas to maximize operating income consistent with building a lasting franchise.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Questions, Lew, on the gross margins here. I mean, it still sounds like we're hearing that double-digits labor cost increase in China. So just trying to understand sort of where is your gross margin improvement coming from. If you can just give us little more color there. Is it channel mix? Is it all relief and sourcing, and how that's happening? And then on the new headquarters that we've been hearing about, can you maybe talk about any cash flow implications from that, and does that change -- or your commitment towards your continued share repurchases or dividends? Maybe just talk about the cash flow and your minimal cash balance requirements.", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. Let me ask Jerry Stritzke to jump in here.", "Jerry Stritzke", "On the sourcing opportunities, I mean, we were very pleased with the job that our team has really done trying to mitigate some of those challenges. And it's hard work that we've done, a lot of work trying to get raw material sources in place to help offset -- working on where we're doing our manufacturing, how we're doing it. But it is still a pressure that we have to cope with that, push it the wrong way, and it creates some pressure on our margin. We're forcing in that as our International business does grow.  Particularly in Asia, that's a plus. But then there's -- we have puts and takes. As we expand the other markets we get, we go the other direction. So we are really striving to kind of -- to lose point to hold the ground. But there are puts and takes, and we fight that battle every other time. And we've talked, I think, before about our kind of sourcing activities in Vietnam, India. We're actually continuing to expand that and aggressively look at that. We've had some great successes that have worked to our benefit. I think it's a reflection of the talent we have offshore, which we think is unique to Coach, to really build manufacturing capabilities. And our hands-on activity do that in the way that ensures that we continue to deliver high-quality product.", "Jane Nielsen", "And in the next quarter or 2, as is our practice, we'll come back and talk to you about our next year's outlook on gross margins.", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And how about the headquarters and the cash flow thoughts?", "Jane Nielsen", "Yes, I think that what you've seen in our Q2 repurchase activity, we remain committed to 2 things. One is investing in our business to continue to drive long-term growth and return, and the second is we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. We're doing that through a combination of dividends, which you've seen increase over time since our initiation, and through stock repurchases. And I don't anticipate that our building would stop that in any meaningful way.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you, Jane.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. It is now 9:30. The market's about to open. So as is our tradition, I'd like to turn it back to Lew for a few closing words. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, thank you, Andrea. Obviously, a lot of good discussions around men's; China; our stabilizing gross margins, which I think is a testimony to the nimbleness of our team; the digital world is really powerful and is now for us an overarching strategy. So we do feel good about where we are, and we feel excited about our prospects. ", "So have a good day, everybody. Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude the Coach earnings conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thanks, Wendy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. With me to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; and Jane Nielsen, Coach's CFO. Mike Tucci, North American Group President is also joining us to discuss our retail initiatives, including Men's and digital and new product introductions.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2011, for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our third fiscal quarter 2012 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. Mike Tucci will review some new initiatives in North American retail, product and merchandising strategy and Men's. Jane Nielsen will conclude with details on financial and operational results of the quarter. Following that, we will hold the Q&A session where we will be joined by Jerry Stritzke, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Victor Luis, our International Group President. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Lew will then conclude with some brief summary comments. ", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we're very pleased with our third quarter results, including strong sales and earnings growth, as well as operating margin expansion. Our performance clearly demonstrates the vibrancy of the Coach brand, our innovative and relevant product offering and our multichannel international distribution model. Further, the announcement today of the increased dividend reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach's future. ", "While I will get into more detail about the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter were: first, earnings per share rose 24% to $0.77 compared with $0.62 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $1.11 billion versus $951 million a year ago, an increase of 17%; third, direct-to-consumer sales, which represent over 85% of total sales, and now include domestic retail businesses in Singapore and Taiwan, rose 18% to $984 million from $837 million in the prior year on a comparable basis; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 6.7% from prior year while total North American direct-to-consumer sales rose 13%; fifth, we continued to generate very strong sales growth of nearly 60% and double-digit comps in China, where we remain on course to generate at least $300 million in sales this year; and finally, sales in Japan rose 10% versus prior year in constant currency and rose 14% in dollars. ", "In North America during the quarter, we opened one retail store, closed another, while opening 5 factory stores, including 2 Men's factory stores. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 350 full-priced and 162 factory stores in operation in North America. ", "Moving to China. We added 5 new locations, all on the Mainland, bringing us to 85 Coach locations at quarter end, including 12 in Hong Kong, 3 in Macau and 70 locations on the Mainland in 32 cities. ", "And in Japan, 3 locations were opened, all Men's, while 3 were closed. At quarter end, there were 184 total locations in Japan. ", "Finally, I thought I would briefly mention our 2 other direct businesses in Asia acquired this fiscal year. First, in Singapore, we now operate 6 locations. Five were acquired last July, and we've opened one additional store since. And second, Taiwan, where we transitioned 26 locations to our direct control in January. ", "Indirect sales rose 10% from prior year to $125 million from $114 million on an -- on a comparable basis. Sales for the quarter at retail and international wholesale locations increased while sales at POS in U.S. department stores were modestly below last year's third quarter. ", "We estimate that the addressable women's U.S. handbag and accessory category grew about 10% in the March quarter, consistent with the increases it experienced over the last year. Similarly, Coach's total North American women's bag and accessory business grew at the same rate as the category over the period. ", "Separately, it's worth noting that we once again saw continued modest improvement in our customers' outlook for the economy, with about 66% of those surveyed now believing that the U.S. economy is stable or getting better, up from 60% last quarter and 58% a year ago. ", "Our intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with more than 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months. In North America, our total revenues rose 12%, with our directly operated businesses up 13% driven by a 7% comp as we managed the business to balance productivity gains and margin improvement. ", "All direct channels benefited from our innovative digital media strategy, spanning our own websites, mobile platform and social media, which enabled customers to purchase wherever they preferred to engage with our brand. The primary driver of our retail comp gain was an increase in the overall number of transactions while an increase in average transaction size contributed as well. Overall retail traffic rose as traffic on the Internet continued to gain momentum, with in-store trends consistent with prior quarters. ", "Turning to our store channels. Both performed similarly, fueled by average transaction size gains while conversion also rose in retail stores. ", "As we've discussed many times outside of North America, China is our largest geographic opportunity given the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the quarter, our sales again rose sharply, up nearly 60% from prior year, fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales growth. This overall growth rate was similar to our last quarter with a change in composition of the drivers, as distribution was the larger contributor to growth. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach as evidenced by the extremely high repurchase intent of over 90% among existing customers. ", "While Jane will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I did want to give you this recap. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss some organizational changes, which we put into place over the quarter, to more closely align the leadership of Coach with the needs of our business, both in North America and in our rapidly expanding international markets. These changes will help us leverage our many business opportunities around the world and prepare us to operate efficiently at the scale we envision during our planning horizon. ", "First, Mike Tucci has assumed the new role of North American Group President responsible for North American retail, global, digital media and customer engagement and North American wholesale. This will ensure an even more cohesive approach to our brand, merchandising and retail experience wherever our customers choose to shop with us in North America. ", "And second, on the international side, Victor Luis has assumed a new role of International Group President responsible for our directly operated retail businesses in Coach Japan, Coach China and Coach Asia and for our wholesale business within Coach international. This will facilitate an even smoother transition of businesses we plan to manage directly in the future, such as Malaysia and Korea. It will create significant synergies as we look to optimize our brand experience in our own directly managed stores, in our distributorships in Coach Europe and in a growing global travel retail market. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American retail business and our global product initiative. Mike?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Today, I'd like to review a number of retail strategies that were implemented in North America during the quarter, as well as providing an update on our global product initiatives and our Men's business. ", "As noted in our press release, we leveraged the underlying strength in our North American business and implemented a significant shift in our pricing strategy in factory stores during the quarter, as we eliminated in-store couponing across our network. Our new \"no math\" pricing structure provides us with greater marketing flexibility and a more targeted value proposition while enabling us to drive excellent margins. Additionally, our store associates can now devote more time and energy to engagement, sharing product knowledge and building the sale. ", "Complementing these in-store strategies, we expanded our e-commerce factory programs. As you know, earlier this fiscal year, we introduced an invitation-only flash-sale site targeted towards our most loyal, factory-exclusive consumers. This provides them with the convenience of shopping online, enjoying the same product and value as found in our stores for a limited time period. ", "We also began working with a number of small -- of third-party flash sites, targeting their unique databases of value-conscious consumers with the intention of introducing them to Coach factory, which also contributed to our overall comp this quarter. Our early results indicate further opportunity for highly profitable customer acquisition in this value channel. ", "Moving on to product. During the third quarter, we launched an updated Poppy collection with a fresh point of view and several new silhouettes, including the hippie, hobo and, most importantly, the Willis, which harkens back to the classic Willis bag of the '90s. We also introduced a fresh spring palette in Madison. ", "In late February, we focused on Kristin with 4 new styles across multiple fabrication and a beautiful new woven leather concept in soft, feminine colors. At the end of the quarter, we launched Hamptons Weekend, primarily a tote and shoulder bag group, which was also informed by a collection from our archives. ", "One of the most exciting product successes we're enjoying is the excellent consumer response to both Willis and Hamptons Weekend on a global level. Both of these groups rooted in classic Coach are precursors to and will be components of a major collection launch this summer called Legacy. ", "Also inspired by our heritage, grounded in leather and featuring iconic Coach elements, the dual-gender Legacy lifestyle collection will encompass the complete world of Coach and will be our largest product launch in many years. Early pilots are currently underway and results underscore our confidence in this major initiative. ", "The Legacy launch will also drive new merchandising strategies across all retail stores, including presenting a bolder lifestyle story for our brand, incorporating categories such as outerwear, jewelry, small accessories, watches and scarves, presenting men's and women's together in a powerful store environment and driving major color stories in handbags and accessories to highlight key items. ", "We're also very excited about the results we're continuing to achieve in our Men's business, which is on track to double again this year to over $400 million globally. We experienced success in Men's across all concepts and store types, including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. In North America, we see Men's as both a way to drive productivity in existing stores and a substantial new distribution opportunity. ", "Given this success, we're now accelerating the rollout of Men's within existing retail stores. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect to have a broader expression of Men's in nearly 100 Coach retail stores in North America, up from 42 at the end of the third quarter. Outside the U.S. where Men participate in the category at a higher rate, new dual gender and dedicated Men's shops will remain the primary distribution growth vehicles. ", "In summary, we're pleased with the continued progress we've made in improving productivity and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the balance of the spring season, given the current sales trends in our retail businesses and the Legacy launch in the seasons ahead. ", "With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and other opportunities for growth. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Mike. As most of you know, we have 4 overarching growth strategies: first, building our women's business in the North American market; second, leveraging the global opportunity; third, tapping into the large and growing men's accessory category; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world. ", "As our distribution plans for the current year haven't changed since our last earnings call in January, I will briefly recap. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 13% this year compared to 9% in FY '11. ", "Starting in North America, we're on course to open about 40 new stores this year, including the 27 opened during the first 9 months. These openings will include about 15 full-priced and 25 factory outlets, with about half being dedicated Men's locations. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 10% this year, driven by Men's.", "Turning to China. As you know, this year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 30 locations planned or an additional 10 for the balance of fiscal year, bringing the total to about 95 at the end of FY '12. All of these openings will be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. ", "In Japan, we now expect to open about 10 net new locations with an additional 2 net new stores expected during the fourth quarter. In total, we anticipate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year compared to 3% last year. ", "Consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets at the beginning of the quarter, we transitioned our domestic retail business in Taiwan, which has about 25 locations and generates about $50 million of annual sales at retail to Coach's direct control. This follows our acquisition of Singapore last summer and will be followed by the acquisition of our Malaysian domestic retail operations in July, as we have previously announced. ", "In addition, as noted in our press release, we are very pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement to take control of our Korean domestic retail business from our current distributor, Shinsegae International, effective in early FY '13. Over the last several years, we have enjoyed an excellent partnership with Shinsegae. They have been instrumental in the development of the Coach brand in Korea, including the opening of several important locations in key department stores in Seoul and in other major cities throughout the country. ", "For perspective, our current annual sales in Korea are about $120 million, including global travel retail, or about 5% of the $2.4 billion premium bag and accessory market. The domestic retail business generates about $60 million across 47 locations. In addition, there are 14 Korean travel retail locations, which will continue to be managed by third-party, duty-free operators and are not part of this agreement. ", "It's important to note that these acquisitions allow us to leverage the investment we have already made in the region utilizing the infrastructure created over the last few years, including our Asia shared services center and the Asia distribution center. In addition, we find these stores experience a significant improvement in productivity when they become directly managed, as we control the total brand experience.", "Outside of our directly operated markets, we continue to have thriving distributor-run businesses in other locations. This year, we expect to open about 35 net new international wholesale locations expanding to new markets, including Brazil, Vietnam and Kuwait. In fact, our first location in Brazil opened earlier this month in Morumbi Shoppings mall to an excellent consumer response. We believe this bodes well for our expansion into other South American countries later this calendar year. ", "Touching on Europe, where we're beginning to build a foundation for long-term growth. First, in the U.K., we have started our multichannel model. This week, we will open a shop-in-shop in Liberty department store and a flagship store on Regent Street. We are continuing to gain traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and the majority of our business is domestic. ", "Second, in France, where we have partnered with Printemps, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourists, as we build Men's -- as we build brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. In total, we expect to open 11 locations in Europe in FY '12, bringing our total locations to 25 by year end.", "In closing, we're energized by the continued pace of change in growth at Coach. We're confident that our 4 overarching growth strategies will continue to drive our momentum and enable us to realize the many opportunities in front of us. ", "At this time, I would like to turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financials of our third quarter results. ", "As we mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 17%. Our direct-to-consumer segment, which represents over 85% of our business, was up 18%, and our indirect business rose 10%. As a reminder, the year-ago revenues for both segments were adjusted for the transition of Singapore and Taiwan. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 24% to $0.77 as compared to $0.62 in the year-ago period, as net income rose to $225 million from $186 million. ", "For the third quarter, our operating income totaled $337 million, up 21% from the -- from $280 million reported on a non-GAAP basis in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter expanded 100 basis points to 30.4% compared to 29.4% in the year-ago period. In the third quarter, gross profit rose 18% to $818 million from $692 million a year ago, and gross margin rate expanded 100 basis points to 73.8% compared to 72.8% the prior year, driven by both manufacturing cost benefits and new pricing strategies implemented in the quarter. ", "Moving to expenses. We were pleased that we were able to hold our expense rate in the third quarter, given the previously discussed impact of the Taiwan transition. Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percent of sales was 43.3% versus 43.4% on a non-GAAP basis. As noted in our press release, during the year-ago quarter, we recorded certain items including a favorable tax settlement. As a result, we made charitable contribution which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the prior year's third quarter was $254 million with a 26.7% margin and the SG&A expense ratio was 46.1%. ", "Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $475 million, up 21% from Q3 last year. This inventory level allows us to support 34 net new North American stores, 10 net new locations in Coach Japan and 30 additional Coach China stores from the year-ago period, as well as the acquired stores in Singapore and Taiwan and our Men's initiatives. Further, it will support strong underlying business trends, enabling us to meet demand this season. ", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $930 million as compared with $886 million a year ago after the repurchase of over $900 million worth of Coach common stock in the interim 12 months. ", "During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired 2.3 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $73.92, spending a total of $172 million, taking our fiscal year date -- year-to-date total to about $530 million. At the end of the quarter, about $430 million remained in our current repurchase authorization. ", "Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $103 million compared with $227 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow from -- in the third quarter was an inflow of $61 million versus $186 million in the same period last year, primarily reflecting the changes in accrued income taxes and charitable donations. ", "Our CapEx spending was $41 million versus $42 million in the same quarter a year ago. Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, CapEx for this year will be in the area of $200 million, driven primarily by the opening of new stores across all geographies and investments in technology necessary to enable our expansion. ", "We were very pleased to once again report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike said, we're well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. ", "To elaborate on our fourth quarter assumptions, first, we expect to achieve double-digit sales and earnings per share growth ahead of the top line. This plan includes North America comp sales at least as high as what we generated in the third quarter, as we continue to balance productivity gains with margin improvement. ", "Second, we continue to expect gross margin to expand from prior year levels in the fourth quarter, driven by our sourcing initiatives and pricing strategies. Therefore, we anticipate the gross margin for FY '12 will be similar to prior year level.", "Third, on SG&A, we expect our developed businesses to continue to deliver leverage while we will also continue to invest in global growth for the future. Given that we've been accelerating the transition of distributor-operated wholesale businesses to our direct control, we would expect expenses to slightly outpace top line growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year, however, our SG&A expense rate should be similar to FY '11. ", "Fourth, and based on the metrics I've just described, we believe that we'll continue to deliver operating leverage in the fourth quarter of 2012 with a full year operating margin slightly ahead of last year's rate of 32%. And fifth, our tax rate is still likely to be in the area of 33%. ", "Before we open it up to Q&A, I want to echo Lew's earlier words. This was an excellent quarter for Coach. Clearly, our spring results bode well for the future, and we're confident we can continue to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. ", "Thank you all for participating in our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, joined by Jerry Stritzke and Victor Luis, will take some questions, which will be followed by a brief comment from Lew.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bob Drbul from Barclays Capital.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "The first question that I have, Lew, is can you talk a little bit about how you plan to continue to drive comp store sales and differentiate from the competition going forward, given the competitive set of the category currently?", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. Well, let me first say, the category continues to grow worldwide. And here in the U.S., it's growing on at about a 10% level on the women's side. And on the men's side, of course, at a faster level. We are a dual-gender brand. And while our growth on the women's side are equaled to the category, during the last quarter, our overall growth exceeded the over -- the dual-gender growth in premium bags and accessories. So there's a lot of opportunity. First, with regard to Men's, as Mike indicated, our business is on-track to double to over $400 million this year globally, which represents about 8% of our sales. We believe next year, it will be well in excess of 10% of our business. And we are accelerating the introduction of Men's into a much broader range of our full-priced stores and shop-in-shops worldwide. So we're looking to capitalize on the growing category and the strength of the product offering and, of course, our growing brand loyalty in this category. Secondly, and more broadly on the product front, as Mike indicated and we've talked about many times, Bob, the launching of Legacy, which is a global lifestyle brand of concept, which is a dual gender, and we are using that to re-platform our full-priced stores. And we have enormous optimism for what that group is going to do. Mike mentioned our pilots are doing really well, so a combination of Men's and the re-platforming on the women's side to really focus on Legacy. And of course, internationally, we have an enormous opportunity with the much larger role that Men's plays in markets such as China to truly establish ourselves as a dual-gender brand. The digital side should also be referenced, Bob. We're so excited about the progress we've made in this last year to harness its power and to really give consumers an opportunity to shop wherever they choose to shop. And with our very robust 15 million database in North America, it gives us great, great opportunities.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Schick with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "The question is really around the sourcing work and the pricing strategy that you're putting into place now and I guess have been. What does that mean to the long-term gross margin profile of the business? Would prior gross margin peaks like 78% be achievable over a longer-term planning horizon?", "Jane Nielsen", "David, I think that, right now, we're comfortable with our guidance, which says that we'll continue to see margin expansion in the fourth quarter and that we'll be about similar levels to FY '11. And as is our custom, we'll come back in the fourth quarter and give you our best outlook for FY '13. As always, we continue to look for initiatives, such as counter sourcing, designing into cost, putting our manufacturing base, diversifying it outside of China. Those are ongoing initiatives that we continue to focus on to drive gross margin, and we're very happy with the results that we've seen in our results in the factory initiative.", "Michael D. Tucci", "Just to elaborate a little bit on the pricing piece of the margin equation here, we spent a lot of time on the sourcing and supply side to really work through our scale, our unit advantages, the tremendous work that Jerry and his team have done to building costing opportunity. And what we saw with the all-store discounting is sort of a blanket effect on promotional stance in factory stores. And with the underlying strength in the business coming out of Q2, we really made the determination that we could get away from that and leverage cost savings by being more targeted in the way that we market to our consumer and offer value to the consumer in the factory channel. We still had very strong productivity gains there, strong comps, and we were able to build in margin advantage, taking advantage of the costing opportunities that existed. So we believe that it is long term. We're working it every day. We continue to probe and test for ideas around how we can play. We realize the factory is a value channel, and we'll continue to be aggressive there. But the early gains for us around margin and maintaining strong productivity are very attractive, and we want to push hard as we move into the fall season to really take advantage of that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.", "Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Mike, I've got to ask some questions about the guys, about the Men's product. So I'm speaking about the 100-plus stores or so that you guys have launched in terms of getting a little bit of a capsule collection within your full-priced stores, and we've started to see that in our market in the beginning of April. How many more of those do you think you could roll out by the time you have Legacy? And I just have a follow-up question to that.", "Michael D. Tucci", "Yes, good question. Actually, part of your question is really where the answer is. We went back in with the Legacy launch, which is targeted for late July, and we put together a plan in our stores. Lew used the phrase re-platforming to create a real strong visual presence in our stores around marketing and product presentation, using the launch of Legacy as the catalyst. And we identified actually, to be precise, 108 stores that will get what I would call a more supercharged effort around presentation and physical enhancement. Coincidental with that, we also looked at our Men's proposition at 42 stores with shops or more expanded Men's presence and quickly made the leap and said, \"Can we get Men's advanced and expanded in those 100 stores to take advantage of the duality between Legacy, the strength of the women's proposition and putting Men's in at the same time?\" That is all happening as we speak and will be front and center for the Legacy launch. We are, at the same time, looking at the balance of our 250 stores for further opportunity. We are working hard on lease expirations and opportunities for expansion in our primary mall locations. So this will be an ongoing effort. And my sense is that every quarter or every season, we'll have an opportunity to layer in more Men's shops as we get deeper into the fleet and as we get more empirical experience on the improved productivity that Men's gives us by adding it to an existing women's store. My goal would be to get a stronger Men's presence in all stores very quickly. For competitive reasons, I'm not going to elaborate further, but we are doing things to bring Men's products closer to our consumers in all stores through technology and other marketing advantages that we have that we'll continue to probe on in piloting. You'll see us doing more with that in the marketplace very soon as well.", "Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Mike, if I could just squeeze in one quick follow-up related to that. Given that this is such a unique opportunity for -- like a first-ever, dual-gender launch of a line in fall, does it make sense to implement more of a celebrity approach, particularly around the Men's? You guys do that when you go into international markets on the women's side. I'm just wondering at what point we might see that strategy deployed on the Men's side?", "Michael D. Tucci", "I think what you'll see with regard to Legacy and Men's is a very holistic and complete approach to our marketing strategy.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the South Korea buyback but -- with that and Taiwan and Singapore, Malaysia. How do you -- what kind of resources are needed to take these businesses in-house? And when you buy them, what kind of pricing do you get for the deal? And then do you get with that a lot of the infrastructure that comes with it, or do you have to rebuild from scratch? Can you kind of walk us through the process how we should think about these deals financially and then operationally from an investment perspective?", "Lew Frankfort", "Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. In essence, when we're buying these businesses back, we are creating the teams in-market from scratch. In certain cases, of course, inheriting team members from our distributors and then hiring new, specifically, general management into place as well. At the same time, we are leveraging the infrastructure that we have invested in Shanghai to support these businesses across the region, specifically, as we've mentioned in past calls, our Asia distribution center, which supports across the region, as well as shared services across IS logistics and then transactional accounting, payroll and the like, which allow us to get some leverage from the infrastructure that we have going in. Saying that, there is a buildup that happens domestically in the markets, and usually, there is a 6-month challenge. We have to purchase back inventory, which has an impact, of course, as well as getting the store performance up. Usually, we're having to make a substantial investment in store staff to get what we refer to as the traffic per -- our TPLH numbers in line with our international standards. Traffic per labor hour is the measure that we use for those who are not familiar with TPLH.", "Jane Nielsen", "And, Omar, if you look at these on a financial basis, they are very  value-creating transactions over time. We -- as we've discussed before, there's some first-year dislocations as we buyback the inventory at wholesale cost, and we assume all of the SG&A of the entity that we purchased. But over time, they are very value creating. We're very happy with the deals that we've announced.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.", "Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Can you comment on the margins on China and Japan? Do you expect -- anticipate accelerating margins with the emphasis on Men's versus the original model of women's only? And how should we be thinking about margin projection -- projected margins in Singapore and Taiwan?", "Jane Nielsen", "Well, as you know, the margins in our China business, our Japan business are very attractive. Overall, we're very happy with the gross margins that we have internationally. Over time, our international growth is a margin enhancer for total Coach, so we're very encouraged by that. We expect that our acquired businesses will also be margin enhancing for Coach after we get through that initial transition period, where we're working through the inventory that was bought back at wholesale level.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Tunick with JPMC.", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I guess first for you, Lew. I mean, you talked about the 4 overarching growth strategies, and obviously, you have a great balance sheet. What is your view on the trade-offs of acquisitions? And then for Mike, it sounds like your core customer is feeling better. The product innovation continues to be super strong. What do you think it would take to turn traffic trends positive in the full-priced stores?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Well, first, with regard to acquisitions and, Brian, we've talked about this many times, we have enormous run rate organically with the Coach business and we don't see acquisitions as a imperative to driving double-digit top line and bottom line growth. So it's not a strategy that we have been pursuing. Mike?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Sure. I'm actually very pleased with where we are from a traffic standpoint. And, Brian, we look at things in the aggregate. Traffic was up in full price and factory. In-store traffic, as we said, was similar to prior levels. Where we see opportunity is this idea that we can drive excitement into our stores with further introduction of the Men's concept and the launch of Legacy. And our optimism there is significant. It's an opportunity for us to show significant excitement and product advancements to the consumer, and that's where we see the opportunity.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Black with Citigroup.", "Jeff Black - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "On China, you mentioned double-digit comps. Any real change in trend there in the quarter? And when we look at the distribution model, what are you learning as you expand into the Mainland? What works best in terms of both demographics and/or format? And does that really alter the thinking as it relates to the mix of flagships, retail, shop-in-shops, et cetera?", "Lew Frankfort", "Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. First, I would just reiterate that we're extremely pleased, as Lew mentioned, with our terrific growth in the quarter, which at 60% is similar to the growth that we experienced last quarter, and we remain very much on-target to achieve our target of $300 million, which we announced last October. As Lew also mentioned, there was a shift in the drivers of growth this quarter with more of the sales increase coming from new doors which are performing ahead of our plans. Specifically, what we're seeing in terms of comp within China is increased travel and purchases internationally, especially from the Tier 1 consumers, which would be these consumers from Shanghai, Beijing going more overseas. While the Tier 2 and Tier 3 consumers, these consumers in second and third tier cities, shopping closer to home, driving our non-comp sale. I would remind us that we're now at 32 cities across China, still a very small portion of the 120-or-so cities that have a population of 1 million or more. And indeed, of the 18 locations that we've opened year-to-date in China, 14 have been in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And all but one of the locations that we will open this quarter are also in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And these are cities that will benefit disproportionately from the growth of the middle class and Chinese government investments in infrastructure. And longer term, as we think about as well the fact that GDP consumption, as a percentage of GDP in China, is at 35% compared with the 70% here in the U.S., of course, these vast majority of Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities will also be drivers within the longer-term opportunity for us. Specifically, in terms of the models in new stores to the second part of your question, we have the same multichannel strategy in China that we leverage globally, opening up flagship stores, retail stores in shopping malls, locations in department stores and factory outlets. And of course, each of these channels are at different levels within different cities. And the opportunity for us is always, first and foremost, to focus on providing the brand with a very good position in each of the markets and then expanding from there. We tend to first open within luxury malls, first and foremost, expanding then to department stores and more bridge or fashion malls as they develop. And the opportunity there is quite massive, as most of these second- and third-tier cities still do not have these locations as they're only on the drawing boards today, and then eventually, of course, into factory outlet malls, which will undoubtedly be a massive opportunity long term within the China market. And they are only now beginning to gain a little bit of traction.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Randy Konik with Jefferies.", "Randal J. Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a question first for Mike, with the change in the couponing strategy in the outlet channel, which is great long-term strategy. How do you think that impacts -- I think you said traffic was up during the quarter in outlet. Do you think that impacts traffic negatively in a big way going forward? Do you see differences in conversion, so forth? And then, I guess, just for Jane. On Japan, can you just remind us how the tsunami impacted the fundamentals of the financials of Japan last year? And of the 4 buckets of gross margin you've talked about being easier compares from Japan move to manufacturing out of China, channel mix and China sales growth, what would be the most important of those 4 buckets to take the gross margins higher in the back half and beyond?", "Jane Nielsen", "Yes. Why don't I start with the tsunami impact in Japan? If you -- overall, in the third quarter, the impact of the tsunami was about 9% in the third quarter last year. So our growth of 10% shows that we're back in this quarter to pre-tsunami levels. In the fourth quarter, we were down about 7% in local currency. That excludes the 53rd week, and that was all due to the impact of the tsunami. In terms of gross margins, we really view it as multiple initiatives. So obviously, our sourcing initiative is very important to counterbalance labor inflation. Counter sourcing is very important for us on the material side. And gross margin expansion is also very linked to our attractive mix of countries as we grow international. There are really a multiple of levers that we're all working at the same time. Some are producing more sometimes, some are producing a little less, and they're growing over time.", "Lew Frankfort", "Mike?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Sure. On the pricing and marketing within factory, we do see it as long -- as a long-term strategy. There will always be puts and takes in terms of metrics, but the initial results are very, very strong and encouraging. Again, we're doing this from a position of underlying strength, leveraging the product offer, the pricing opportunity in our factory stores, the robust trends in traffic, conversion, ADT within the channel and also leveraging this idea of dual channel in factory around the digital opportunity to a targeted and discrete audience. The overall driver of comp is that transactions are up, and that's what we want to focus on. We want to focus on productivity and enhancing as best we can across the metrics for the long term.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.", "Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research", "So as I'm listening to sort of all the puts and takes on comp, it seems as though you really have the levers to kind of control the factory comp to the extent that you want to, to sort of gain the optimal margin and sales mix. And so as we look at this quarter's comp, in part it sounds like you maybe held back the factory a little bit in favor of better gross margins. And as we move forward, you continue to have that ability, plus with this re-platforming of the brand that we're expecting with the August floor set, perhaps we'll see even greater conversion and traffic. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Lew Frankfort", "You said it better than we've said it. The reality is that we could have driven higher comps if we wanted to, but we are -- we have a very strong long-term view, and what we're doing is in the interest of the brand. And as Jane indicated, we expect comps this quarter to be at least as high as they were last quarter. And we urge you to understand that we have a robust international diversified business model. We have great opportunities, and we feel very pleased with where we are and where we came out and what the future bodes for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Can you talk a little bit about the runway for the gross margin improvement coming from manufacturing and the new pricing strategy? Is there more to go on that? And then just maybe what the pricing is on an average handbag now, and what percent over $400? And then just one last thing, Victor and Mike, congratulations, new functions and the new roles.", "Lew Frankfort", "Lots of questions embedded in your question. Let me ask Jerry, if he would, to talk a bit more about runway on gross margin, and you may even want to talk to -- what Mike referenced earlier about our pricing latitude on the factory side to give us improved margins over time.", "Jerry Stritzke", "Yes. We -- as you know, we've been working on -- working in the sourcing base to offset margin pressures. A lot of those margin pressures, again, as you've seen in the press you guys have covered, has really been pressure on raw materials, pressure on increased labor. We're 2 years into really a 4-year plan to diversify our sourcing base to offset those, and we're going to continue that over the next couple of years. We see that as, again, offsetting pressures that exist in the market. So it's really more of trying to maintain our margin rate. The other thing that has really presented itself as an opportunity in support of Victor's business is they become more sophisticated in operating in Asia. We're looking at the idea of how do we manufacture in a country to allow -- to take advantage of duty benefits. So as we become a more international global organization, we're finding that the significant opportunity is for us to locate our manufacturing in a place where we can obtain trade benefits, whether it be from Vietnam to Japan, et cetera. So those are things we're looking for as we move to the future, to continue to give us margin upside and advantages. And the idea that is it just one thing or is it another, it's really the work that Mike's doing in his channel really complements the work that we're doing on the manufacturing side. So it's really both. And the idea of keeping our margin strong, and we have the strongest margin in the industry. The -- I'll let the over $400 performance -- Mike?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Yes. We really had very, very strong balance in handbags. Average unit retail in total were up slightly, over 400 penetrations were even. And very, very important here, remember that we introduced Willis in the quarter, and it was a key driver for us. And that's a handbag retail at around $300. So we feel like we hit a very strong balance tone in the quarter around handbag. I think the last question was around roles, and why don't I just add a couple of thoughts on that? One is I'm very excited about the opportunity within North America, really, to take a 360 view of our customer across all channels. We have a very strong position in department stores, tremendous relationships with our key partners there, premium positioning within the handbag world in department stores and an opportunity for us to really expand and grow our business in a very important channel to us from a consumer standpoint. And I'm excited about getting involved with that, particularly on the eve of the Legacy launch.", "Lew Frankfort", "Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. So my responsibilities have increased to include all of our indirect businesses outside of North America, so all of our wholesale operations, including, of course, our global duty-free businesses. And as Mike, I'm very excited about that opportunity where we can, of course, leverage the learnings from our consumers who are increasingly global consumers, and in doing so, also partner with Mike, of course, in capturing that opportunity here in the U.S., so truly looking to scale the teams that we have in place and to drive our businesses as a truly global operation.", "Operator", "And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrea for closing comments.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you, all, for joining us on our conference call today. As Jane noted, I'd now like to turn it back to Lew for a few closing words. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "I think pretty much everything has been said. We continue extremely optimistic about what the future bodes for us. We do continue to believe we have unlimited opportunities. If you were to visit us here at our 516 building, you would see a level of excitement among staff at all levels that hasn't been here for many years. The growth in Men's and the opportunities there, along with the dual-gender Legacy, has led us to look at the business in a very bold and aggressive way. ", "So as we've said before, stay tuned. There's a lot to come. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the Coach Earnings Conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly and fiscal year end results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman; and Jane Nielsen, Coach's CFO. Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters and fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2011 for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our fourth fiscal quarter and annual 2012 results and will also discuss our overarching strategies. Jane Nielsen will continue with details on financial and operational results of the quarter and year. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session where we'll be joined by Mike Tucci, North American Group President; Victor Luis, International Group President; and Jerry Stritzke, our President and Chief Operating Officer. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. We will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, our double-digit sales and earnings gains in the fourth quarter capped another strong fiscal performance for Coach, highlighted by excellent top and bottom line growth. We were also very pleased with profitability levels in both the quarter and year, as we managed the business to balance productivity gains and margin improvement. We continued to diversify our supply chain, expanding our manufacturing base globally. Importantly, we made significant progress on all of our growth initiatives.", "Moving on to some key highlights of our quarter and fiscal year. Our performance in FY '12 was highlighted by increases of 15% in revenue, 17% in operating income and 21% in earnings per share. It was a year of several milestones. First, we continued to leverage the international opportunity for Coach, growing organically through distribution and productivity while accelerating the acquisition of key Asian domestic businesses to our direct control. In China, Coach sales exceeded $300 million, up 64%, ending the year with nearly 100 locations. Second, our Men's business doubled in FY '12 to over $400 million, as we continue to open dedicated stand-alone and dual-gender locations globally, while also rolling out a broader expression of men's to nearly 1/3 of our North American retail stores by year end. Third, we successfully expanded our digital initiative, driving double-digit online sales growth, while also exploring new ways to communicate with our consumer and grow our database. And fourth, we increased our quarterly dividend by 1/3, demonstrating our financial strength, cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholder return.", "This annual performance was capped off by a strong fourth quarter. Some key metrics were: first, net sales totaled $1.16 billion, an increase of 12%. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.86, up 27% from the $0.68 in the prior year. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 13%. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 2% on a comparable basis from prior year, while North American total direct sales rose 7%. Fourth, China sales rose 60% as we continue to generate distribution growth and significant double-digit comps in China. And finally, sales in Japan rose 18% in dollars and 16% in constant currency, anniversarying the 2011 impact of the earthquake and tsunami.", "During the fourth quarter, we opened 4 net new North American retail stores while also opening 7 factory stores, including 5 dedicated Men's stores. At the end of FY '12, there were 354 Full Price and 169 factory stores in operation in North America. This was an increase of 9 Full Price stores, including 3 Men's retail stores, as well as 26 factory stores including 16 Men's stores from the end of FY '11.", "Total square footage grew 10% for the year. In addition, as forecasted in our third quarter conference call, we accelerated the rollout of a broader expression of Men to an additional 50 locations in Q4. Therefore, at year end in North America, there were 30 Men's stand-alone factory stores, 50 stand-alone Men's retail stores and over 85 Men's retail shop-in-shops -- I'm sorry, 5 stand-alone Men's retail stores and over 85 Men's retail shop-in-shops.", "Moving to China. During the quarter, we added 11 net new locations, 9 net on the Mainland and 2 in Hong Kong. At the end of the quarter, there were 96 Coach locations in China, including 79 locations on the Mainland and 36 cities. Additionally, there were 14 locations in Hong Kong and 3 in Macau. In aggregate, there was an increase of 30 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 58%.", "In Japan, 3 locations were added, 2 Men's retail locations and a factory store. At year end, there were 187 total locations in Japan with 23 stand-alone Full Price stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 35 factory stores and 7 duty free locations. In total, a net of 11 locations were added in Japan during FY '12 and 3 were expanding, yielding total square footage growth of about 6%.", "Finally, I wanted to mention our 2 other direct businesses in Asia acquired this fiscal year. First in Singapore, we now operate 7 locations; 5 were acquired last July, and we've opened 2 additional stores during the fiscal year. And second, Taiwan, where we transitioned 26 locations to our direct control in January and opened a new store this quarter. Shortly after the fiscal year ended, we acquired our domestic businesses in Malaysia which included 10 locations, generating annual sales of about $30 million at retail.", "Indirect sales, which represent about 11% of Coach's sales annually, were even with prior year on a comparable basis, adjusting for the transition of Singapore and Taiwan. Sales were driven by international wholesale shipments, while shipments into U.S. department stores declined as we continued to tightly manage inventory in this channel given retail sales trends.", "At POS, international sales rose significantly, driven by both distribution and same-location sales gains. While in U.S. department stores, sales decreased moderately on a year-over-year basis in the quarter.", "We estimate that the addressable women's North American handbag and accessory category grew at least 10% in FY '12. Coach continued to participate in the market growth, performing similarly in our own direct channels. As you know, we're also continuing to drive our Men's business in North America through new stand-alone and dual-gender or side-by-side stores and by dedicating more space for a broader Men's assortment in existing retail stores. In FY '12, Coach's sales of Men's bags and accessories doubled in North America, driving the overall Men's premium category, which grew about 25% to nearly $800 million.", "Over the fourth quarter, the economic backdrop in the U.S. clearly softened as consumer confidence and sentiment declined. However, our research shows that our customers' intention to purchase Coach over the next year continues to be strong, with more than 2/3 of consumers surveyed noting they probably or definitely would purchase a Coach product in the next 12 months.", "Our revenues in North America rose 5% with our directly operated businesses up 7%, driven by a 2% comp. As noted in our press release, an increasingly promotional environment in North America led to slower growth than expected in factory stores, which was entirely responsible for the change in the overall retail comp trend from last -- from the prior quarter. As a result, we responded by reinstating our prior practice of in-store couponing in a cross section of factory locations late in the period. It's important to note that we have significant pricing flexibility and a variety of marketing levers available to us in this channel, which allows us to balance productivity gains and margin improvement.", "The primary driver of our overall retail comp gain was an increase in average transaction size. The trends in our Full Price stores and overall e-commerce channels were consistent with the prior quarter. Our factory store comp was impacted by the elimination of in-store couponing throughout most of the quarter and also by slowing traffic to factory malls.", "Outside of North America, we saw very strong growth in our international markets. We achieved our strongest top line growth in China, which remains our largest geographic opportunity, given both the size of the market and the rate of growth. During the fourth quarter, our sales again rose sharply, up nearly 60% year-over-year, consistent with the prior quarter and fueled by distribution and significant double-digit same-store sales growth. As I noted upfront, this took our full year sales to over $300 million, up over 60%.", "For the quarter, as mentioned, we posted a 16% increase in local currency in Japan and an 18% gain in dollars. As we anniversary the impact of last year's earthquake, Japan is a mature market where we are focusing on the Men's opportunity and gaining share in the women's category.", "Moving on to product. During the fourth quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and newness, with the launch of the Hamptons Weekend collection introduced in April and update to Poppy and Madison throughout the quarter. Looking forward, we're excited about the distinctive new look you will see in our stores with the dual-gender Legacy lifestyle collection, which is being introduced over the next month globally. Inspired by our heritage, grounded in leather and featuring distinctive Coach elements, it is our largest product launch in many years. This iconic collection provides a new foundation for the brand, targeting multi-generational consumers who are both classic and stylish in their preferences. As we've discussed, the Legacy launch is driving new merchandising strategies including: first, presenting a bolder lifestyle story about our brand, incorporating categories such as outerwear, jewelry, small accessories, watches and scarves; second, presenting men's and women's together in a powerful store environment; and thirdly, driving major color stories in handbags and accessories to highlight key items.", "In support of the launch, we're rolling out new visual merchandising enhancements to about 100 of our leading stores in North America, as well as key international locations. This is providing a vibrant new backdrop for the collection, driving consumer interest. Legacy launched in North America just about 10 days ago. So with only a week's worth of sales results, we can tell you that we are pleased with the collection's performance. Thus far, the duffel and the canvas carryall are the top handbag styles, as planned. The vibrant colors are being very well received in both handbags and women's accessories, and prints and fashion styles are best sellers. Of course, we plan to support Legacy through a greater investment in integrated marketing communications, featuring bold new creative across print, digital and outdoor. These major marketing initiatives are timed to coincide with the publication of the September fashion books when they drop in mid-August.", "Naturally, I also want to update you on Men's, a key global initiative. As mentioned, Men's doubled again in FY '12 to over $400 million globally. And we're experiencing success across all concepts and store types including dedicated stores, shop-in-shops, dual-gender locations and expanded assortments in existing stores and across all geographies and channels. Outside of the U.S. where the male consumer tends to be more style-conscious, we've also opened a number of Men's dedicated stores as well as dual-gender stores. At the end of the year, an expanded assortment of Men's was available in about half of our directly-operated Coach locations globally as well as in many key distributor-operated locations. This performance underscores our confidence in Men's as a significant growth driver for Coach. We continue to believe it will continue -- it will contribute 25% or more of the company's growth over the next several years.", "As we enter FY '13, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged; first, leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses through both distribution expansion and product -- productivity gains; second, continuing to build our women's business in the North American market; third, tapping into the large and now rapidly growing Men's accessory category, which I've already touched on; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world.", "Starting with distribution, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 12% in FY '13, consistent with last year. Beginning in North America, we will open at least 30 new stores in FY '13, including about 10 new Full Price locations and at least 20 factory outlets, of which about 10 will be Men's stores. One of these new Full Price locations will be a concession shop-in-shop at Macy's Herald Square opening early this fall, the first of its kind for Coach in the U.S. We are very excited about this important department store location, which will feature a flagship face designed for us by renowned architect Rem Koolhaas, who will also be designing our Omotesando flagship in Tokyo next spring.", "In addition, we're planning to expand about 20 locations, 5 Full Price and 15 factory, to create side-by-side stores with a separate entrance and dedicated Men's shop. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of at least 10% this year, similar to last year, driven by our expanding Men's business.", "Turning to China. As you know, we're committed to open -- opening about 30 new locations a year. Finding the right people to manage and staff our stores to provide the right Coach in-store experience constrains us from more rapid distribution growth. In FY '13, we again expect to open about 30 new stores, bringing the total to around 125 locations at the end of the year. All of these openings are planned to be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 35% in FY '13. And we expect sales to total at least $400 million, driven by both distribution and comparable location sales.", "In terms of our other direct markets of Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia, our primary focus is driving productivity as we continue to invest in training, merchandising, store environments and systems, creating a brand-right experience. This will also be true of Korea, where we are acquiring the domestic retail business from our current distributor within the next few days. As a reminder, Coach's current annual sales in Korea are about $120 million, including global travel retail or about 5% of the $2.6 billion premium bag and accessory market. The domestic retail business generates about $60 million across 48 locations. In addition, there are 14 Korean travel retail locations, which will continue to be managed by third-party duty-free operators and are not part of this agreement.", "In Japan, the overall consumer market remains challenging and the category continues to be fairly stagnant, although fully back to pre-earthquake levels. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. During this fiscal year, we expect to open about 10 net new locations in Japan, most of them dedicated Men's stores. We are also particularly excited about our 5,000 square foot Omotesando flagship, scheduled to open next spring. In total, we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 5% in FY '12.", "Finally, beyond our directly owned international businesses in Asia, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other countries. Brazil, Kuwait and Vietnam were all new markets for Coach in FY '12. Finally, beyond our directly owned businesses in Asia, we're focusing on expanding through distributor partners in 3 regions: first, other emerging markets in Asia, such as Vietnam and Indonesia; second, Latin America including Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Chile and Peru; and third, the Middle East, where Kuwait has been our newest addition. These are in addition to the significant global travel retail opportunities that continues to exist for Coach.", "Touching on Europe, we\u2019ve begun to build the foundation for long-term growth with 25 locations across the U.K., France, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. First in the U.K., we have started our multichannel model. We had 5 locations opened at the end of FY '12 including 2 London flagships. We're continuing to gain traction in this market as the U.K. consumer is embracing Coach and the majority of our business is domestic. Second in France, where we are partnered with Printemps, we've opened 9 locations to date. Importantly, our key Boulevard Haussmann women's and men's shop-in-shops are performing well with the global tourists as we build our brand awareness with the Parisian shopper. Altogether, we expect to add about 5 locations in Europe during FY '13.", "I've just reviewed our strategies to drive our growth at a double-digit pace, giving -- given the continuing strength of the Coach brand and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us both in North America, which remains a growing market and worldwide, while our focus on Men's and digital provide additional opportunities for growth.", "At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials and investment plans. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year results.", "As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 12% with direct-to-consumer, which represents about 89% of our business, up 13%; and our indirect segment", "[Audio Gap]", "with prior year. Net income for the quarter increased 24% and totaled $251 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.86, up 27%. For the fiscal year, sales rose 15%, totaling $4.76 billion. We saw leverage to the bottom line with earnings per share at $3.53, up 21%, and net income of $1.04 billion, up 18%. For the quarter, operating income totaled $371 million on a non-GAAP basis, 19% above the $312 million reported in the year-ago period, while operating margin was 32.1% versus 30.3% for the prior year. During the quarter, gross profit rose 13% to $838 million from 748 -- $741 million recorded a year ago while gross margin was 72.6% versus 71.8%, primarily due to channel mix and sourcing cost improvement.", "SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 40.5% compared to 41.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. We were pleased that we were able to gain 100 basis points of leverage in the quarter, as our primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan provided leverage to the corporate P&L.", "During the quarter, we recorded certain items including a favorable tax settlement. As a result, we made charitable contributions which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the fourth quarter was $352 million with a 30.4% margin and an SG&A expense ratio of 42.1%. On a non-GAAP basis, for the full year, operating income totaled $1.55 billion, 17% above the $1.33 billion reported in the year-ago period, while operating margin was 32.6% versus 32.0%. For the year, gross profit rose 15% to -- $3.47 billion from $3.02 billion a year ago. As expected, gross margin was 72.8% versus 72.7%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 40.2% compared to the 40.7% reported in fiscal 2011.", "During both FY '12 and FY '11, we recorded certain items including favorable tax settlements. As a result and in both years, we made charitable contributions which precisely offset the benefit of these tax settlements to net income and earnings per share. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, operating income for the fiscal year 2012 was $1.51 billion, with a 31.7% margin and an SG&A expense ratio of 41.0%. This compared to fiscal year 2011 operating income of $1.3 billion on a GAAP basis with an operating margin of 31.4% and an SG&A expense ratio of 41.3%.", "Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $504 million, up 19.6% from FY '11 year end, consistent with our expectations. This inventory level allows us to support distribution growth and to maximize sales this summer and fall. Cash and short-term investments stood at $917 million, 31% above the $702 million a year ago, after $700 million of share repurchases in the interim 12 months.", "During the fourth fiscal quarter alone, we repurchased and retired about 2.5 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $67.79, spending a total of $169 million. At the end of the year, 262 million remained under our present repurchase authorization.", "Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $283 million compared to $221 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $210 million versus $164 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $73 million versus $57 million in the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year 2012, net cash from operating activities was $1.2 billion compared to $1 billion a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '12 was an inflow of $1 billion versus $886 million in fiscal year '11.", "CapEx spending totaled $184 million for the year compared to $148 million in the prior year. It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '13, we expect that our CapEx for next year will be up in the area of $250 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansion across all geographies, elevating our store environments within our existing stores and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion.", "Consistent with our practice over the past several years, we are not giving specific guidance for FY '13. We're mindful of balancing the impact of a muted consumer environment in North America and a softening global macroeconomic outlook with our optimism around the launch of Legacy, Men's growth and the strong international expansion opportunities for Coach. As noted, FY '13 will be an investment year for us as we amplify our actions to drive long-term growth. Our most significant investment is accelerating our international growth through the acquisition of the domestic retail operation of our key Asian distributors and the further development of infrastructure to support this global growth.", "In FY '13, we will also distort our investments in the digital space to expand and deepen our engagement with consumers. In addition, we will increase our marketing spend toward strengthening our brand positioning with distinctive new product and elevated store environment across all channels and geographies. Some of these initiatives will be in the form of CapEx, as I mentioned, while others will result in higher operating expenses, such as those associated with the transition of the Asia retail businesses including Taiwan, which we won't anniversary until January 2013; and the Malaysia and Korea, which will be acquired in Q1. So while our core businesses are expected to continue to deliver modest operating leverage, we expect that together, these investments, along the with increased brand support, will result in some deleverage in FY '13 while providing a platform for -- to accelerate our earnings growth in the years beyond.", "Therefore, when you're thinking about the year, keep in mind the following: first and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales growth. Our sales will be driven in part by low to mid single-digit comps in North America where our comparisons will be more difficult in the first half. In addition, currency is likely to be more of a headwind early in the year. Second, our gross margin is planned to improve modestly, as channel mix and our sourcing initiatives continue to contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margin to remain high and in the 73% range for the year. Third, on SG&A, international acquisitions alone will cause our expenses to rise at least 150 basis points. In addition, the in-store enhancements and marketing programs for Legacy will have a more pronounced impact in the first quarter. Fourth, therefore taken together, we would expect some compression in the operating margin to about 31%. Notably, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year as we further refine our international tax strategy.", "Therefore, when you're modeling out the quarters, I would like you to remember that the first quarter will be the most challenging in terms of both top line as we're up against very strong North American comp and a larger currency benefit, in bottom line due to the disproportionate impact of the investments and brand spend.", "In summary, FY '12 was an excellent year, demonstrating our ability to manage our business nimbly while advancing our key growth initiative. We're accelerating our distribution plan to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China, exploring new geographies and capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers, both men and women globally. Most importantly, our goals are unchanged. We remain committed to achieving double-digit top and bottom line growth over our planning horizon. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in our brand while continuing to return capital to shareholder. I'd now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kimberly Greenberger.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Morgan Stanley.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Apologies, we seem to be experiencing technical difficulties.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Morgan Stanley. I wanted to see if you could help us understand the differential between the factory comp and the Full Price comp here in the fourth quarter and how that changed relative to third quarter. And then just looking forward, as you dynamically manage your promotions, how -- if you can just talk to us about the different strategies you're expecting to employ as you work toward that low to mid single-digit comp in the upcoming year, that would be helpful.", "Lew Frankfort", "Mike Tucci will answer the question.", "Michael D. Tucci", "Sure.", "[Audio Gap]", "remain steady. We did see a change in run rate in factory. And what we saw was the success of our pricing strategy in Q3 against a less promotional environment, with more robust traffic trends were successful. We were able to maintain higher rates of productivity and comps, and that changed late in the fourth quarter as we anniversaried a more promotional environment in factory. And we saw a change in factory tempo in terms of traffic levels in factory stores. We responded to it. We took action. We pushed a stronger value message into our stores. We revamped our signage and presentation programs in the stores to show a more pronounced level of newness and value, and we continue to do that as we enter into July. And the learning for us is that as we see a more promotional environment, as we are up against a heavier promotional cadence in factory stores, we have to be nimble. We have to use a variety of levers in terms of messaging and pricing, and we have to run the business for a balance of sales productivity and margin improvement. And that's the approach that we're taking going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson.", "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just a follow-up on Kimberly's factory question. Did you find out once you change the promotional cadence, you saw the comp pick back up, and is that what the guidance is based on going forward? And just to follow up on Legacy, happy to hear that things are going well or according to plan. And just any more color you should give us on the outlook for the Full Price store comp?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Okay, sure. The reality is that we did see an improvement in our factory business when we went back to a more aggressive stance in the stores. And it's a channel where we have to constantly find the right balance between pricing, value, newness and achieving the right levels of margin. I think long term, our objective is to continue to deliver growth in this channel, and that's our approach going forward. We do see in the front half of our FY '13 a fairly promotional compare, as well as an environment that we think will become increasingly promotional from a macro standpoint. So we have to be prepared, and we're working the business to drive results, hence our guidance for FY '13. I'm going to pass it to Lew to speak to Legacy on a global level, and then I can add some color here in North America.", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. We're just getting Legacy out. I mentioned it's in our North American stores for about a week, and we just launched it in China and in most Asian markets. In Japan, it won't be launched for another -- a few weeks even though we're in some presell activities. Overall, the collection is doing well and it's meeting our expectations. It's early days for us to talk to what it will mean overall globally for the business, and we are taking a more cautious approach, considering the macro environment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer.", "Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Robert W. Baird. I guess to follow up on Legacy, could you talk about how big you expect it to ultimately be, how long do you expect the lifespan of the launch to be?", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. As we've indicated on, the Legacy collection is inspired by very -- great success of product from our archives. And what we've done is create a modern interpretation that is relevant and stylish today and we are confident will be relevant and stylish tomorrow. Our intention is for this to be a multiyear dual-gender platform that will allow us to more strongly differentiate ourselves against competitors since the branding materials detail on styling is unique and authentic to Coach. We have a real confidence that Legacy will be embraced by both women and men worldwide.", "Michael D. Tucci", "I think to add to that, in terms of how we're planning the cadence of the launch, the marketing launch in the marketplace, both from a digital as well as traditional media standpoint, really begins to hit mid-August. We have just launched here in North America our first product flow across our department store channels and our retail stores. We are also refreshing with new styles and colors monthly. We have a significant investment in Legacy as part of our holiday gifting strategy in our Q2 strategy, which is our most important quarter. And then we will begin some nuance Legacy in the second half of the year, our fiscal year, with additional elements such as the weekend concept and additional expressions from a category standpoint to round out multi-category platform within Legacy. So it's ongoing, it's throughout the year and it's seasonally enhanced.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff.", "Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "It's Betty, [ph] CLSA. How is the performance in Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities in China evolving as new store opens and as sort of the economy sort of changes a bit? Could you talk about last year and then how you think it's going to play out this year?", "Lew Frankfort", "Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. As we talked about last quarter, we continue to have a performance in Tier 2 and 3 cities, which continues to exceed our expectations actually. We're now, as Lew mentioned in his remarks, in 36 cities, of which 15 locations now in Tier 3 cities. So really, a small percentage of the 79 total locations across China. So still tremendous opportunity ahead for us with approximately 120 cities as we know with a population of 1 million or more. So we continue to be very excited about the distribution opportunity.", "Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And how are the factory stores starting to work out?", "Victor Luis", "Today, we still have a small number of factory locations. We are in 11 locations, including 2 in Hong Kong and Macau. So 9 on the Mainland. A tremendous amount of interest in the channel from developers, both domestic and international. And we are seeing the Coach proposition resonate extremely well, and we're very excited about the long-term opportunity for that channel in that market, especially as more and more traditional luxury brands as well become interested in the channel and helped to raise its awareness with the Chinese consumer.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "It's ISI Group. I wanted to ask you guys about, it sounds like the category still is very strong. I think you cited 10% category growth for the full year, and it's obviously is one of the largest players and the key players in the category. How are you guys thinking about this, the handbags, the accessories market in the cycle that we appear to be in? It's been so strong in the last few years, especially relative to fashion and apparel, which has been a much weaker segment. Do you think that the consumer spending patterns have changed? Are you confident that the category growth will remain strong? Obviously, a key question given that you're the category leader.", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, first, Omar, the category has been growing disproportionately for nearly 15 years now. There's been a real shift in women's spending patterns as she has consistently distorted her spending away from apparel towards accessories as a way to update her wardrobe. We expect that to continue. At the same time, we believe that there's a very substantial opportunity globally and as well as here in the U.S. in the men's accessories area where the category is experiencing outsized growth. We mentioned that the category grew by about 25% this year here in the United States, and a majority of that growth came from Coach. So we do feel that while the category, like all discretionary consumer spending, is subject to change based upon consumer sentiment, we believe that the changes will be less pronounced than in other categories.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Liz Dunn.", "Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research", "Macquarie. I guess my question relates to China profitability, men's profitability, some of the investment initiatives. Can you just update us on where those finished fiscal 2012 and what we should look for, for 2013 to just as sort of discrete items or in combination, what the dilution is? And when some of these investment initiatives should sort of turn into positive territory from a contribution standpoint to the bottom line?", "Jane Nielsen", "Sure, Liz. First, when we think about China profitability, what we said and what we've seen is that China's four-wall profitability is in the 40% range. So the store contribution is in the 40% range. It is on a path as it achieves growth, and we scaled some of the investments that we're making in infrastructure to be one of our most profitable markets. We don't talk about specific market profitability, but we're very encouraged with the progress we've made on our four-wall profitability. Men's initiative overall is even with the rest of our business. So as we grow Men's, it's just as attractive and as profitable as our basic women's business. So we're very excited about that growth.", "Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just as we think about Asia x profitability in total and some of the investment spending this year, like is this a multiyear thing or should we see some accretion from those businesses through 2014 and beyond?", "Jane Nielsen", "So what you'll see, Liz, is in the year that -- and we called it out as a one-time impact, is the impact of our overall acquisitions of the distributors. So the half year impact of Taiwan and the impact of Korea and Malaysia will be a drag to overall operating profit and SG&A in the year. As we move through, we work through the inventory, which is written up, and we work through some of the SG&A and re-assort and get these businesses on growth, they are long-term value creating and growth enhancing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Tunick.", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "JPMorgan. Two quick ones. I guess, Jane, maybe some comments on the gross margin guidance this year and maybe beyond? Just trying to get an update on the sourcing initiatives and maybe how the couponing back in factory maybe changes your view of what you think the gross margin opportunity is? And then maybe someone on the product side can talk beyond Legacy. What does the product introduction cadence look like in the coming 12 months versus the previous, as you obviously invested in Legacy and talked about the newness opportunities to drive continued growth in the Full Price business?", "Jane Nielsen", "Sure. Brian, let's start with gross margins. So first of all, let's take FY '12. We were very pleased in the fourth quarter. We had 80 basis points of expansion, largely driven by channel mix and our sourcing initiative. As we've guided to, we expect to see continued gross margin expansion next year in the 73% range. That is going to be driven by, again, our continued sourcing initiative as we continue to diversify our manufacturing base. It's going to be driven by favorable channel mix. And a prudent approach, as Mike called out, to promotion in the factories. Those 3 factors together are what are giving us confidence to give you the -- to give the guidance of an improved gross margin next year. Overall in newness, we see Legacy as a powerful collection. And its gross margin will be about consistent with our existing business. So we expect no material effect up or down with Legacy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jessica Sean [ph].", "Unknown Analyst", "I was wondering, as we think about the comp and the full-line stores in the fourth quarter, I was wondering if you could talk about the impact of the rollout of the men's assortment and what that had on productivity and ASP for those stores? And also what is your expectation for the impact as we look to next year?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Sure. A couple of things. One, in the stores that entered the quarter with men's fully positioned, and that was about half of where we landed at the end of the quarter, Men's was a significant driver of comp and productivity. The overall comp impact for the Men's shops that we added in Q4 was less significant because they came in very late at the quarter. You'll see a bigger impact for Men's as the comp driver in FY '13 as we go into Q1 virtually fully established. There are a handful of very significant shop installations happening in the first half of the year based on lease timing. But the majority of our Men's work in terms of impact in shops and stores happened right at the end of the quarter and will have a bigger impact on FY '13.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez.", "Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Nomura. As you look at factory, how much of it was traffic versus a conversion issue? And Lew, as you just take a step back and look at that factory business, how much do you look at the issues there being macro versus maybe having a less inspiring product assortment versus maybe just simply coming up against a ceiling of how many dollars you can move through those boxes?", "Lew Frankfort", "It's a great question, and it's something we think end about all of the time and work. First, there was a overall decline in the rate of traffic later in the quarter. And this is -- transcends Coach but has impacted us, particularly in June. And what we saw among other retailers starting really in May was an intensification of their promotional activities including the perennial in-store coupon to drive additional shopping. So we do see what occurred in our fleet late in the quarter heavily driven by the macro environment. And as Mike said, we were up against very strong promotional activities last year. In terms of product, certainly product is a factor. We actually introduced a strong platform in the second half of June. We sent deletes from our Full Price, Kristin, and that coupled with the reinstatement of coupons, reinvigorated factory performance. We believe that when we look at factory bricks-and-mortar, both on digital as the nominee channel, that we have huge opportunities to drive additional factory sales. That is basically buying discontinued or made-for-factory product at a discount. And the appetite, of course, among consumers to buy product at a discount is insatiable and growing.", "Michael D. Tucci", "Lew, I think the only piece that I can add, on the operational side of things, we do not -- we work very, very hard on throughput, productivity, managing transactions in stores. In fact, we launched our first phase of mobile POS in factory stores on a pilot basis. We do not see a cap on productivity in our stores from a throughput standpoint. We've been through this for a number of years. We've been through multiple peaks around holidays, and we still see tremendous headroom in terms of productivity and operational efficiency in our stores.", "Lew Frankfort", "And the only -- the last thing I'll add is that we are going through a project to elevate the in-store experience. And we are in the midst of developing prototypes which we plan to roll out during this year, that will show a much more integrated, broader Coach experience, which will focus off, in addition to bags and accessories, on other lifestyle categories such as sunwear, wearable jewelry, outerwear and -- to name several.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jennifer Davis.", "Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Lazard Capital Markets. First, let me say that the Legacy assortment looks amazing, so I can see why you guys are so excited about it. And then just a quick clarification, just want to make sure I heard correctly. Comps at Full Price stores in the fourth quarter increased around 6.7%, right?", "Lew Frankfort", "What we said was that they remain consistent with their level last year. We do not -- last quarter. We do not disaggregate comps. And our overall comps were 6.7% in the third quarter. And what we went on to say was that the entire decline was due to a decline in performance within our factory channel during the fourth quarter.", "Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my question is for Mike Tucci. Just wondering what your thoughts are on the North American wholesale business, now that you're in charge of that business as well. Do you think that there are any changes to the strategy maybe that you could make there?", "Michael D. Tucci", "I do. Quick learnings there for me. One, we have a strong team here with great relationships with our key partners in the department stores. The department store leaders are very committed to Coach. We're working extremely hard to create the same excitement around Legacy in department stores that we have in our retail stores. And so the investment that we're making around presentation, product assortment, training and development and marketing really carries over into the wholesale channel. That launch was timed exactly to the day with -- when we launched in our retail stores. I think the first major flagship in a department store that's going to be run by the Coach direct team in Herald Square as part of the accessories hall that Macy's is doing in New York is a tremendous opportunity for us and one that we may find some opportunities for a longer term in terms of the operating model. So we're working very hard on that channel to protect our position there as a market share leader and to deliver value to that consumer.", "Operator", "Our next question comes -- our final question comes from Christian Buss.", "Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the marketing investments and the cadence you expect there over the course of fiscal '13, and how that's going to impact the P&L?", "Jane Nielsen", "Yes. So the marketing investments that we're talking about overall will be more front-end loaded. As we talked about we are distorting our marketing early in the year to support Legacy so you will see it, especially in the first quarter. And as we move through the year, we will be investing through the year. In aggregate, our incremental marketing investment we're expecting to be about $0.04 to EPS, a little more than $0.04 to EPS.", "Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. Wondering if you could also talk about the concession shop with Macy's and what the thinking is there and whether that might become a model on a go-forward basis for North America?", "Lew Frankfort", "Let me begin by saying that outside the U.S., all of our shop-in-shops are leased shops. These are -- they are all concession shops where we pay based on performance and, in some cases, a guaranteed minimum threshold. So this is really the prevailing model outside the United States, and we've enjoyed great success with that model. In the U.S., the situation is quite different, as department stores have maintained their direct operation of virtually all of their shops. We don't expect that to change materially. We see Macy's as an exceptional situation. We're partnering with Macy's to really create a global flagship for Coach that will attract tourists, both from the United States and abroad, to Macy's to see our spectacular shop.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you. That\u2019s going to conclude our conference call today. We went a little longer than usual to make up for some of early technical difficulties. But now, I'd like to turn it back over to Lew for a few closing words. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "Let me begin by saying that we know there's a lot of interest in what we announced today. Obviously, some of the metrics were lower than what Wall Street expected. The reality is that we manage our business for the long term, and we have real clarity about what we're doing and where we're traveling and are very confident in our long-term growth prospects and our ability to drive our business at a double-digit pace. We have an exceptionally strong franchise. We have a seasoned and nimble management team and operating team, and we're driven to win. And I believe that you will find that in the seasons and years to come, we will prevail as we have over the years and decades. Thank you, everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO; and Jane Nielsen, Coach's CFO. Mike Tucci, North American Group President is also joining us for a holiday preview.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that the historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our first fiscal quarter 2013 results and will also discuss our program -- progress on global initiatives. Mike Tucci will review our key programs for the holiday season. Jane Nielsen will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session where we will be joined by Victor Luis, International Group President; and Jerry Stritzke, our President and Chief Operating Officer. The Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. We will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning. Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As we noted in our press release, we were pleased with our results this quarter highlighted by double-digit top line growth with strong comparable store sales most notably in North America and China. We continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives, enhancing our leadership position in the North American women's bag and accessory category through fashion innovation, aggressively growing our international business, becoming a market leader in the Men's accessories category and harnessing the power of the digital world.", "In addition, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of our domestic distributors in Korea and Malaysia, and reflective of our strong balance sheet and positive outlook, our board has just authorized a new $1.5 billion stock repurchase authorization.", "While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights were: First, net sales totaled $1.16 billion versus $1.05 billion a year ago, an increase of 11%; Second, earnings per share totaled $0.77, up 6% from prior year; Third, North American sales increased 8% to $784 million from $729 million last year, with direct sales up 11% on a 5.5% comparable store sales increase; And fourth, international sales increased 15% to $362 million from $314 million last year, driven in part by a nearly 40% gain in sales in China with a continuation of double-digit comps.", "Looking first at global distribution. During the quarter, we opened 5 North American factory stores, including 3 Men's stores. At the end of the period, there were 354 full price and 174 factory stores in operation in North America.", "Moving on to China. During the quarter, we opened 8 net new locations, 1 in Hong Kong and the remainder on the Mainland, bringing the total number to 104 locations, including 86 on the Mainland in 38 cities. In the wake of our recent Asia distributor acquisition and including Singapore and Taiwan, which we took over last year, we now directly operate 92 locations in Asia, not including Japan and China. They include: 7 in Singapore, 10 in Malaysia, 27 in Taiwan and 48 in Korea. And in Japan, one Men's factory store was opened. At quarter end, there were 188 total locations in Japan with 23 stand-alone full price stores, including 8 flagships, 122 shop-in-shops, 36 factory stores and 7 distributor operated wholesale location.", "Moving on to sales and productivity and starting in North America, which today represents about 2/3 of Coach's sales. Our total revenues in North America rose 8% for the quarter, with our directly operated businesses up 11%. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 5.5%, with our factory store comps benefiting from a return to more promotional in-store practices and our full price store comp similar to prior quarter trends. Of course, our Internet business, driven by significant traffic gains, continued to drive overall comp. In department stores, sales trends at POS was essentially even with prior year, while shipments into department stores declined as inventories were planned lower.", "Overall, we estimate that addressable women's North American handbag and accessory category rose about 10% last quarter. At the same time, in our own North American stores and on the Internet, Coach's sales rose 11%. It's worth noting that our Men's business was also a significant driver of our overall sales growth in Q1.", "Moving on to international sales, which represent about 1/3 of Coach total sales today. They rose 15% in the first quarter. China sales rose nearly 40% from prior year, fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales. Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach as evidenced by these results as well as the increasing contribution of the Chinese tourists to our global sales in the extremely high purchase -- repurchase intent among existing consumers.", "Our other Asia direct businesses outside of China and Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia and Korea, also posted strong aggregate growth in the quarter. In part, these countries benefited from the retail step-up from prior year except for Singapore, which was purchased at the beginning of last fiscal year. In addition, their combined POS sales also rose at a double-digit rate. In Japan, we posted a 1% increase in constant currency, while sales in dollars were even with prior year. Coach holds a #2 place within the Japanese imported accessories market with a 17% yen share. Our position reflects the strength and relevance of the Coach brand with the Japanese consumer who has become increasingly value oriented.", "Finally, I would like to touch on our international wholesale business where we experienced strong shipment growth, as retail sales gains were driven by distribution expansion. While Jane will get into more detail in our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I did want to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for the first quarter as well as our holiday sales initiative. Mike?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Thanks, Lew. During the first quarter, we featured a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness, driven by our Legacy launch. We were very pleased by the excellent response to the collection, as Legacy proved to resonate with consumers across geographies and demographic. Inspired by our archives and featuring the duffle and Candace carryall style, Legacy underscores our heritage as an authentic leather goods brand, distinctively Coach and differentiated in the marketplace.", "While Madison and Poppy remained important collections during the quarter, we continue to build our Legacy momentum over the next several months. Additional seasonal offerings such as cold weather and outerwear are being introduced this quarter, along with new brights, novelty elements such as Ocelot haircalf and colorblock. Of course, we're supporting the collection with innovative marketing programs like our just launched Grand Central takeover here in New York, with 84 Coach images focused on the northeast corridor of the station over a 4-week period. We're also taking over buses and telephone kiosks in both New York and Chicago during fall and holiday.", "Additionally, our recently updated Madison collection featured new silhouettes, including the Juliette satchel and the new carryall, which we'll deliver in early December. New Poppy will arrive just in time for holiday and will feature our much-loved iconic Willis bag in beautiful colors, colorblock and a range of great sizes and shapes.", "And of course, we'll also have a comprehensive assortment of great gifts from tech accessories to wristlets and a wide range of items under $100 as well. In addition, our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan beginning in mid-November, featuring a powerful gifting message. The emphasis of our marketing will be product and item-driven across our core categories and other gifting ideas. Our campaign will span coach.com, social and media advertising and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic.", "And our PR team working in conjunction with several of today's leading style authorities has developed a series of digitally-based initiatives centered around their favorite picks for holiday. Additionally, each of these style icons will curate a designated shop of their holiday selection on coach.com.", "I'd like to provide an update on our Men's growth strategy, which is a significant opportunity for Coach, both here in North America where we have a long history as a men\u2019s leather goods resource and globally, where the category is more developed. During the last quarter, we added a broader assortment of Men's to an additional 14 full price stores in North America, taking us to over 100 stores with a significant Men's presence by the end of September. We're seeing excellent response to our product both in these retail stores and in our dedicated factory stores. Coach is rapidly becoming a leading brand authority in Men's bags and accessories. As we created the world of Coach for women across categories, we are now doing the same for men, designing collections with a distinct point of view, but sharing the modern classic aesthetic that is the hallmark of Coach.", "Moving to our stores. As part of our brand-building initiative, there's an opportunity both in our full price and factory stores to continue to elevate our store environment and to present a broader expression of Coach to our consumers. During the first quarter, to support Legacy, we rolled out new visual merchandising elements to about 100 retail stores and several key U.S. department store doors as well. These stores outperformed during the quarter, and we will continue to push these enhancements to more stores over the fiscal year.", "We've also experienced excellent customer response to our new 625 North Michigan Avenue flagship store in Chicago, which represents a new evolution of our retail concept and our new dual-gender, side-by-side concept store in Pentagon City Centre. And just last week, we opened our first North America department store concession shop at Macy's Herald Square here in New York City. Designed by renowned architect Rem Koolhaas, this flagship space reflects our newest and most modern design elements, including video and digital content that provides an elevated environment to showcase our products and enhance the Coach experience within a department store.", "On the factory side, our store elevation and enhancement strategy was piloted in our Riverhead and Woodbury Common stores with excellent results. We will roll this program out to about 25 of our highest volume stores by mid-November prior to our peak holiday selling season.", "In summary, we will continue to drive our women's business through fashion innovation, leverage the opportunity in Men's and evolve our store and digital concepts to provide a brand-right shopping experience for our consumer wherever she chooses to shop.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategy and further opportunities for growth. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Mike. Mike just discussed a number of our brand building and productivity initiatives, which will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and in international markets. Looking towards the balance of FY '13, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. First, we're leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses through both distribution expansion and productivity gains. Second, we're continuing to enhance our leadership position in the North American women's bag and accessory market, as we strengthen our position in lifestyle categories such as footwear. Third, we're tapping into the large and rapidly growing Men's accessory category, which Mike has already discussed. And fourth, we're harnessing the growing power of the digital world.", "Starting with distribution. First, as our plans haven't changed materially from what we outlined on the July earnings call, I will be brief. To start, we expected our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% or 11% during this year. In North America, we now expect to add about 25 net new stores, including 20 factory stores, of which 10 will be Men's stand-alone location.", "Turning to international and starting with China, we again expect to open about 30 new stores this year, bringing the total to around 125 locations by year's end. All of these openings are planned to be dual-gender stores due to the size of the Men's opportunity. In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 35%. And as we said earlier, we expect sales to total at least $400 million, driven by both distribution and same location sales growth.", "We're also very excited to announce a new distribution channel for China, e-commerce, which we expect to go live next month, providing Chinese consumers a new way to engage with the Coach brand.", "In terms of our other Asian direct markets, our primary focus this year is on driving productivity rather than new distribution, as we continue to invest in people through training, as well as merchandising, store environment and systems, creating a brand-right experience. In Japan, where the overall consumer market remains challenging, we expect to open about 10 net new locations, most of them dedicated Men's doors. In total, we expect that net square footage growth will increase by about 10% this year compared to about 5% in FY '12.", "Finally, as you know, beyond our directly owned international businesses in Asia, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other countries. We're focusing on expanding through partners in 4 regions: first, in Europe, where we have begun to build the foundation for long-term growth; second, Latin America, including Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Chile and Peru; third other Asia-Pacific markets such as Australia, Thailand and Indonesia; and fourth, the Middle East. These are in addition to the significant global travel retail opportunities that continue to exist for Coach, as the brand's recognition continues to grow globally.", "We've just reviewed our strategies to drive our growth at a double-digit pace given the continuing strength of the Coach brand and our increasing global expansion. We have significant runway ahead of us, both in international -- both in North America, which remains a growing market and worldwide, while our focus on Men's and digital provides additional opportunities for growth.", "At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials and investment plans. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter result. As a reminder, and as noted in our 8-K filing earlier this month, we've changed our segment reporting for FY '13 to a geographic focus, recognizing the expansion and growth of sales through our international market. This quarter, revenues increased 11%, with North America up 8% and international sales up 15%. Net income for the quarter totaled $221 million, up 3%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.77, up 6%. This compared to net income of $215 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.73 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $332 million, 3% above the $322 million reported last year, while operating margin was 28.6% versus 30.7%. This growth and our continued high level of profitability was achieved while making unusual investments in our business, primarily related to our distributor acquisitions, which we had previewed in our last conference call.", "During this quarter, gross profit totaled $845 million versus $765 million a year ago, an increase of 11%. The gross margin rate was 72.8%, even with prior year, with our sourcing cost improvement offsetting the higher cost of inventory repurchased in our acquisitions. As expected, our expense ratio in Q1 totaled 44.2% compared to the 42.8% (sic) [42.1%] reported in the year-ago quarter.", "Excluding the impact of distributor acquisition costs, we were able to gain leverage to EPS. As you know, our most significant investment is accelerate in our international growth through the acquisition of domestic retail -- of the domestic retail operations of our key Asian distributors and the further development of infrastructure to support this global growth. We are also distorting our investment in the digital phase to expand and deepen our engagement with consumers.", "Inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $598 million, 15% above $520 million reported at the end of last year's Q1, consistent with our expectations given the repurchase of inventory from our newly acquired market. It will allow us to support distribution growth and to maximize this sale and holiday.", "Cash and short-term investments [indiscernible] $761 million as compared with $848 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $56.59, spending a total of $175 million. With only $87 million remaining of the previous authorization, the board authorized another $1.5 billion in share repurchases.", "Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $202 million compared to $225 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $146 million versus $194 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending were $56 million versus $31 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Consistent with our previous expectations and reflective of our global growth initiatives, we expect that CapEx this year will be in the area of $250 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansions across all geographies, elevating our store environments within our existing stores and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion.", "Looking at the balance sheet. At the balance of 2013, the goals we articulated back in July have not changed. We remain mindful of balancing the impact of a weak global macroeconomic outlook with our optimism around our business. So when you're thinking about the year, our plans are in line with those outlined in our July call.", "First and most generally, we continue to expect to achieve double-digit sales growth. Our FY '13 sales will be driven in part by low- to mid-single-digit comps in North America for the year. As you know, our comparisons will be most challenging in the second quarter given our extremely strong multi-year comp performance. However, we do expect comps to strengthen in the second half. In addition, currency is likely to be more of a top line growth headwind in the first half of the year. Second, our gross margin is planned to improve modestly, as channel mix and our sourcing initiatives continue to contribute to profitability. On balance, we expect gross margin to remain high and in the 73% range for the year. Third, on SG&A, international acquisitions alone will cause our expenses to rise at least 150 basis points for the year. Fourth, therefore taken together, we would expect some compression in the operating margin to about 31%. Notably, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage to EPS. And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies.", "In summary, we were pleased with our first quarter result, highlighted by double-digit top line growth and driven by strong comparable sales -- same -- comparable store sales in North America and China. Looking forward, we're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China, exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers, both men and women globally.", "Importantly, we remain committed to achieving double-digit growth over our planning horizon. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in our brand, while continuing to return capital to shareholders.", "Now I'd like to open it up to Q&A. Operator, you may go ahead.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about China. We've seen a number of your peers indicate that sales there have been a little bit difficult. Your numbers were surprisingly good. Can you just dig into the strength in China? And in particular, how is the Legacy line doing there? And I just had one clarifying question for Jane if I could. Jane, did you indicate that without the acquisitions, your operating margin in the quarter would have been up? And does that mean that you would expect after this year that you could actually see operating margins trend higher over time?", "Jane Nielsen", "Sure. For clarification, what we said is without the impact of the acquisitions, we would have had some leverage from sales to EPS growth. And our gross margin, as I called out, was impacted by acquisitions by about 30 basis points.", "Lew Frankfort", "Alright, [indiscernible] Victor Luis.", "Victor Luis", "Given the overall context of the markets and of course, our overall higher comp base, we are extremely pleased with the growth that we have shown in the quarter. And I think it's a strong reflection of the relevance of our products. And to the second part of your question, the performance of Legacy. As Mike touched on in his comments, Legacy is truly resonating globally, not just here in North America. And we're especially pleased with its performance in China where it is becoming a very strong second pillar for us alongside Madison. Madison has been, since our launch in China with the takeback of the business, a true iconic collection for us and continues to be a very strong recruiting tool as such. And now Legacy is a second pillar and especially relevant with current Coach fans that are looking for a more subtle, more fashionable collection from a multi-category perspective. We're especially pleased in China with the performance of Men's and as well, even outerwear where in certain locations we're seeing double-digit penetrations of Legacy outerwear. So overall, a strong story.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.", "Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I guess for Mike, a lot of questions surrounding the quarter was on the couponing side, so maybe just hoping you could just talk about the Facebook coupon at the full price stores. And obviously, you still seem to have a lot of room to get back towards your peak conversion in traffic. Just trying to understand the thought process there. And similarly in the factory side, how -- now you look back. I guess you've had 2 or 3 quarters on the fair-and-square pricing, the couponing now back in the store. Just give us some idea of your thought process now, what you've learned. And then maybe if Lew just wants to talk about the market share opportunities maybe in Asia x Japan. Obviously, you\u2019re the market share leader here in the U.S., over 30% market share. Just wondering what are realistic targets you think Coach could have in Asia x Japan over the next 5, 7 years.", "Lew Frankfort", "Okay. But I think we got about 5 questions in there. Mike, why don't you take the first several.", "Michael D. Tucci", "I'll give it a crack, and I will -- let me address on the full price side, there's been some noise on the investor's side around promotional activity. We actually saw a very healthy quarter in our full price business. We were extremely pleased with Legacy and the performance of our business across men's and women's. And promotional activity is actually down. So what I think occurred out there, which was a pickup on your side a bit, was we did experiment with some customer acquisition, third-party opportunities within the digital space. And that created some noise in the marketplace. We'll continue to probe on that and experiment, but it's really not a large segment of our business. On the factory side, as we stated in Q4, we were going to take a more promotional stance in our stores around in-store marketing. And that proved to be very successful. And I might add there that we're really pleased on the factory side, as we return to marketing tactics in-store. We're able to maintain very high margin rates consistent with prior year and get the productivity levels back.", "Lew Frankfort", "With regards to your market share opportunities, I had mentioned before we had 17% market share in Japan where we are the #2 share. It was -- it would show [indiscernible] for me to suggest that in China we could have that market share. But we would not be content with anything less over time. So we do believe as the market develops, Coach is particularly well positioned for the emerging middle class in China. Victor, touched on our business and our consumers. They still have over a 90% repurchase intent. We feel very optimistic that in the emerging markets we can develop very strong leadership positions. In more developed markets, we think it's more realistic to look at 10% as an aspirational goal, where in certain markets today, we have 5% and 7%. Victor, you want to expand on that?", "Victor Luis", "I think you said it all, Lew.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc.", "Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Could you talk a little bit about Legacy and the customer base that you're seeing? Do you view it as a new customer? Is it a lapsed customer? Or is it your core Coach customer that's very enthused about Legacy?", "Lew Frankfort", "It's really all of the above, and it varies a lot by market. What we're finding is that some of the Legacy styles that are extremely reminiscent of the styles that were in existence 20 or 30 years ago are particularly appealing to an existing consumer, the larger bags. At the same time, the smaller bags are doing -- which are trend right, are doing very well with younger consumers. Overall, we're finding that we are appealing to new consumers, existing consumers and lapsed consumers. It all depends on the market and the circumstance.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.", "Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Can you talk about the flash sales in the factory stores? What are you learning from these? And do you intend to do these in Asia?", "Michael D. Tucci", "We are -- we're really, I would say, in exploration mode on the flash side. It is a very targeted program to a discrete audience of factory-only consumers, with targeted pricing, margin structure that we love, response rate and performance that we control. And we'll continue to use this. This is just an extension of us moving into the digital world and leveraging it across channels and across customer types in a targeted way.", "Lew Frankfort", "Victor, you want to touch on it internationally?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. The only place where we tested it and experimented, as Mike mentioned, has been in Japan. Important to note though that our e-mail database there is quite small, so it is a very tiny experimentation at the moment. And as we learn more in the U.S. and continue to grow our database, we will revisit it in the years ahead.", "Lew Frankfort", "It's actually a very substantial opportunity, as consumers are looking for convenience and they're also looking for limited edition factory product. And again, just to reiterate, we -- this is a focus on consumers who only purchase in factory stores. We do not offer this opportunity to full price consumers. So what we're doing is we're leveraging the opportunity among existing brand-loyal Coach factory store consumers to give them the opportunity for a time-limited circumstance to buy factory product at a great price.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Nomura.", "Tracy Kogan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. One question and then one clarification, the first question is on Legacy and how we should think about how this line will transition into the factory channel and what the timing on that would be. And how does that compare to how you transition Poppy from full price to factory? And then on the clarification, I think you said your gross margins in factory were flat, but I wasn't sure if you meant operating margin. But if you could just clarify that and if you could give us the direction of gross margin in your other channels as well?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Sure. I'll take most of that. Our Legacy development today is focused solely on full price across Men's and women's. We are in the very, very early days of development. We have tremendous innovation and newness coming into the marketplace there across silhouette, fabrication. There is not any need for us to think about Legacy as a factory platform. In fact, we're looking at newness and elevation within factory stores outside of Legacy as we head into the fourth quarter -- third and fourth quarter of '13 and into '14 where we have exciting platforms there, leather and fabric based. So Legacy is really a full price proposition going forward. And yes, when I was speaking to margin, what I was talking about margin rate in factory stores during the quarter, holding its own against the change in the promotional strategy, which we're very pleased with.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Wanted to ask you about marketing. I think Mike had mentioned it in the prepared remarks, mid-November marketing plan. How are you guys philosophically, strategically thinking about marketing plans? You've got 2 kind of arguably very different, very important initiatives, both the Legacy and the Men's, which are a little bit new for the brand. How important is the marketing to get the word out to consumers to bring them into the stores? And what are some of the strategies around that? And then I also wanted to ask, within the Legacy business, are you seeing any differentiation in terms of the success at higher price points or lower price points or different type of products within the Legacy business in the early days?", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, first to your general question on marketing, we are approaching both -- we're approaching Legacy and our new collections in the dual-gender manner. If you look at our print ads and you look at all of our digital advertising, you'll see both dual-gender products as well as women's products and Men's products featured in a lifestyle manner with people who personify the Coach brand. And so we have a layered approach on the marketing. More specifically, when we think of marketing, it's not only advertising, but it's store windows. It's the store environment. And when you visit our stores today, you'll see a Men's presence in most of our store windows. You will also see in our flagship locations a very strong head-to-toe lifestyle presentation. And we feel quite good about our ability to convey a broader world of Coach that's more modern, more emotional and more relevant.", "Michael D. Tucci", "Lew, just to build on that in terms of marketing, where I would point to is our efforts to enhance our store environments, not only through window presentation but in-store environments. We did make a strong investment going into the year and through the quarter in the top 100 stores. In full price, we got credit there. Our flagship stores outperformed in the quarter, driven by, I think, a more comprehensive Legacy presentation, including Men's that really cut through. We'll continue to build on that. And what we're seeing out there, including in key department store locations, tremendous appetite or range of price points and product offer and handbags within Legacy and all our collections. And I think we have to continue to take advantage of that from a marketing and positioning standpoint in the marketplace.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jessica Schoen with Barclays.", "Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could give us some more detail about how much of an impact the Asian acquisitions had on gross margins, as well as how much it benefited from the sourcing initiatives and the channel mix?", "Jane Nielsen", "So, Jessica, what you saw is that we had a 72.8% gross margin, about even with prior year. And what we're calling out is that our sourcing initiatives and improvements there were able to offset about 30 basis points of pressure from the repurchase inventory in the acquisitions. So excluding acquisitions, we would have seen gross margins up 30 basis points. On the cost side, what we're seeing as we move through these acquisitions that we expect, as I called out in the prepared remarks, about 150 basis points of pressure on our SG&A line from the acquisition as we move through the year, heaviest in the first half, it eases in the second half.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.", "Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research", "I'm curious about the holiday, just sort of the number of SKUs under $100, if you could share that detail, particularly as you think about Legacy and some of the wristlets and cold weather accessories. Can you just tell us how that should play out?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Sure. very much consistent with prior years, little bit of nuance by store attribute, so you'll see some distortion in higher price points in flagship stores and more balance in primary stores. We are making a stronger play in what I would call tech accessories. That's kind of obvious given what's going on in the marketplace. It's also a price point opportunity, a color opportunity. So you'll see us go after that in both channels, frankly. And we feel like from a gifting standpoint, having Men's and women's more bold in more stores offers us a nice advantage this holiday versus prior years.", "Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research", "Can I just ask a follow-up, which is who's buying Legacy? Do you still feel like it's a sort of fashionista customer? Or who's the core customer for the Legacy line?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Yes. I think Lew touched on that earlier. We're really seeing a broad response to Legacy across existing and new consumers, terrific response to Legacy in the department store channel where we've seen tremendous impacts on leather based and penetrations of leather go up. The other nice thing about Legacy from a handbag standpoint is it's landing right in our sweet spot in terms of average unit retail, right in that $300 range with, again, some headroom to move up with elevated product in select stores going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Glick with Buckingham Research.", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "This a question for either Lew or Mike. Historically, it's been a great strength of Coach that you really haven't been very reliant on the department store channel to drive your growth. However, it is an important customer phasing channel and important for the brand given how many customers are going through department stores in the U.S. and how the accessories business is growing just disproportionately within that channel. I just visited your new Herald Square shop at Macy's, which looks sensational, and I'm just wondering is this a kind of reinvigorated commitment to the presentation to the content in that channel. And are you looking perhaps to defend your market share a little more aggressively in that channel given the success of the category there?", "Michael D. Tucci", "You said it all. We are -- first of all, we're -- we believe in the department store channel in North America. We believe in our partners there. We believe in our leadership position there. We have really put our noses into that business. We understand the competitive set well. I think the Herald Square effort, which was led by Lew and the management team here speak to our commitment in the channel. We're going to school there. We will be relentless. We will look for opportunity, and we'll manage our business one customer at a time in the same way that we manage our business in all of our other channels.", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "So would you expect to see your -- the sell-in trend be more in line with kind of the POS trend? And if not, see some growth there as we go through the balance of the fiscal year?", "Michael D. Tucci", "We're really looking to optimize productivity there. Sell-in, things like replenishment and the opportunity to maintain consistency in the channel, newness, potential product development opportunities within the channel, it's across all areas. What we want to manage there is focus on the locations that we're in, how to make them more productive and to point our inventory into the right stores at the right time and turn that business and move it forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Erika Maschmeyer with Robert W. Baird.", "Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Follow-up on the department store strategy that you were just mentioning. On the inventory side, at this point, do you have enough inventory in that channel? Or does your sell-in kind of limit that? When might you see that pick up? And then on the -- can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the Men's contribution? I know you rolled it out to the 85 stores late in Q4, so wanted to get a sense of how much of a lift that provided in Q1.", "Michael D. Tucci", "Yes, the big opportunity on the department store side, particularly with Macy's but I think with others, too, is to really focus on EDI and to focus on getting into a replenishment business across key styles that we can own and manage. We own the inventory. We're working very closely. As we look into Q2 from a readiness standpoint, we feel like we have a very good pipe. We are being more conservative with our ship into that channel, but as we see the business move and we see traction, we have the opportunity to chase and to replenish into that business in a very productive way.", "Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then on Men's?", "Michael D. Tucci", "Oh, I'm sorry. Men's lift, well, the reality for us here is that while we pushed -- from a North America standpoint, we pushed Men's into about 100 stores in what we would call a significant way. And it's been both a comp and customer acquisition driver for us. We now have Men's in all stores, either through CBSR or in some opening assortment way going into the holiday season, which I think provides us further opportunity within the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jennifer Davis with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "First, I have a quick clarification. Jane, I think you said gross margins would have been up about 30 basis points, excluding the impact of the acquisition of distributors. Could you tell us how much either SG&A or EBIT margins would have levered excluding the acquisition?", "Jane Nielsen", "So what we would have seen excluding the acquisition is our operating margin would have been about -- we would have seen operating margin compression about 80 basis points. And that was expected given the distortion of marketing into the first quarter to support Legacy.", "Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "My question was on Men's. How much did that, I guess, contribute to growth in the U.S.? And is there an opportunity -- I think you kind of addressed this in the last question, but is there an opportunity to expand it a little more into the rest of the fleet beyond just the digital or just a little presentation that you have? And then finally, on your e-commerce, is there an opportunity to expand or do you feel like you have an opportunity to get into any full e-commerce sites in any additional countries beyond China and Japan?", "Michael D. Tucci", "I think on the Men's side, as I touched on earlier, while we haven't broken out specifically what the Men's contribution is, it is a positive driver from a productivity standpoint. And absolutely, we are looking from a format standpoint as well as within existing locations how we can get Men's product into our stores. I mentioned Pentagon City in my prepared remarks. That's a store where we've expanded and relocated in a mall to add a Men's store within side by side our women's store, where we've essentially seen the Men's business come from 0 in the prior store to a very significant Men's contribution relative to women's. So we're looking at that as a concept for us to potentially expand further in top locations and build out in addition to adding Men's into all stores going forward.", "Victor Luis", "And to your second question on e-commerce sites, as we discussed, at the beginning of next month, we will go live, e-commerce in China, which follows up on our first international site in Japan. Right now, we're very focused on transforming our informational sites across our other direct to Asian markets into fuller marketing sites, including the leverage of mobile and iPad apps, as well then from there the possibility of partnering with our distributor partners in other markets and looking at future developments in the e-commerce space.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.", "Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Mike, I was wondering if you could help us understand as we look ahead to the holiday quarter, how you guys would be planning the promotions, like the best customer events and what have you and how that's planned relative to last year so that there's less confusion in the holiday quarter versus the prior quarter. And then also related to that, could you give us a sense of the complexion of the handbags in terms of the distribution between the bucket of below $400 and over $400? I think you guys have talked about it in the past. Just wondering what's going on with that.", "Michael D. Tucci", "Sure. On the promotional side across full price and factory channel, very consistent with prior years. I think the only nuance out there is the method of delivery. What we put in the mail, what we put -- what we're doing digitally and how we might play with regard to third-party opportunities. But our plans today are very consistent with last year. In terms of mix on products, penetrations over $400 were essentially the same in Q1. I think you've heard me this morning speak about what I'm sensing as an opportunity for more elevated products, which I think may have an impact on that price tiering going forward. We did see some improvement in ADT overall, which we are very pleased with. And we think we're extremely well positioned from a gifting and pricing standpoint across all channels as we head into the holiday quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Could you help us think a little bit more about the gross margins in the U.S. full price side of the business. I'm trying to add up the pieces a little bit. You said 30 basis points was basically a wash between sourcing and the acquisitions. And I think Mike Tucci said that the factory stores were about flat. And we know China is better, so how are you feeling about the U.S. full price stores in the gross margin side right now?", "Jane Nielsen", "We're feeling very good about our gross margin position. I think that our -- with the sourcing initiatives that we put in place continue to work, it's offsetting the pressure that we've seen from the acquired inventory. And so we feel we're on a good trajectory, and we're pleased, as Mike mentioned, with our factory store and full price store gross margin in the quarter.", "Michael D. Tucci", "I think that the only piece that I'd add to that is as we've been able to really work our Men's product and work on our positioning in Men's, the team has done a tremendous job in terms of cost retail relationship there, so as we grow our Men's business to become a margin benefit for us in full price. And that's been a terrific win for us.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And is there any way we can get maybe just an update on the sourcing initiatives? Jane, I think you spoke about them a little bit. But we heard from other companies saying that they do expect sourcing to rise a little bit from Asia over the next few years versus, obviously, it's been a good source of deflation over a much longer period. How are you looking at it today? Maybe just an update on some of the initiatives you gave us last year on the sourcing outlook.", "Lew Frankfort", "I'd like to ask Jerry Stritzke to answer that. Jerry?", "Jerry Stritzke", "Thanks, Lew. We really are well into a 4-year plan that we articulated, I believe, the last -- about a year ago. And that shift has benefited us as we move more and more of our production into countries outside of China, Vietnam, Indonesia, other countries. And that involves both finished goods and raw materials. So as that shift has continued as kind of the mix has offset the actual pressure that we've seen in labor. Obviously, as we look forward, there is a lot of uncertainty about what labor costs will be around Asia and around the manufacturing base. So that's something we'll have to continue to pay attention to as we look to the future.", "Lew Frankfort", "Jerry, just comment on raw material costs if you would.", "Jerry Stritzke", "Overall, we've been able -- raw material costs hit a spike about 2 years ago. It dropped. We've been successful, and we have a great raw material team that really spans Asia and Europe and not only addresses leather-based costs but also addresses hardware. So we've had a very aggressive posture of taking positions we need to, optimizing our raw materials costs, which is about 60% of our cost of goods when you look at our handbag and small leather goods. So our expertise and credibility there, including creating new sourcing basis in our new countries where we're doing manufacturing, which cuts our logistics expenses, has all kind of contributed to keeping those costs in check and keeping us in a good place. So it has worked well for us. We'll continue to strive to make it work as we look to the future.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Frankfort for closing comments.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks. Pretty much everything has been said. I'll just close by saying we had a good quarter where we have traction on all of our initiatives. We're well positioned for holiday, and our opportunities for long-term growth continue to be abundant. And we're going to take advantage of all of them. Thank you, everyone, and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you, Wendy. Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Jane Nielsen, Coach\u2019s CFO. Mike Tucci, North American Group President is also joining us for a holiday review.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal year. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends, or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now, let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2013 results and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives. Mike Tucci will review our key programs for the holiday season. Jane Nielsen will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter. Following that, we will hold a Q&A session, where we will be joined by Victor Luis, International Group President; and Jerry Stritzke, our President and Chief Operating Officer. The Q&A session will end shortly before 9.30 am. Lew will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I\u2019d now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach\u2019s Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning. Thanks, Andrea, and welcome everyone. As noted in our press release, we were pleased with the overall progress we made against our strategic initiatives, aggressively growing our international business, becoming a market leader in the Men\u2019s accessories category globally and harnessing the power of the digital world. And in aggregate, we posted modest though highly profitable growth.", "However, we were clearly disappointed in our North American performance notably in women\u2019s where results were below expectations. The two overarching issues which impacted results, first was the muted consumer environment in the U.S. with a fiscal cliff uncertainty weighing on shoppers and a slow recovery from Hurricane Sandy in the Tri-State area. Second was intensified competition and heightened promotional activity in the women\u2019s bag and accessory category, especially in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Importantly, we maintained our pricing strategies, protecting our brand proposition.", "While we will get into further detail at our current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, along with specific strategies underway to address the North American market, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.", "Some key financials were, first, net sales totaled $1.50 billion versus $1.45 billion a year ago, an increase of 4%. Currency negatively impacted total sales by about 1%. Second, earnings per share totaled $1.23, up 5% from prior year. Third, North American sales increased 1% to $1.08 billion from $1.07 billion last year with direct sales up 2% on a 2% comparable store sales decline. And fourth, international sales increased 12% to $411 million from $368 million last year, driven in part by a 40% gain in sales in China with a continuation of double-digit comps.", "Looking first at global distribution, during the quarter, we opened two retail locations, including the first company operated concession in North America at Macy\u2019s Herald Square, as well as 15 factory stores including four Men\u2019s factory stores. This brought the total to 356 retail stores and a 189 factory stores in North America at the end of the period.", "Moving on to China, during the quarter, we opened 13 new locations on the mainland, bringing the total number to 117 locations including 99 on the mainland in 40 cities and we just celebrated our 100th store opening last week.", "In the wake of our Asian distributor acquisitions over the last 18 months, we now directly operate 92 locations in Asia comprised of seven in Singapore, 10 in Malaysia, 27 in Taiwan, and 48 in Korea. We do not have any openings in these markets during the last quarter. And in Japan, five dept stores were opened. At quarter-end, there were 193 total locations in Japan with 24 standalone full priced stores including eight flagships, 122 shop-in-shop, 40 factory stores, and seven distributor operated wholesale locations.", "Moving on to sales and productivity and starting in North America, our total revenues in North America rose 1% for the quarter with our directly operated businesses up 2% on the 2% comparable store sales decline. Overall trends in both retail and outlet malls in the U.S. shorten over the period impacted by macro concerns and Hurricane Sandy. For Coach, traffic trends in-store also weakened, while conversion and average transaction size was similar to prior year.", "Our Internet business remained strong, driven by significant traffic gains continuing to contribute to overall comp. In department stores, sales trends at POS were modestly below prior year, while shipments into this channel declined. Overall, we estimate that growth in the addressable women\u2019s North American handbag and accessory category remain strong in the holiday quarter rising about 10%.", "Moving on international sales, which today represent nearly one-third of Coach total sales rose 12% in the second quarter. As mentioned the China sales rose about 40% from the prior year. This sales growth was fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales growth.", "Clearly, the Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by these results, as well as the increasing contribution of the Chinese stores to have a global sales and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing consumers.", "Our other Asia direct businesses outside of China and Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia and Korea also posted strong aggregate growth in the quarter. In part, these countries benefited from the retail step-up from prior year, except for Singapore, which was purchased at the beginning of last fiscal year. In addition, their combined POS sales also rose at a double-digit rate. In Japan, we posted a 2% decrease in constant currency, while sales in dollars were down 7% from prior year reflecting the weaker yen.", "Finally, I would like to touch on our international wholesale business, where we experienced a modest decline in shipments, but retail sales gains were strong primarily driven by distribution expansion.", "While Jane will get into more detail on our financials, and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I wanted to give you this recap. Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our North American retail business and some of our initiatives going forward. Mike?", "Michael Tucci", "Thanks, Lew, and good morning. Lew has just given you a recap of the quarter, noting the traffic challenges in North America continued through the season in both retail and factory malls in general, and for us specifically impacting our in-store business. Our online business performance remained strong and the success of Men\u2019s was a bright spot as well.", "First, let me start with full price Women\u2019s handbags. Legacy and Madison were our lead connections for holiday with new silhouettes introduced throughout the quarter. Penetrations for these collections matched our international expectations, but in the context of a weaker than expected business, handbag comp declined. We did, however, maintain average unit retails in handbag and overall transaction size rose in our full priced channel.", "There were number of key takeaways during the quarter. First, leather handbags continue to be strong, while logo and mix materials underperformed. We saw strength in the over $400 handbag assortment, which validates the larger opportunity at higher price points. Tech accessories were very successful including our new iPhone covers, which we\u2019ll be expanding going forward.", "Looking ahead, we\u2019re excited about our spring product initiatives including updates in January in Madison such as the Candace Carryall, as well as newness in legacy with Perforated Leather novelty offered in our key silhouettes and new styles in Mini Tanner. We also launched our newest fragrance Love and a Mini Boyfriend Watch, which is a smaller size of our best selling Boyfriend collection, and already being embraced by consumers.", "In February, we introduced the new legacy Courtenay Hobo and Romy flat, both styles featuring our iconic Turnlock closure. In March, we launched the powerful new (inaudible). Our color palette is on trend for the season with mint robin\u2019s egg blue, lemon, bright coral and new neutrals. As of last Friday, all of our stores have transitioned fully to spring.", "One product opportunity that we\u2019re particularly excited about is footwear. In March, we will be relaunching shoes in about a 170 retail stores, featuring great belly flat, fashion wedges and heels and on-trend sneakers. And in a select number of flagship stores who have begin to install shoe salon to showcase the new world of Coach footwear.", "Shifting to e-commerce, online business was strong for holiday with sales in traffic growing at a double-digit pace through coach.com and eFS, our factory site.", "In addition, we are seeing an increasing percentage of sales in traffic coming from mobile. Clearly, this trend is representative of our consumer shopping behaviors in this growing digitally-enabled environment and is consistent with our increased emphasis on digital, both to our own website and social media. Our intend is to rapidly drive further innovation in this channel.", "We\u2019re also really excited about the results we are achieving in our Men\u2019s business, which is on track to grow about 50% globally this year to over $600 million. We have experienced success in Men\u2019s across all concepts and store types and across all geographies and channels. In North America, Men\u2019s is driving productivity in existing stores and also represents a substantial new distribution opportunity.", "In our press release today, Lew noted that we are implementing a number of strategies and actions to enhance and present a broader lifestyle expression of Coach to our consumers. As part of this brand building initiative, we elevated our store environments in both full pricing factory stores, telling a more complete story. We\u2019ve experienced excellent customer response to new retail concepts such as our remodel to 25 North Michigan Avenue, flagship store in Chicago, our dual-gender side-by-side concept store in Pentagon City Center, and at our first North American concession shop at Macy\u2019s Herald Square here in New York, which provides an elevated environment to showcase our products and enhance the Coach experience within a department store.", "We\u2019ve also added some of these new visual merchandising elements to many of our retail stores and several key U.S. department store doors, and we\u2019ll continue to push these enhancements to more stores over the balance of the fiscal year. And later this spring, we\u2019ll begin to leverage mobile POS, which will allow us to remove cash ramps and reclaim selling space for lifestyle categories with a goal of driving improved productivity in the same footprint.", "On the factory side, our store elevation and enhancement strategy was piloted in our Riverhead and Woodbury common stores and rolled out to about 25 of our highest volume stores during November. We also opened our factory store in the future in Deer Park, Long Island this quarter. This is the most advanced store format in terms of merchandising and store experience in this channel, and will be a laboratory for future store development.", "In summary, we\u2019ll continue to drive our Women\u2019s business through fashion, innovation, and broadening the expression of the brand through lifestyle categories. We\u2019ll leverage the opportunity in Men\u2019s and evolve our store in digital concepts to provide a brand-right shopping experience for our consumer wherever she chooses to shop.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and further opportunities for growth. Lew?", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks, Mike. Before we move on to our usual discussion of distribution and our financials, I want to recognize it\u2019s not business as usual. We have a long history of responding to change, and I want to go back to the future to discuss the specific actions we\u2019re taking to enhance and build out our Coach Women\u2019s business here in North America and globally.", "[For] perspective, the Coach proposition is based on several differentiating elements. First, Coach is a distinctive brand which grew organically from the inherent and recognizable qualities of our product. Second, we are innovative in consumer centric, change and continuous improvement is build into our culture. Third, we have a multi-channel international distribution model with increasing global presence. And most importantly, fourth, we have a broad, diverse and committed consumer base.", "Over the last decade, we have built Coach into a leading international accessories company with a loyal and highly engaged consumer franchise. Our customers recognize the Coach brand for its authenticity, innovation, and relevance. Building on these equities, we\u2019re now transforming Coach into a global lifestyle brand anchored in accessories. We\u2019ve been strengthening our teams to enhance and build out the Coach experience through product, retail environment, and integrated marketing.", "This holistic approach will continue to add excitement and cache to the Coach brand. We\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to offer a lifestyle assortment within categories such as outerwear, shoes, jewelry, watches, eyewear, and fragrance. This next evolution of the brand will encompass a full head to toe expression of the Coach women, including a focused ready-to-wear presentation to inspire our customers with a complete Coach point of view that is relevant to how she lives her life. This new design direction while still grounded in accessories covers all categories and price points including a more elevated product platform. It\u2019s intended to imbue our product with a much more of an emotional context.", "You will see elements of this brand strategy implemented through this brand fall with a more complete expression of the new world of Coach next holiday. We plan to convey this dual expression of the Coach brand by telling a complete story about the women and men who are our consumers. We will impact every way the brand touches the consumer including in our stores, window, online and market.", "Now moving on to our distribution update; as our plans haven\u2019t changed materially from what we first outlined on the July earnings call and reiterated in October, I will be brief. We expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% or 11% during this fiscal year. In North America, we expect to open a few net new stores in the back half in addition to the 22 net openings in the first half, taking us up about 25 net new stores for the year. In total, square footage will increase about 10% in FY13.", "Turning to international and starting with China, as you know, we expect to open about 30 new stores this year or about another 10 in the second half, bringing the total to about 125 locations at the end of the year. All of these openings are planned to be dual gender stores due to the size of the Men\u2019s opportunity. In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 35%, and we expect sales to total at least $400 million driven by both distribution and comparable location sales. We\u2019re also pleased to announce the new distribution channel for China e-commerce, which went large in November, providing Chinese consumers the new way to engage with the Coach brands.", "In terms of our other Asian direct markets, our primary focus for this year is on driving productivity rather than distribution, as we continue to invest in training, merchandising, store environments and systems, creating a brand-right experience.", "In Japan, where the overall consumer market remains challenging, we expect to open about 10 net new locations, most of them dedicated Men\u2019s doors. In total, we expect that net square footage will increase by about 10% this year.", "Finally, as you know, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in Asia, we do have significant and growing distributor run businesses in other countries. We\u2019re focusing on expanding through partners in four regions; first, in Europe, where we have begun to build the foundation for long-term growth; second, Latin America, including Brazil, Venezuela, Columbia, Panama, Chile and Peru; third, other Asia Pacific markets such as Australia, Thailand and Indonesia; and fourth, in the Middle East. These are in addition to the significant global travel retail opportunity that continues to exist for Coach as the brand recognition continues to grow globally.", "We have just reviewed our strategies to drive the next chapter of growth for Coach based on our strong brand and business equities. We have significant runway ahead of us both in North America, which remains a growing market and of course, worldwide.", "At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO for further details on our financials and investment plans. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Lew. Lew and Mike have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results.", "Our quarterly revenues increased 4% with North America up 1% and international up 12%. As noted, the weakened yen reduced sales growth by about one point.", "Net income for the quarter totaled $353 million, up 2%, with earnings per diluted share of $1.23, up 5%. This compared to net income of $347 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.18 in the prior year\u2019s second quarter.", "For the first half, net sales were $2.67 billion, up 7% from the $2.50 billion reported in the first six months of fiscal 2012. Net income totaled $574 million, up 2% from the $562 million reported a year-ago, while earnings per share rose 5% to $2 from $1.90.", "For the second quarter, our operating income totaled $527 million, 5% above the $501 million reported last year on a GAAP basis, while operating margins was 35.0% versus 34.6%.", "During this quarter, gross profit totaled $1.09 billion versus $1.05 billion a year ago, an increase of 4%. The gross margin rate was 72.2%, even with prior year, constrained by just over 20 basis points by the higher cost of inventory repurchased in our acquisition. As expected, our expense ratio in Q2 totaled 37.2% compared to the 37.6% reported in the year ago quarter on a GAAP basis.", "During the year-ago quarter, we reported certain items, which yielded a substantially lower tax rate and decreased our provision for taxes by $12 million. As a result, we made charitable contributions, which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlement to the net income and earnings per share.", "Therefore, on a non-GAAP basis, excluding these items, operating income for the prior year\u2019s second quarter was $521 million with a 36.0% operating margin and the SG&A expense ratio was 36.2%. Importantly, even including the impact of distributor acquisition cost, we were able to gain leverage to EPS.", "As a reminder, this year, our most significant investment is accelerating our international growth through the acquisition of the domestic retail operations of our key Asian distributor, and the further development of infrastructure to support this global growth. We are also distorting our investments in the digital space to expand and deepen our engagement with consumers.", "Moving on to the balance sheet; inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $494 million, 15% above the $429 million reported at the end of last year\u2019s Q2. Our inventory levels are driven by the repurchase of inventory from our recently acquired markets and distinctive units that will allow us to support distribution growth and to maximize sales this spring.", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $859 million, as compared with $1.09 billion a year ago. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 4 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $56.63 per share, spending a total of $225 million and taking the six months total to $400 million. At the end of the quarter, about $1.4 billion remain on our current repurchase authorization.", "Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $628 million compared to $611 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $567 million versus $572 million in the same period last year. As a reminder, we shifted our dividend payment paying it out in the second fiscal quarter as compared to the third fiscal quarter last year.", "Our CapEx spending was $61 million versus $39 million in the same quarter a year ago. We continue to expect that CapEx this year will be in the area of $250 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansions across all geographies elevating, our store environments and investments in technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion.", "Looking at the remainder of fiscal 2013, we\u2019re mindful of balancing the impact of the muted consumer environment and the challenging market dynamics in North America with our optimism around Men\u2019s and the strong international expansion opportunities for Coach. We also recognize the yen is likely to be an accelerating headwind over the remainder of the fiscal year. Therefore, our second half outlook has become more cautious.", "First and most generally, we expect to achieve high single-digit second half sales growth with North America comps about even with prior year. Second, our second half gross margin is planned to improve modestly on a year-over-year basis as channel mix and our sourcing initiatives continue to contribute to profitability. On balance, we continue to expect gross margin to remain high at about the 73% area for the year.", "Third, on SG&A, as we\u2019ve noted previously, international acquisitions alone will cause our expenses to rise about a 150 basis points for the year. Fourth, therefore taken together, we still expected annual operating margin of about 31%, is the compressions from prior year as a results of our investments. Notably, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage to EPS.", "And fifth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 33% for the year as we continue to further refine our international tax strategy.", "Overall the last decade, we have become a leading international accessories company. It\u2019s now time to build out a fuller expression of our brand and to tell a more complete brand story to our consumers. Importantly, we have the financial strength and the brand vibrancy to capitalize on the opportunities ahead and drive profitable growth.", "I\u2019d now like to open it up for Q&A", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Bob Drbul with Barclays.", "Bob Scott Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, good morning.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning, Bob.", "Bob Scott Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Lew, I have two questions for you. The first one, the new transformation strategy, is it a reaction to market conditions and really what do you hope to achieve with it?", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, first Bob, we have been working for the last two years on moving Coach from an accessories brand to a lifestyle brand. We started with a holistic approach to Men\u2019s, which is running extremely strongly. We have moved forward with footwear. We\u2019ve introduced new store prototypes. We have expanded our lifestyle categories with key items, particularly in outerwear, all of which demonstrate on consumers\u2019 interest in Coach providing a more complete expression.", "And based on the accumulation of variety of factors including having the right team in place on success with our initiatives, business process change and an articulation of who the Coach women will be through our lenses, we have now galvanized on this initiative. And you will see this holiday a complete expression of the Coach brand. And in essence, what we really want to do is enable the consumer to see Coach in a more complete emotional context, rather than seeing Coach as a great accessory or a great bag we want to first think of Coach as a great brand in accessories, but through a lifestyle lens.", "Bob Scott Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. And then I have a second question Lew. Within the holiday season, was there a variation between full price comps and the outlet stores in North America?", "Michael Tucci", "The short answer is no. The trends were very consistent both bricks and mortar channels were impacted by lower traffic. And we did not promote our way to positive comp, which obviously we had the marketing levers to do, but wanted to protect the brand composition.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great, thank you so much. I just had a follow-up on Bob\u2019s question before I move on to my question. Lew, it sounds like you had negative traffic in both channels, and if you could just comment on the level of sort of couponing and discounting obviously we saw flat gross margin, so it looked to be relatively similar to last year. But I think there might have been some an incremental discount, for example, the factory channel in December, if you could just comment on that?", "Lew Frankfort", "The promotional activities were consistent with our last year in factory. What impacted us was overall more traffic, which was down during the month of December in particular.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great, thanks. And did you quantify the impact of Sandy, and then just any initiatives here in the first half of calendar 2013, your second half of your fiscal year. To move that comp from that negative to level back into the flat range, that would be helpful? Thanks so much.", "Jane Nielsen", "Yeah, Kimberley just to answer your question, one on the factory stores, in the second quarter our factory store gross margin was flat to prior year. So we held our gross margin in our factory store. Overall, Sandy was about a point of comp in North America in the second quarter. As we look at initiatives over the second half, we feel well positioned for spring, we are overlapping our no math in our factory channel in the coming quarters, and Mike also have some comments on comp.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. Well, first of course, we recognize that we battle through a tough holiday season. We were pushing the business, but we did limit some of our activities. Our approach this spring is really around very fresh inventory going into the spring season, a focus on women\u2019s handbags and accessories as an opportunity to strengthen. And within that leveraging underlying strength in the leather category and trying to offset the weakness that we are seeing in non-leather mixed materials and logo through further innovation, more fresh delivery there. And frankly, rebalancing our inventory to push more emphasis on leather where we see growth.", "Another opportunity to improve comp performance is clearly taking advantage of the digital space and the men\u2019s opportunity, which continue to be very, very strong for us. An area that we are studying and we will take a little bit more time to understand is the impact of anniversarying the no math strategy, in fact we have literally started today last year. So as we get deeper into the spring season, I think we have some opportunity to be creative there, to focus on merchandize opportunities within the factory channel against that backdrop.", "And then finally, from a product standpoint, really focusing on shoes as a growth lever as a frequency opportunity, as an opportunity we will engage with the consumer in an extremely important category, where we\u2019ve invested significantly in product innovation, presentation, I mean in-store effort to improve that business.", "Kimberly Greenberger \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great, that\u2019s a helpful color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick with JPMC.", "Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning.", "Michael Tucci", "Good morning.", "Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan", "Two questions if I could. The first one maybe some thoughts over the next couple of years. How you think margins on footwear or I guess outerwear, or apparel I guess as you look to build into more of a lifestyle brand. How do you think the margins on those new categories will impact the overall operating margins of the company?", "And then the second question maybe shorter-term here, just your comments interesting leather in over a $400 price point was stronger, weakness at logo. Do you think that\u2019s something, economically hitting your more aspirational Coach Shopper? Is it a fashion direction change, more competition? What do you think is happening there that the logo business has been weaker? Thanks very much.", "Michael Tucci", "Why don\u2019t I take the second piece and then I\u2019ll let Lew speak to the longer-term context of the business. This leather and mix issue that we\u2019re seeing in the business, I do think that the leather opportunity for us is very significant and one that we have to be more aggressive with, both from a pricing and innovation standpoint, there is a strong reception there.", "One interesting fact, on the wholesale side, we saw a very nice season at bloomingdales and it was driven by leather. There is not a signature comparing in that specific account. So the benefit there was much more significant to us. We need to build on that. I do think that some of the competitive and pricing promotional activity that we saw in the quarter, particularly in December was a heavy emphasis on promotional goods, logo goods in the marketplace. We did not take prices down there. We weren\u2019t pristine but we did not cut price points there in the full price channel on our signature business. So we need to rebase that business, we need to move forward and I do think that, there is clearly a macro trend, particularly globally, towards leather and away from the traditional logo business.", "Lew Frankfort", "", "With regard to operating margins, we are not concerned that they will place any stress on them. First, we are in the footwear and lifestyle category today; second, we will continue to be anchored in the accessories; third, many other factors impact our gross margin including channel mix and geography, and we are confident that we can maintain our operating margins as we broaden our expression.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Erika Maschmeyer with Robert W. Baird.", "Erika Maschmeyer \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. Could you talk a bit about the trends that you saw in terms of your shipments in POS department stores? How did that trend throughout the quarter? And then where you implemented the automated replenishment? Did you see lift there after implementing that, any quantification would be helpful. And then could you also just talk a little bit more about the promotional environment? Was that worse within the department stores and then your wholesale accounts versus specialty stores, any color there would be great. Thanks.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. Within the wholesale channel, we actually saw continued improvement in managing inventory. In that, we were able to effectively control shipments in which allowed us to run a cleaner business. We actually saw some organic margin improvement in the quarter in our wholesale business, which we were pleased with. We came out of the quarter cleaner. If you look in the marketplace today, we are fully transition there and we\u2019re very clean.", "So from a shipping standpoint, we manage the business very tightly, we\u2019re able to stay close in terms of POS sales and we feel like we\u2019re very well positioned for spring. We continue to work on the opportunity around automatic replenishment, particularly with key foundational styles and we will build on that, that\u2019s a learning opportunity for us, it\u2019s a consistency opportunity for us that we will manage and we will move forward.", "Erika Maschmeyer \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Then on the promotional environment?", "Michael Tucci", "The promotional activity, I think built throughout the quarter and frankly the surprise for us was the level of promotional activity that we saw within department stores in the month of December in the category, I think the category was very strong. And it became aggressive from a pricing standpoint within the December period.", "Erika Maschmeyer \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. Best of luck.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Alvin Cooperman with Wells Fargo.", "Alvin Cooperman \u2013 Wells Fargo & Company", "Thanks, good morning.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning", "Alvin Cooperman \u2013 Wells Fargo & Company", "I like to ask more about the footwear opportunity (inaudible) near-term. Like you said, you have been already in the footwear business. So can you give a little bit more color, is it may be how many more SKUs or more space in this stores and when do you think some of this investment can begin to move the needle? Thanks.", "Michael Tucci", "Sure, I\u2019ll speak to it from a retail standpoint across digital and our retail stores. We actually have carved back the footwear business significantly in the last several quarters, in preparation for relaunching footwear this spring. In addition, we built the design team there. We built the production capability there. And the big movement there is to really move away from a more casual sneaker oriented price driven business to a more complete offer of footwear across end-use wearing occasion price points.", "Now, I want to be very clear here, the full expression of footwear, we will do in a select number of stores in a very pointed way, and we will learn and go-to-school the best proxy I can give you for this. This is the way we approach our Men\u2019s business, where we got very deep into it in a very concentrated way impactful and built it out from there.", "There is a broader opportunity in footwear in more stores, which you\u2019ll see this spring. But we believe that moving the needle in footwear will require a more significant investment in store presentation, inventory marketing, and really working to re-space the business in our stores in terms of providing a better shopping and service environment. That will take more time. That\u2019s more of a long-term play.", "Lew Frankfort", "The only thing I would like to add Mike is that, we see footwear as a real traffic driver. It\u2019s a very frequent purchase, it\u2019s emotional. And as we present on the worlds of footwear in our marketing, in our windows, and all consumer facing environments, women will be surprised and we believe very pleased with the cheers and more, what Mike said, original assortment that reinforces not only our heritage, but also which builds on our heritage (inaudible) to today\u2019s fashion and usage.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Chloe Wayne with ISI Group.", "Chloe Wayne \u2013 ISI Group", "Hi, this is Chloe Wayne on for Omar Saad. It would really help us to think about the shift to your global lifestyle brand strategy, if you could give a couple of sentences on how you define the Coach brand? How would you describe what the core Coach Lifestyle represents? And what does your consumer research show about how your customer thinks about this? Thanks.", "Lew Frankfort", "Let me begin by saying that we have a very loyal and committed franchise. I said earlier that our franchise is very broaden and diverse. And obviously with 30% market share in the Untied States, we reach virtually every one of our targeted consumers and the way in which consumers see us is as a loved and trusted brand, they believe in the authenticity of Coach, the quality, the function, the durability of our products. And as I said earlier, as a product driven brand, the equities of our brand has really evolved from our product. And by migrating to a lifestyle brand, we are looking to build on these equities to create a greater emotional context for this consumer to see the entire Coach women. And the Coach women is intelligent, self assured, she is looking for style and function, and she is not looking for product to overwhelm her, but to complement her lifestyle. And we are going to reflect that on the head to toe expressions, which already exists in our key flagship stores. We\u2019re looking to just express it more fully.", "Chloe Wayne \u2013 ISI Group", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Good morning, everyone.", "Michael Tucci", "Hey, Dana.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Hi. I wanted to ask a little bit more about, as you see inventory levels both on the full price channel and the half price channel. Where do you see them as you look forward to the second half of the year? How do you see those evolving? And also as you look at the international business, are you experiencing the same product trends overseas as what you\u2019re seeing here with logo and also with leather? Thank you.", "Michael Tucci", "Jane will take the first part and then Victor will discuss our international trends.", "Jane Nielsen", "Dana, over time we expect our inventory levels roughly to track with sales. There are some, you know our acquisitions will take that level up as we build for [newness] and we\u2019ll have a little more inventory on hand. But overall, our inventories are in great position and they generally track with sales.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning, Dana. On the international product trends, Mike touched it on that earlier, in general they are global. I mean we are seeing leather trending positively in all markets and this is also true in China, where we have moved and are really ahead of the curve. There maybe some slight nuance between the second or third tier city and the first tier city, but in general that is a global trend.", "And in those markets, especially again in China, we\u2019ve also been very hard at work on advancing our transformation from just an accessories brand to a broader lifestyle brand, and it is easier to do so in those markets where we don\u2019t have the history and there the consumer is really reacting incredibly positively to our proposition. And then our flagship stores during the past season, we have seen lifestyle categories reach penetrations of 20% to 25%. And so we are really excited about the changes underway and the impact that, that will have on our global business not just here in the U.S.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "And just lastly, how do you see the investment cost related to this transformation to a lifestyle brand?", "Jane Nielsen", "Dana, the guidance that we\u2019ve given for the year really encompasses the start of this journey on our transformation as we look at the opportunities both the sales impact and the profitability impact. We\u2019ll assess the investment levels as we move forward.", "Michael Tucci", "We have built-in a sufficient capital to address store renovations in new store concepts, and improved different fixturing. In addition, we do have a very strong supply chain that is extremely efficient, we know how to bring product to market and we don\u2019t see significant ramp up cost, the key is talent, and as we indicated before we have strengthened our design and merchandising leadership, and we do believe that we now have the strength and team in place to be able to drive us to our potential.", "Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Antoine Belge with HSBC.", "Antoine Belge \u2013 HSBC", "Hello, it\u2019s Antoine Belge with HSBC. And I have noticed that your new store seems to be contributing less to sales growth. I think if you look at the difference between your direct-to-consumer sales in North America up 2% and the comps down 2% to the 4% contribution. I think in the past, it was probably a higher number. So can you elaborate on that?", "And just a follow-up on your guidance of flat comps in the remaining two quarters. I notice also that the comparison base is quite different between Q3. I think you did 7% last year and only 2% in Q4, so should we expect actually the flat number price to being a negative number in Q3 whereby I don\u2019t know a low single digit number in Q4.", "Jane Nielsen", "Yeah, Antoine, given the current market and variability, we are not giving specific quarterly guidance. We are comfortable with our guidance for the half of about even with prior year. We do see that the new square footage comes on not at full productivity as we build it out, but we do see that our new stores are coming online and are continuing strong, but overall we see some of the back half stores coming later online.", "Antoine Belge \u2013 HSBC", "", "Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort", "I think the only think I would add here Jane is that our stores are profitable from day one. But second, I would like to just emphasize the point that you\u2019ve made around rap and they are not open for a full year. And third, most of the stores that we\u2019re opening are in secondary markets, not all of course but many and we have a lower cost structure and that\u2019s what makes them extremely profitable.", "Antoine Belge \u2013 HSBC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Champine with Canaccord.", "Laura Champine \u2013 Canaccord Genuity", "Good morning guys. Lew, I\u2019m sorry if I missed it. But what was the growth in the category in the U.S. for handbags, and I think this is the first time that you guys in a long while have admittedly given up share. Is that one new competitor, lots of new competitors or you just kind of hitting a wall in terms of the market share potential for handbags, if you could comment on that would be great?", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. First the category growth was 10% more or less. This is the first time that we have not held or grown faster than the category. As I said earlier, we have about a 30% market share. In other areas, we have obviously have grown and here we are talking North America women\u2019s. We are confident that the strategies that we have articulated or strategies that can enable us to resume growth and maintain if not grow our category share in the years ahead.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jennifer Davis with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Jennifer Davis \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Couple of clarifications, first, could you share your thought process on your share repurchase program, you purchased shares opportunistically or how do you go about that? And then Jane could you remind us of the impact of the acquisition of your distributors kind of the timing of the expenses associated with that and how that flows kind of each quarter through the year as you acquire a distributor. And then sorry, on traffic, I believe mall traffic was down 4% in December. Do you guys have outlet mall traffic numbers that you could share with us? And then finally, my question, Lew, I guess on?", "Jane Nielsen", "You missed Jennifer.", "Jennifer Davis \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "I know, well here is Michael, no more clarifications. My question is, could you remind us of your penetration of accessories and kind of non-handbag categories versus handbag? What that mix is today and then where you see it going? Thanks a lot.", "Jane Nielsen", "Why don\u2019t I take the first two clarifications and then I\u2019ll have my comment on malls and penetration. So our share repurchase program, we view share repurchases as a, and our dividend program combined the way of returning capital to shareholders.", "Our first priority is to invest in our business. As to we\u2019ve done that, we look at the residual of our cash and look to return that to our shareholders. We balance our working capital needs, our expected CapEx, and then repurchase shares opportunistically based on the capital flows and needs of our business overall.", "Just on the acquisitions, when we acquire a business, there are several impacts. We acquire distributor business. Remember, the sales that we guess, we already have the wholesales sales. So we get about the markup between wholesale and retail.", "So we get that that bump on the sales line, but it\u2019s not a 100% of sales. But we take on 100% of the SG&A of the acquired market. That SG&A impact is with us for the whole first 12 months of the acquisition and ongoing, but once we\u2019re out of the first-year overlapped become much less dramatic.", "And as we acquire a distributor, we have to markup the inventory that we acquire. It takes us about two quarters to be out of that higher priced inventory that\u2019s marked up to roughly wholesale, our wholesale prices. [To talk you] about the first two quarters following an acquisition, the gross margin impact subsides.", "Lew Frankfort", "The only category that we track in a, let\u2019s call it in a rigorous way is other than Women\u2019s is Men\u2019s accessories. And here in America, we have about a 17% market share, and that category has grown by about 25%.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Citibank.", "Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi, guys, thanks. Regarding the intensified competition and the environment here, what are your thoughts on where you stand with the legacy average unit retail? And as you look to drive incremental traffic or look to improve traffic trends, do you think on moderating AUR is a potential strategic option?", "My follow-up is related to your ideas on broadening expression. What should we think about in terms of where you want to get footwear as a percentage of mix? And also is there other efforts in relation to jewelry and watches as you undergo this process and other categories, how should we think about the mix composition that you are targeting? Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort", "Why don\u2019t I begin and then turn it over to Mike. First, with regard to how should we think about AUR and do we think is an opportunity perhaps at lower price points. The reality is just an opportunity at all price points. And we look to maintain and achieve a very balance assortment. We believe there is a very substantial opportunity in the space over $400, where we barely participate. And consumers have embraced all of our limited addition product in that price range. So you will continue to see us maintain a very balanced approach to the very diverse and broad consumer base that we have.", "With regard to legacy, legacy has been an important step in our transformation of legacy, is going to, as we said before continue with us. And the average legacy price point is somewhat higher than the overall assortment, but in part that\u2019s because the collection is driven in leather. Mike, you want to talk a little bit about mix?", "Michael Tucci", "Sure. The piece that I\u2019d like to speak to on, specifically on handbag positioning from a pricing standpoint, our stated $300 sweet spot I think is remain the opportunities to nuance that by store type and push harder across our most premium location, which by the way performed significantly better than primary locations in the quarter and we continue to see that trend as an opportunity going forward.", "Pushing higher price points into the most premium locations, while balancing that with compelling innovation at opening price points, particularly in primary locations we\u2019re 350 store business and in many of our department store doors where there is more of a price compelling proposition to be made for us to maintain and grow share. So that\u2019s the piece on handbags.", "And on shoes, we haven\u2019t placed specific target on shoes as a percent to total. What we are looking at there initially is diversifying the assortment, building a tiered assortment there and using shoes as an incremental productivity opportunity, building ticket, building frequency and improving productivity in stores and across our digital platform as well.", "Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks a lot guys. And Lew, just to be clear, within the legacy portfolio, are you saying that you are happy with where the AUR is within that collection? Are there changing\u2026", "Lew Frankfort", "Absolutely. The average handbag is about 20% higher than the average bag. And as you know, legacy has a very substantial number of key outerwear items, which outperforms extremely well.", "Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thanks guys and good luck.", "Jane Nielsen", "Thank you everybody for joining us today as the market now is open and its our prior practice to conclude the call, I will just turn it over to Lew for a couple of sentences closure and I look forward to speaking to you over the next couple of days.", "Lew Frankfort", "First, I just want you also know that we are extremely focused and single minded and confident in our ability to address the near term challenges in North America. At the same time, we will be continuing to leverage the global opportunity as we evolve the Coach brand, so as I said before and years behind, stay tuned. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Lew Frankfort, Coach\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Victor Luis, President and Chief Commercial Officer; Jane Nielsen, CFO. Mike Tucci, North American Group President.  ", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. ", "Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends, or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now, let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our third fiscal quarter 2013 results. Mike Tucci will review North America, including some early reads on new programs in retail and wholesale. Victor Luis will discuss our progress on global growth initiatives, and Jane Nielsen will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question and answer session where we will be joined by Jerry Strizske, our president and chief operating officer.  The Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Lew will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I\u2019d now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach\u2019s chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning.  Thank you, Andrea, and welcome everyone.  As noted in our press release, we were pleased with our solid third quarter results and the overall progress we made against our initiatives, including growing our international business, becoming a market leader in the men\u2019s accessories category globally, and harnessing the power of the digital world.", "We also moved forward with our grand transformation, as we added to our creative leadership, building upon our strong team, and began to create a more robust lifestyle offering with the relaunch of footwear.  Further, the announcement today of the increased dividend reflects our financial strength and our confidence in Coach\u2019s future.  ", "Separately, we also noted that Reed Krakoff does not intend to renew his contract, which expires in June 2014, to focus exclusively on his namesake brand.  We are exploring strategic alternatives for the RK brand.", "Reed has been my creative partner for 16 years, and has been instrumental in the brand\u2019s remarkable evolution and growth and we have great admiration and respect for Reed\u2019s significant accomplishments.", "We\u2019re also excited about the next chapter of our growth story, now underway as we transform Coach into a global lifestyle brand anchored in accessories.  We have built a very strong creative team, and are now looking for a successor to lead it.", "While we will get into further detail about current conditions and the [outputs of] business shortly, as always, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.  Some key financial highlights were, first, net sales totaled $1.19 billion versus $1.11 billion a year ago, an increase of 7%.  On a constant currency basis, sales rose nearly 10%.  Second, earnings per share totaled $0.84, up 10% from prior year.  ", "Third, North American sales increased 7% to $792 million from $738 million last year, with direct sales up 8% on a 1% comparable store sales gain.  And, fourth, international sales increased 6% to $382 million from $359 million last year, driven in part by a 40% gain in sales in China, with a continuation of double digit comps.  On a constant currency basis, international sales were up 14%.", "Looking first at global distribution, during the quarter in North America we opened one retail location, closed five others, and opened two new factory men\u2019s stores.  This brought the total to 352 retail stores and 191 factory stores in North America at the end of the period.", "Moving on to China, during the quarter we opened one new location on the mainland, bringing the total number to 118 locations, including 100 on the mainland in 41 cities.  Following our Asian distributor acquisitions over the last 21 months, we now directly operate 93 locations in Asia comprised of 49 in Korea, including one location we opened in the quarter, 27 in Taiwan, 10 in Malaysia, and 7 in Singapore.  ", "And in Japan, we closed two locations, taking the total to 191 at the end of the quarter with 23 standalone full-price stores including 8 flagships, 121 shop and shops, 40 factory stores, and 7 distributor-operator wholesale locations.  ", "Moving on to sales and productivity, starting in North America, our total revenues rose 7% for the quarter with our directly operated businesses up 8% on a 1% comparable store sales increase.  In department stores, sales trends at POS were slightly above prior year, while shipments into this channel also rose slightly.  Overall, we estimate that growth in the addressable women\u2019s North American handbag and accessory category remained strong in the latest quarter, rising high single digits.  ", "Moving on, international sales, which today represent about a third of Coach\u2019s total sales, rose 6% in the third quarter or 14% on a constant currency basis, consistent with prior quarter.  China sales rose about 40% from prior year, fueled by distribution and double digit same-store sales.  Clearly, the Chinese consumer continues to embrace Coach as evidenced by these results as well as the increasing contribution of the Chinese tourist to our global sales and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers.", "Our other Asia direct businesses outside of China and Japan - Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore - also posted strong aggregate growth in the quarter.  In total, they benefitted from the retail step up from the prior year from Malaysia and Korea.  In addition, their combined POS sales also rose at a double digit rate.  In Japan, sales were even with prior year, on a constant currency basis, while dollar sales declined 14%, reflecting the weaker yen.  ", "Finally, I would like to touch on our international wholesale business where we experienced a modest decline in shipments while retail sales gains remained strong, driven primarily by distribution expansion.  While Jane will get into more detail on our financials, I wanted to give you this recap.", "As Andrea said, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our North American business and some of our initiatives going forward.  Mike?", "Michael Tucci", "Thanks, Lew, and good morning.  Lew has just given you a recap of the quarter.  Let me provide some detail on North American performance, along with progress on our key initiatives.  Most generally, we\u2019re pleased with our business as our revenue in North America grew at 7% overall and 8% in direct channels.  ", "Our in-store traffic trends improved from the holiday quarter, while conversion was similar to prior year and ticket was up.  Our internet business remains strong, driven by significant traffic gains continuing to contribute to overall comps.  In aggregate, our comp stores sales increase was driven by an increase in transactions, fueled by our online businesses while ticket was even with prior year.", "Looking at North America full price, and starting with handbags, Legacy and Madison remained our key collections in the March quarter, with new silhouettes introduced throughout the period.  Two notable introductions were the Saffiano tote group and the limited launch of the Phoebe shoulder bag, both in March, and both well-received.", "We saw a continuation of trends favoring leather, where we were well-positioned, and the above $400 segment continued to perform well, at about 18% of handbags.  Small bags also trended particularly well, which impacted mix, resulting in slightly lower average handbag retails.  ", "Looking ahead, we\u2019re excited about our fourth quarter product initiatives featuring the new Phoebe shoulder bag, which, as noted, launched at the end of March, and will be our featured style for Mother\u2019s Day.  Phoebe represents our latest innovative design direction, and has been a huge hit with consumers, immediately becoming a best-seller.  For spring, Phoebe is offered in a beautiful new leather quality, which is soft and drapey, with sleek hardware details and sophisticated subtle branding.  ", "Throughout the quarter, we have new on-trend colors coming into existing collections, and in June we\u2019re looking forward to a new satchel and tote product launch targeted to our fashion-conscious consumers who appreciate pretty styling and feminine details.  ", "One product opportunity that we\u2019re particularly excited about is footwear.  In March, we relaunched shoes in over 170 retail stores in North America, featuring great ballet flats, fashion wedges and heels, and on-trend sneakers.  In a select number of flagship stores, we began to install shoe salons to showcase the new world of Coach, and made shoes a feature of our windows in over 75 locations.", "The response from consumers has been extremely positive as the business in these footwear locations went from about 3% to almost 12% of the business in five weeks, and has positively impacted productivity.  Important to note is that we converted our past sneaker-focused business into a fashion business of key styles such as the Nadia loafer, the Nala heel, and the Dalia ballet slipper.", "Not only have we gotten great traction on these anchor styles, but almost every fashion style, whether it\u2019s a wedge, a woven heel, or a strappy sandal, is selling well.  Shoes have been featured in our print marketing campaigns online and in many editorial credits this season.", "Our emphasis on growing this category will continue to build as we head into fall and include more dominant fashion footwear assortments in our wholesale locations as well.  We will continue to focus on building our key items, evolving our mix, and growing both AURs and overall penetration levels.", "Shifting to ecommerce, online business was strong again this quarter, with sales and traffic growing at a double digit pace through Coach.com and EFS, our factory site.  In addition, we\u2019re seeing an increasing percentage of sales and traffic coming from mobile.  Clearly this trend is representative of our consumers\u2019 shopping behaviors in this growing, digitally enabled environment, and is consistent with our increased emphasis on digital, through our own website, digital advertising, and social media.  Our strategic intent is to rapidly drive further innovation in this channel.  ", "We also remain really excited about the results we\u2019re achieving in our men\u2019s business, which is on track to grow about 50% globally this year to over $600 million.  We\u2019re experiencing success in men\u2019s across all concepts and store types, and across all geographies and channels.  In North America, men\u2019s is driving productivity in existing stores, and also represents a substantial new distribution opportunity.", "I\u2019d also like to provide a brief update on our wholesale business.  We are focused on improving our performance here, with an emphasis on growing our leather handbag and accessories business, taking advantage of our auto-replenishment program, and we\u2019ll begin execution of our shop renovation and [case line] transformation during this quarter, with significant rollout in fiscal year \u201914.", "In summary, we\u2019ll continue to drive our women\u2019s business through fashion innovation and broadening the expression of the brand through lifestyle categories.  We will leverage the opportunity in men\u2019s and evolve our store individual concepts to provide a brand-right shopping experience for our consumer, wherever she chooses to shop.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Victor for a discussion of our strategies and further opportunities for growth.", "Victor Luis", "Thanks, Mike.  Last quarter we talked about our brand transformation into a global lifestyle brand anchored in accessories.  As we build out our strategic plan, we\u2019re focusing on three key elements: product, stores, and marketing.", "To this end, over the last quarter, we made several important hires to strengthen our team and enhance the Coach experience, including Sandra Hill, EVP of women\u2019s design, with responsibility over all women\u2019s products; Zach Augustine, as EVP, global environments, who is leading initiatives across visual merchandising, architecture, and all in-store creative development; Erin Thompson, as VP, artistic director of global environments, reporting to Zach and overseeing all creative developments for windows, in-store merchandising, showrooms, and events.", "Sandra, Zach, and Erin joined a strong creative team in place, including Jeffrey Uhl, our SVP of men\u2019s design, who has been leading the creative direction for all of men\u2019s categories for both full price and factory: Javan Bunch, SVP of licensing, who is spearheading the relaunch of our footwear, and Maria Turgeon, who was recently promoted to a newly created role of SVP, women\u2019s factory, and whose new designs will be arriving in stores later this spring and summer.   ", "The creative team now in place is focused on developing and presenting a full head to toe expression of the Coach woman and man, including a focused ready to wear presentation to inspire our customers with a complete Coach point of view that is relevant to how she lives her life.  Over the next few quarters, the level of innovation across product categories will increase as we continue to add emotion to our offering and greater fashion credibility and relevance to the brand.  ", "Moving on to our distribution update, as our plans haven\u2019t changed materially, I\u2019ll be brief.  Our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10-11% in FY13.  In North America, we expect to open a few stores in the fourth quarter in addition to the 20 net openings in the first half, taking us to about 22 net stores for the year.  In total, square footage will increase about 10%.  ", "Turning to international, and starting with China, as you know we expect to open about 30 new stores this year, or at least another seven in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to about 125 locations at the end of the year.  All of these openings are planned to be dual-gender stores, due to the size of the men\u2019s opportunity.  In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 35%, and we now expect sales to total about $425 million, up from our previous guidance of at least $400 million, an increase of nearly 40% driven both by distribution and comparable location sales.  ", "In terms of our other Asian direct markets, our primary focus continues to be driving improved productivity, rather than new distribution, as we continue to invest in training, merchandising, store environments, and systems, creating a brand-right experience.  ", "In Japan, we will open seven additional locations in the fourth quarter, taking the total to 11 net new locations in FY13, most of them dedicated men\u2019s stores.  Earlier this month, we opened our ninth Japan flagship on Omotesando, which is, after Ginza, the second most important tourist shopping destination in Tokyo.  ", "In total, we expect that net square footage growth will increase by about 10% this year, compared to about 5% in FY12.  And, consistent with our strategy of directly operating select international markets, we are pleased to announce the purchase of our partner\u2019s 50% interest in our European JV, with the transaction expected to close in July.  Today, through the JV, we are operating 18 locations in the U.K. and Continental Europe.", "As you know, Europe is a large market for women\u2019s and men\u2019s luxury accessories, representing about 25% of the global category sales.  Coach\u2019s heritage, linked to New York fashion, is appealing for many Europeans, and creates a differentiated positioning compared to the traditional luxury brands.  In addition, we believe the region has significant long term potential, attracting both domestic shoppers and the international tourists.", "Finally, beyond our directly owned international businesses, we have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other countries.  We are focusing on expanding through partners in three other regions.  First, Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Chile, and Peru.  Second, other Asia-Pacific markets such as Australia, Thailand, and Indonesia, and third, in the Middle East.", "These are an addition to the significant global travel retail opportunity that continues to exist for Coach as the brand\u2019s recognition continues to grow globally.  We\u2019ve just reviewed our strategies, built upon our strong brand and business equities.  Over the long term, we have significant runway ahead of us.  At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further detail on our financials and investment plans.  Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Victor.  Lew, Mike, and Victor have just taken you through the highlights and strategies.  Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results.  ", "Our quarterly revenues increased 7%, with North America up 7% and international up 6%.  As noted, the weakening yen reduced sales growth, so in constant currency, revenues rose 10% overall, with international sales up 14%.  Net income for the quarter totaled $239 million, up 6%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.84, up 10%.  This compared to net income of $225 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.77 in the prior year\u2019s third quarter.", "For the first nine months, net sales were $3.85 billion, up 7% from the $3.61 billion reported in the first nine months of fiscal 2012.  Net income totaled $813 million, up 3% from the $787 million reported a year ago, while earnings per share rose 6% to $2.84 from $2.67.  ", "Our tax rate for the quarter was 31.3%, taking our year to date rate to the current run rate of 32.4%.  The lower than expected tax rate for FY13 is a function of the favorable mix in our countries.  ", "For the third quarter, our operating income totaled $348 million, 3% above the $337 million reported last year on a GAAP basis, while operating margin was 29.3% versus 30.4%.  During this quarter, gross profit totaled $880 million versus $818 million a year ago, an increase of 8%.", "The gross margin rate was 74.1%, up 35 basis points from last year.  As expected, our expense ratio in Q3 totaled 44.8%, compared to the 43.3% reported in the year ago quarter, reflecting the acquisition of distributors made earlier this fiscal year.  Even including these investments, we were able to gain leverage to EPS.  ", "Moving on to the balance sheet, inventory levels at the end of the quarter were $560 million, 9% above the $475 million reported at the end of last year\u2019s Q3 and more in line with sales growth.  ", "Before turning to the cash flow statement, I\u2019d like to provide some details about our new corporate headquarters, originally announced in November of 2011.  We entered into a joint venture agreement with [Related] to develop our new worldwide corporate headquarters in Manhattan in the Hudson Yards district.  Our new headquarters will allow our business units to operate under one roof, reflecting the collaborative way in which we work today.", "As detailed in our 8-K filing earlier this month, we expect to invest approximately $750 million over the next three years, or $620 million net of the proceeds from the sale of our current building.  This year, our cash outlay will be between $130 million and $160 million, depending on the progress in construction.  Of this, $30 million of capex was already included in the company\u2019s guidance.  The balance is treated as an investment in our joint venture with related.", "Moving back to the third quarter financials, cash and short-term investments stood at $928 million, as compared with $930 million a year ago.  During the first nine months, we repurchased and retired just over 7 million shares of common stock at an average price of $56.63, spending a total of $400 million.  We did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter, and therefore, at the end of the quarter, about 1.4 billion still remained on our current repurchase authorization.   ", "As noted, we increased our cash dividends by 13%, raising it to an annual rate of $1.35 per share, reflecting our commitment to return capital to shareholders balanced with our investment in the growth of the business.", "Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $209 million compared to $103 million last year during Q3.  Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $167 million versus $61 million in the same period last year.  ", "Our capex spending was $43 million versus $41 million in the same quarter a year ago.  We continue to expect that capex this year will be in the area of $250 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansions across all geographies, elevating our store environment, and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion.  As noted, this included the $30 million of capex associated with the new headquarters.  ", "Looking ahead, we\u2019re mindful of balancing the impact of the still-muted global consumer environment and challenging market dynamics in North America with our continued optimism around men\u2019s and the strong international expansion opportunities for Coach.  We also recognize the yen will be an accelerating headwind.  Therefore, the second half operating outlook provided on the January call remains the same.  ", "First, and most generally, we expect to achieve high single-digit second half sales growth, with North America fourth quarter comps about even with prior year, impacted by the Easter shift into March.  ", "Second, our second half gross margin is planned to improve modestly on a year over year basis, as channel mix and our sourcing initiatives continue to contribute to profitability.  On balance, we continue to expect gross margin to remain high at about 73% for the year.", "Third, on SG&A, as we\u2019ve noted previously, international acquisitions alone will cause our expenses to rise about 150 basis points for the year.  Fourth, therefore, taken together, we still expect an annual operating margin of about 31%, with compression from the prior year as a result of our investments.  ", "Notably, we expect our core businesses to continue to deliver leverage to EPS.  At the same time, given our international mix, we are changing our guidance and now project our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 32.5% for the year.  ", "As is our practice, we look forward to providing you with initial FY14 guidance when we report our fourth quarter results in late July.  At that time, we will also share our expectations for growth over our planning horizon as we continue to refine the roadmap for our brand transformation.  Importantly, we have the financial strength and the brand vibrancy to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.  ", "I\u2019d now like to open it up to Q&A.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.]  Our first question today is from Bob Drbul with Barclays.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays ", "I have two questions, actually.  The first one is Lew, can you talk about how you are feeling around the creative team in place, and the ability to implement the brand transformation?  And the second question I have is you mentioned some details around the innovation in handbags.  Can you just elaborate a little bit more exactly how the team is positioned to expand and create more innovation in the category over the coming quarters?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Sure.  First, as I mentioned earlier, we do have a very strong creative team in place, where we expect it to transition will be seamless.  One of the excellent aspects of where we are today is that our entire creative and business team is aligned on the transformational strategies that are underway.  We are also very focused on what we need to do from a focus and pacing perspective.  And we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to move forward as we have.  Victor and I have been working very closely with Reed to spearhead the transition and everyone is up to speed.", "In terms of our focus, as we said earlier, we began with men\u2019s.  We relaunched footwear.  And the initial results are extremely satisfying.  We are moving forward to launch a head-to-toe capsule group that will be anchored in accessories, which bridges to innovation in handbags.  One of the opportunities for Coach is to offer a more sophisticated, tailored look that will appeal to consumers who are both in our franchise as well as to our new consumers, and we will begin to see some of these styles during our holiday quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley ", "", "I\u2019m wondering, can you talk to us about your assessment of the store opportunities over the medium term in both the North American and Japanese markets?  And specifically, regarding Japan, can you talk to us about any hedging activities that you may or may not engage in with the yen falling, or if there\u2019s any expectations of price adjustments in that market, just given what we\u2019re seeing with the weakening yen?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Jane, why don\u2019t you take the second part first?", "Jane Nielsen", "Sure, why don\u2019t I take the hedge aspect of the question?  We actively hedge, overall, for transactions, so that we minimize the impact to cost of goods sold by hedging in a layered fashion every quarter so that we are protected about three quarters out to a substantial degree.  We\u2019ll continue that practice.  Really, our objective is to smooth the impact of the yen on our costs over time.  And we\u2019ve been able to successfully do that this year and we\u2019ll continue to practice layered hedging as we move forward.  ", "Michael Tucci", "Kimberly, just to clarify, are you curious in North America about, when you say store activity, is that a distribution-related question?", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley ", "Mike, just in terms of store count, are you getting to the point where you\u2019re ready to slow down the new store growth?  Or are there still pockets like, for example, men\u2019s factory outlet stores, that you\u2019re looking to continue growing, both in the mature U.S. market and the mature Japanese market?", "Michael Tucci ", "Thank you, that\u2019s helpful.  Let me take full price first, where there\u2019s an interesting inflection happening in full price today, where we have a significant amount of leasing activity happening around leases that are coming due, which provides us an opportunity for repositioning, looking at market penetration, and potential downsizing of stores in select markets.  In addition, we have significant lease rights built in, which allow us to take action, and on a select basis, underperforming stores.  ", "On the opposite end of that is an intense focus around our top 100 locations in North America, including wholesale, for repositioning, replatforming, supporting our business from a transformation standpoint.  So in full price, it\u2019s a combination of some pruning and what I would call market analysis, and then really focusing on top stores for maximum positioning and competitive positioning to support the transformation.", "On the factory side, frankly there\u2019s a lot of development happening.  There\u2019s an enormous amount of new development and there we\u2019re focused on select new market entries and new store entry, as well as maximizing the men\u2019s opportunity with some repositioning in smaller stores.  I think we\u2019ll give you a lot of detail on that when we talk about our longer term strategy in the fourth quarter call.", "Lew Frankfort ", "And Kimberly, just on Japan, quite a similar story in the sense that there is very little development taking place in full price.  Indeed, most of luxury full price distribution is through the department store channel, which is not growing, and has in fact been contracting for over a decade.  Our focus there is on men\u2019s distribution.  Given the department store distribution, our handbag distribution tends to be in women\u2019s spaces, so we have been selectively adding men\u2019s location in buildings where we already exist, leveraging the management talent and infrastructure in place.", "In terms of factory distribution, the market is pretty much saturated and mature.  There will be some select closings and openings as we evolve, but we see our focus really being on current distribution, remodeling, and continuing to drive the brand transformation through innovation in the space that we\u2019re in.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.  ", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "", " ", "Operator", "I wanted to ask about your thought process on the current pricing architecture at both full price and factory in North America.  There was a lot of buzz going around the past month or two as it looked like your factory couponing was much deeper than it was last year.  Yet your gross margins in the quarter were very healthy.  So are you price engineering for these discounts?  Or is there something else there?  How should we kind of think about that?", "Michael Tucci ", "That\u2019s a good question.  There was a lot of chatter about that.  There\u2019s a lot to it.  One, it\u2019s critical to note that we have to separate some of the tactical things we do in stores and in our marketing to drive engagement, and to drive conversion with the net margin impact.  ", "And all of our promotional strategies are built with the assortment when we set our assortments almost a year in advance, with a number of options against how we want to play it.  And so we\u2019ve gone from some discounting activity on total transactions, to a targeted promotional campaign on handbags, which had an incredible impact on mix and ticket within the factory channel.  And we\u2019ll continue to work it.  ", "What we\u2019ve found is that the factory channel expects promotional value, and we are working to nuance that and play that in the most effective way that we can.  The most important thing we can do is continue to focus on innovation there and in full price, and to deliver compelling products.  And that offers us the most pricing flexibility going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Citigroup.  And as a reminder, one question, one follow up question, please.", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup ", "", "Could you update us on the competitive environment, what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace with respect to the heightening or the latest [spots] there?  Also, we\u2019re pretty excited about the transition of watches to the fashion category.  Do you expect that your floor space commitment will increase for that category?  It feels like your press release speaks a lot to the evolution of how you think about head to toe in store.  So if you could just preview for us how we should think about the engineering of the floor space in regard to the transition, that would be helpful.", "Lew Frankfort ", "First, in terms of competition, we\u2019d rather focus on the category dynamics in terms of size.  And as I indicated earlier, the category grew high single-digits.  It\u2019s extremely vibrant, and we\u2019re participating in that growth.  And of course we need to look at our business globally and we also need to look at our men\u2019s business.  And I think the results speak for themselves.", "Relative to watches, you\u2019re correct.  We did make a strategic decision to shift watches to the much more dynamic fashion area within department stores.  And as part of that change, we are also evolving our assortment holistically so that we can offer more compelling, relevant fashion at good price points.", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup ", "And a follow up on Europe, that sounds quite constructive.  It\u2019s been not the easiest market for U.S. luxury and accessible luxury brands to penetrate.  Are there product strategies and marketing strategies that you\u2019re undertaking in order to maximize your opportunity for success in that market?", "Victor Luis", "Sure, let me touch on that.  We believe that the transformation that is going underway, and that we\u2019re executing at the moment plays right into the European consumer needs in providing a head to toe look that is relevant in today\u2019s fashion.  ", "I would just remind us that the European market is a large one, approximately 20% of the global premium market at $6.5 billion or so.  As I mentioned, today we have these 18 locations that were taken back from the JV, and we\u2019re very excited to bring them in house.  And as we have shown in the past with all of our buybacks, we\u2019ve executed effectively and are looking forward to bringing those businesses under our leadership.", "Operator", "As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question.  Our next question is from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.", "Brian Tunick - JPMorgan  ", "First, for Jane, maybe if you could just help us out on thinking about the SG&A dilution from the distributors this year.  I think you\u2019ve continued to say 150 basis points.  So I was just wondering how should we be thinking about that dilution as you lap it?  And does the U.K. acquisition you guys talked about now impact the timing?  How much should we potentially expect to see next year?  ", "And then the second question, maybe if Lew wants to talk about it, we\u2019ve had a lot of questions from investors on the balance sheet, and we\u2019re just wondering, you know, as you talk about your capex needs, can you maybe talk about your thoughts on the minimum cash position?  And as you move the company into more of a lifestyle brand, does that open up your thoughts to potentially buying versus building any skill sets the company currently doesn\u2019t have?  ", "Jane Nielsen ", "Why don\u2019t I start, just in terms of the dilution in SG&A.  We\u2019ve called out the 150 basis point impact to our SG&A margin.  So as you think about, we took on our acquisitions.  We had them evenly spaced throughout the quarter.  ", "So it\u2019s been about $100 million over the four quarters, evenly paced through the four quarters.  It was more or less dilutive, depending on the size of the quarter, but the actual dollars paced out about the same, as we moved through the quarter.  So as we come out of fiscal year \u201913, that SG&A that was a pick up from the Asian distributor acquisition will be in our base, and you should start to see a normalization of growth rates into SG&A.  ", "The transaction in Europe, we\u2019ll get back to you in the fourth quarter with more specific announcements as to impact, in conjunction with our FY14 guidance.  It\u2019s at $40 million in POS.  It\u2019s smaller than our Asia distributor acquisitions, but we will take on SG&A as we take on the European JV.", "Lew Frankfort ", "With regard to your question around volume versus building skill sets, first, we do have a very seasoned and strong team.  Our bench, both on the creative side, as well as on the retail and operating side, has experience across all of the categories that we\u2019re in today.  And in fact, we have experienced, even at POS, in most of everything that we plan to launch in holiday, our focus, it\u2019s really on augmenting our leadership team with key significant hires, which Victor mentioned earlier in the call.", "Operator", "Our next question is from [Maureen Hutchinson] with Bank of America.", "[Maureen Hutchinson] - Bank of America", "Can you comment on traffic and ticket trends in full line and factory?  And also, have you gotten the mix of logo to where you wanted it?", "Michael Tucci", "The logo opportunity for us continues to evolve.  We had a tremendous quarter in leather.  The logo trends were probably at their lowest level, and we think that\u2019s a good thing longer term, as we begin to lap that, particularly as we go into next season.  I feel very good from a positioning standpoint about our balance between logo and leather.  And I think going forward the opportunity is to [distort] leather further.  ", "In terms of traffic, what we said was, and please be mindful that we don\u2019t disaggregate metrics in detail, we did see some sequential improvement from the holiday quarter.  And one thing I want to note, and I feel good about this, we\u2019re seeing a very strong performance in our stores, both full price and factory, around key holidays.  ", "So we saw it coming out of the Christmas period, the holidays that fell into January.  We saw a very strong performance around Chinese New Year and President\u2019s Day, Easter as well.  I think that bodes well for us for Mother\u2019s Day, which is the single biggest holiday period in our stores other than Christmas.  And it\u2019s just a few weeks away.  So we want to continue to focus on maximizing opportunities around our biggest traffic periods, and hopefully that will continue to help drive productivity.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.", "Liz Dunn - Macquarie ", "", "My question is regarding the footwear business.  Can you just talk about how that business will build in your direct channel over the next couple of quarters?  And how that should impact the margin structure, both in the near term and longer term?  And then as a follow up to I think it was Brian\u2019s question, would you ever consider specifically buying the footwear business back in?", "Michael Tucci", "In terms of of positioning, footwear, we\u2019re just getting started on it.  To get some scope on this, I believe that footwear represents the single largest opportunity that we have in front of us in women\u2019s.  It reminds me a little bit of the early days when we started with our men\u2019s strategy.  ", "We\u2019re focused today on setting the assortments, positioning the assortments properly in terms of size of assortment and offer and pricing.  We feel good about our store count in North America at about 175 stores.  We\u2019re beginning to dabble with the idea of what footwear might look like in the factory channel, and you\u2019ll see us play there in future.  ", "And I actually believe that from an assortment and positioning standpoint, the fall assortment that we launch is truly stronger than what we have today.  It\u2019s an assortment that was built with more time, with Javan and our design team, and we will have the benefit of further in-store execution, [unintelligible] wrap removal, mobile POS, [seeding], presentation, and most importantly, more time with selling confidence and service as we launch that.  ", "So early days.  We\u2019re committed to it.  And we\u2019ll continue to focus on it as a growth category.", "Lew Frankfort ", "With regard to our margin structure, we don\u2019t believe that our overall margin will change materially from growth in our footwear business.  We do believe it will help grow the overall business, and grow overall profitability.", "With regard to future plans, we have a great partnership with our licensing partner and our contract doesn\u2019t expire for another two years.", "Operator", "The next question is from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.  ", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "", "Can you talk about the key drivers in men\u2019s?  I always think about wallets and belts, but can you talk about the balance with bags, briefcases, totes, outerwear?  How much are those categories as a percentage to the total?  And how big could this business be over the next, say, three to five years?", "Victor Luis", "The business, we believe, in the medium term, is a billion dollar global opportunity.  And the shifts that we\u2019re seeing globally is the growth in the bag business.  It\u2019s slightly different, of course, by market, in terms of attitude, but we are also seeing a very strong trend in certain key locations in our outerwear and our team is also today developing other categories more fully.  Of course, there\u2019s opportunity in tech, small gifts, the holiday season, but in the quarters ahead we will also be looking at the footwear opportunity, just as we are in the women\u2019s space.", "", "Operator", "The next question is from Jennifer Davis with Lazard Capital Markets.  ", "Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets", "", "First question and then a follow up.  How much time has Reed spent, I guess in the last year or so, on the Coach brand versus his own brand, or his own line?  And then could you talk a little bit about the talent underneath him?  ", "And then a follow up, I guess, on apparel.  Just wondering, what should we expect in the holiday quarter?  Should we expect about a rack out there in the stores?  A couple of racks?  Are you planning on putting dressing rooms in the stores that are going to be a relatively small piece of the total?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Reed has been careful to balance his time, so that both Coach and RK can benefit from his considerable talents.  A good part of Reed\u2019s effort and my efforts, and more recently Victor\u2019s, has been to forge a creative team that can work collaboratively and who are empowered, and we have been working very closely with that team and do believe, as I said earlier, that we\u2019re in a very strong position to move forward without any disruption.", "Relative to ready to wear, I think the context you really need to think about is that we\u2019re not looking to sell tops and bottoms.  This is not a full launch into ready to wear.  This is a very careful, methodical approach to create a story of who the Coach woman is.  ", "And our intention in all of our lead stores is to provide a capital group of ready to wear with our outerwear, and it\u2019s going to be a tiered structure.  There will be a small number of stores that will carry ready to wear, who have dressing rooms.  We are contemplating adding a small number of dressing rooms.  ", "A much larger number of stores will be carrying key iconic items, led by accessories, shoes, bags, outerwear.  And in China, there\u2019s an opportunity that\u2019s much larger, where we already have outerwear representing over 20% of our sales in key stores.  ", "Operator", "The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group ", "", "Lew, as you think about the talent that remains to be added, characteristics that you\u2019re seeking in the successor to Reed, given that it\u2019s a different place and time now from what the business was 16 years ago?  And then also, as you see the men\u2019s opportunity, margin performance in the U.S. and China, is it where you wanted it to be now?  And how do you see it moving forward?", "Lew Frankfort ", "With regard to the second part of your question, did you say margin performance?", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group ", "Yes, exactly.", "Lew Frankfort ", "On margin, it\u2019s exactly where we would like it to be.  Men\u2019s is at parity with women\u2019s.  In terms of Reed\u2019s successor, obviously, as you say, it\u2019s a different point in time.  We\u2019re early in our search.  We are looking for someone who will be able to oversee the global men\u2019s and women\u2019s design effort and help to spearhead our creative functions.  But again, depending on the person that we find, we\u2019ll adjust the organizational structure.  We are, of course, looking for someone who is highly collaborative, who works across different channels, different geographies, who will be partnering with our very strong team.  ", "Operator", "The next question is from Antoine Belge with HSBC.", "Antoine Belge - HSBC", "Just one question on China.  Can you maybe provide a little bit of color about the most recent trend there [unintelligible] some of your European competitors have been experiencing a slowdown there\u2019s.  Are you benefitting from that?  And are you actually targeting a different customer base for the time being?", "Michael Tucci ", "I would say that as you have heard, we\u2019ve seen really no visible change in our trend.  We continue to be focused on our distribution growth as well as driving efficiency in our stores.  We have a very experienced and increasingly seasoned team on the ground.  And we\u2019re very, very pleased with the repurchase intent that we\u2019re seeing with consumers.  ", "Our strategy is obviously very different than the traditional European luxury brands who are much more focused on exclusivity.  Coach is much more focused on being a selective brand and we believe the opportunity is tremendous, and being in only today 41 cities, out of what the Economic Intelligence Unit is telling us is 210 cities with a population of a million or more, in most recent data, gives us a tremendous confidence on the opportunity that lies ahead.  We truly believe it is still very much boundless.", "And of course, we\u2019re seeing tremendous benefits from our investments in China, not only in China, but indeed in almost every single market where we have retail today.  The impact of these Chinese consumers, and the Chinese tourist, is a growing one.", "Operator", "Thank you.  I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you all for joining us today.  Now I\u2019d like to turn it back to Lew for some closing comments.  Lew?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Obviously there\u2019s a lot going on here at Coach.  I think you heard a lot of enthusiasm from myself and our team.  We are at an exciting juncture.  We\u2019re galvanized towards what we need to do, and we\u2019re very enthusiastic about our long term opportunities.  So I wish you all a good day.  Thank you.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thanks you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly and fiscal year end results are Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO, Victor Luis, Coach\u2019s President and Chief Commercial Officer and Jane Nielsen, --Coach's CFO.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal year. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now, let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort and Victor Luis will provide C results and will also discuss our overarching strategy. Jane Nielsen will continue with details on financial and operational results for the quarter and in the year along with our outlook for FY 14. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session. This Q&A session will end shortly before 09.30 am. Lew will then conclude with some brief summary of comments. I'd now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman and CEO.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thanks Andrea and welcome everyone. We shared a lot of news in our press release this morning and we understand that it will take some time to digest. This year has obviously been unique and we have recognized all that is -- that\u2019s not been business as usual. Most importantly, we have taken significant steps to help reposition the company to return to superior growth rates while maintaining outstanding profitability levels. Our focus and priority is on the brand and driving its relevance to reinforce our customer\u2019s emotional connection to Coach notably in North America. We have a proven group of Coach Leaders to execute our transformation strategy. This is a multiyear journey and we\u2019re excited about the future, building upon our strong brand and business equities with an exceptional team at the helm. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Mike and Jerry for their important contributions in building Coach into a leading international accessories brand. The entire Coach team has great admiration and respect for their significant accomplishments and we wish them the best. And now to our results and outlook.", "During the fourth quarter we approached double digit growth in constant currency and continued to gain overall traction on our key strategies supporting our transformation. We generated strong international results, leveraged the men\u2019s opportunity globally, strengthened our digital capabilities and drove excellent results in the re-launch of footwear. While we maintained our outstanding profitability levels, we were not satisfied with our performance in the women\u2019s handbag and accessories category in North America. ", "Moving on to some key highlights of our quarter and fiscal year. Our performance in FY\u201913 was highlighted by increases of 7% in revenues, a 2% rise in operating income and 6% in earnings per share. It was a year of many milestones. First, we continued to leverage the international opportunities for Coach, growing organically through distribution and productivity while accelerating the acquisition of international retail businesses to our direct control. In China, Coach sales exceeded $430 million, up 40% ending the year with about a 125 locations including over 100 on the Mainland.", "Second, our men\u2019s business grew almost 50% in FY13 to about $600 million as we continued to open dedicated standalone and dual gender locations globally while also rolling out a broader expression of men\u2019s through additional North American retail stores. Third, we successfully expanded our digital initiatives, driving double digit online sales growth while also exploring new ways to engage with our consumer and grow our database reflecting, shifting, shopping preferences. Fourth, we increased our quarterly dividend by 13%, demonstrating our financial strength, cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholder return and confidence in the future. And fifth and most importantly we embarked on our journey to transform Coach into a global luxury lifestyle brand building upon our leadership position in accessories. ", "Some key fourth quarter metrics were. First, net sales totaled $1.22 billion, an increase of 6%. On the constant currency basis, sales rose 9% for the quarter. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.89, up 3% from $0.86 in the prior year.", "Third, North American sales increased 6% to $825 million from $781 million last year with direct sales up 5% and comparable store sales down 1.7%.", "And fourth, international sales increased 7% to $386 million from $362 million last year, driven in part by a 35% gain in sales in China with a continuation of double digit comps. On the constant currency basis, international sales rose 17%. Most broadly we were also very pleased with profitability levels in both the quarter and year.", "Turning to global distribution, during the fourth quarter we opened three new North American retail stores and closed four others. We also opened two factory stores including one dedicated men store. At the end of FY \u201813, there were 351 full price and 193 factory stores in operation in North America. Total square footage grew 11% for the year.", "Moving to China, during the quarter we added eight new locations on the Mainland, bringing the total to a 126 Coach locations in China including 108 locations on the Mainland and 47 cities. In aggregate, there was an increase of 30 net new locations for the fiscal year or square footage increase of 33%.", " ", "In Japan, seven locations were added during the quarter, bringing the total to 198 with 24 standalone full price stores including nine flagships, 124 shop-in-shops, 43 factory stores and seven distributor-operated wholesale locations. In total, a net of 11 locations were added in Japan during FY \u201913 yielding total square footage growth of about 9%. We also directly operate 92 locations in Asia comprised of 48 in Korea, 27 in Taiwan, 10 in Malaysia and seven in Singapore.", "Moving on to sales and productivity, starting in North America, our total revenues rose 6% for the quarter with our directly operated businesses up 5% on a 1.7% comparable store sales decrease, due in part to the Easter shift which we called out as a benefit to last quarter. While men\u2019s and our newly relaunched footwear categories performed well. As I mentioned, we were disappointed by our overall performance in women\u2019s bags.", "More generally, internet sales and traffic continued up double-digit consistent with consumers shifting shopping preferences, while in-store trends notably traffic were weak. On these lower traffic levels in-store conversion was up and transaction side fell.", "In department stores, sales trends at POS were slightly above last year, while shipments into this channel also rose. Overall, we estimate that growth in the addressable women\u2019s North American handbag and accessory category remained strong rising low double digits in fiscal 2013 to about $12 billion as bags and accessories continue to represent a growing portion of our wardrobe spend.", "The combined North American premium women\u2019s and men\u2019s market rose about 15% in FY \u201913 to about $11 billion. Coach continued to participate in a market growth with our own direct channels posting solid gains for the year up 6% as mentioned with the combined market share of about 30%.", "As we\u2019ve discussed, we\u2019re also continuing to drive our men\u2019s business globally to new standalone and dual gender of side-by-side stores and by dedicating more space for broader men\u2019s assortment in existing retail stores. In FY \u201913, Coach\u2019s sales of men\u2019s bags and accessories increased 50% in North America, driving the overall men's premium category which grew 25% to about $1 billion.", "Looking ahead, we remain excited about the prospects to our global men\u2019s business where we believe we can reach $1 million in sales in three years from the $600 million achieved last year.", "I'd now like to turn it over to Victor to discuss international sales, product performance this quarter, as well as to give you an update on our progress, on transformation and what you can expect in FY \u201914. Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Thanks, Lew. Starting with international, which today represents about a third of Coach's business, sales rose 7% in the fourth quarter or 17% on the constant currency basis, consistent with prior quarter and full year trends.", "During the quarter, China sales rose about 35% from prior year, fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales. As Lew noted upfront, this took our full year sales to over $430 million, up 40%.", "Clearly, the Chinese consumer continues to embrace Coach, as repurchase intent has remained high at over 80% among existing consumers. This is also evident by the increasing contribution of the Chinese tourist to our global sales.", "Our other Asia direct businesses outside of Japan and China, Korea, Taiwan Malaysia and Singapore also posted strong aggregate growth in the quarter and the year. In total, they benefited from the retail step up from the prior year from Malaysia and Korea, which were acquired in early FY \u201913. It\u2019s important to note that their combined POS sales also rose at a high single-digit rate for the quarter and a double-digit rate for the year. As noted, for the quarter, we posted a 4% increase in local currency in Japan despite the top compare, while dollar sales declined 15% reflecting the weaker Yen. ", "Similarly, for the year, sales were essentially even with prior year on a constant currency basis and down 9% in dollars. Moving on to product, Legacy and Madison remained our key collections in the fourth quarter with new silhouettes and on trend colors introduced throughout the period. The Madison Phoebe Shoulder Bag launched at the end of the March in North America and later globally was particularly successful. We also featured a new group of Satchels and Totes across multiple collections in June. ", "Looking forward, we\u2019re excited about the re-launch of Madison this quarter, which follows the same design aesthetic as Phoebe with clean sophisticated lines, feminine details, Rich leathers, and understated branding.", "More generally, we saw a continuation of trends favoring leather hand bags across all price segments. In particular, we enjoyed healthy year-over-year sales increases in small bags and the above 400 segments continued to perform well at about 16% of handbags. Our overall handbag penetration was even for last year. And I\u2019d be remiss not to mention that this distinct newness in our factory channel where new designs are beginning to arrive in stores and online. Metro a great Tote group was a winner of late this spring and Park a fashionable leather based collection has just hit the stores and has been very well received. In fact, by the end of Q1, about 80% to 85% of our factory handbags will be new, innovative factory exclusives. ", "Turning to North America\u2019s department stores, we are committed to growing this business and positioning Coach to win. We\u2019re focused on improving performance with an emphasis in growing our leather handbag and accessories business taking advantage of our auto replenishment program and executing our new shop renovation and case line transformation with significant roll out this year. We\u2019re also looking at incremental new door distribution opportunities with current partners. ", "I\u2019ll now give you an update on our footwear business, which as you know, we re-launched this spring in over 170 retail stores in North America with the objective of elevating our products proposition. Supporting Coach as a lifestyle brand and reinforcing our fashion credibility. The collection featuring great ballet flats, driving moccasins, fashion wedges, heels and on-trend casual style has been very well received by consumers. In fact, footwear in these locations went to almost 12% of the business immediately and stayed up the level for the fourth quarter versus about 7% in the year ago quarter positively impacting productivity in these stores. ", "We\u2019re focused in building our market share within this fragmented $20 billion global category. This fall we\u2019ll include more dominant fashion footwear assortments in our international and wholesale locations and continue to focus in building our key items. We\u2019re evolving our mix and growing both AUR\u2019s and overall penetration levels across all of our businesses. Over the next few quarters the level of innovation across all products categories will continue to increase, adding emotion while strengthening fashion credibility and relevance for the brand. ", "This will be most notable in the holiday quarter with the arrival what we\u2019re calling Capsule a curetted product assortments across categories focused on key items in bags, foot wear and outerwear. This Capsule collection will support our lifestyle imagery and to be available in select locations globally. At the same time, we\u2019re enhancing our store environment across all channels and developing innovative marketing campaigns to communicate a more aspirational and consistent brand story reinforcing the bond with our existing consumers while driving new customer engagement globally. Our intent is to drive brand relevance, building on our leadership position in accessories. ", "Moving on to e-commerce as mentioned our North American online business was strong again this quarter with sales and traffic growing at a double digit pace with an increasing penetration coming from mobile and tablet. Additionally, we have been extremely pleased with our website evolution earlier this month as we improved the functionality and upgraded the look and feel of Coach.com across all devices.", "Earlier this year, we talked about our brand transformation into a global lifestyle brand anchored in accessories. As we have built out our strategic plan, we have focused on three key elements: product, stores and marketing.", "To this end, we\u2019ve made several important hires to strengthen our team and enhance the Coach experience. Importantly and most recently, we announced that Stuart Vevers will be joining Coach as Executive Creative Director in September and will be responsible for leading all creative aspects of the Coach brand, including women\u2019s and men\u2019s design, brand imagery and store environments.", "Stuart\u2019s appointment marks an important milestone in our transformation and we\u2019re extremely pleased that he will be leading our strong creative team already in place. His depth and breadth of experience will be an invaluable asset to the business in general and the design team in particular as we continue to evolve.", "I\u2019m confident that his creative expertise with some of the world\u2019s leading leather goods brands will enable him to draw upon Coach\u2019s rich heritage to create innovative product and brand imagery, elevating the customer experience and creating a fuller expression of the brand. And today we announced the reorganization primarily within the North America leadership team to enhance focus and drive execution in the company's largest market.", "Most of you know, Coach Veteran, Francine Della Badia, who is currently the EVP, responsible for all North America Retail Merchandising, Planning and Allocation as well as Coach\u2019s Global Men\u2019s and Factory merchandising. She is succeeding Mike as President, North America Retail.", "Longtime Coach leader, David Duplantis, EVP, Digital Marketing, is taking on the new role as President of Global Digital and Customer Experience. Javan Bunch, SVP Of Licensing, who has spearheaded our footwear relaunch, will assume the expanded role of SVP and President, North America Wholesale and Licensed Categories, reporting into Todd Kahn, our General Counsel in his expanded role as Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs.", "In addition, Ian Bickley, President, Coach International, is expanding his role to take on responsibility to include all international direct retail businesses as President, International Group. Finally, Stephanie Stahl, currently Senior Vice President, Strategy and Consumer Insights, is taking on an expanded role as Executive Vice President, Marketing and Strategy. Fran, David, Todd, Ian and Stephanie will report to me in their expanded roles.", "As Lew mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we took significant steps to set the foundation for return to strong growth by streamlining the business, committing to additional brand investments and forging the next group of Coach leaders to drive our transformation.", "As we enter FY \u201814, our strategic focus remains on the four pillars of growth we have previously shared. First and most broadly, growing our business in North America and globally by transforming into a global lifestyle brand; second, leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses; third, tapping into the large and growing men's accessory category which I\u2019ve already touched on; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world.", "Starting with distribution, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 9% in FY \u201814 compared to 11% in FY \u201813. Beginning in North America, as noted we are primarily focused on elevating our retail environment and replatforming our stores to showcase the full breadth of Coach\u2019s lifestyle categories.", "In Full Price, where we have a significant number of leases coming due, we're taking the opportunity to streamline our store base and reposition while at the same time reviewing expansion and relocation opportunities and capture men\u2019s footwear and outerwear businesses. ", "In the North America factory channel, where there is an enormous amounts of new real estate development, we\u2019re focused on select new market entry as well as capitalizing men\u2019s opportunity with some repositioning in smaller stores. Balancing these factors, we will open about 20 new stores in FY \u201814, including two new full priced locations and at least 15 factory outlets most of which will be dual gender stores with one free standing men\u2019s store planned as well. ", "In addition, we\u2019ve planned to close 16 full price locations as we streamline our store base by closing less productive units. Importantly, we are also expanding about 20 locations, seven full price and about 13 factory to accommodate the full build out of our dual gender presentation by adding men\u2019s to our existing stores. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 7% this year driven by the net of these activities versus about 10% in FY13. ", "Turning to China, in FY \u201914, we again expect to open about 30 new stores, all dual genders bringing the total to about 155 at the end of the year. In total, square footage in China is expected to grow about 25% in FY\u201914. We expect sales to total about $530 million driven by both distribution and double digit comparable location sales. In terms of our other direct Asia markets of Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore our primary focus remains productivity as we\u2019ve invested in training, merchandising, store environments and systems creating a brand right experience. In Japan, during FY\u201914 we expect to open about five to ten net new locations most of them dedicated men\u2019s stores. In total, we expect net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 3% this year.", "As discussed in our release, in early July we completed the repurchase of our partners\u201950% interest in our European JV. In addition, also in July, we transitioned the two (inaudible) locations to our direct control. Therefore today, we operate 20 locations across the U.K, France, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Germany. ", "As a reminder, Coach\u2019s annual sales at retail in Europe are approximately $40 million with the vast majority represented by the stores that are now directly operated as retail businesses. As you know, Europe is a large market for women\u2019s and men\u2019s luxury accessories, representing about 20% of the global category sales. We believe the region have significant long-term potential for Coach, attracting both domestic shoppers and the international tourists. It\u2019s important to note that was in bags and accessories accessible luxury is growing rapidly and as we have proven with our other directly operated businesses, we plan to play a leadership role in the development of this market segment. ", "Further, Coach\u2019s heritage linked to New York fashion as appealing for many Europeans and creates a differentiated positioning compared to the traditional luxury brands. Moving forward, we expect to swiftly increase our distribution primarily to wholesale locations and key retail stores. All together, we expect to open approximately 70 wholesale and ten retail locations across the U.K and Europe in FY\u201914.", "Finally, beyond our directly owned international businesses, we have significant and growing distributor run businesses in other countries. We\u2019re focusing on expanding through partners in these other regions. First, Latin America including Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Chile and Peru.", "Second and other Asia-Pacific market such as Australia, Thailand and Indonesia and third in the Middle East. These are in addition to the significant global travel retail opportunity that Lew mentioned earlier and continues to exist for Coach as the brands recognitions continues to grow globally.", "I have just reviewed our strategies to drive growth while taking steps to streamline our fleet and maximize productivity in North America. At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Niel, our CFO for further details on our financials. Jane?", "Jane Niel", "Thanks, Victor. Lew and Victor have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year results.", "Our quarterly revenues increased 6% with North America up 6% and International up 7%. As noted, on a constant currency basis, revenues rose 9% overall, international sales up 17%. For the fiscal year, sales rose 7% totaling $5.08 billion with North America up 5% and International up 10%. On a constant currency basis, total sales rose 8% for the year with International sales up 15%.", "Excluding unusual items, net income for the quarter totaled $254 million, up 1% with earnings per diluted share of $0.89, up 3%. This compared to net income of $251 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.86 in the prior year's fourth quarter.", "For the quarter, operating income totaled $371 million essentially even with the year ago period on a non-GAAP basis while operating margin was 30.3% versus 32.1%. During the quarter, gross profit rose 6% to $892 million from $838 million reported a year ago, while gross margin was 73%, an increase of 40 basis points versus year ago primarily due to sourcing cost improvements.", "SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 42.6% compared to the 40.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. For the full year FY '13, operating income totaled $1.58 billion on a non-GAAP basis, 2% above the $1.55 billion reported in the year-ago period. Also on a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was 31.1% versus 32.6% last year.", "During the year, gross profit rose 7% to $3.7 billion from $3.47 billion a year ago. The gross margin rate was 73%, up 20 basis points versus a year ago and in line with our guidance. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales totaled 41.9% compared to 40.2% reported in fiscal FY \u201812.", "As I turn to GAAP metrics, let me recap the unusual items. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012, we recorded favorable tax settlements and made charitable contributions which precisely offset the benefit of the tax settlements to net income and earnings per share in both these periods. As noted in our press release, during the fourth quarter of FY '13 we recorded charges of $53 million for unusual items.", "These consisted primarily of corporate restructuring, severance related expenses, impairment charges related to retail stores, as well as the write-down of a small amount of inventory. These steps include a reduction in corporate staffing levels with an elimination of over 200 jobs globally. And in aggregate, these actions increased our SG&A expense by $48 million and cost of sales by $5 million in the period negatively impacting earnings by $33 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share.", "Separately, as you saw in the press release this morning, we did announce that we\u2019ve entered into a binding agreement to sell the Reed Krakoff to a group led by Reed. The sale was anticipated to close in the first quarter of FY \u201914 and Reed will depart the company upon the sale of the business. ", "Including charges, net income for the fourth quarter totaled, $221million with earnings per diluted share of $0.78 bringing total year net income to $1.03 billion and earnings per share of $3.61. Taken together, these restructuring actions will streamline our business, drive efficiencies and leverage our technology in global capabilities. In addition, these savings will fund key initiatives related to our European acquisition and our transformation. Notably, an increase in marketing spend around brand development. Importantly, we believe they will have a one-year payback and result in savings of over $50 million annually. ", "Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory levels at quarter end were $525 million, up 4% from FY \u201912 year end. Cash and short term investments stood at $1.1 billion, 24% above $917 million a year ago. During physical year 2013, we repurchased and retired over $7 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $56.61, spending a total of $400 million. At the end of the year, approximately $1.4 billion remained under the company\u2019s current repurchase authorization.", "As noted last quarter, we increased our cash dividend by 13%, raising it to an annual rates of $1.35 per share, reflecting our commitment to return capital to shareholders, balance with our investment in growth of the business. ", "Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $375 million compared to $283 million compared last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $293 million versus $210 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $81 million versus $73 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "For the full physical 2013, net cash from operating activities was $1.4 billion, compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal \u201913 was an inflow of $1.2 billion versus $1.0 billion in fiscal year \u201912. Capital spending totaled $241 million for the year compared to $184 million in the prior year. It\u2019s important to note that based on our current plans for FY \u201914, we expect CapEx for the next year to be up in the area of $280 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansions across all our geographies elevating our store environments within our existing store and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable global expansion. ", "Consistent with our practice, over the past several years, we will not be giving specific guidance for FY \u201914. As you know, we are focused on driving sustainable long term growth against the healthy and attractive brand propositions. The restructuring charges we reported today will allow us to align our resources for maximum impact, while effectively managing our expense ratio. ", "As you think about 2014, keep the following in mind. While we are enthusiastic about early iterations of our transition to a life style brand, which will begin to be seen during this holiday season, we recognize that a full reflection of this positioning is part of a multi-year journey. Therefore, we are not building in an improvement from the negative low single digit Q4 North American comp run rate into out FY \u201914 plans at this time. ", "We expect to deliver mid-single digit sales growth in constant currency. Assuming the Yen at close to 100, this would equate to low-to-mid-single digit in dollars with currency another factor in the first half.", "Gross margin is projected at 71% to 72% for the year. The expected decline versus prior year primarily reflect currency notably the weaker yen, rising labor cost, especially in the second half, as well as inventory amortization from the JV acquisition in Coach Europe.", "SG&A expenses are expected to grow in line with sales. Increased investments in Europe, marketing and other brand transformation initiatives are expected to be funded by the restructuring actions. Taken together, we would expect operating margin to remain high at about 30%.", "And finally, our tax rate is expected to be in the area of 33% for the year. In terms of how the quarters layout, there will be puts and takes through the year. Looking at overall topline growth, the first half and especially the first quarter will be most impacted by the yen.", "Regarding our balance sheet, cash flow and capital allocation, we continue to have a strong balance sheet and very healthy operating free cash flow of over $1 billion annually. We will continue to prudently invest in the growth of our business, while also returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "We expect that dividend growth over time will be at least in line with net income growth and that share repurchases will be executed opportunistically based on our outlook on the capital needs of the business and liquidity.", "Our current FY 2014 outlook reflects approximately $700 million in share repurchases, approximately equivalent to our prior three-year average. Most importantly, our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we\u2019re in a position to invest in our brand while continuing to return capital to shareholders.", "I\u2019d now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question today is from Bob Drbul with Barclays.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays", "Hi. Good morning.", "Jane Nielsen", "Good morning.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays", "I guess, Victor, I have a question for you. In terms of all of the management appointment and some of the departures this morning, is the team now complete? Are there any other major hirings that you think you need to do, how should we think about it from that perspective?", "Victor Luis", "Thanks Bob. I would say that certainly the majority of the team is complete, and you have heard this morning, it really is leveraging the very deep bench that we have. We are at the moment looking for and recruiting for a replacement for Jerry as COO and that is a major appointment outstanding.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays", "Okay. And then, I just have one follow-up question and it is, can you talk a little bit about the capital allocation, I mean, Jane, and whether the company would consider an acquisition at this point to drive growth?", "Jane Nielsen", "Sure, Bob. As I just said, our long-term and long-standing commitment is to growth and creating shareholder value. We\u2019ve got a strong balance sheet and a great cash flow in our business, but our priorities for cash are first and foremost to invest in the growth of our business. Our strong ROIC and discipline in deploying capital creates significant value for our shareholders.", "I would say, secondly, we are open on a selective and opportunistic basis to making value creating acquisitions that would build platforms for long-term growth. We\u2019d be open to a deal that would create leverage for our global infrastructure, our organization capabilities, and our operating strength.", "And then, finally, as always, we\u2019re committed to returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. As we -- as I just mentioned, we\u2019d expect our dividend to grow at least in line with net income growth, and we\u2019ll execute share repurchases opportunistically this year expecting to return to that $700 million level where we\u2019ve been for the last three years or so.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Hello, you guys there?", "Jane Nielsen", "Yeah. Please go ahead.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my question. I guess my question is about the store streamlining -- the full-price store streamlining in the U.S., the sixteen doors you plan to close in North America this year. Are any of those doors losing money or is there anything specific about those locations, and maybe could you comment on the margin implications there as well as you streamline that part of the business?", "Unidentified Participant", "Okay, well the first, calling [stocks] (ph) from our fleet is routine, because populations might make people move. The second -- each of the stores that we selected are stores in catchment areas as where another Coach store is in immediate proximity, and these stores are \u2013 were at the bottom of our performance hurdle with only modest four wall contribution. ", "Lew Frankfort", "Yes, I just have one another comment on that. The stores that we closed were at the end of their lease, and so we chose opportunistically to close those stores at the end of a lease action.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "It\u2019s okay, great, and then a quick follow-up on -- could you maybe comment a little more on the wholesale opportunity that you mentioned here in North America, maybe how many doors -- how many US stores are you currently in, how many shop transformations have you identified, and maybe could you size that opportunity?", "Lew Frankfort", "Well, first for context, we are in about 1000 locations, and there are a substantial additional number of locations that we think are appropriate for Coach where our consumers shop. We\u2019re contemplating opening about 100 additional locations this year. In terms of our wholesale business overall, it\u2019s a very sharp focus for us, and we are looking to open about 20 shops or rather I should say where we\u2019re renovating about 20 shops before the holiday and another 30 after Christmas. Beyond that, we\u2019re moving to open case line where we have about, I believe about 20 locations today with open case line, and we\u2019re moving to about 300 locations in open case line. We\u2019re excited about the appointment of Jason Bunch, as noted. He has spearheaded the re-launch of our footwear, proven merchant, and very versatile up in that channel. So, overall we\u2019re very enthusiastic, so when we talk about our case line, we\u2019re moving to actually open sell from case line to be more precise. ", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Okay, great. Good luck.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Due to the number of questions in the queue, we do ask that you limit your request to one question per request. The next question is from Oliver Chen with Citigroup. ", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup", "Hi, guys. Thanks. Regarding your plans and your stated plans to intensify North America and your performance in women\u2019s handbags, could you just articulate your average unit retail strategy and where you feel comfortable with the price points in the future versus currently, and how that portfolio may evolve in terms of how that may impact overall AUR there, thanks?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Sure, first for a context, when we talk about our women\u2019s handbag and accessories business in North America, it should be noted that we\u2019ve been challenged in the global portion of our business only. Our leather business is extremely healthy and robust. And as we move into this fiscal year as Victor mentioned both on the factory side and on the full price side, we\u2019re focusing primarily on leather-based collections and CAPSULE is also going to provide us with an additional group of what we would call aspirational and more sophisticated products. Overall, our [AGT] is expected to be about the same, and the average handbag we\u2019re looking to be slightly up in the neighborhood of $300, that\u2019s somewhat higher.", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup", "Thank you. Good luck.", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from David Schick with Stifel. Mr. Schick, please check your mute button.", "David Schick - Stifel", "Hi. Good morning. Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning, David.", "David Schick - Stifel", "I just wrapped up with the mute button on. Could you talk about the online trends both the business you\u2019re seeing, any engagement -- any engagement stats that you\u2019d care to share before and since the re-platforming that you\u2019ve done? Thank you.", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. Actually, we are just beginning our second month, so everything we say is based on pretty much the last 30 days, and we\u2019re pleased with the improvements. We made changes in a variety of areas; first, we have moved to horizontal navigation. But we have elevated photography which does include on-figure handbag shops, stronger product pages, and the alike, and what we\u2019re finding is an overall increase in demand. We do have a reduced bounce rate and improve conversion rate. And we are also finding that a greater portion of people are engaging with mobile and tablets just because it\u2019s easier to navigate. So net-net, we\u2019re very pleased, and as you know today that the digital world is more in a constant evolution.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Hi, everybody. Could you talk about -- actually on the digital subject, your digital efforts outside the United States and then elaborate a little bit on the travel retail opportunity? And then lastly, just could talk about the performance of footwear in stores that had product both in North America and Asia?", "Lew Frankfort", "Sure. How are you, Barbara? Thank you for your continued interest in our international business as we can always count on you. In terms of, first, I\u2019ll start with your last section which is footwear. We have been very pleased with the initial rollout this past quarter here in North America, whereas I mentioned in our speakers\u2019 notes, we\u2019re seeing penetration really from the start of the launch at 12% compared to 7% last year.", "Some great news in further \u2013 a little bit more texture is that we\u2019ve seen the AUR increase 20% year-over-year as we\u2019ve move to much more of a fashion-based collection from traditional sneaker and moccasin-based business that we were in the past. So that points to really promising news moving forward.", "In addition, internationally, really the launch is taking place in the month of September as we\u2019ve been gearing up with the international last, and so we\u2019re really excited about that, some initial tests in Japan and in China in very select doors points to also very promising direction there, so we\u2019re very excited.", "In terms of digital internationally; we have, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, a pretty robust business in Japan and that is one of our leading doors as it is here in North America, and we\u2019re really leveraging a lot of the learnings that our North American digital team has been taking into the channel here and leveraging them in Japan quite effectively.", "As you know in China, very young business, we\u2019re just about to comp our first year, and there we are very excited because we are seeing distribution, whereas today we have doors in 47 cities, we\u2019re seeing distribution in I believe now over 110 cities. It is giving us very good indication of the opportunities outside of locations where we exist today.", "We are seeing a consumer that is a little bit more youthful, younger than the traditional consumer in our stores, and even seeing categories such as jewelry doing better online that we have not seen in our stores. So, a lot of learning that we are leveraging in the quarters ahead. I\u2019m especially excited about a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing internationally and engaging with the consumer through social media, whether it\u2019s in Japan, Korea through Facebook where we\u2019ve just started, and in China especially through Sina Weibo where we have consistently been the number one international fashion brand there approaching now 700,000 fans online, which is a very strong point of engagement between ourselves and our consumers. In terms of the international tourists, there is a lot of puts and takes there of course as our awareness grows globally. We begin to see different tourist opportunities. I would say that the most recent trends point of course to the continued very strong growth of the Chinese tourists, which is a very major part of our business now outside of Mainland, China, of course across Asia, here in the U.S and as well in our European capital flagships. We have seen a little bit of a downshift in the Japanese tourists. This is of course driven more by the impact of the yen as the Japanese consumer has decided to shop more at home, and now we\u2019re seeing the most recent trends are very promising and pointing to increasing flows of tourists from Indonesia and Thailand where we are growing our businesses through very good domestic partners and slowly but surely beginning to see our Brazilian tourist business also pick up, especially in the Miami area and here in New York city.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Well, okay great thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Brian Tunick of JPMorgan.", "Brian Tunick - JPMorgan", "Thanks and good morning.", "", "Lew Frankfort ", "Good morning Brian.", "", "Brian Tunick - JPMorgan", "Guys, just hoping we could tie back the negative comp guidance for the upcoming year with some of the comments you guys have been making about the enthusiasm around the product launches, you know the impact of comp on men\u2019s and footwear, the increased marketing spend, so just hoping you guys could talk about what kind of comp maybe difference that you saw between the factory channel and full price, and are you expecting both channels to be negative low singles in the upcoming year, thanks very much.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "Well first, Brian as you know, we do not disaggregate comps. We can tell you that the trends are similar in terms of improved conversion in both channels on (inaudible). The reality is that, we do see this as a multi-year journey, and while we\u2019re very sensitive as to quarter-to-quarter trend, we\u2019re taking the point of view that until we actually experience traction within our stores, we\u2019re not going to forecast it and that\u2019s our tradition. Anything else, Brian?", "", "Operator", "Thank you, the next question is from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.", "", "Liz Dunn - Macquarie", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. My question relates to sort of the North American stores plans, what is the optimal footprint that includes footwear, like how much square footage do you have to add to the stores and what else might your plans entail in moving from kind of what I think of as sort of pristine box, it\u2019s very efficient at selling handbags to something that maybe drives the customer in a bit more, and keeps her engaged in the store and in the lifestyle? Thanks.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "Well first, fortunately when we\u2019re moving to a system where we will no longer need cash wraps, so we\u2019re going to be able to eliminate cash wrap stations and use that additional space for productivity. And in terms of driving productivity in our stores, our overall footprint is adequate. What\u2019s critical is for us to create more surprise, more moments, and more unexpected, and you are going to see as we move forward in which we\u2019ve already begun within our stores a merchandising configuration that does encourage exploration, and we\u2019ll tell a much more complete story on that, we believe, it\u2019s going to resonate very well with consumers.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you all for joining us today on our conference call. As Jane noted, I\u2019d now like to turn it back to the team for a few closing words.", "Lew Frankfort", "First, let me begin by saying that we\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. We have a strong and seasoned management team and a strong bench. I know some of you are concerned. We do expect this to be a seamless transition, and we\u2019re committed to delivering strong top and bottom line growth over our planning horizon. We have a great grand, we have excellent business equities, and we have an exceptional group of people working at Coach. So, as I\u2019ve said before, stay tuned and have a good day everybody.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the Coach Earnings Conference.

Good morning everyone and I like to welcome everyone to my last call as Coach\u2019s CEO. As you all know I will be moving on to Executive Chairman in January and I could not be more pleased with the choice of my successor Victor Luis who has demonstrated the passion, strategic vision, focus, superb execution and strong values that makes an outstanding leader. And Victor will have a stronger partner in our new Executive Creative Director, Stuart Vevers who officially joins us in September and is recognized as one of the world\u2019s leading accessories designer. Stuart\u2019s broad luxury experience focused on leather goods and his creative expertise grounded in accessories will enable him to draw upon Coach\u2019s rich history to create innovative product and brand imaginary elevating the customer experience and creating a full expression of the brand. I\u2019m confident that Victor together with Stuart will forge the ideal partnership or as I like to say the balance of logic and magic to advance Coach\u2019s transformation.", "Turning back to our quarterly results. As noted in our press release we achieved slight overall sales gains in constant currency benefitting from our geographic diversity. We continue to drive excellent growth in emerging markets in Europe as well in the men\u2019s business and in developing lifestyle categories such as footwear. Importantly we moved forward with our transformation initiatives across all consumer touch-points, product, store environments and marketing focused on the competitive handbag and accessories category in North America. While we will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.", "Some key financials were first net sales totaled $1.15 billion versus $1.16 billion a year ago, a decrease of 1%. On a constant currency basis sales rose 2% for the quarter. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.77 even the prior year. Third North American sales decreased 1% the $778 million from 784 million last year with direct sales also declining 1% on the 6.8% comparable store sales decrease and fourth international sales decreased 1% to $365 million from $367 million last year. On a constant currency basis international sales rose 9%. Sales in China remained strong increasing over 35% with a continuation of double digit comps while sales in our directly operated locations in Asia, ex-Japan and Europe rose sharply as well.", "Looking first at global distribution, during the quarter the company closed one full price location and opened five North American factory stores, including one men\u2019s freestanding store. At the end of the period, there were 350 full price and 198 factory stores in about 150 outlet malls in North America.", "Moving on to China. During the quarter, we opened six net new locations all on the Mainland bringing the total number to 132 locations, including 114 on the Mainland and 49 cities. In Japan, we opened one net new men\u2019s location during the quarter and we classified four doors from temporary to permanent bringing the total to 196 directly operated locations which included 149 full price and 47 factory locations in about 30 outlet malls. During the first quarter, we opened two locations in Singapore and now directly operate a total of 94 locations in the balance of Asia, including 48 in Korea, 27 in Taiwan, 10 in Malaysia and 9 in Singapore.", "Moving on to sales and productivity. Our total revenues in North America declined 1% for the quarter with our directly operated businesses also down 1%. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales declined 6.8% while digital men\u2019s and our newly re-launched footwear categories performed well. We were disappointed by our overall performance in women\u2019s handbags and accessories. More generally, we continue to achieve sales gains on the internet while in-store trends notably traffic remained weak. On these lower traffic levels, in-store conversion was up and transaction size held. In department stores, sales trends at POS were modestly prior year, while shipments into department stores declined slightly. Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women\u2019s handbag and accessories market rose at a high single-digit rates in the first quarter. This was a modest deceleration from recent trends impacted by core consumer categories by the cautious spending environment.", "As we have discussed, we are also continuing to drive our men\u2019s business globally through new standalone and dual-gender stores and by dedicating more space for a broader men\u2019s assortment in existing retail stores. In the first quarter, Coach\u2019s sales of men\u2019s bags and accessories increased over 25% globally. Looking ahead, we remained bullish about the prospects of our global men\u2019s business where we are targeting about $700 million in sales in FY \u201814, up about 20% and $1 billion in sales in three years. Before we discuss international sales and progress on transformation, Francine Della Badia has joined us today to discuss our product performance for the first quarter and our holiday sales initiatives. Fran?", "", "Francine Della Badia", "Thanks Lew. Starting with product, as Lew mentioned, we continue to feel pressure in our North America business in traffic in our retail stores impacting women\u2019s handbags and accessories. I am going to give some underlying texture to the comp performance both in our successful and strong product initiatives, which are resonating with consumers and where we see the opportunities to strengthen our product positioning in North America.", "We were peaked with the re-launch of Madison this quarter. Madison was completely redesigned with the sophisticated and elevated attitude featuring well-defined and timeless elements, feminine details, rich leathers and beautiful texture and understated branding. The new silhouette accessory to smaller version of our popular Phoebe Shoulder Bag, the new Madeline Satchel in two sizes and Kimberly Carryall are best sellers. Customers responding to the prettier and more emotional sensibility with properly integrated functions to support our customer\u2019s busy lifestyle and therefore the overall effortlessness of these products. For more capital Legacy [ph] handbag choices we also introduced new shapes in Legacy such as the drawstring shoulder bag and the turnout coat. As expected trends continue to favor leather handbags across all price segments. In particular the above $100 segment continued to perform well at over 20% of handbag sales. Our overall handbag penetration to our woman\u2019s business was about even till last year. We see opportunities in woman\u2019s handbags and accessories and continuing to infuse more emotion into our product leveraging our distinctive brand. Stuart Vevers luxury experiment and his passion to make the Coach\u2019s [indiscernible] relevant for today where it needs creativity and superior functionality are crafted into beautiful Coach leather bags will allow us to speak to more aspirational consumer and continue to inspire our customers globally. We continue to see strength in our lifestyle categories in Q1. For three months this spring about a 170 price locations, double in penetration from about 4% to over 8%, as higher AUR reflective of the compelling assortment. This category performs highlights our consumer desire for more emotional trend right fashion product.", "We\u2019re seeing strong performance across heels, flats and booties. We\u2019re focused on building our market share within the fragmented nearly $25 billion global premium footwear category. This fall we have introduced more dominant fashion footwear assortments in our international and wholesale locations and continue to focus on building our key items.", "We are evolving our mix and growing both AURs and overall penetration levels across all of our businesses. At the end of Q1 over a 100 Coach international retail locations offer the elevated collection and response from customers is an excellent. I also know [indiscernible] watches we\u2019re advancing [ph] and expanding our collection, repositioning into a fashion assortment and focusing our sweet spot in an average $225 price point.", "In our factory channel as planned new designs represented the majority of our handbag assortment last quarter. First a stylist collection came in July and sold extremely well. Campbell and more sophisticated group of iconic Coach turnout hardware [ph] offered a multiple fabrications including exotic performed strongly. During August we launched an assortment of made for factory footwear in 20 store and we are very pleased with customer response. We will be significantly expanding the distribution and offering starting in the spring. More broadly we\u2019re expanding the role that lifestyle categories play in factory including outerwear, watches, jewelry and sunwear. In addition we have remodeled a majority of our factory stores in for our new factory design concepts, including an enhanced visual merchandising and marketing elements.", "Moving to digital, as mentioned our North America online business continues to be strong with traffic growing at a double digit pace driven by engagement from tablet and mobile devices which represent for the 50% of our site visits. Optimization of these devices has been a key focus for us creating more compelling customer experiences. Turning to holidays, we continue to focus on increasing the level of innovation across all product categories adding emotion while strengthening fashion credibility and relevance to the brands. This will be most notable with the arrival of Capsule, a curated product assortment across categories focused on key items in bags, footwear and outwear which started arriving in stores last week.", "All stores in North America have now received new Capsule handbags silhouette to [indiscernible] in two sizes and three colors. A tiered offering of more fashion handbags and additional colors and material are offered in select flagship locations with the full assortment including ready to wear available in 25 global flagships including 11 in North America. This Capsule collection supports our lifestyle imagery, featured in our new fully integrated marketing campaign Coach New York Stories showcasing top fashion models wearing Coach set against recognizable New York backdrop.", "This campaign communicates a more aspirational and consistent brand story reinforcing the bond with our existing consumer while driving new consumer engagement globally. The campaign is already generated significant buzz in the fashion press and in social media channels around the world. At the same time, we are enhancing our store environments unveiling a new store concept in two key flagship locations in New York and Southern California during the holiday quarter. In department stores, we are also elevating our presence with new shop-in-shops and converting our case line presentations to open sell. In fact, we have seen a significant lift in sales in about a dozen locations where we have transitioned from case line to open sell format.", "In summary, we will continue to drive our women\u2019s business through fashion innovation across lifestyle categories supported by dynamic integrated marketing. We will also leverage the opportunity in men\u2019s and evolve our store and digital concept to provide a brand-right shopping experience for our consumer wherever she chooses to shop.", "With that, I will turn it over to Victor for a discussion of our international business, strategies and further opportunities for growth. Victor?", "", "Victor Luis", "Thanks Fran. Starting with our international segment, which represents about a third of Coach\u2019s business sales rose 9% on a constant currency basis in the first quarter, but declined 1% on a reported basis due to the weak yen. China sales rose over 35% from prior year fueled by distribution and double-digit same-store sales. We are very pleased by the continuing strength in this market, which bodes well for our global travel retail business with the Mainland Chinese tourist plays an increasingly important role. You may remember that our e-commerce site in China launched a year ago and while still in early stages, the internet customer within Mainland China is shopping us from over 200 cities, including more than 150 where we have no bricks and mortar presence. This is another sign of the substantial distribution opportunity for the brands beyond the top tier markets.", "Further as Coach\u2019s is relatively young brand in China, we are already recognized as a dual-gender and lifestyle as men\u2019s products and women\u2019s lifestyle categories taken together represented a third of sales in the first quarter. Our other Asia direct businesses outside of China and Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore also posted strong aggregate growth increasing at a double-digit rate for the quarter with robust comparable store sales as we anniversary-ed the purchase of our retail operations in Malaysia and Korea during the quarter. In Japan, we posted a 2% increase in constant currency as the market growth slowed while sales in dollars were down 22% reflecting the weaker yen. As discussed in our release in early July, we completed the purchase of our partner\u2019s 50% interest in our European joint venture. In addition also in July, we transitioned the two Printemps\u2019 Boulevard Haussmann locations to our direct control. Today, we operate 20 locations across the UK, France, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Germany.", "During the first quarter under our direct control, we saw significant sales growth at POS and strong comps in these locations. Also we just opened our first location in Galeries Lafayette yesterday and look forward to opening our first flagship location in Spain in mid-November along with a men\u2019s shop in Galeries Lafayette. We continue to believe that Europe represents a significant long-term opportunity for Coach both with domestic shoppers and the international tourist notably in key European cities with the accessible luxury segment is outperforming traditional luxury.", "Looking forward to the balance of FY \u201814, our strategic focus remains on the four pillars of growth we have previously shared. First and most broadly growing our business in North America and throughout the world by transforming into a global lifestyle brand; second, leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses; third, tapping into the large and growing men\u2019s accessories category which we have already touched on; and fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world. While focusing in productivity, we will selectively continue to expand our distribution. As our plans haven\u2019t changed materially from what we outlined on the July earnings call [indiscernible]. We continue to expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 9% in FY \u201914. In North America, our square footage will be up about 7% driven by 20 new store openings focused on factory, 15 to 20 previously announced full price closures and about 20 total expansions across both channels within the context of our transformation. In China we expect to grow square footage about 25% in FY \u201914 was about 30 net new dual gender stores. We expect sales to total about 530 million driven by both distribution and double digit comparable location sales.", "In terms of our other direct Asia markets of Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore while we expect to open a few stores our primary focus remains productivity. We have begun to see the results of Coach\u2019s direct management as well as the successful expansion of lifestyle categories in these markets.", "In Japan we expect that next square footage growth will increase slightly and expect to open about 5 to 10 net new locations, most of them dedicated men stores. And in Europe including the UK, we expect to open 10 retail location focused on key European capitals and about 50 wholesale locations in Fiscal Year \u201914.", "As you know, we also have significant and growing distributor run business in other countries. Our primary areas of focus are first Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Chile, Peru and Argentina. Second other Asia-Pacific market such as Australia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, and third in the Middle East. These are in addition to the significant global travel retail opportunity that continues to exist for Coach as the brands recognition continues to grow globally. I've just reviewed our strategies to drive growth, while taking to improve productivity in North America. At this time I will turn it over to J Nielsen, our CFO for further detail on our financials. Jane?", "", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks Victor. Lew, Fran and Victor have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results. Our quarterly revenues decreased 1% in both North America and international declining 1% in dollar. As noted on a constant currency basis revenues rose 2% overall with international sales up 9%. Net income from the quarter totaled 218 million was earnings per diluted share of $0.77. This compares to net income of 221 million and earnings per share of $0.77 in the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Our operating income totaled $322 million 3% below the 332 million reported last year while operating margins was 27.9% versus 28.6%.", "During this quarter growth profit totaled $827 million versus the 845 million a year ago, a decrease of 2%. Growth margin was 71.8% versus 72.8% for the prior year. Our expense ratio n Q1 totaled 43.9% improving from the 44.2% reported in the year ago quarter.", "Inventories at the end of the quarter were $637 million, a 6.5% increase over the 598 million reported at the end of last year\u2019s Q1. Cash and short term investments sit at $855 million as compared with 761 million a year ago. During the first quarter we repurchased and retired nearly 3.3 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $53.17 spending a total of $175 million. At the end of the period about 1.2 billion remained in the company\u2019s current repurchase authorization.", "Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was a $164 million compared to $202 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $118 million versus $146 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $46 million versus $56 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Looking forward at the balance sheet, we are deploying international cash into high-quality investments with higher yields and with some durations over a year and expect to shift between cash and short-term investments into other\u2019s non-current assets. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect that CapEx will be in the area of $280 million primarily due to new store openings and expansions across all geographies, elevating our store environments within our existing stores and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable our global expansion and transformation.", "While we are encouraged by the initial iterations of our transition to a lifestyle brand, we have recognized that the full reflection of this positioning is part of a multi-year journey. In addition, the retail environment remains challenging with soft mall traffic and volatility in consumer sentiment. Therefore, as you think about the remainder of 2014, our updated outlook is as follows. We expect to deliver flat to low single-digit sales growth in constant currency. Assuming the yen remains close to 100, this would equate to sales growth about even with last year in dollars with currency more of a factor in the first half.", "Also we are forecasting our North America comp run rate to be down high single-digits for the balance of FY \u201814. Gross margin is projected at about 70% to 71% for the year. The primary impact compared to last year will be increased factory clearance levels, the weaker yen, rising sourcing costs as well as inventory amortization from the JV acquisition in Coach Europe. We expect modest SG&A dollar growth with increased investments in Europe marketing and other brand transformation initiatives generally funded by the restructuring actions taken in Q4 with some de-leverage on a lower sales forecast. Taken together, we would expect operating margins to be about 28%. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be around 32% for the year.", "Regarding our balance sheet, cash flow and capital allocation we continued to have a strong balance sheet and substantial operating free cash flow of over $1 billion annually. As always, we will prudently invest in the growth of our business while also returning cash to shareholders through dividends coupled with share repurchases. Our current FY \u201814 outlook continues to reflect about $700 million in share repurchases approximately equivalent to our prior three-year average. Most importantly, our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in our brand while continuing to return capital to shareholder. I\u2019d now like to open it up to Q&A.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question today is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.", "", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question and Lew congratulations on a great run and best of luck in your new role.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you.", "", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "So it sounds like conversion in the U.S. has actually been pretty good the past six months which is a good sign but people just aren\u2019t coming in the doors, is there anything you think you can do to pull them back inside cum [ph] holiday? And then I guess Jane is in regards to the new outlook, I guess maybe when would you anticipate some improvement in North America and in your outlook why don\u2019t you assume any improve in the North America comps over the nine months. Thank you.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "Let me begin by saying that, we have a broad and comprehensive program across product marketing and environments which is kicking in. So if you visit our stores today you will see as Francine mentioned the arrival of the Borrow Bag Capsule. You will see a complete head to toe look in our marketing, enhanced environments. Traffic is a lagging indicator what we expect to see which is occurring and has been occurring is higher conversion and steady of somewhat higher ADT with an intensified need of 12 gram [ph] across both digital and traditional we\u2019re hopeful that we will see an increase in our traffic levels. Having said that until this occurs we are not going to forecast and improvements in your trend rates within North America so we\u2019re actually waiting for it to occur and when it occurs you will know about it.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Oliver Chen with Citigroup.", "", "Nancy Hilliker \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi everyone this Nancy Hilliker filling in for Oliver Chen. I wanted to follow-up on just what I was talking about also can you give us any information in terms of why maybe the new lifestyle program and new capital collection et cetera wouldn\u2019t maybe help comp guidance going into holiday and also if you could talk a little bit about skew rationalization just if you\u2019re planning to sort of focus more on certain products et cetera that will be great. Thank you.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "In terms of Capsule as we have communicated in the past it is a very small collection, there are five handbag skews that go across all stores and this is the collection that only launched 3 \u2013 4 days ago and the initial results are very promising that we can share but obviously given the size of the launch we do not expect it to be providing a major inflection alone to the business. In terms of skew rationalization that will certainly be something that we look at moving forward especially as we look at bringing other categories into our fleet as you have heard Fran report earlier our shoe relaunch continues to take hold where we have seen footwear move from the 4% penetration to 8% of the business. Most of that has come in the expansion within the 70 locations where we have added fashion assortments and as you also heard Fran referred we\u2019re very pleased with the fact that it is the fashion assortment that is checking with consumers and not just the typical snicker and flip-flop business of the past.", "", "Operator", "The next question is from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.", "", "Brian Tunick - JPMorgan", "First question on SG&A came in better than what we would have expected given the sales. So I\u2019m wondering if there were any timing shifts maybe from marketing perspective or anything we should think about coming into big holiday period [ph]. And then on inventory at the channel, it would be very helpful if you could provide some more color on how do you feel about inventory levels at department stores or wholesale accounts like Zappos given that you mentioned U.S. sales were down modestly and selling was down slightly. Thanks.", "", "Jane Nielsen", "Sure just let me comment on the 30 bips of SG&A leverage that you saw, it's largely timing. As you think about legacy last year the marketing was more predominately in the first quarter. New York Stories is going to hit in the second quarter and that accounts for all the difference in SG&A leverage. So it's simply timing. We\u2019re calling for as you heard in the guidance SG&A, modest SG&A dollar growth and so that\u2019s very consistent so it's an element of timing. In turns of overall inventory, if you think about inventory, we don\u2019t guide to inventory, you saw our inventory is up about 6.5%. If you think about inventory, think about the increased overall AUCs or average unit cost is driving overall inventory and obviously our sales was \u2013 were below our expectations. Those are two primary drivers.", "", "Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks. Best of luck.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.", "", "Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America", "Thank you. Good morning.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning.", "", "Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America", "Following up on the factory question, can you talk about some of the promotions that you have tested within factory? And then how much excess inventory you expect to manage to clear over the coming quarters?", "", "Jane Nielsen", "Hi. So as you know, we \u2013 factory is our promotional channel and there are number of different levers that we used during the year to manage our factory business and drive revenue. This quarter, we did take additional promotion of on our clearance business in factory and that was mostly to offset higher AURs that we experienced with the new products that we have been launching to balance the business for the quarter.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from John Morris with BMO Capital.", "", "John Morris - BMO Capital", "Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little \u2013 get a little bit more color from you guys on maybe comparing and contrasting the business between the retail stores and the factory specifically traffic trends and the like, maybe a little bit more color there beyond what you have already commented on? Thanks.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "Well first as reported, traffic trends in factory stores and retail stores have been tough and then \u2013 and indeed in the full price stores, our traffic slightly worsened in our \u2013 in the quarter, but overall conversion has remained strong and in fact it\u2019s higher than our last year.", "", "John Morris - BMO Capital", "And between the two channels, Lew, was factory worse than retail in terms of traffic and/or in terms of conversion I am looking to start with [ph]?", "", "Lew Frankfort", "We don\u2019t \u2013 just to aggregate that is a two channels, but what we can tell you is that the patterns that have existed \u2013 that existed in the prior quarter and in the prior 12 months remain consistent.", "", "John Morris - BMO Capital", "And just can Francine give us a little bit more color on where we see \u2013 where she sees the holiday opportunity this year versus last year maybe some of the specific initiatives that you might be doing around holiday to help drive the business? Thanks.", "", "Francine Della Badia", "So for holiday on the full price side and I think actually more broadly we have this fully marketing \u2013 this fully integrated marketing campaign across both marketing in our stores, in our windows and also across all of our digital channels who are very active in social media right now, those are efforts to continue to drive traffic into all of our stores during the holiday quarter. And I think specifically to Victor\u2019s comment about the recent launch of capsule, where we are feeling good about the burrow [ph] bag and that\u2019s a good indicator for our products initiatives as we go forward. And as we have spoken to we are excited to continue to drive our lifestyle categories, specifically footwear in men\u2019s. On the factory side, I can tell you that we continue to see great consumer response with the new product that we have been launching so that product has performed well. We will continue to be promotional more around our clearance, but at any given point in time, we are continually testing and piloting our promotional levers in factory.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "And let me just \u2013 I would like to also add in terms of our advertising spends we are intensifying spending in the quarters that you will be seeing in both our traditional media and digital a much stronger presence of Coach communicating on the broader expression of the brand.", "", "John Morris - BMO Capital", "Thanks very much. Good luck.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, please limit yourself to one question per request. The next question is from Edward Yruma with Keybanc.", "", "Edward Yruma - Keybanc", "Hi thanks and good morning. I was wondering if you could tell us about the customer that\u2019s in the stores buying some of your lifestyle product, if it would be shoes or watches. Is it existing customer? Are you capturing new customers and are they also making a purchase of the bag at the same time? Thanks.", "", "Jane Nielsen", "We\u2019re experiencing both, so it is an existing customer, would you find that consumer to buy handbags from us also participate in a significant way in other parts of the business and the other lifestyle categories and we\u2019re also attracting new customers, especially with some of their repositioning, moving watches to a more fashioned assortment at a $225 average price point and also footwear with the new trend right fashion product assortment, we\u2019re definitely seeing new customer engaging in the footwear category for us.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.", "", "Liz Dunn - Macquarie", "I was just wondering on gross margin if you could give us a sense of where merchandised margin or mark downs shook out in the quarter relative to last year and as I look at the guidance sort of versus last time is the delta there just increased promotion at factory because off the other sort of items that you have mentioned had been pressures that we were expecting before or have any of those sort of intensified? Thank you.", "", "Jane Nielsen", "Yeah sure. Liz let me break it down for you that, to equate to our guidance now. So there will be heightened promotional levers in our North Americas factor channel as Brian mentioned largely related to clearance especially during the holiday season. So that\u2019s one of the largest changes from our previous guidance as we have noted before we expect the Yen to be about 50 basis points of pressure on us and that is reflected in channel mix that we don\u2019t get the benefit because of the Yen of the higher growth margin in Japan. Overall we have also seen some rising sourcing cost, called out labor in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re also seeing some overall sourcing cost increases and then we have the inventory amortization from the acquisition of our JV and Coach Europe. If I break it into those four buckets that encompasses the margin pressures both versus prior year and versus previous guidance.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.", "", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Could you talk about the key differences between China and the North America in terms of conversion, men\u2019s we know is stronger, you know in terms of just the big business buckets?", "", "Lew Frankfort", "Overall I would say that of course what we\u2019re experiencing in China is a much lower conversion rates that is due to our lack of awareness and as awareness grows of course so will our conversion as consumers discover more fully the Coach story. Saying that our lack of history of course has the advantages as I addressed in the speaker\u2019s notes of allowing us from the very early stages to position the brand as a lifestyle brand. As I mentioned this past quarter approximately in fact almost exactly 1/3rd of our sales in China came through other categories, men\u2019s and other lifestyle categories including footwear and women\u2019s outerwear and we expect that will continue to increase as we further develop in the quarters ahead our lifestyle categories through transformation and this really speaks to our previous comments that the impact of transformation on the brand of course is not only going to provide the context and relevance for Coach to achieve renewed growth in the North American market but also to help position us more fully to compete more successfully in emerging and international markets where we don\u2019t have a history.", "", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Can you also talk about the tests in the United States to add more footwear using a pool stock [ph] for shipment to customers what is going on with that? Fill footwear in more stores.", "", "Jane Nielsen", "So we do footwear in 175 locations right now and what we have been doing is testing footwear in having a smaller assortment in about 10 additional doors to see if we can service the customer with sizing in inventory in an order from Jack and we will continue to test and probe more around distribution opportunities in footwear. The other thing that I will say is as we continue to look at the fleet and have remodeled store opportunities, we will take advantage of mobile POS technology and remove cash wrap for the mobile POS technology and dedicate more square footage on the selling floor on two categories like footwear. In terms of Jacksonville, we have a very active program right now in our distribution center, where customers can order shoes from any store in the fleet.", "", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "So by the end of the year, you will have footwear you think in how many \u2013 the ability to buy footwear in how many locations?", "", "Jane Nielsen", "And you can buy footwear in any location today off of our program CBSR which is the Coach by special request, you can order from any store.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Good morning everyone. As you think about inventory planning if you go into the balance of the year, how you are planning inventories and if you think about the collections what should we be looking for in terms of updates to collections, new collections until Stuart comes out with his own collections? Thank you.", "", "Francine Della Badia", "Yes. So why don\u2019t I address the inventory question. So I think as I said we don\u2019t provide guidance on inventory, but we expect based on square footage growth that you will see continued inventory growth through FY \u201814. And we have a few factors that I outlined and you see cost increases, the acquisition of Coach Europe and also our expansion into lifestyle categories. So there are three things that are driving inventory growth. And you know that we have a proven track record of managing our inventory very profitable over time. So our inventory is current, its currency and we feel that we are in a reasonable position.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "In terms of your question on newness moving forward, we see in the second half as we go beyond holiday an increasing presence in capital that will be a further rollout of burrow [ph] and other capsule silhouettes across the entire fleet both in terms of new fabrications as well as a couple of new styles. In addition in the second half of the year, we will be bringing out new silhouettes including Domed Satchel and other collections from the spring that will lead into Stuart\u2019s first collection, which will be in stores from fall of next year. We expect it to run across the entire fleet from September. Stuart of course is very busy currently in developing that collection and we will have more to share on that in the spring.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.", "", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you. Good morning.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "Good morning Kimberly.", "", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley", "My question is just about the one, two, three-year outlook, could you help us understand how you view Coach\u2019s go-forward strategy in terms of either stabilizing market share in the U.S. and what do you think the drivers there might be and/or it\u2019s rather you are just going to progress with the lifestyle conversion of the brand perhaps a little bit of that market share slide away in hopes of stabilizing the business potentially at a slightly smaller level. I am just looking for your big picture thinking on the kind of three-year outlook for the business?", "", "Lew Frankfort", "Our objective has been and will be to grow with the category. Handbags and accessories has been and will continue to be a key core category for Coach and the main driver of our business. Transformation is truly about providing context and emotion for the Coach brands. We do not see us evolving into a ready to wear resource first and foremost. And as we have stated previously, our focus will be in driving the other key categories around handbags and accessories that provide some context with footwear and outerwear being key drivers. We have talked about this being a multi-year strategy; we believe it's the right strategy and the right one to drive long term growth. We have a great team in place and certainly we don\u2019t know of another brand in our core space that has the experience and the execution of transformations in their path as we do and we\u2019re excited about writing this chapter and the journey ahead.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS", "I wanted to ask you about the U.S. store count and I guess the full price stores and you guys gave some update language [ph] on that, it sounds like it's still tracking to the plan you gave us 90 days ago. I wanted to think about that in the context of where the comps are and how you see the trajectory of the comps over the next few quarters Lew and perhaps why it makes sense to continue growing footage here, will we see more a stabilization in the U.S. same store sales numbers?", "", "Lew Frankfort", "I\u2019m sorry, the last part you did a review of the comps?", "", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Right why I guess the square footage growth rate in the U.S. is staying where it's at as far as the plan considering where comps are right now and the trajectory that Jane laid out for us over the next few quarters, does it make sense to continue the footage growth in the U.S. until we see more of a stabilization in the comps.", "", "Lew Frankfort", "The answer is that we\u2019re very thoughtful about the way in which we look at distribution and we have that situation where we do have markets both on a factory side and extremely selectively on the full price side whether opportunities are to develop, a three standing dual gender stores as well men stores at the same time we\u2019re focused on productivity measurements particularly being sensitive to our full price fleet which needs to lead. And what we\u2019re not showing in comp of course, comps that not show is the benefit of the revenues that we\u2019re achieving in the first 12 months of these new store openings and we might say when we look at these new store openings through a store they are very productive.", "", "Jane Nielsen", "But Michael just to build on what we called out in Q4 is that we do continue and what you saw still in Q4 as we continue to look at our overall real estate position as things come under lease renewal and expiration and we make a judgment based on each store and the trading area and we will continue to do that. It's in our practice and we will continue to do that across our fleet.", "", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "And maybe would you mind telling us a little bit about I\u2019m a little bit interested to hear where some of the good SG&A control came from in the quarter particularly with the square footage growth being up. You know I will get some detail when the 10-Q comes up and maybe you can just talk about it qualitatively? Thank you.", "", "Jane Nielsen", "Well I think that what we called out in Q4 was that the actions we took in the restructuring, we\u2019re going to fund investments that we\u2019re making in the brand. You saw that play out in Q1 with the improvement in our SG&A ratio we will be coming from an issue of timing of marketing spend, so you will see that the about consistent through the year should be up through the year but Q1 was the low Q1 last year because of the difference of timing between Legacy and Coach New York Story.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.", "", "Tracy Kogan - Wells Fargo", "Thanks its Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I had a question about your launch of more lifestyle categories within the factory channels. If you could just help us what with when we might see these categories in the stores and how many stores will get them, how many skews et cetera and then if you could just tell us maybe I think you said 20 stores where you had footwear, how did the productivity of those stores compare to those without the footwear? Thanks.", "", "Jane Nielsen", "Right now we have outerwear in 140 factory stores, so the initiative in outerwear is rolled out and it's performing quite well so we\u2019re seeing good improvement to last year in that category. We just recently launched women\u2019s and men\u2019s made for factory watches. That is the new launch this quarter. And so we are excited about the growth opportunity in the watch category in factory stores. In related to footwear in the 20 stores, we are going to be rolling out to an additional 70 stores later in the spring and in the 20 stores where we currently have footwear we are continuing \u2013 we are looking at optimizing the footwear presentation in these locations and adding additional assortment to these locations starting in the third quarter. In terms of productivity in these stores, the productivity is incremental and is \u2013 they are performing quite well. We are also seeing the same type of fashion appetite coming out of our factory division that we are seeing in full price.", " ", "Lew Frankfort", " ", "We invite you to visit factory and full price stores near you. And what you will see in the factory fleet, in particular, is our new design concept, which has been extremely well received and actually provides the environment for a much fuller expression of the brand.", " ", "Operator", " ", "Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Andrea Shaw Resnick for closing remarks.", " ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", " ", "Thank you all for joining us today. As our practice, we like to close the call before the market opens. So I would like to turn it back to Lew and Victor for some closing comments. Gentlemen?", " ", "Victor Luis", " ", "Thank you, Andrea. I would first just like to thank everyone for joining us and want to congratulate Lew on his last call as CEO. And we on the management team of course are very much looking forward to partnering with him in his new role. This leadership team inherits a fantastic iconic brand that is grounded in authenticity and heritage with a proven history and success in reinventing itself. And we are all very excited about working together and partnering to write the next chapter of the Coach brand. As I mentioned earlier very few if any brands in our space indeed have the success of reinvention that this brand and this company has. And we are excited about resetting ourselves for a period of sustained growth.", " ", "Lew Frankfort", " ", "And well, I have said on previous calls from time-to-time just stay tuned everybody.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Ms. Andrea Shaw Resnick. You may begin.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Victor Luis, Coach\u2019s CEO, and Jane Nielsen, Coach\u2019s CFO. Francine Della Badia, president of North America retail is also joining us. ", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. ", "Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2014 results and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives. Francine Della Badia will discuss our business in North America in more detail. Jane Nielsen will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question and answer session where we will be joined by Lew Frankfort, Coach\u2019s executive chairman. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Victor will then conclude with some brief summary remarks.", "I\u2019d now like to introduce Victor Luis, Coach\u2019s CEO.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning. Thanks, Andrea, and welcome everyone. As we enter the new calendar year, I couldn\u2019t be more excited to be greeting you today as CEO of Coach, succeeding our executive chairman, Lew Frankfort. It is an honor to have the opportunity to build on Lew\u2019s remarkable 35-year legacy and to lead the best team in specialty luxury retailing.", "We are at a truly unique moment in time. We are faced with a new competitive landscape, evolving consumers, and changing shopping patterns, receiving the opportunity to define modern luxury by innovation, emotion, and relevance into the Coach brand. ", "Change and the sense of urgency are not new to our history. Many of you know that we talk about Coach\u2019s history in chapters. In our first chapter, Coach defined luxury leather goods for the American consumer. ", "In our second chapter, we created the accessible luxury handbag and accessories category in North America and key Asian markets. And now, I, together with Stuart Vevers, our new executive creative director, and our seasoned Coach team, are excited to write Coach\u2019s third chapter, our transformation into a global lifestyle brand anchored in accessories.", "We will accomplish this by focusing on our key brand equities of authenticity, quality, craftsmanship, and value. As noted in our press release, during the holiday quarter, total sales fell slightly in constant currency as weakness in our North American women\u2019s bags and accessories business offset strong growth in men\u2019s footwear and robust sales in emerging Asian markets and Europe.", "We continue to be disappointed by our performance in North America, which was impacted substantially by lower traffic in our stores and by our decision to limit access to our e-factory flash sale site. ", "At the same time, China results remained resilient, with total sales growing about 25% and comparable store sales rising at a double digit rate. Importantly, we continue to advance our transformation initiatives and position coach to launch Stuart Vevers\u2019 first collection in September.", "Before getting into the final details of the quarter, I want to start with key milestones in our transformation journey. As you know, we have focused on the three primary aspects of brand experience: product, stores, and marketing. Starting with product, we continue to see strength in men\u2019s and footwear, two categories that have undergone significant evolution in previous years and quarters. ", "The story of this quarter was the introduction of capsule, notably the success of the Borough bag, a prelude to a comprehensive replatforming of our women\u2019s assortment across bags, accessories, and lifestyle categories.", "Stuart has made significant progress leading Coach\u2019s design team to replatform our assortment to both imbue more emotion in the product and elevate the brand. In fact, we\u2019re presenting Coach\u2019s first-ever collection in February during New York Fashion Week. ", "The presentation will be a series of one-on-one or small group appointments over a five-day period. The goal of presenting in this format is to create the opportunity for Stuart to present the fall collection and personally share his inspiration and vision for the brand with the fashion community in an intimate and informative environment. ", "Moving on to stores, there are a few areas of progress to note. The highlight of the quarter was the unveiling of a new store concept in two key flagship locations in New York and Southern California. In addition, our holiday store windows, \u201cA Brilliant Season,\u201d reflected our move toward installations rather than simply monthly product backdrops.", "And finally on marketing, we launched a new fully integrated marketing campaign, \u201cCoach New York Stories,\u201d showcasing top fashion models wearing Coach, set against recognizable New York backdrops. ", "While our journey has just begun, we have confidence in our vision of what we need to do and have the strategies in place to realize that vision. As was the case with our former transformations, we recognize that this is a multiyear endeavor which requires single-mindedness, tenacity, nimbleness, and patience before it will be fully reflected in our financial performance.", "Turning to the results of the last quarter, some key financials were, first, net sales on a reported basis totaled $1.4 billion versus $1.5 billion a year ago, a decrease of 6%. On a constant currency basis, sales declined 3% for the quarter. Second, earnings per share totaled $1.06 as compared to $1.23 in the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Third, international sales increased 2% to $425 million, from $418 million last year. On a constant currency basis, international sales rose 11%.", "Sales in China remain strong, increasing about 25% with the continuation of double digit comps, while sales in our directly operated locations in Asia, ex-Japan and Europe, rose sharply as well. And fourth, North American sales fell 9% to $983 million from $1.08 billion last year, with direct sales declining 8% on the 13.6% comparable store sales decrease.", "During the quarter, looking at distribution, the company opened one North American full price location and opened seven factory stores, including one men\u2019s freestanding store. At the end of the period, there were 351 full price and 205 factory stores in about 155 outlet malls in North America.", "Moving on to China, during the quarter we opened 10 net new locations, with two locations in Hong Kong and eight on the mainland, bringing the total number to 142 locations, including 122 on the mainland, in 51 cities. ", "In Japan, as expected, we did not open any new locations during the quarter. There are 196 directly operated locations, which include 149 full price and 47 factory locations in about 30 outlet malls.", "Also in Asia, during the second quarter we opened two locations in Malaysia, one in Korea, and one in Taiwan, bringing the total to 98 directly operated locations in the balance of Asia, including 49 in Korea, 28 in Taiwan, 12 in Malaysia, and 9 in Singapore.", "In Coach Europe, we opened four directly operated doors, including Serrano, our first flagship in Madrid, two shop in shops in Galleries Lafayette in Paris, and a shop in shop in El Corte Ingles. As of the end of the quarter, there were 24 directly operated locations in Europe across the U.K., France, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and Germany. We also opened several wholesale doors in the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy. ", "Moving on to sales and productivity, our total revenues in North America declined 9% for the quarter, with our directly operated businesses down 8%. As noted, total Q2 same-store sales declined 13.6%. While men\u2019s, and our relaunched footwear categories, continue to perform well, we remain disappointed by our overall performance in women\u2019s handbag and accessories. Fran will provide some additional granularity to our retail businesses in a moment. ", "In department stores, sales trends at POS were slightly below prior year, while shipments into department stores declined as planned. The outperformance vis-\u00e0-vis our retail stores was reflective of the overall channel and generally better traffic trends than the malls at large.", "Overall, and consistent with the September quarter, we estimate that the North American premium women\u2019s handbag and accessories market again rose at a high single digit rate in the second quarter.", "Turning to men\u2019s, as we\u2019ve discussed, we\u2019re also continuing to drive our men\u2019s business globally, through new standalone and dual gender stores, and by dedicating more space for a broader men\u2019s assortment in existing retail stores. In the second quarter, Coach\u2019s sales of men\u2019s bags and accessories increased nearly 20% globally.", "Looking ahead, we remain bullish about the prospects for our men\u2019s global business, where we\u2019re continuing to target about $700 million in sales in FY14, up about 20% from last year, and $1 billion in sales in three years.", "Turning now to our international segment, which represents about a third of Coach\u2019s business, sales rose 11% on a constant currency basis in the second quarter, but only 2% on a reported basis, primarily due to the weak yen. As expected, China sales rose about 25% from prior year, fueled by double digit same-store sales and distribution growth.", "We\u2019re very pleased by the continued development of this market, which bodes well for our global travel retail business, where mainland Chinese tourists play an increasingly important role. Further, as Coach is a relatively young brand in China, we are already recognized as both dual gender and lifestyle, as men\u2019s products and women\u2019s lifestyle categories, taken together, represent over a third of sales.", "Our other Asia direct businesses outside of China and Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore, also posted strong aggregate growth, increasing at double digit rate for the quarter, with robust comparable store sales. As a reminder, we anniversaried the purchases of our retail operations in Malaysia and Korea during the first quarter, so our business is now apples to apples, no longer benefitting from a wholesale to retail step up. ", "In Japan, we posted a 2% decrease in constant currency while sales in dollars were down 21%, reflecting the significantly weaker yen. In Europe, where our brand is small but growing rapidly, we generated significant sales growth at POS and strong comps in the quarter. We continue to believe that Europe represents a significant long term opportunity for Coach, both with domestic shoppers and the international tourists, notably in key European cities where the accessible luxury segment is outperforming traditional luxury.", "While Jane will get into some more details on our financials, and I will discuss our outlook in some detail shortly, I wanted to give you this recap. Francine Della Badia has joined us today to review our holiday season and discuss our business in North America in more detail. Fran?", "Francine Della Badia", "Thanks, Victor, and good morning. As Victor mentioned, we continue to feel pressure in our North America business, in traffic in our retail stores, impacting women\u2019s handbags and accessories. Simply put, we were dissatisfied with our performance in these categories. As I did last quarter, I\u2019m going to give some underlying texture to the comp performance, both in our successful and strong product initiatives which are resonating with consumers, and where we see the opportunities to strengthen our product [unintelligible] in North America.", "As was the case industry wide, in-store traffic decelerated further from Q1 levels as the national retail traffic index posted the steepest holiday season decline in at least six years. Similarly, in factory malls, which are primarily open air, in traffic, notably in the two weeks leading up to Christmas, we did not experience the build that we expected. On these lower levels of foot traffic throughout our store base, overall conversion rose and transaction size held.", "While in previous quarters and years we were able to offset slowing in store traffic on the internet, our online business did not contribute positively to our overall North America comps. Our year over year comparisons were impacted by our strategic, brand health decisions to both eliminate third-party flash events as well as limit the access and invitations to our factory flash site. Excluding these factors, our internet comp would have experienced moderate growth. ", "What we have found, as was alluded to earlier, is that when we do offer fashion innovation our customers do respond. As Victor mentioned, the story this quarter was the introduction of capsule. All of our full price stores in North America received the new capsule handbag silhouette, the Borough, in two sizes and three colors. ", "A tiered offering of more fashion handbags in additional colors and materials were offered in select flagship locations, with the full assortment, including ready to wear, available in 25 global flagships, including 11 in North America. This all store silhouette, priced at $548 and $798, experienced strong sell through, surpassing our internal expectations. Importantly, we experienced no price resistance. ", "More generally, the above $400 price bucket grew in penetration and represented 22% of handbag sales, with the strongest performance at the upper end of our range, $600 and higher. Emotion clearly trumped price, as our consumer is willing to pay more for compelling, elevated product.", "I\u2019ve mentioned we continued to see strength in our lifestyle categories in Q2. Footwear, which relaunched last spring in about 170 full price locations, rose in penetration from about 5% to over 8%, at higher AURs, reflective of the compelling assortment. This category performance highlights our consumer\u2019s desire for more emotional trend right fashion product. We\u2019re seeing strong performance across heels, flats, and booties.", "We remain focused on building our market share within the fragmented nearly $25 billion global premium footwear category. For holiday, we introduced more dominant fashion footwear assortments in our international and wholesale locations, and continued to focus on building our key items.", "We\u2019re evolving our mix and growing both AURs and overall penetration levels across all of our businesses. At the end of Q2, nearly 150 Coach International retail locations offered the elevated women\u2019s collections, and the response from customers has been excellent. ", "In factory, after a strong Black Friday weekend, we did not experience the anticipated build in traffic in the weeks leading up to Christmas. However, similar to full price, we are seeing the consumer response to distinctive newness and fashion innovation as well as an overall shift to leather versus logo. Faux exotics, pearlized, and gathered leathers performed better than we expected at above average price points. ", "The fact that we\u2019re experiencing a strong appetite for more elevated products is exciting for us. We were also pleased with the performance of outerwear, footwear, and the newly introduced watch and jewelry categories. We\u2019ve also remodeled a majority of our factory stores into our new factory design concept, including enhanced visual merchandising and marketing elements. We are using elements of our New York Stories marketing in the windows, elevating the look and feel of these stores.", "In terms of our full price store designs, Victor touched on windows, and most importantly, our new full price concept stores on lower Fifth Avenue and South Coast Plaza. These stores are a physical expression of transformation, as we bring our brand positioning to life. They\u2019re modern, elevated, elegant, and warm, and offer our customers a more complete dual gender lifestyle experience.", "They invite customers into a much richer relationship with our brand, giving Coach greater relevance and fashion credibility. In the weeks since they have reopened, we have seen our customers explore the stores and engage with our product and brand in new and exciting ways. We view these locations as laboratories. We will live in them, learn from them, and ultimately be able to take the elements and roll them out more broadly across the fleet.", "This spring and summer, you will see bolder, more feminine visual merchandising initiatives, especially in our most prominent flagship locations, and concepts that will be represented in all stores, continuing to elevate marketing and our brand positioning. Our fall marketing campaign communicated a more aspirational and consistent brand story, reinforcing the bonds with our existing consumer while driving new customer engagement globally. ", "During the holiday quarter, we evolved the campaign with new tastemakers such as Misty Copeland, the first African-American lead ballerina to the American Ballet Theater; Michael Chernow, founder of The Meatball Shop; and Gia Coppola, a photographer. They\u2019re all telling their own New York story, featuring their favorite Coach product. ", "In summary, we\u2019re confident in our roadmap to restore productivity in North America. While we recognize this will take some time, and are clearly disappointed with our recent performance, we are focused on maintaining our operational excellence. We are making the necessary investments in our digital capabilities as the business becomes increasingly omnichannel, and we\u2019re reviewing our store fleet systematically, culling where necessary and investing where appropriate.", "With that, I will turn it back over to Victor for a discussion of our international business, strategies, and further opportunities for growth. Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Thanks, Fran. Our strategic focus remains on the four pillars of growth that we have previously shared. First, and most broadly, growing our business in North America and throughout the world by transforming into a global lifestyle brand anchored in accessories. Second, leveraging the global opportunity by aggressively growing our international businesses. Third, tapping into the large and growing men\u2019s accessory category, which we\u2019ve already touched on. And fourth, harnessing the growing power of the digital world to both drive ecommerce and customer engagement globally.", "While focusing on productivity, we will selectively continue to expand our distribution. As our annual plans haven\u2019t changed materially from what we shared in July and in October, I will be brief. ", "We still expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase around 9% in FY14, consistent with prior guidance. In North America, our directly operated square footage will be up about 7%, driven by about 15 new store openings focused on Factory, about 20 expands within the context of our transformation and 15-20 previously announced full price closures.", "In China, as we discussed, we\u2019re on schedule to open about 30 net new dual gender locations, increasing our square footage by about 25%. And as noted in our press release, our sales remain on track to reach $530 million this year, driven by both distribution and double digit comparable location sales.", "While we expect to open a few stores in our other direct Asia markets of Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore, our primary focus remains productivity. We have been realizing the benefits of Coach\u2019s direct management in these markets and are pleased with the development of both our teams and our brands.", "In Japan, we expect net square footage growth will increase slightly with the opening of about 5 to 10 net new locations, most of them dedicated men\u2019s stores. And in Europe, including the U.K., for FY14 we still expect to open about 10 retail locations focused on key European cities, and now plan to open about 30 total wholesale locations.", "As you know, we also have significant and growing distributor run businesses in other countries. Our primary areas of focus are first, other Asia Pacific markets, including Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines; second, Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, Peru, Chile, and Argentina; and third, in the Middle East.", "I just reviewed our transformation progress, ongoing strategy to reinvigorate growth while taking steps to improve productivity in North America. Importantly, we are confident in our vision and we have the right team and resources to execute our transformation already underway.", "At this time, I will turn it over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, for further details on our financials. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen ", "Thanks, Victor. Victor and Fran have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. Our quarterly revenues decreased 6%, with North America declining 9% and international increasing 2% in dollars. As noted, on a constant currency basis, revenues were down 3% overall while international sales rose 11%.", "Net income for the quarter totaled $297 million, with earnings per diluted share of $1.06. This compared to net income of $353 million and earnings per share of $1.23 in the prior year second quarter. Our operating income totaled $436 million, as compared to the $527 million reported last year, while operating margin was 30.7% versus 35%.", "During this quarter, gross profit totaled $983 million, versus the $1.09 billion a year ago. Gross margin was 69.2% versus 72.2% for the prior year. Our expense ratio in Q2 totaled 38.5% compared to 37.2% reported in the year ago quarter.", "Our SG&A dollars actually declined slightly on a year over year basis as we managed variable cost to the lower sales levels, adjusted our outlook for lower performance-based compensation levels, and benefited from the weaker yen.", "We also realized the benefit of our fourth quarter restructuring actions and the sale of RK, which were offset by higher spending on Coach brand marketing as well as the impact of taking Coach Europe in house.", "Inventories at the end of the quarter were $553 million, 12% above the $494 million reported at the end of last year\u2019s Q2. As mentioned on our last call, we\u2019ve planned for inventory levels to be up over the balance of this fiscal year, based on several key factors, including distribution growth, the acquisition of Coach Europe, higher average unit cost, and our expansion into lifestyle categories.", "In addition, sales growth [unintelligible] the lower expectations, is also driving inventory levels. However, our operating model, with a robust factory channel, allows us to view our inventory as currency, and our balances are high quality and current.", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $799 million, as compared with $859 million a year ago. On the balance sheet, we continue to deploy international cash into high quality investments with higher yields and durations over a year. And, in turn, there is a shift between cash and short-term investments into other noncurrent assets.", "During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired about 3.3 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $52.99, spending a total of $175 million. At the end of the period, about $1 billion remained under the company\u2019s current repurchase authorization.", "Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $400 million, compared to $628 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $340 million versus an inflow of $567 million in the same period last year. Our capex spending was $61 million, even with a year ago.", "Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect that capex this year will be in the area of $280 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansions across all geographies, elevating our store environment within our existing stores and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable our global expansion and transformation.", "Based on our second quarter results, we\u2019ve modified our outlook for the balance of the year as follows. We now expect to deliver low single digit sales declines in constant currency in the second half. Assuming the yen remains close to 104, this would equate to low to mid single digit rate decrease in sales for the balance of the year in dollars. ", "For the full year, this would take us down low single digits in constant currency and low to mid single digits in dollars. Also, we are forecasting our North America comp run rate to be in the range of our Q2 levels for the balance of the year, with 3Q the more difficult compare given the Easter shift.", "Gross margin is projected at about 70% for both the back half and the year. The primary impact compared to last year will be increased factory promotion levels, the weaker yen, rising sourcing costs, as well as inventory amortization from the JV acquisition in Coach Europe.", "We continue to expect modest mid single digit SG&A dollar growth in the second half, with increased investments in Europe, marketing, and other brand transformation initiatives generally funded by the restructuring actions taken in last year\u2019s Q4, but with some deleverage on the lower sales forecast. Therefore, for the full year, SG&A will be up low single digits. ", "Taken together, we would expect operating margins to be in the area of 26% to 27% for the year. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be around 32% for the year.", "Regarding the balance sheet, cash flow, capital, and capital allocations, we expect to continue to have a strong balance sheet and substantial operating free cash flow. We will prudently invest in the growth of our business while returning cash to shareholders through dividends, coupled with share repurchases. Our current FY14 outlook continues to reflect about $700 million in share repurchases, approximately equivalent to our prior three-year average.", "Our long term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in our brand while continuing to return capital to shareholders.", "I\u2019d now like to open it up to Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] The first question today is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee ", "Victor, I wanted to ask about some of the initial steps you\u2019ve taken in this transformation, both from a product perspective. It sounds like the Borough Bag has been a hit, and the lifestyle stores look great. But both have been done on such a small scale, so I guess the question is why wouldn\u2019t you be a little more aggressive from both a product and stores perspective on some of these changes that do appear to be working. And then a quick follow up would be, internally, what gives you the confidence that Stuart\u2019s product will work, and that the brand is still healthy?", "Victor Luis", " ", "Let me start with the second part of your question, which really is about confidence around the brand. I not only have the pleasure of leading the best team in luxury specialty retail, but also without a doubt the leader in the space from a brand perspective. We are the original U.S. luxury brand. We are the most authentic brand, and certainly any piece of research that we see today, and which I know many of you also do, shows us as the most loved brand in the space.", "Of course, the environment around this has shifted. Consumer shopping behaviors are changing, there\u2019s a new competitive environment. We realize that. We\u2019re grasping that opportunity through our transformation, and are very cognizant of the need for us to tell a richer story to our consumers and provide a richer context, which is what we\u2019re doing through our strategies and through transformation.", "And with Stuart Vevers as our creative director, we\u2019ve undertaken that journey. He\u2019s been with us for four months, and just yesterday, internally, we showed the first collection. And I can tell you that the energy among the team was palpable. ", "We are extremely excited by the initial steps we\u2019re taking. Stuart is providing us with a rich context for us, not only in terms of rediscovering what is great about Coach, which is a story on quality, great purity of design, understanding materials and craftsmanship, but also providing a fashion relevance for the brand like we\u2019ve never had. So we\u2019re incredibly excited about that. ", "In a minute, I\u2019ll ask Lew to give you his opinion as well, because obviously, having been on the journey for 35 years, he can certainly compare with past years.", "In terms of the Borough and the stores, we want to be of course learning on everything that is happening. The Borough was developed by our team 12 months ago. And we made the initial buys, we\u2019ve gone back in. You\u2019re going to see increasing presence of that specific silhouette across the fleet in North America and globally. In fact, from this floor set, if you would have visited stores today, relative to holiday, you\u2019ll see an increased presence there. ", "And in terms of the fleet rollout of the new concept, the lifestyle concept that I know many of you have visited at Lower Fifth and perhaps at South Coast Plaza, as Fran touched on, the feedback from consumers and just our staff and their interaction with them has been very positive. So we\u2019re learning, we\u2019re tweaking obvious fixture programs and the like, and over the next weeks and months, we\u2019ll be making decisions on how expensively we roll that out based on the feedback.", "Lew, perhaps you want to give your comments on what you\u2019ve seen in relation to Stuart\u2019s first development?", "Lew Frankfort ", "Sure. Good morning everybody. Just for some context, our brand grew organically from our product. Before we had a great brand, we had a great product. And the attributes of the product, as Victor mentioned, authenticity, craftsmanship, quality, and value, were the cornerstones of our products, and eventually became key brand equities. ", "Today, when we look at the product that we\u2019re going to be launching in our first ever presentation next month, launching in September, it still has been absolutely true to our underlying brand equities. The product is rich, it\u2019s elevated, it\u2019s original. He has interpreted and brought forward the many codes that consumers have come to know and embrace from Coach. And in closing, the product is imbued with emotion. It resonates with quality, and is quite appealing. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Oliver Chen with Citigroup.", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup ", "Regarding the factory channel and the promotional nature of what\u2019s happening there, could you highlight a potential catalyst for abatement there, and what you\u2019re seeing competitive within the marketplace? And just as a follow up, to help us set expectations for your business going forward, how do we think about timing for a better comp store sales? And what should we prioritize as the key drivers for that happening?", "Francine Della Badia ", "I\u2019ll start with your factory question. In terms of factory stores, as we mentioned, we had a strong Black Friday weekend, and then were disappointed by the deceleration of traffic post that, in the weeks leading up to Christmas. We have been promoting more heavily, specifically on the clearance end of the business in factory, to move through some inventory and manage our inventory as efficiently as possible. ", "So the good news is that Maria\u2019s new product, and the new design that we have in the stores, is really checking with consumers, and we are selling that product extremely well, at above-average factory price points. And so when we have the traffic, we are able to very effectively convert and actually move ticket. So as we are into the spring season, we anticipate holding traffic, that we should be able to continue down the path of being really proud of the product that we put into factory stores and continue to convert the customers that are walking in. ", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup ", "And my second question was just more about setting appropriate expectations for the timing of the turnaround of the comp and which drivers would you prioritize for us as the most importance aspect?", "Victor Luis ", "Certainly we\u2019re committed to driving productivity, as we have discussed, and long term value for our shareholders. We have of course also guided that we will not forecast the change in the trend until we see it. There is of course the knowledge that traffic is a likely indicator. We\u2019re going to see conversions being the main driver.", "We\u2019re excited about the fact that we have a tremendous amount of internal excitement already and what we\u2019re seeing in new product coming out for September. We know that while shopping behaviors are changing, all of our traffic is being impacted globally, this is truly about great brands.", "And we\u2019re focused on driving relevance for the Coach brand, getting back to the core, creating exciting shopping experiences for consumers, engaging with them online and in the stores in new and exciting ways, which is necessary in this changing environment, and doing so of course through all of our marketing mediums, whether it be through traditional advertising, social media, and the like. ", "And we\u2019re on a journey, and we will take you along with us on that journey, and we\u2019re very focused, of course, on the fall, as a very important key next chapter for us as we continue with the marketing campaign that we already have, but also the presentation of Stuart\u2019s first full collection in our full price channel, where we will have the largest single introduction of new SKUs that we\u2019ve already had, in one launch. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.", "Liz Dunn - Macquarie ", "My question is relative to your place in the marketplace. I guess you talked about the overall North American handbag market still being fairly robust, but obviously your business was tough. Traffic was tough. Do you think it has to do with a shift to business online? I\u2019m just sort of struggling with how the overall market remains as robust as you see it being, but your problem is primarily traffic. If you could just help add context? Is it just that you\u2019re not checking online to the same extent that your competitors are? What channel do you see losing the most share in?", "Victor Luis ", "I think most retailers today are seeing that the shopping mall channel is seeing the most pressure in terms of traffic overall. Our online business is more mature than perhaps some of the other competitors that we have. We\u2019ve been in the space longer than most of our competitors. ", "But saying that, as we discussed in our notes, we did take a very important strategic decision this past quarter to limit access, especially on our flash site, as we look at driving brand equity and moving forward. We know this is a long term journey. ", "Specifically, we did not have third-party events via our flash web sales, as we had this time last year. And we\u2019ve been also very vigilant in ensuring that we try and keep resellers off of our flash web sales model because of the impact that it has, of course, through the parallel channels both domestically and international. ", "Our number one opportunity of course is in recruitment of consumers into the franchise here in North America, where we are still the leaders. We know that that\u2019s going to happen in an omnichannel way, both through the wholesale channel, through our current partners, where there\u2019s a definite opportunity for us to drive further relevance and a further strong presence for our brand, of course, through our own stores. And we realize that the full price channel has to lead. ", "This is something that we shared with you, and we\u2019re very focused on driving relevance through that as our most important priority, because of the halo that that plays across the entire brand. And for those of you that have visited our Lower Fifth Avenue store and you compare that experience with the rest of the Coach fleet, and you can imagine that across an entire fleet, as we tweak it, develop it, and perfect it, I think you see a Coach of the future. And of course as well through the digital channel, which is not only an important channel for communication, but increasingly for ecommerce. So it\u2019s really about the brand across all channels. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Bilun Boyner with JPMorgan. ", "Bilun Boyner - JPMorgan", "It\u2019s very encouraging that you mentioned you did not see price [unintelligible] and higher price points perform better. So when we get Stuart\u2019s first [unintelligible] in September, where should we expect AURs for that line compared to the collection that\u2019s lower priced? And you mentioned that you limited access through the [unintelligible] sale websites. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how material that was. Was it a significant portion of the [unintelligible] business you cut out?", "Francine Della Badia ", "In terms of average price points, the over $400 bucket, as we talked about strength in that in the prepared remarks, we actually had a 7% increase in AUR over last year. So as we anticipate Stuart\u2019s collection and look forward to his fall, the newness in his products, we do anticipate that AURs will increase. And balance in the assortment is important, but seeing that we are performing well in the categories where we had very emotional product, the consumer is willing to pay for it, and we will price the goods accordingly.", "In terms of the internet, and the limitation of the flash sale site, we did eliminate third-party, as we said, and paid search as well, and the reseller impact. Those things taken together did have an impact on the overall performance of our internet business, and if we took those out, we would have seen a moderate increase in internet sales.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura. ", "Bob Drbul - Nomura", "I just had one question. What led to the decision to have an analyst day, and what do you plan to share with us on that meeting?", "Victor Luis ", "We want to share details of the vision that we have. Obviously, seeing is believing. You will all be able to see the product in all of its glory, meet the teams that care, which is, as I\u2019ve shared, and we believe strongly, without a doubt, the best team in the space, and share with you our vision for the future. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley ", "Victor, you mentioned the endeavor to restore brand equity, and I\u2019m just wondering, how do you think about that effort over time with the ongoing increase in square footage in factory? It would seem in some ways that those two things worked against one another, given that typically expansion in factory is not really brand enhancing. It certainly increases distribution opportunity, but having more discount product out in the marketplace would not really seem to be congruent with the effort to restore brand equity. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us with how you think about those two opposing forces.", "Victor Luis ", "It\u2019s obviously a question we get often, and what I would share is that we believe the brand, first and foremost, must be led through the full price channel. And what you see, again, in Lower Fifth, what you see in South Coast Plaza, in terms of a direction for the future of our fleet and the equity that we want to drive through that fuller lifestyle experience, where consumers are engaging with the brand differently, without a doubt will be both a business driver but just as important, if not more so, the halo for the entire multichannel strategy that we have.", "Outlets, in terms of their importance globally, are unquestionably the fastest growing certainly bricks and mortar channel in the luxury space. That is not only true for U.S. based multichannel brands. It is increasingly true for European and traditional luxury brands who are driving further relevance for the channel globally, whether it be here in the U.S., where it\u2019s quite a mature channel, but of course increasingly in Europe, and now, more than ever, increasing in China and the rest of Asia as well. And so as that channel grows, we want to make sure that we participate in it, and take our fair share there.", "Saying that, we\u2019re very cognizant of the need, as a result of increasing competitor pressures in that channel as well, to remain relevant there. And many of you have visited our [unintelligible] Park rollouts, which is now our global rollout already, which we believe in that channel elevates the brand, provides a terrific experience, and I think just as you\u2019re seeing and will see increased value, not just through price, but through great product, emotional product, in our full price channel. We will continue to see that moving forward in our factory channel. ", "And that is the key. The key is not just to see it as a promotional channel, but to see it as a channel which is of relevance to a certain consumer, who does not shop in other channels, and where we have the leadership position and see continued growth moving forward. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Faye Landes of Cowen and Company.", "Faye Landes - Cowen and Company ", "On the outlet thing, can you just give us some dimension? You implied that you\u2019re going to be selling the excess full price product in the outlets channel, just to get rid of the inventory you have right now. How quickly do you think you can clear that, because as you\u2019ve often indicated before, that\u2019s not the core of your outlet strategy? ", "Jane Nielsen ", "Our outlook is that we\u2019ll be able to move through a great deal of our inventory over the next several quarters. And given the size, the productivity of our factory channel and the volume that we move through there, we have a lot of confidence that we\u2019ll be able to clear through our inventory profitability over the next several quarters.", "Victor Luis ", "I would just add that this is not new for us. Many of you who have been with us on our journey know that even during the 2008/2009 crisis, it didn\u2019t take us more than two to three quarters. This inventory is currency for us. It\u2019s no more than 5% of our total sales, and we\u2019ve always sold full price [unintelligible] in our factory channel. It adds to the relevancy of that channel. There are many consumers who are obviously looking for the hunt of what was in full price in previous months. And so we look to it as an opportunity and not necessarily a negative.", "Jane Nielsen ", "There are several drivers of inventory, one of which is our sales outlook that was lower than expectations. But some core drivers, like our distribution expansion, our higher average unit cost, and the acquisition of Coach Europe and our expansion into lifestyle categories have elevated inventory levels, some just based on the nature of the business. But in terms of that which is excess because of our sales outlook, we\u2019ll move through that very quickly.", "Operator", "The next question is from Laura Champine with Canaccord.", "Laura Champine - Canaccord ", "This is, I\u2019m afraid, just an extension of what Liz has already asked, which is can you talk about what is driving the strength in the category and how you diagnose, in the most important quarter of the year, an acceleration in market share loss, and what is being done specifically to address that other than obviously new product coming with Stuart\u2019s arrival?", "Victor Luis ", "Well, the strength in the category really speaks to the message that we\u2019ve been putting out there for many quarters now, which is obviously that consumers increasingly look to accessories as the most important part of their wardrobe. It\u2019s what they are doing and leveraging in that sense, to identify themselves as they spend less on apparel and more on accessories. This is a cyclical shift that has been going on for over a decade now.", "Obviously, as a result of our own success, as a result of this growth in the category, there\u2019s increased competition. That competition creates excitement in the category, which continues to drive it. The opportunity for us, of course, is to leverage our solid equities in our brands, the amazing team and know how that we have, and with new creative direction, to drive relevance in our brands and take our fair share of the market as we have in the past, and that\u2019s what we intend to do.", "So our strategies for dealing with that are everything that we have been sharing with you in terms of transformation. We\u2019re excited about having you all together with us on June 4, when we will share not only with you the details of our vision, but of course the strength of this team in terms of what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re going to execute moving forward.", "Laura Champine - Canaccord ", "And just as a follow on, is there a concerted effort to elevate the brand? And how might that change the market size that you can address in North America, if I am hearing that right, that there is an effort to elevate the brand to higher price points?", "Victor Luis ", "It\u2019s a terrific question. You will see some increased SKU counts at the higher price points, but our strategy is not to change the range of our price points. Many of you will remember, during the financial crisis, when consumers were more price sensitive, we talked about a rebalancing in our assortments. What we\u2019re seeing with obviously consumer confidence at levels that are much better, and the increased competition and excitement around the category, is an opportunity for us to leverage our core strength, our authenticity, quality, heritage, and the respect that consumers have for Coach as the leader in this space to continue to elevate and rebalance our assortment now to more SKUs in the above $400 space. ", "But this is not about us becoming a European luxury brand tomorrow. This is about us driving desirability and driving, if you will, confidence in the brand in the mind of the consumer through increased value through quality. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Randy Konik with Jefferies. ", "Randy Konik - Jefferies", "Can I just follow up on that, with pricing architecture, because you said on the call that about 22% is done at the greater than $400 price point, which is doing well. But 80% of your business is below that, and when you look on the website, you\u2019re hit with price points right away that are $598, $698, $1,000, etc. And when you look at your key competitors, their opening pages on their websites are $298, $328, to $458. ", "So I guess I\u2019m just curious about how you\u2019re thinking about pricing architecture and how to message that to the consumer, because again, when I look at the website, it just looks like the prices are just not accessible as they have been in the past. And just want to follow up with the point that you\u2019re not going to alienate that lower price point offering. Just your thoughts there would be helpful. ", "Victor Luis ", "It\u2019s a great question, because I think what you\u2019re looking at, as you open up our website, of course we always start with newest [unintelligible], with newness, and what you\u2019re seeing on the top of the page there is the Borough. And thankfully, the Borough is resonating incredibly well.", "As you go into the bottom of that first page, or onto page two or three, you\u2019ll see that we have not given up the $200 price bucket, $300/$400 price bucket, and that we continue to be very active in that space. As well, I think what you\u2019ll see is that we will play across channels a little bit in a bit more targeted way. ", "You\u2019re going to see us develop more specific products that will be in more price sensitive channels such as that with our wholesale [unintelligible], versus what you might find in the flagship store, versus what you might find in a secondary market, either here in the U.S. or internationally. These are strategies that we\u2019ve been leveraging globally quite successfully.", "There is, without a doubt, a very substantial opportunity above the $400 price point bucket. We know that that is becoming increasingly attractive not just here in the U.S., so I would ask us to think about that opportunity globally. As we see the logo business challenged, what is increasingly happening globally is brands headed further into the leather space. ", "As many of you know, our European competitors have a very hard time achieving price points below $1,500, below $2,000, when it comes to leather handbags. And so the opportunity for us is not just to play with lower prices, but to play with increased value and perception through quality, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to look to change the value proposition in the months ahead, but doing so by rebalancing the assortment, not by shifting completely. ", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you all for attending our Coach conference call this morning. As is our custom, it is now 9:30, and I will turn it over to Victor for some concluding remarks.", "Victor Luis ", "Thank you, Andrea, and thank you all for listening and for being on this journey with us. As we stated, while we\u2019re disappointed in our Q2 results, and as Lou has stated in the past, we know that we are at a very specific moment in time. We have tremendous confidence in the strength of our brand, in our vision, and in our team, and we are very excited about partnering together as this team executes the transformation already underway, and to get us back on the road to a healthy track and long term growth.

At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Andrea Shaw Resnick.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Victor Luis, Coach\u2019s CEO, and Jane Nielsen, Coach\u2019s CFO.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions.", "Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future performance.", "Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our third fiscal quarter 2014 results and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives. Jane Nielsen will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter. Following that, we will hold a question and answer session where we will be joined by Francine Della Badia, our President, North America Retail. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Victor will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I\u2019d like to turn it Victor Luis, Coach\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning. Thanks, Andrea, and welcome everyone. As noted in press release, during the third quarter, total sales declined as weakness in our North American women's bag and accessories business continued to offset strong growth in men's, footwear and robust sales in international market.", "Our business in North America remained challenging in the period exacerbated by the weather and shift of the Easter holiday. We experienced lower than expected traffic levels in our stores while our Internet results were impacted by our strategic decision to eliminate third party events as well as limit the access and invitations to our factory flash site.", "At the same time, results in China and Europe remained very strong. Importantly, we continued to advance our transformation initiatives and building the foundation to launch Stuart Vevers' first collection in September.", "Before getting into the financial details of the period, I want to start with key milestones in our transformation journey as I did last quarter. We will continue to provide you with these progress reports understanding that it will sometime before these changes manifest in our financial results.", "As you know, we're focused on the three primary aspects of the brand experience: products, stores and marketing. Starting with products. We continue to see strength in men's and footwear, two categories which have undergone significant evolution in previous years and quarters. In fact, men's represented 15% of our global sales in the third quarter and continued to positively contribute to our comps while we expanded our footwear distribution notably in international markets.", "The most significant achievement in the quarter was our first ever New York Fashion Week presentation in February. During the event, we unveiled Stuart's inaugural collection which will be in stores in September. The collection got a significant attention and the global press was uniformly positive bringing Coach into the fashion conversation.", "Moving on to stores. We have just announced a partnership with Studio Sofield. William Sofield's creative inspiration will enhance and elevate our retail stores building on the strong foundation we have created it in our lower Fifth Avenue in South Coast Plaza flagships. We will leverage our learnings from these two stores around customer service, multi-category merchandising, residential feel and the in-store discovery experience incorporating them into our next generation retail concept.", "And finally, on marketing where we are working on bringing to light Stuart's vision of the Coach woman and man for the season in a multilayered integrated marketing campaign. As our journey progresses, we have confidence in our vision of becoming a global lifestyle brand defining our view of modern luxury making it inspirational and approachable. And we are confident in our ability to execute against this vision.", "Turing to the results of last quarter, some key financials were, first, net sales on a reported basis totaled $1.1 billion versus $1.19 billion a year ago, a decrease of 7%. On a constant currency basis sales declined 5% for the quarter. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.68 as compared to $0.84 in the prior year's third quarter.", "Third, international sales increased 14% to $441 million from $385 million last year. On a constant currency basis international sales rose 20%. Sales in China remained very strong increasing over 25% with a continuation of double-digit costs, while sales in our directly operated locations in Asia and Europe rose significant as well. And fourth, North American sales fell 18% to $648 million from $792 million last year on a 21% comparable store sales decrease.", "During the quarter, looking at distribution, the company closed 13 North American full price retail locations. At the end of the period, there were 338 full price retail and 205 outlet stores in about 155 outlet malls in North America.", "Moving on to China, during the quarter, we opened 5 net new locations all on the Mainland bringing the total number to 147 locations including 128 on the Mainland in 52 cities.", "In Japan, we opened three net new locations during the quarter. There are 199 directly operated locations which include 151 full price and 48 factory locations in about 30 outlet malls.", "Also in Asia, during the third quarter, we closed one location in Taiwan and opened one and closed two locations in South Korea bringing the total to 96 directly operated locations in the balance of Asia including 48 in South Korea, 27 in Taiwan, 12 in Malaysia and 9 in Singapore.", "In Coach Europe, we opened two directly operated doors during the period. As of the end of the quarter, over 26 directly operated locations in Europe across the UK, France, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Germany. We also opened several wholesale doors in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Switzerland.", "Moving on to sales by channel and geography and starting with our domestic businesses, our total revenues in North America declined 18% for the quarter with our directly operated businesses also down 18%. As noted, total Q3 same store sales declined 21%. While our overall performance in women's handbag and accessories remain disappointing, our men's and footwear categories continues to perform well. In department stores, our sales trends at POS were slightly below the prior year while shipments into department stores declined as planned.", "For perspective, we estimate that the rate of growth of the North American premium women's handbag and accessories market decelerated slightly reflecting the overall retail slowdown from weather and the Easter shift, but still rose at a high single digit rate in the March quarter.", "Similar to what we've done over the last two quarters I want to provide some underlying texture to the comp performance, both in those areas where we have seen progress and those where we see the opportunities to improve our positioning in North America.", "As was the case industry-wide, in-store traffic continue to decline with the ShopperTrack retail traffic index which includes also lifestyle and outlets malls down 16% for the quarter, impacted by weather as well as the Easter shift to April. The NRTI focused on indoor malls having less of weather impact was down far less, negative 2%, but also continued weak. In aggregate, conversion and transaction side were neutral to our store business while traffic drove the comp declines.", "While in previous quarters and years, we were able to offset slowing in-store traffic on the Internet, as expected, our online business did not contribute positively to our overall North America comp in the third quarter. Specifically, our year-over-year comparison continued to be impacted by our strategic decisions to both eliminate third-party flash events this fiscal year and limit the access and invitations to our factory flash site. Excluding these factors, our Internet comp would have contributed to our aggregate performance.", "There are some sustained themes in our North American women's business. Leather continues to well outpace logo across all channels and we are designing into this trend. It\u2019s a long-term shift that favors Coach given our heritage in leather goods and our global sourcing network of tanneries. Small bags also continue to trend well.", "We also saw relative strength in our elevated product in our retail stores. More generally, the above $400 price bucket grew in penetration and represented 21% of handbag sales with the strongest performance at the upper end of our range, $600 and higher. Outside of handbags, we continue to see strengths in our lifestyle categories in Q3. Footwear, which relaunched last March in about 174 price retail locations, rose in penetration from about 6% to about 8% at higher AURs reflective of the broader passionate assortment in these stores.", "We are also seeing a positive response to our expanded men's and footwear assortment in factory stores.", "We remain focused on building our market share within the fragmented nearly $25 billion global premium footwear category through both distribution, adding international and wholesale doors and by maximizing footwear productivity through mix, increasing AURs and overall penetration level across all of our businesses.", "At the end of Q3, nearly 180 Coach International retail locations offered the updated women's fashion collection and the response from customers has been excellent.", "Turning to men's. As we discussed, we're also continuing to drive our men's business globally through standalone and dual gender stores and by dedicating more space for broader men's assortment in existing retail stores. In the third quarter, Coach's sales of men's bags and accessories continued to grow at double-digit rate globally.", "Looking ahead, we remain bullish about the prospects for our global men's business where we're continuing to target about $700 million in sales in FY'14, up about 20% from last year.", "Turning now to our International segment, which represents about a third of Coach's business, sales rose 20% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter and 14% on a reported basis due to the weak yen. As mentioned, China sales rose over 25% from prior year fuelled by double-digit same-store sales and distribution growth. We are very pleased by the continued development of this market which bodes well for our global travel retail business where the Mainland Chinese tourist plays an increasingly important role. Further, Coach is also recognized as both a dual gender and lifestyle brand as men's products and women's lifestyle products taken together represent roughly a third of sales.", "Our other Asia direct businesses outside of China and Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore, also posted strong aggregate growth increasing at a double-digit rate for the quarter with comparable store sales gains.", "As a reminder, we anniversaried the purchase of our retail operations in Malaysia and Korea during the first quarter of this fiscal year, so our business is apples to apples no longer benefiting from a wholesale to retail step up.", "In Japan, we posted 10% increase in constant currency due in large part to a pull forward in demand related to the April consumption tax increase while dollar sales declined 2% reflecting the weaker yen. Therefore, we would expect a reversal in Q4 of approximately equal size bringing the annual sales back in line with first half trends.", "In Europe, where our brand is small but growing rapidly, we generated significant sales growth at POS and strong comps in the quarter. We continue to believe that Europe represents a significant long-term opportunity for Coach both with domestic shoppers and the international tourists notably in key European cities where the affordable luxury segment is outperforming traditional luxury.", "Moving on to distribution, as our annual plans haven't changed materially from what we have shared in the past I'll be brief. We now believe our square footage globally will increase around 7% in FY'14 slightly below our original guidance of 9% primarily due to North American wholesale where we purposefully deferred some openings and case line to open-sell conversion to align with the next generation retail store design in FY'15.", "In North America, our directly operated square footage will be up about 7% driven by about 15 new store openings focused on factory, about 20 expansions within the context of our transformation and 15 to 20 previously announced full price closures.", "In China, as we've discussed, we are on schedule to open about 30 net new dual gender locations increasing our square footage by about 25% and, as noted in our press release, our business is now on course to deliver sales of over $540 million.", "While we expect to open a few stores in our other direct Asia market, our primary focus remains on productivity. We have been realizing the benefits of Coach's direct management in these markets and are pleased with the development of both our teams and our brand.", "In Japan, we expect that net square footage growth will increase slightly with the opening of about 5 to 10 new locations most of them dedicated men doors. And in Europe, including the UK for FY'14, we still expect to open about 10 retail locations focused on key European cities and a growing number of wholesale locations.", "As you know, we also have a significant and growing distributor run businesses in other markets. Our primary areas of focus are, first, other Asia-Pacific markets, second, Central and South America and, third, the Middle East.", "Before handing the call over to Jane Nielsen, our CFO, I wanted to reinforce that we are excited about our vision for the brand and the long-term benefits of the initiatives currently underway, but we also recognize this is a multi-year journey. We understand that it will take time as in the case of our first reinvention for our re-platforming to drive improved performance.", "As such, we expect sales in FY'15 to moderate further as we positioned the brand for healthy sustainable growth. In addition to reduced sales, increased investments on transformation initiatives including stores and marketing will impact EPS.", "I wanted to take this opportunity to provide this initial guidepost, but I look forward to providing additional context and, more importantly, our plans to drive brand vibrancy and long-term value creation during our analyst day on June 4.", "Now I'll let Jane to provide some additional further detail on our financials and outlook for the balance of the year. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Victor. Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies; let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results. Our revenues decreased 7% with North America declining 18% and international increasing 14% in dollar. As noted, on a constant currency basis revenues were down 5% overall, while international sales rose 20%.", "Net income for the quarter totaled $191 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.68. This compared to net income of $239 million and earnings per share of $0.84 in the prior year's quarter. Our operating income totaled $263 million as compared to $348 million reported last year, while operating margin was 23.9% versus 29.3%.", "During the quarter, gross profit totaled $781 million versus $880 million a year ago. As expected, gross margin was 71.1% versus 74.1% for the prior year.", "Our expense ratio in Q3 totaled 47.2% compared to 44.8% reported in the year-ago quarter.", "Our SG&A dollars actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis as we manage variable cost to the lower sales level, adjusted our outlook for lower performance based compensation level and benefited from the weaker yen.", "We also realized the benefit of our 4Q '13 restructuring actions and sale of RK, which funded higher spending on Coach brand marketing and helped to offset the impact of taking Coach Europe in-house.", "Inventory levels at the end of quarter were $584 million, 13% above the $516 million reported at the end of last year's Q3. As mentioned on our last call, we plan for inventory levels to be up over the balance of fiscal year based on several key factors including distribution growth, the acquisition of Coach Europe, higher average unit cost and our expansion into lifestyle category. Clearly, sales below our expectations also contributed. We are carefully managing our open-to-buy to allow for the appropriate investments in Stuart fall collection.", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $775 million, as compared with $928 million a year ago with a substantial portion held outside the U.S.", "On the balance sheet, as noted earlier this year, we continue to deploy international cash into high quality investments with higher yields and duration over a year and, in turn, there is a shift between and cash and short-term investments into other non-current assets. As expected, we ended the third quarter with $210 million outstanding on our credit facility in order to cover our working capital needs in light of our investments in our business and our new corporate headquarters.", "During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired out 3.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $47.99, spending a total of $175 million. Year-to-date, we repurchased 525 million of common stock. At the end of the period about $835 million remained under the company's current repurchase authorization.", "As noted in our press release, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3375 per common share payable at the end of June, maintaining our annual rate of $1.35.", "It is important to mention that we've modified the timing of our annual dividend rate assessment to align with the company's fiscal year end and the review of our annual operating plan.", "Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $105 million, compared to $209 million last year during Q3.", "Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $54 million versus an inflow of $167 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $51 million versus $43 million in the same quarter a year ago. We now expect that CapEx this year will be in the area of $250 million to $260 million, primarily due to new store openings and expansion across all geographies and investments in the technology and infrastructure necessary to enable our global expansion and transformation.", "The decline from previous guidance of about $280 million relates to a shift in the timing of retail store and wholesale remodel and conversions into FY'15.", "While many of the metrics we've guided to remain intact, including our expectations for gross margin rate and SG&A investment spend, based on our third quarter results, we've modified our outlook as follows. First on sales, we now expect to deliver a mid-single-digit decline in constant currency and a high-single-digit decrease in dollars for the full year. This includes a fourth quarter sale decline of about 10% with our North America comps in the range of our Q3 run rate.", "Gross margin is still projected at about 70% for the year, which includes a fourth quarter margin of about 69%, reflecting our usual seasonality between the third and fourth quarters.", "We now expect total SG&A dollars for the year to be roughly even with prior year, with an increased investments generally funded by the restructuring actions taken in last year's Q4, but with some deleverage on the lower sales forecast. This guidance reflects a mid-single-digit increase in SG&A dollar in Q4, reflective of marketing spend and some timing of financial adjustments compared to prior year. Taken together, and based on the lower than expected sales, we would now expect operating margins to be in the area of 25% to 26% for the year.", "And finally, our tax rate is expected to be around 30% for the year benefiting from certain discrete items as well as favorable geographic mix.", "Regarding our balance sheet cash flow and capital allocation, we continue to have a strong balance sheet and operating free cash flow. As we've noted in the past, our first priority for cash is to reinvest in our business. And of course, we remain committed to our dividend. However, given our current outlook for the business, domestic cash flow requirements, including funding our transformation initiatives to drive a long-term growth, we do not anticipate further share repurchases during the remainder of FY'14.", "As Victor mentioned, we look forward to sharing more of our plan to drive productivity, restore growth and create long-term shareholder value at our analyst day in June.", "I'd now like to open it up the Q&A. We are ready to take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions).", "The first question for day is from Bob Durbil with Nomura.", "Bob Durbil - Nomura", "Victor, on the comments as you look to FY'15, I was wondering if you could just give us some insight when you think we will start to see the benefits of the transformation play out?", "Victor Luis", "Good morning, Bob, thank you for your question. We obviously have been very consistent in saying that we're on a multi-year journey. We're really excited about the vision that we have. In fact, we just think yesterday reviewing our spring product and I could not be prouder of the work that Stuart and the team are doing. We also showed the team the new Studio Sofield design that will be the basis of our retail rollouts moving forward from the fall.", "We also understand, however, that our vision while clear is not yet known to all of you and we're really excited about sharing it with you and taking you on this journey with us, which we plan to do June 4 when we show you exactly what we were doing a lot on our product, work around our stores and, of course, the marketing plans that we will have around brand transformation.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Oliver Chen with Citigroup.", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup", "Hey guys, thank you. Regarding what you're seeing right now in the outlet channel, could you brief us on the promotional environment there? And also, as you undergo the transformation, could you just let us know regarding full price versus outlet in terms of what we should think about as product and marketing gets refined further? Thank you.", "Francine Della Badia", "Hi, Oliver, it's Fran. As noted, we were more promotional during the quarter specifically in North America factory and specifically on (inaudible). So part of the cost decline was due to deceleration of the traffic in the factory channel, but we did push the business a little bit harder there. So that was our positioning in factory for the quarter.", "In terms of going forward, we were also less promotional on the (inaudible). So we did limit access to the site as Victor discussed in his prepared remarks.", "Victor Luis", "Oliver, in terms of your second question in regards to brand transformation, we're of course are looking at all channel as part of our transformation not just full priced factory but also of course our wholesale channel where we made some comments in terms of the work that we need to do and replatforming that business as well. Saying that we understand that our full price business must lead and all of our attention to-date or the vast majority of our attention to-date has been on full price product stores and marketing. We expect that Stuart's focus on the factory channel will lead to rollout a product in that channel from spring summer with some initial products coming in December in a small way.", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you. And just as a quick follow up as we look to this transformation taking place which lever are you most encouraged about going forward on a long-term basis which would be kind of the leading inflection point in terms of which comp lever would we monitor?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. We know, Oliver, that traffic is a lagging indicator. We would expect conversion to be the first sign of transformation taking hold and, of course, moving forward as well potentially from slight increases in AUR as we continue to shift our assortment.", "Oliver Chen - Citigroup", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Victor, to your line as what changes we should be expecting to see (inaudible) to the stores in September with the new fall collection, meaning, how many stores of the days will be showcasing the newest store then? How will the department stores handle the launch and how should that rollout progress as we move in individually and then (inaudible)? Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you. We will see of course the major shift in our full price channel with 80% to 85% of the skews transforming to Stuart new collection globally, that is, across all of our full price locations. In addition, we will start with the new Sofield and that means wholesale as well of course.", "In addition, we will start seeing the new Sofield concept rolled out in key flagship stores in North America in the fall. We will start with Rodeo Drive, AOL-TimeWarner and as well one international flagship with Shinjuku in Tokyo also being replatformed. And then from holiday, as I mentioned earlier to Oliver's question, we begin to see the flow in of a few skews in our factory channel which have been inspired by the new collections that we have in full price with a much broader roll out coming in spring summer as our attention turns to that channel as well.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Okay, great, and then just a quick follow up question of that be the Easter impact to your quarter that you guys has reported, just curious if you guys could quantify that maybe I missed it?", "Jane Nielsen", "About 100 basis points.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Okay. Thanks, good luck.", "Jane Nielsen", "And then just we have also called out weather, it was about 200 basis points.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee", "Got it. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Brian Tunick with JPMC.", "Brian Tunick - JPMC", "", "Thanks, good morning. Wanted to talk a little about the real estate and your conversation about remodels and conversions pushing into 2015, should we, A, expect CapEx then to shift into 2015? Does that impact how you thinking about the buyback program which I think it was $1.4 billion over a two-year plan? And then on the store closing side, how many leases come up on the full price side over the next couple of years, and would you consider accelerating the store closing program if comps don't meet your plans?", "And then the second question is on your guidance, Victor, for next year as we try to get ahead of it. What do you mean by sales expected to moderate further? And any more color on the earnings line as well would be helpful. Thanks very much.", "Jane Nielsen", "Brian, why don't I take the first part of your multi-part part question and then I will turn it over to Victor. So in terms of what we called out in terms of CapEx, we do expect that the remodels and wholesale renovations will roll in to FY'15. We are looking across, as a part of our business transformation, all of the needs required for brand transformation and that will certainly be a part of that we move forward in to CapEx.", "As it relates to our share buyback, what we have guided to was about 700 million of share buybacks. We have completed 525 million, as I mentioned. And it's really based on our current cash flow forecast, our domestic cash requirements to really invest in our business, and that's our primary focus, and we will continue to keep you to update you on that as we move forward. As we have called out in this quarter, we are very committed to our dividend as our primary means of returning capital to shareholders.", "And then as you step backed and asked about our store leases. As a part of our transformation and I think as Fran mentioned on the last call, we are looking critical across our entire fleet and across our entire asset base and aligning that for long-term brand growth and aligning it with our transformation.", "Victor Luis", "", "Brian, in reference to your question on FY'15, we really don't have much more texture to provide at this moment. Really looking forward to sitting with all of you on June 4, sharing with you all of the details and plans and texture around the guidance that we've provided and sharing of course the vision as well as having all of you meet the talented group of individuals who are executing around our plans.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is form David Scheck with Stifel.", "David Scheck - Stifel", "", "Hi, good morning. My one question is when you think about the 13 stores, full price stores in North America, could you take us through your thought process on culling stores, and I understand there are still stores to be opened, but just the thought process how you look at markets, the stores themselves or the future vision as it pertains to rightsizing store base? Thank you.", "Jane Nielsen", "Hi, David. So we've been taking a look at our total fleet as undergoing a very comprehensive review first of the economics of the stores. We've also been looking at our 12 major markets and really trying to understand how penetrated as a brand we are in those markets. And obviously economics and profitability will drive most of our decision as we go forward and continue to assess the fleet. We are doing this across full price stores, factory stores and wholesale so that we have a very comprehensive understanding of the brand positioning. As I said to our most important 12 markets (inaudible) throughout the entire fleet. We are looking at a number of different metrics and evaluating it so we can continue to be opportunistic on a go forward basis.", "Victor Luis", "David, I would only add that of course we are leveraging all of the data that we have internally in terms of name capture from all of our location to understand consumer movements across channels and within channels and, of course, looking at opportunities both from a competitive perspective as well as just mall vibrancy to understand where we can leverage, as Fran mentioned, other channels whether it be our wholesale presence, which is quite extensive, or of course more importantly and very much a topic de jure for all of us in the retail space is the power of the Internet and how we can leverage that in a transformative way as well.", "David Scheck - Stifel", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Hi, everybody. Given the weakening traffic at the outlet malls, why would you be opening 15 stores there? I know that's where all the action is in terms of new mall development, but it just seems like a lot? And then could you verify when the Herald Square store goes into the comp base?", "Francine Della Badia", "Yeah, okay, hi. As you know, our factory store division is incredibly profitable. So we're taking a look at all the new store development that is happening on the factory side and looking very carefully at those opportunities and we continue to see given premium mall development with the increasing co-tenancy from European luxury players. Therefore, we are proud of our positioning in these all and centered and also deliver incredible productivity and profitability in the new stores that we plan to open. So that is contributing to our revenue or top line.", "Victor Luis", "", "Harold Square is going to comp in October.", "Francine Della Badia", "", "Third part, yeah, sorry.", "Victor Luis", "", "Comp in October. ", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Okay. Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "", "I would only add to what Fran said in reference to the factory outlet channel. As you know and we have discussed this a few times and I think you hinted too, is the vibrancy of this channel globally and it is relative. Of course, we see the full price channel in general, especially in the U.S. market suffering much more dramatically from traffic trends. Of course, Q3 is a very unique situation given the weather impact and given that all of these malls or the vast majority of them of course are outdoor malls and, therefore, would suffer more at this moment in time.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "", "Thanks. Good morning. Question on SG&A and kind of the philosophy. I think it is going to be roughly flat, may be down in dollar terms this year based on your guidance. Are you thinking about as you -- you have got all these different initiatives in play and transformation projects going on. When do you think about ramping up to spend in dollar terms? Are you going to wait to kind of see an inflection as a new product in a new direction under Stuart on the creative director side starts to see the sales impact of that or is it some -- is the spending really going to ramp up ahead of kind of any turn in sales? Thanks.", "Jane Nielson", "Yeah. Omar, I think as we called a big part of our SG&A guidance for the fourth quarter is a ramp up in marketing, as we anticipate Stuart's products arriving in stores in September. So we are committed to investing in our transformation. And we are committing to investing in this now in order to drive the momentum as product arrives in stores.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "", "Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you Omar.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Hi. Can you talk little about -- if you think about full price in department stores, how would -- how did the business differ in Q3, was there any difference in terms of what sold through and what you are seeing there? And then, on the transformation. How do you see the marketing plan for both international and North America timing and cadence what you're seeing? And just lastly, inventory, as you get through the end of the year, how should we be thinking about it? Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "I am going to let Jane in a moment to discuss inventory. In relation to the question on the wholesale channel, Dana, we have not really seen dramatic change. In trend, that channel over all was less impacted by traffic declines this past quarter obviously for many reasons and has performed generally better than the overall mall environment.", "In terms of marketing, we are very focused on right now with Stuart in leveraging external and internal resources in putting together a very detailed plan. We look forward to sharing that with some texture, both in terms of the visual imagery and the actual media plan with all of you along with PR and press and events in the like at our June 4, analyst day.", "We are really looking of course at a multiyear journey to drive consumer perception around the brand. We know that product and our store experience will be key in that but, of course, are very excited about communicating this vision to consumers. It will be a global campaign. Obviously, in terms of execution there may be some tweaks by markets around language and the like, but we do see it being very consistent and global.", "Francine Della Badia", "Just on inventory level, Dana, we called out that for the balance of the year we expect our inventory level to remain high. Based on some of the factors that we called out related to our business distribution growth, higher AUCs,, the acquisition of Coach Europe and our expansion into lifestyle. Also, our inventory obviously is impacted by our sales growth that is below our expectation. As we move through, we are -- we still continue to look at our factory channels, our primary means of moving through inventory. We've always had a small portion of our product in disposition. We'd expect to increase that somewhat as we move through the balance of these.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.", "Liz Dunn - Macquarie", "Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, I was been kind of dancing around the little bit, but I was wondering what appetite you have or tolerance you have for sort of planned reduction in your sales base to restore the company back to health? Obviously, you made this change with sort of your presence in the flash sale sites and there is the guidance -- preliminary guidance for 2015. But would you consider taking sort of a bigger planned haircut to sales to restore the company back to -- which historic health it's still quite healthy, but you know what I mean?", "And then also, I just had a question on the 12 markets that you identified focusing on, what percent of your stores and your sales are those 12 markets? And are you seeing some dynamic that is different in those 12 markets versus the rest of your store base? Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "", "Thank you, Liz. I think in terms of planned reduction, we realize that it's obviously a delicate balance. And as you referenced, we see ourselves doing the said. Obviously, the strategic steps that we have taken in relation to all of the work with reducing partnerships with third party sites, reducing invitations to our database in terms of our flash websites, are all actions that we have taken towards protecting our long-term brand health. And we really will then look at of course driving all the positive steps that we need to take in terms of product, in terms of marketing and in terms of stores to drive relevance and to drive admiration around the brand and, of course, as mentioned earlier, conversion and eventually sales through those actions.", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.", "Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America", "", "Thank you. Good morning. How much testing of style and colors have you been able to do for this fall's launch versus prior seasons?", "Francine Della Badia", "", "Hi, there. We have not tested any of Stuart's new products. As you know, Stuart joined us about six months ago. So he has been very, very busy executing to the new product development for the -- for his fall collection.", "Victor Luis", "", "While we have not tested anything to-date, we will be looking up one or two style in -- later in spring, early summer which will guide our buys. But more importantly, I would add what we know and have shared, which is that the editorial reviews have been absolutely fantastic. And our first audience of course is always our internal teams and our global buying teams who have been here actually this week and last week. Last week, they were here to review our outlook products presentation for spring and this week they are reviewing the full price product. And I can tell you that the reactions have been terrific. I certainly, personally have never been more optimistic about a new collection in my seven years at Coach than what we are about to launch in the fall and what we are seeing for spring today.", "Francine Della Badia", "", "I just want to go back to Luis this question because we did not answered the part two, which is how important are the 12 markets. The 12 markets represent about 50% of our overall sales. They represent more than that in traffic. And in terms of consumer perception, there are keys to really changing brand perception. And so, we are going to focus on the 12 markets first, certainly with Studio Sofield and the brand transformation effort that we have around marketing product in stores.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "", "We'll go to the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "", "One thing that I think is counter intuitive, I think we have talked about on past calls is how you are going to be able to go to market with price point you want in the full price stores, which I think would include raising price point. While we have seen how hard it is for both you guys and for anyone to reduce the amount of coupon, your promotionality in stores like the factory outlets, maybe you can help us just think about how we can think about pricing integrity for the brand based on where you are at today?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. It's a terrific question, Michael, because as you suggested it is of course counterintuitive. I would just caution though that the strategy is not to increase prices across the board. The strategy is for us to continue to work on rebalancing our assortments across various price buckets. We have absolutely no intention to give up on the $300 sweet spot in our full price channel and slightly below that that exist in the wholesale channel and we are going to be developing into those price points moving forward. And we look forward to showing you side by side the current product as well as the future product in those price buckets in the increased value that we are working to provide consumers.", "And moving forward, value is not just about a price point. It's going to be about quality great design and of course all of the aspirational imagery that we are going to developing around the Coach brand through what we do in our store environments, customer experience in marketing. So we are really excited about that. And I think seeing that holistically, which hopefully we will be able to show all of you on June 4, will provide a little bit more clarity around the vision that we have on how we are bringing back to life.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Okay. And then, Jane, if I could just follow with one question as for as the share repurchases, any way you can give us some early thinking on how you would look ahead and say potentially this is what would cause us to restart share repurchases? Thank you.", "Jane Nielson", "As we look up back, our priority for cash remain the same. Our first priority is we have always said the best thing we can do for our shareholder is to invest in the growth of our business. Our second priority is we'll look to make value accretive acquisitions, and then our third priority is to return capital shareholders. As we said today, we are committed to dividend and we really view repurchases as what we would do with excess cash flow.", "So those are the priorities and that's our view on the purchases, and so it's really about our investment need and our outlook as we move forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Randy Konik with Jefferies.", "Randy Konik - Jefferies", "Hey great. Thanks a lot. I guess, my question is regarding the fiscal fourth quarter comp guidance. I think you said it was going to be similar to the third quarter. How do we think about that given you said the third quarter was negatively impacted I think by 300 basis points because of the Easter shift and weather?", "And then can you kind of talk to us about on one hand it sounds like you are trying to elevate the brand which is kind of and you spoke about the penetration with the increase of higher price points, but yet you are continuing to expand the outlet channel distribution. How are we supposed to think about that balancing act or what's the vision long-term for how the outlet sits in this business model, the price point sit in the business model and then how the logo sits in this business model? Thanks.", "Jane Nielsen", "Yeah, so Randy as we think about our fourth quarter comp I think we have been clear that we are not going to call a change in trend in the business until we have seen it. As we give you guidance in any quarter, we give you our best estimate based on what we are seeing in the business at that time. And obviously as we called out clearly, traffic deterioration in our business was the key factor that led to the change in comp. We clearly had Easter overlap, we had a weather impact, but traffic was the real challenge relative to our expectation.", "Victor Luis", "In terms of your second question which is indeed, as you suggested, a really important balancing act, I would just say that this is not a change in our business model. The word elevation is not about transforming Coach into what we perceive or what may be perceived as a traditional luxury brand. Indeed, while some may believe that affordable and luxury are two word that don't go together, this brand has been created and has as its purpose affordable luxury as its positioning, and that\u2019s what we will do moving forward.", "Indeed, we are really excited as I mentioned earlier about providing extreme value to the consumers at really great price points. Quality, great design, great materials, craftsmanship are all a part of what has made Coach great and what differentiates us from many of our traditional competitors and especially the new accessible luxury competitors that have arisen in the market space. and that's part of our mantra and what we are going to reclaim.", "As it comes to the factory channel, there are some who believe that there is may be a magic formula to full price doors to a factory door or 3:1 or 4:1 whatever it maybe, I haven't seen that play in our own analytics. Certainly, there is a fine balance and it really comes down to consumer perceptions across the channel. As we've suggested and talked about, we have taken very important steps as it relates to how we deal with the online EFX customer in terms of trying to manage those impression.", "And as it relates to the actual outlook channel, we will make any moves in a very careful way in terms of selecting doors, looking at cannibalization and doing so by markets as Fran suggested earlier.", "When we really talk about advancing the brand across the 12 markets we are talking about doing so across all channel. So we will make a move across full price, factory and wholesale and drive brand perception first and foremost across these 12 key major metropolitan areas in the U.S., and as we do so globally as well across the major fashion capitals.", "Operator", "Thank you. The last question today is from Faye Landes, Cowen and Company.", "Faye Landes - Cowen and Company", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. First of all I may -- two things. First of all, I may have missed this but Brian questioned earlier about the cadence message here of sales like it should be model -- its preliminary, but how we should be modeling next year. And also, if you could just talk about some of your staffing like you had a couple of people leave Jeffery Hill and Bunch Javan, if its correct pronunciation, but who is in that job now? Are there roles that you need to fill?", "Victor Luis", "With respect to the team, we have obviously a very experienced senior management team. We're very happy for Jeffery and his own move in his career. What I can share with you is that Stuart has a tremendous amount of experience in the men's space. Just yesterday we've seen the new men's collection which has continued to evolve and look absolutely great, and we're excited to show that you on June 4 as well and you'll be able to see it live.", "Jane Nielsen", "Yes, just in terms of FY'15 I think Victor called out that our expectation at this point is that sales will moderate further. And we're not giving anymore specific shape as to FY'15.", "Faye Landes - Cowen and Company", "To moderate further that means more negative?", "Jane Nielsen", "Correct.", "Victor Luis", "Correct.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you. That concludes our Q&A. I will now turn it over to Victor Luis for some concluding remarks.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you everybody for joining us. Of course, we're disappointed by our North American performance especially as it relates our women's handbag and accessories business, but we are incredibly excited and happy to be and what is -- and continues to be a very vibrant category. Our international business, our men's business, our footwear all point into the positive direction.", "And as I mentioned earlier, unfortunate that you all can't see what we're seeing and experiencing in the last six months with the steps that we've taken forward towards brand transformation. I am more optimistic than at any point during my seven years at Coach in terms of the clarity of our vision and how the actions that we are taking move in a very position direction toward bringing that vision to life and very excited about sharing that with all of you when we're together June 4. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the Coach earnings conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at COACH, Andrea Shaw Resnick.", "Andrea Resnick", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Victor Luis, COACH's Chief Executive Officer; Francine Della Badia, President, North America Retail and Jane Nielsen, COACH's CFO.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions.", "Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a complete list of risks and important factors.", "Also, please note that historical trends may not be indicative of future performance.", "Now, let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our first fiscal quarter 2015 results, and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives. Francine Della Badia will speak to our North America business, product performance and review our key programs for the Holiday season. Jane Nielsen will conclude with details on financial and operational results for the quarter and our outlook. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session, the Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 AM. We will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I'd now like to introduce Victor Luis, COACH's CEO.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning. Thanks Andrea and welcome everyone.", "As noted in our press release, our first quarter results were in line with our expectation and our annual guidance at continued international growth was offset by our North American handbag business where we have strategically reduced promotional events. Importantly, we made progress on the transformation planned outlined during our Analyst and Investor Day this summer to address brand challenges and bring greater fashion relevance to COACH across the three pillars of product, stores, and marketing.", "The launch of Stuart Vevers first collection in September was a significant milestone in this journey and we look forward to building on our early success over the upcoming seasons. While we recognize that many of our initiatives will take time to be evident than our financial results, our performance to-date has been on plan and we are confident that we have the creative direction, team and resources to execute our brand transformation.", "Before we get into the details of the quarter and as promised, I thought we would share some of the actions we have taken in just the last three months. Starting with product, as mentioned we launched fall 2014 collection and retail stores globally on September 12th as planned with the full assortment including ready-to-wear introduced an approximately 40 global flagships also as planned.", "While at his early days, the fall 2014 product introductions are performing to expectations. In addition, we held our second event, New York Fashion Week presentation in early September showing our spring 2015 collections to The Fashion Press and once again the press was overwhelmingly positive building on the response to Fall 2014 and driving fashion, credibility and buzz. The key to elevating the brand perception in the mind of the consumer. We are also on track to launch Stuart's product in outlet stores globally this spring. And in North American department stores, we continue to grow our exclusive product program.", "While we are looking forward to our first stores to open or reopen with our new modern luxury concept starting tomorrow with our flagship in Shinjuku in Tokyo. These stores represent a more complete expression of our transformation. Over the next few weeks, we will be reopening our store at Time Warner center in New York City and our Rodeo Drive flagship in Beverly Hills.", "Prior to holidays, we expect to have a total of 20 stores opened globally in the new concept including two more here in the US, Fashion Valley in San Diego and Americana in Manhattan, Long Island. And we are on track to renovate a total of 150 retail locations in FY15 and to open 60 new stores globally in this new concept.", "In North American department stores, we have already completed 140 projects installing open sale environments and replacing the old case lines and have seen an improvement versus the balance of doors. We now expect to convert over 300 locations from case line presentations to open sale this fiscal year.", "We also successfully launched The Shop Manager program in the wholesale channel adding approximately 25 managers and key doors with the goal of adding a total of 50 shop managers in fiscal 2015.", "We are in the process of finalizing negotiations to close approximately 70 retail locations with the majority of closures occurring shortly after the holiday season. And we remain on track to full 13 men's only outlet locations into existing stores leveraging the team and to cross shopping opportunity. We expect that these will happen after holiday to minimize disruption during the busy selling season.", "We also expect to close the two outlet stores identified in key markets as part of our learning agenda during the second half.", "On the marketing and customer experience front, we dramatically increased our print advertising pages with improved positioning notably into September fashion books. We also saw significant increases in editorial mentions and rank in all three major markets, North America, Japan, and China.", "And as we increased our positive brand impressions, we also pulled back on promotional activity as announced we adopted a semi-annual sales model back in June consistent with the luxury fashion brands and had no preferred customer events in our retail stores this quarter nor any COACH days in North American department stores. In addition, we reduced the cadence of DOS flash sales from three a week last year to once a week this quarter. By the end of FY15, we expect to be down to once a two events per month.", "We are continuing to evolve our customer experience model to align with the evolution of the product and the new store concept. So while there are much heavy lifting remaining in front of us, we are very pleased with what we've accomplished this quarter and would continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.", "Turning to the results of the last quarter, some key financials were. First, net sales on a reported basis totaled $1.04 billion versus $1.15 billion a year ago, a decrease of 10%. On a constant currency basis, sales declined 9% for the quarter. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.53 excluding transformation related charges as compared to $0.77 in the prior year's first quarter. Third, international sales increased 4% to $381 million from $365 million last year. On a constant currency basis international sales rose 6%. As expected, China sales rose 10% with positive comparable store sales. While sales in our directly operated locations in Asia and Europe rose as well. And fourth, North American sales fell 19% to $634 million from $778 million last year, on a 24% comparable store sales decreased.", "During the quarter, looking at distribution and consistent with our annual guidance, there was little change in our global directly operated door count. In total, adding five net locations worldwide. One in North America, one in Japan, two in mainland China and one in Europe. As you know, we are primarily focused on re-platforming our stores, elevating brand perception, optimizing our store fleet and opening new location selectively in key markets.", "Moving on to sales by channel and geography and starting with our domestic businesses. Our total revenues in North America declined 19% for the quarter, with our directly operated businesses also down 19%. As noted, total Q1 same store sales declined 24% with the reduction in DOS events, pressuring total comp by about 5 percentage points. Fran will provide further context around our North American business shortly.", "In department stores, our sales transact DOS were similar to the company directly operated stores while shipments into the channel declined to a lesser degree, reflecting receipt of new fall product at quarter end. As mentioned, consistent with our own retail stores, weak curtails promotional activity. Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessories market rose at a high single-digit rate in the September quarter in line with recent trends. As the category continues to benefit from the secular shift into accessories from apparel.", "Turning to men's, which represents 18% of global categories spend or about $7 billion to-date. As we discussed, we are also continuing to drive our men's business globally. Primarily through new dual-gender stores. As expected in the first quarter, COACH's global sales of men's bags and accessories rose slightly, impacted both by the Yen and the pullback of promotion and DOS in North America.", "Looking ahead, we remained bullish about the prospects for our global men's business and are continuing to target $1 billion in sales in 2017.", "Before we discuss international sales Francine Della Badia has joined us today to provide some more insight into our North American business and initiatives for the season ahead.", "Franc?", "Francine Della Badia", "Thanks Victor. The first quarter marked the implementation of many initiative we outlined to the Analyst Day, to change and elevate brand perception in the minds of our consumers. In the early days, the impact of these actions played out as expected both globally and in North America.", "Domestically, we kicked off our semi-annual sales strategy at the end of Q4 and ran it through the first couple of weeks in July. Q1 was the first quarter that we curtailed preferred customer events.", "As forecast, this impacted conversion rate to the quarter, while traffic trends remained weak on a year-over-year basis. Given the shift in the type and cadence of promotional activity and as anticipated, average unit retail rose as did average transaction size. Bear in mind that the new product arrived in stores in week 11 of the 13 week quarter that would had little impact on results.", "In outlet stores, the overall environment was definitely more promotional especially in our space with our competitive set becoming even more aggressive, traffic levels were weak and conversion was negative while ticket was up slightly. We did see a very positive consumer response to our new Kuwait collection which carried a higher AUR underscoring the premise that emotion can trump price even in outlets. As planned, our store comp was down high-teens with our total comp pressured an additional five points by DOS as we pulled back from three flash sales events a week to only one event per week.", "Over the year, we expect our store comp trend to improve as new product penetration growth across both channels, more stores are re-platformed and marketing intensifies. However our internet comp were worsen as we further curtail events.", "As discussed, evolving brand perception is critically important in North America notably for women\u2019s bag and accessory business where we\u2019ve been the most challenged. During the first quarter, we presented a more focused assortment of handbags in retail stores with SKUs down about 25% from prior year and saw handbags increased as a percent of our women\u2019s business.", "Within our handbag business in retail stores, we saw absolute strength in our elevated product. More generally, the above $400 price bucket grew in penetration saw a positive comp and represented 30% of handbag sales versus roughly 21% last year.", "At the same time, we maintained a balanced assortment with small bags continuing to trend well and our overall handbag AURs remaining consistent with prior year. More broadly, leather continues to outpace Logo across all channels and we're designing into this trend. It\u2019s both the shift that favors COACH longer term, given our heritage in leather goods and elevates our impressions in the marketplace. In fact, Logo represented only 6% in women\u2019s handbags in our retail business down from 8% last year.", "Outside of handbags, we continue to see relative strength in our lifestyle categories in Q1. Women\u2019s footwear held its penetration at last year\u2019s level at about 9% of North America retail sales in those stores carrying the full offering. We are also seeing a positive response to our expanded men\u2019s and women\u2019s footwear assortment in outlet stores.", "In total, we saw a significant increase in footwear sales across all directly operated channels in North America. Before I move on to holiday initiatives, I know that you want to hear about how the new fall 2014 product is checking since its mid-September launch and what our key learnings are.", "While it\u2019s only been six weeks, we have been pleased with the reception to the new line. Our handbag assortment represent Stuart's hip and modern take on the brand punctuating the essence of COACH\u2019s DNA. We have seen excellent response to novelty across all price points and are definitely seeing more new customers especially in collection doors carrying the full assortment. Editorial product featured no marketing or picked up in the fashion press such as the Rider 33 handbag, the Apollo sweater, the shearling coat and Urban Hiker boot have all been standouts.", "Anecdotally, we are hearing from our store teams that these early adopters of Stuart's collection product are highly fashion engaged and new to the brand. They are buying multiple pieces including ready-to-wear bags and shoes.", "In addition and importantly, we're also seeing success in the fashion execution of core products such as the Crosby Carryall, which marries great function with great style in neutral vibrant colors and animal prints. Indie is the bestseller in the refined pebbled leather with enhanced branding and Kelsey, a great value at 228 and Signature card and 258 in leather.", "Turning to holidays, we continue to focus on increasing the level of distinctive newness across all product categories adding emotion while strengthening fashion credibility and relevance to the brand. New product launched last Friday including Gramercy, our top handle satchel and Ranger a great fashion shoulder bag as well as cold weather accessories.", "For holiday, we also have a new shoulder bag scout at a $325 price point delivering right before Thanksgiving. In outlet CB, last year's bestseller in retail was just introduced last week while Margo, a new carryout across multiple fabrication comes in early December.", "As discussed during Analyst Day, our approach to customer events formerly known as PCE will be far fewer events annually, focusing specifically on our best customers during key holiday periods such as Black Friday. We will be more tailored in our segmentation selectively extending invitations. This approach will support sustained sales growth and build our brand, reinforcing our full price positioning. At the same time, we're also enhancing our store environments as Victor mentioned, we're excited about our first new retail concept stores during holiday which will represent the true manifestation of modern luxury across all aspects of the customer experience, environments, products and service. In addition to the new architecture and furniture and fixturing, our in-store initiative include new music, updated packaging and an elevated clientele program in key flagship.", "In summary, we're pleased with the initial steps we've taken to reposition COACH. Notably in the North America women's business adding more emotion and excitement to the product offering and around our brand.", "With that, I will turn it over to Victor for a discussion of our international business, strategies and further opportunities for growth. Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Thanks Fran.", "Turning now to our international segment which represents about a third of COACH's business. Sales rose 6% on a constant currency basis in the first quarter and 4% on a reported basis primarily impacted by the weaker yen on a year-over-year basis.", "As mentioned, China sales rose 10% from prior year with positive comparable store sales and slower distribution growth in line with our forecast. We remain very optimistic on the prospects for this market overtime as long-term drivers remained intact including a rapidly growing middle class and overall shift from pure stated to value favoring the affordable luxury segment and the evolving retail landscape with the development of new luxury shopping malls. However, we understand that there will likely be continued volatility in the near-term due to both macro issues and geopolitical events which are impacting trends in China and some key tourist markets notably Hong Kong and South East Asia. While we are still targeting China sales of about $600 million for FY15 driven primarily by distribution growth, current conditions are limiting visibility to PRC consumer travel and shopping patterns especially in Hong Kong driving more variability on a quarterly basis.", "To this point, our other Asian direct businesses outside of China and Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore posted positive aggregate growth though the region experienced a slowdown in traffic impacted by shifting trends in PRC consumer travel as well as weak inbound travel into Malaysia given the sustained impact from the airline investors.", "As expected, in Japan we posted a 7% decrease in constant currency due in large parts to the continuing impact of the April consumption tax increase. Dollar sales declined 12% reflecting the weaker yen. In Europe, where our brand is small but growing rapidly, we generated significant sales growth and double-digit comps in the quarter. We continue to believe that Europe represents a significant long-term opportunity for COACH both with domestic shoppers and the international tourists notably in key European cities with the affordable luxury segment is outperforming traditional luxury. In FY15 we expect to grow our business to around $100 million from about $60 million in FY14.", "Turning now to our global distribution plans. As our plans have not changed materially from what we outlined on our August earnings call, I will be brief. We continue to expect that our square footage, globally and across all channels will increase slightly in FY15, reflecting our North American fleet optimization. Our overarching focus will be on renovations and remodels to drive productivity. ", "To this point, as we guided previously in North America, our directly operated square footage will be down around 5%, given the 70 retail and 50 in outlet closures offset by a number of expansions within the context of our transformation and a number of outlet store openings. And in wholesale as we've noted, we're moving to more open accessible displays and rolling out a shop manager program. We expect our footprint in department stores to increase modestly in FY15. We plan to add about 40 locations and about 3% to 4% square footage. While converting more than 300 locations from case line presentation to open sale.", "Turning to China. We are still planning to open about 20 stores and could have about 10 closures resulting in around 10 net openings. While we expect to open a few stores in our other Asia direct markets outside of China and Japan in FY15. Our portfolio approach is focused on maximizing productivity with only modest growth of our footprint.", "Turning to Japan. In FY15 we continued to expect a total number of location to remain the same, which slight square footage growth from the new flagship and expansions of a few highly productive locations. Led by retail, our brand transformation plans in Japan focus on the renovation of key doors in Tokyo representing over 70% of the traffic by the end of FY16. Including the new flagship in Shinjuku, Tokyo set to open tomorrow as I mentioned earlier.", "We will also renovate key locations in important cities throughout the country and our flagship stores in Ginza and Shibuya next spring. Most generally, we continue to expect a continuation of current trends in Japan given the ongoing drag from the consumption tax increase which won't anniversary until the next April.", "Moving to Europe. In FY15 as noted, we still expect to grow our business to about 100 million. However, due to the shift in project timing, we now expect to add about 10 directly operated locations and more than 100 wholesale locations. Our goal is to achieve over 0.5 billion in sales and retail, representing mid-single-digit share of the premium men's and women's bag and accessories market over our planning horizon.", "Finally, we also believe there is a significant opportunity for the COACH brand in global travel retail which represents the majority of our international wholesale sales. At the end of the quarter, we had a total of 204 international wholesale locations in 28 countries, which included 110 travel locations and expect to add about a net 30 additional locations by year end.", "Now, I'll ask Jane to provide some additional further detail on our financials and our outlook for the balance of the year. Jane?", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen", "Thanks, Victor. Victor was just taking you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for FY15.", "Our quarter revenues declined 10% with North America down 19% and international up 4%. As noted on a constant currency basis revenues decreased 9% overall with international sales up 6%. Excluding transformation and other related charges, net income for the quarter totaled 146 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.53, this compared to net income of 218 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.77 in the prior year's first quarter. For the quarter, operating income totaled 270 million on a non-GAAP basis versus 322 million last year while operating margins was 20.9% versus 27.9%.", "During the quarter, gross profit totaled $719 million as compared to $827 million a year ago while gross margin was 69.3% versus 71.8%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 48.4% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 43.9% in the year ago quarter.", "As I turn to GAAP metrics, let me recap key transformation and other related charges. As previously announced we expect to incur pretax charges of approximately $250 million to $300 million associated with our transformation plan. A portion of which were reflected in our fiscal fourth quarter 2014 results and we expect the remainder to be largely incur during FY15. These changes are related to inventory and fleet related costs primarily in North America including impairment, accelerated depreciation and severance cost associated with store closures. In total, we expect to capture $70 million in savings related to our transformation initiatives in fiscal 2015 and approximately $150 million in ongoing annual savings in fiscal year 2016.", "As you may recall, during the fourth quarter of FY14 we recorded charges of approximately $130 million for transformation and other related actions. These charges consisted primarily of the realignment of inventory, impairment charges and a portion of the cost related to store closures. In aggregate, these actions increased our COGS by $82 million and SG&A expenses by $49 million negatively impacting net income by $88 million after tax or $0.31 per diluted share all on a GAAP basis.", "During the first quarter of 2015, we recorded an additional $37 million of charges associated with the transformation plan. These charges are primarily related to our organizational efficiency initiatives notably in the elimination of over 150 jobs announced in July representing about a 6% decrease in global corporate staffing level. In aggregate, these actions increased the company's SG&A expense by $33 million and cost of sales by $4 million in the period negatively impacting net income by $27 million after tax or $0.10 per diluted share.", "Moving on to the balance sheet, inventory levels at quarter end were $597 million down 6% from Q1 FY14. Cash and short-term investments stood at $907 million as compared to $855 million a year ago substantially held outside of the US. We continue to deploy international cash into high quality investments with higher yields and durations over a year. And in turn there is a shift between cash and short term investments into other non-current assets. As expected, we ended the fourth quarter with the $170 million outstanding on our credit facility in order to cover our working capital needs in light of investments in our business and new corporate headquarters. ", "Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $139 million compared to a $164 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was it inflow of $99 million versus a $118 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $14 million versus $46 million in the same quarter a year ago. We continue to expect CapEx for FY15 to be in the area of $350 million excluding the cost associated with the new headquarters which are expected to be approximately a $100 million in FY15 as previously announced. And we anticipate maintaining our dividend at an annual rate of a $1.35 for FY15.", "Turning now to our financial outlet for FY15 as our annual plans have not changed from those shared during our June Analyst Day meeting and reiterated on our 4Q '14 earnings call I'll be brief. First on sales, we expect to deliver a low double-digit decline both in constant currency and on a reported basis in fiscal 2015 largely due to our reduced promotion and store closure activity. We are projecting a high-teens comp decline in our North American stores with DOS pressuring the aggregate North America comp by an additional 10 points. This equates to a mid to high 20% decline in aggregate comps. Over the course of the fiscal year, we would expect store comps to improve as the product and store initiatives roll out while the pressure from DOS will intensify as we continue to reduce the cadence of events.", "Gross margin is still projected to be in the 69% to 70% range for the year with higher sourcing cost largely offset by favorable channel mix and lower promotional activities. SG&A expenses are still expected to grow at a low to mid-single digit rate reflective of our increased marketing spend and transformation initiatives. Importantly, while our first quarter SG&A expenses actualize below our expectations and we're down from prior year. This is more a function of timing than any change in our full year plan. Our 2Q and 3Q compares will show the most significant increase given the prior year dollar decline and the timing of our marketing spend in FY15. Taking together, we would expect operating margin to be in the high-teens.", "Finally, our tax rate is expected to be in the area of 32% for the year as we do not expect to anniversary some of the one-time tax benefits we generated in the second half of FY14. We have a strong and flexible balance sheet with about $1 billion in cash and investments and low leverage. We can't continue to access the capital market at attractive rates as needed to fund our headquarters\u2019 investment.", "In closing, I'd like to reiterate Victor's early remarks. We laid out a very clear plan this summer and its execution is underway. You heard this morning about our brand transformation progress around three pillars, product, stores and marketing. And I will add that we are also on track from an investment and restructuring perspective. We've taken out -- we've taken about half our total expected transformational related charges over the last two quarters including right-sizing our inventory levels. We're investing and re-platforming our stores and wholesale doors and are on track to spend about $570 million over the next three years.", "We've begun to realize our cost savings running a leaner more efficient organization. Therefore, looking further ahead, we expect to realize an overall annual financial improvement beginning in FY16 with FY'17 being the year when we return to growth in line with the category. We have the resources to fund our plan while maintaining our dividend during our heavy investment period. Ultimately, our objective is to restore COACH to a place of best-in-class profitability and sustainable growth.", "I'd now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). The first question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura.", "Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities", "Hi. Good morning.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning Bob.", "Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities", "Here is the question that I have is beyond Q1 how has the response to the new product been in retail stores and specifically have you seen a change in retail store comp trends?", "Victor Luis", "Good morning Bob. Thanks for your question and for being with us as usual. We have of course been following the performance very closely as Fran mentioned we have seen and are very pleased with our performance which really reflects the initial signs to product across the channel. When we look at the performance in the first quarter it's very difficult of course to read clearly because of the shift that we have taken in our promotional activities. As we mentioned we had our semi-annual sales of first two weeks of the quarter and no promotional events for the remainder of the first quarter. As we come into October, what we have seen is continued great performance across the new product. We as Fran mentioned have seen positive signs in performance across the new styles in fashion, novelty and core and positive comp across the above $400 performance but very difficult to see with the shift in promotion.", "Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from David Scheck with Stifel.", "David Scheck \u2013 Stifel", "Hi, good morning. I just need to say that there is a lot of moving parts in answer to Bob's question, but any estimation of the impact on tails or comp from the reduction of the COACH days and the DOS in North America.", "Victor Luis", "In terms of the reduction of DOS as Jane mentioned the impact was 5 comp points. The COACH days were only in our wholesale channel, David.", "David Scheck \u2013 Stifel", "I'm sorry in wholesale.", "Victor Luis", "Yeah, which really was an impact of depending on the chain anywhere from 20 to 25 days that we reduced. So approximately one-third of almost one-third of total days where we had promotion last year that we didn't have this year and in general as we mentioned in our speakers notes, the performance was pretty much in line with what we saw in our own stores where we also reduced all of the PCE events from last year.", "David Scheck \u2013 Stifel", "Okay. You mentioned the comp positive above 400. Could you talk about how that looked a year ago and over the last year and how much of it change in trend you're seeing in the above 400?", "Victor Luis", "Sure, Fran.", "Francine Della Badia", "Hi, good morning. As we said on the call, the above 400 is about 30% of our sales this year versus 21% last year. So we are seeing a great response to the elevated product and the forecast that will continue to see the trend rate in this category going forward.", "David Scheck \u2013 Stifel", "I guess my question is, was the above 400 price point. If you could talk about over the last... the prior 12 months not the last quarter but the prior 12 months. How was that trending as a contributor or a drag to comp? Now that it's obviously comping positive in your comping, were your comping it's a huge, it's usually different to the positive sides. So where was that $400 and above comp over the prior year or so?", "Francine Della Badia", "Yeah, so we've actually been talking about the positive response that we've been having through products above 400 for the past year. What we are seeing now is even stronger performance in that category so it has been above 400 a category that has been performing well for us over the past year and we saw... as we mentioned in the positive comp trend this quarter which we wanted to call out as a response to the new product that we launched with Stuart's first collection.", "David Scheck \u2013 Stifel", "Right, any sense of the magnitude in the difference between the prior and the now updated positive comp. That's what I'm really trying to get to.", "Francine Della Badia", "Yeah, we are calling it a positive comp. So without any more specific surrounded. We are very pleased with the performance in that location.", "David Scheck \u2013 Stifel", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Hi, everybody. Could you talk about the performance in the outlet stores in first quarter as the product has been cleaned up? Can you talk about the comps excluding DOS and then secondly can you talk about China the impact on stores in the Hong Kong area with a demonstrations and have you seen any transfer of business outside of Hong Kong and could you recap the number of stores by city tier in China.", "Victor Luis", "Thanks for your multiple questions Barbara as usual. Let me start with China and then I'll hand off to Fran on North American factory and what we are seeing there. In terms of China and Asia overall, what we're seeing is very much, what we're all reading in terms of the geopolitical and macroeconomic situation. We continue to target positive comps and about $600 million in sales for this fiscal year as we said during our notes. But we are seeing tremendous variability and performance and that of course is especially true in Hong Kong where we did have a couple of closures of a few key locations at certain points during the demonstrations, but the biggest impact of course has been in tourists flows across the region. ", "What we're seeing is a fewer tourists into Hong Kong and Macau as well as continued decreases into South East Asia some of that again due to some geopolitical events in that region and of course in Malaysia due to still some impact from the airline disasters. We are seeing some uptick in tourist flows into Taiwan and into Korea but truly not enough to mitigate the -- not at the same level as the decreases that we're seeing especially in the key markets of Hong Kong.", "Saying all of that Barbara as you know it's very resilient economies I think that while there maybe this short term variability our confidence in the long-term opportunities of China and especially of the Chinese consumer globally is very, very strong. We continue to see incredible growth in the middle class there. We continue of course to see very, very good development of the retail infrastructure which offers a lot of opportunities. I am constantly reminded of the fact that we bought our business back in 2008 at the peak of the economic crisis and made very important decisions to invest. ", "China will also benefit from all of the great work that we're doing in brand transformation and we're very much taking the same position of looking to invest and drive our brand relevance further in that market. I'll now pass on to Fran I think you had Barbara one more question on distribution by tiers. We today have a 136 locations on the mainland, the vast majority of our doors are in tier 1 and tier 2 cities with 37 locations in tier 3 and 4, the remainder in tier 1 and 2.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Thanks.", "Francine Della Badia", "Barbara to answer the questions about outlet just first as a reminder we don't disaggregate comp performance in North America direct so I'll just go right to the product performance last month. We launched new product collection called Collect which was largely a leather based full price inspired product which performed extremely well at the higher end of our AUR offering in outlet and last week we just launched CB again a very strong leather based collection in a ray of color. And we're seeing very, very strong performance in that product over through this past weekend. In terms of stores impact on factory, we had focused first on full price, Stuart design for outlet products will arrive in a small way right before holiday. And then we will launch more Stuart designed product for outlet beginning in the spring.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne, Agee.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne, Agee", "Hi. How are you doing good morning everyone? Thanks for taking my question. I just have my question was on the gross margin lines. So you guys are doing a very good job pulling back from the promotions at the private client events and the outlet DOS. So my question is the core gross margin is still down 250 basis points so this clearly got to be an offset to the benefits you're getting from being less promotional. Is that sourcing, is that off price sales I mean can you just help us understand exactly what's going on in a gross profit. Thank you.", "Francine Della Badia", "Yes Ike. So what you saw is about the 260 point decline in our gross margin. Importantly while we are pulling back in promotion activities we did versus last year about a 100 points of pressure from North America outlet in higher product and sourcing cost accounted for the other half. As we said in Analyst Day we're continuing to invest in our products and innovation, quality and putting value in our product for our consumer and then FX was the remainder.", "Ike Boruchow - Sterne, Agee", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning guys. Wanted to ask about the new product and how we should think about its flow through into that outlet channel and that consumer base going forward whether it's next year and then how we think about the impact there?", "Victor Luis", "Sure, Omar I think in reference to Bob's first question as well the good news is that our product is basically performance truly per our plan. And so our plan was of course to take core style such as the ED such as Crosby which are really core styles that will be multi-seasonal and bringing newness and novelty to off the season and then that seasonal product will then flow into outlet through following being in our semi-annual sale first and for most which is the new part of our strategy compared to prior seasonal. So then what we are not doing through the PCE events of course will lead to some promotional activity through the open sale which we will have at the end of each season. The first event of which we had at the end of fourth quarter beginning of the first quarter where we've had a lot of learning that we're now leveraging of course into our next event.", "One of the key learnings that I might add was the recruitment of new consumers that we saw coming in through the open sale which really bodes well of course for how that seasonal product tend serve as a recruitment tool for that more value conscious consumer as well in key metropolitan areas.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "That's very helpful. Thanks Victor.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen.", "", "Oliver Chen- Cowen & Co.", "Hi, thanks a lot. Regarding Stuart and the opportunity you had an outlet. What are your thoughts on how he's going to evolve product with respect to pricing and on your candid comments about the competitives what we've noticed is a lot of competitors competing really strongly on price. So what are your thoughts on the big opportunity in terms of the comp lever you've seen in this environment and in outlet?", "Victor Luis", "Thank you Oliver. Glad to hear from you. We of course a very conscious of bringing value to the consumer and that will happen through not only sharp price points but of course by bringing them value as well through quality. As think you heard Fran mentioned one of the wonderful collections that we've launched this past quarter Collette where we've seen truly great consumer reaction to has been at a much higher AUR than our other collections. But of course we also are very focused in and as a theme not only in the outlet but also in retail and meeting the needs of our core consumer.", "In the case of outlet, we have increased newness coming through Fran mentioned Margo which launches in December that will be followed by a series of other collections throughout the spring and that will be at various price points from the shoppers one at a 100 and below right on up through suggested retails or I should say AURs at approximately 200 to 300 as well.", "Oliver Chen- Cowen & Co.", "Thank you. And we're pretty excited about where the men's product looks. Could you just remind us about how you feel about the long-term percentage of mix and where that can go?", "Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Sure so for us we're in the 14% to 15% range today, the total market for men's represents approximately 18% of the $40 billion premium handbag and accessories markets. We see ourselves of course getting to that and a targeting as I mentioned in my notes Oliver by the end of '17, a $1 billion in sales.", "Oliver Chen- Cowen & Co.", "Thank you very much. Best regards for the holiday season.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you Oliver.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from John Morris with BMO.", "John Morris - BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks and my congratulations on your hard work and progress so far.", "Victor Luis ", "Thank you John.", "John Morris - BMO Capital Markets", "Question I think for Jane on the SG&A just to go back and touch base on that. It looks like it was coming in below your expectations and below where the Street had modeling it and when I heard was it was a lot of that have to do with timing. And so why what was the behind the timing was it that you decided or the company decided to hold off on some of the marketing plans so far, yeah just kind of what were the attributes that help the SG&A come in a little bit lower than expectations.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen", "John as you step back from it a lot of it is about what was in the base last year. So RK was in the base last year and we're able to re-purpose. We're able to re-purpose some of those RK expenditures to marketing in this quarter. Additionally C COACH Europe, in the back half increased our expense level as we move through FY14 and it was not in our base in the first quarter.", "John Morris - BMO Capital Markets ", "Wouldn't you planning, wouldn't you all have taken that into account. So just wondering kind of why would it come in little bit below your expectations that. The SG&A...", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen", "So obviously we're right in track with our guidance for full year for SG&A in terms of SG&A growth as we look at the pushes and pulls in that, it is we are continuing to have an outlook of spending $25 million in marketing and we'll have some expenditures related to occupancy as we open up new international doors and some compensation related expenses as we look at performance based comp back on target which we took down in the second quarter of the last year.", "John Morris - BMO Capital Markets ", "Okay, great and then just one another quick one if I may. Can you give us a feel for the performance in the full assortment stores relative to your expectations versus the performance in the rest of the fleet in another words you are seeing, a divergence in terms of the performance as you would measure in this 40 full assortment stores?", "Victor Luis", "Yeah, I think overall as we mentioned the total collection and total newness is really performing to our expectations and very much in our plan, where we have seen truly great signs as we talked about it is in that above 400. We've seen terrific signs in the full collection doors as well. There is no doubt that we have a new consumer engaging with COACH across the more elevated, more fashioned product and that is globally. ", "We are also seeing better performance in the doors that received the full remodel. Not yet the full concept because as I mentioned in my remarks today actually this evening tomorrow in Japan our Shinjuku flagship is the first full store that is opening in the new concept followed by Rodeo and AOL, Time Warner. But we did significantly touch up our stores that Bleecker Streets, South Coast Plaza with some of you have seen in the past is not yet the full new concept but has an inspiration of it as well as lower fifth, all of those stores are performing much better than the rest of the fleet. And as I mentioned as well still very early days but the over 100 locations in wholesale where we moved to open sale we're seeing better performance as well as the locations again very early days release at the store managers in wholesale.", "So where we are making the fullest expression of transformation visible. We are seeing the greatest impact. We are pleased with the reaction to fashion and we are also very pleased with the two key core silhouettes that are out there which I really our first core introductions ED and Crosby with more to follow, Fran mentioned Scout which follows in December and then we also have a [town carton] which comes in late January early February which are two other key silhouettes chopper pricing that we believe will resonate with our core consumer.", "John Morris - BMO Capital Markets", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question today is from Joan Payson with Barclays.", "Joan Payson - Barclays", "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I focusing I guess on Japan, how do you think about that business for the rest of the year and when there might be a potential for rebound there? And then also I think you mentioned the logo mix for the full price stores being at 6% today. But what has that evolved to in the outlet business and is there a target in mind for the factory stores compared to full price?", "Victor Luis", "Sure, let me first touch on Japan and then I'll let Fran to touch on outlet. Overall in the case of Japan results are very much consistent with our expectations and our annual guidance. Our planning was very much done both in the context of the environments that we've been seeing post the consumption tax is of course as well as our own brand transformation strategy with a lot of work being done in key flagships stores across Tokyo and other key cities and product there as well performing to expectations with certain really nice highlights especially across the more fashioned product where we have seen higher penetrations in Japan across Rider and a few of the fashion bags that we have in other markets.", "And now I'll turn to Fran on outlet.", "Francine Della Badia", "Hi, in terms of the logo business in outlet much more significant than it is in our retail business. It's running right now at about 40% of total sales that's across all categories, handbag specifically it's about 26% of the business in bags. So it's still an important category for us in outlet.", "Joan Payson - Barclays", "Great, thank you.", "Victor Luis", "And what's great there that I will just add we are doing a tremendous amounts of work in iterating across Signature platforms so you will see new Signature platforms penetrating across both our full price channels which we've launched and outlet moving forward as well as the wholesale channel. So we've recognized that while Signature and Logo in general is down trending globally for all players. We see it as a key part of our strategy moving forward and a key part for Stuart and the team to innovate and drive further relevant.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you everyone. That concludes our Q&A. as you know we like to conclude prior to the markets openings. I will turn it back to Victor Luis for some closing remarks. Victor.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you Andrea. I want to thank all of you for being with us today and we've outlined very clear and comprehensive strategies and plant this past summit to address all of COACH's brand challenges. We're in the very early execution of our journey and very confident in laying the foundation for our long-term vibrancy and growth. In this first quarter, I could not be proud of our team and the steps that we have taken across all of the consumer touch points. ", "And at this moment I would also like to take the opportunity to recognize the retirement of our executive Chairman Lue Frankfort, who truly has been a legend in all that he has achieved in his career at COACH. I and the team wish him a tremendous inherited legacy and we wish him a tremendous amount of success as he moves forward in his next chapter. And of course I sit here incredibly proud of what we've accomplished in these early stages of our transformation book more importantly very confidence as we move forward as the team in our next chapter and I thank you all for being with us and look forward to seeing you during the course of holiday.

With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Victor Luis, Coach\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Coach\u2019s CFO.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements including projections for our business in the current and future quarter or fiscal year.

Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

As noted in our press release, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations and annual guidance, adjusted for the stronger-than-expected dollar. We continue to see steady progress in our results with sequential improvement in our bricks-and-mortar stores in North America as we continue to make strides against our brand transformation agenda including greatly reduced promotional impressions.", "International growth rates remain fairly stable, up mid single digits in local currency, with China and Europe driving overall performance and offsetting the difficult compares in Japan this quarter as we were up against the pull-forward in advance of the tax hike effected on April 1st, 2014. Overall, we are pleased with our team\u2019s execution as we continue to gain traction on this strategic plan to reinvigorate growth and drive the Coach brand\u2019s relevance.", "In the weeks ahead, we look forward to completing the acquisition of Stuart-Weitzman, which we announced last quarter, a luxury footwear brand that we believe has significant domestic and international growth potential. As noted previously, we will develop each brand separately. Over the longer term, we will learn from each other, driving synergies across our respective businesses. Specifically, we will leverage Coach\u2019s international infrastructure and expertise in handbags and accessories to develop Stuart-Weitzman handbag and accessories business. And in turn Coach will benefit from the Stuart-Weitzman\u2019s teams accessories and footwear developments, where they\u2019re proven leaders in fashion and fit.", "As we prepare for the integration of Stuart-Weitzman, we have renewed Coach\u2019s women\u2019s footwear license with Jimlar for the next two years. This will allow us to develop the multi-brand infrastructure and systems necessary to bring the category in-house. We are very excited about our first acquisition and look forward to welcoming the Stuart-Weitzman brand and organization into the Coach, Inc. family.", "Separately, we also just announced the new multi-year fragrance agreement with [indiscernible], upon expiration of our license agreement with Est\u00e9e Lauder and expect to launch our first scent with our new partner in the fall of 2016. Before we get into a discussion of the quarter and our progress on Coach\u2019s transformation, I wanted to briefly touch on our global pricing strategy since the topic had become a focus for our peer group given the volatility in global currencies.", "Our pricing strategy has always been to provide exceptional value in local currencies to our global customers. We aim to be approximately 40% to 60% below our traditional luxury competitors, and at this time we do not have plans to change our strategy. Coach will continue to deliver on its modern luxury proposition, offering superb handcrafted products and superior customer service and image-enhancing locations. Given our high level of fashion innovation, we price our products each season and always consider exchange rates at product launches while taking into account the pricing structure of both domestic and international brands in each market.", "Now as we have been doing since we unveiled our playbook last June, I thought we would share some of the actions that we have taken in keeping with our plan as well as our updated learning\u2019s and results across the three brand pillars. Starting with product, Stuart-Weitzman\u2019s design represented virtually all of our retail stores women\u2019s offerings during the third quarter led by our key silhouette, Swagger available in a number of sizes, colors, and novelty, including patch work.", "In our outlet stores globally, Stuart\u2019s impact was also noticeable for the first time, with new group set collections including Mickey, Ruby, and Morgan complementing CV, Christy, and Kelsey, previous retail favorites. Margo, its first outlet design introduced for fall continued to be strong. Stuart\u2019s products represented about a third of our outlet store\u2019s women\u2019s assortment during the third quarter. Most generally, our approach of providing value from product elevation has continued. Putting more makes and quality in the products has been very well received by outlet customers globally, giving us confidence in our long-term direction to drive relevance across all channels.", "In addition, we held our third New York Fashion Week presentation in February, showing our fall 2015 collection and once again garnered overwhelmingly positive reviews from both the editorial and retail communities. Following the fall 2015 presentation, we generated about 193 million lifetime impressions in the market, up approximately 50% from our presentation of spring 2015 in September. And as the editorial community and fashion prep has continued to react positively to our brands, we are also seeing continued progress with consumers. Our quarterly North America brand tracking survey delivered in March showed further improvement among category drivers that Coach has perceived as less promotional, while our brand affinities remain strong overall.", "In our third quarter, we continued to reaffirm that fashion, which was supported by marketing, drives high sell-throughs as has been indicated with the great success we have experienced with Swagger.", "On stores: during the quarter we continued to renovate and open new stores globally in our modern luxury concept. By quarter end, we had 40 that reflected the new design, including our first modern luxury outlet stores in Asia. Naturally, we are adjusting the level of investments and renovation to the market, running the gamut from life touch warm-ups to complete rebuilds but always ensuring that we are differentiated from the competitive landscape in an authentic Coach way. The four North American stores we opened in November continued to post positive comps and well outpace the balance of change. I will shortly touch more on the newer renovations in our discussion of the domestic business.", "Internationally, we have seen significant inflections virtually across the board following renovation from flagship [indiscernible] in London to our outlet in Yogi [ph], Korea. During the quarter, we conducted a modern luxury store intercept and shop-along survey in both the U.S. and Japan with other 100 customers in each market. We found that, one; customers are reacting very positively to the new environment as about 75% of those interviewed said that the modern luxury store makes them want to shop at Coach more often, and two; our modern luxury stores are resonating with customers as sophisticated, luxurious, comfortable, and inviting across both markets.", "This new store environment is especially appealing to the category drivers who found the store fresh, elegant, and having a more elevated feel. As we continue to negotiate temporary locations with landlords for directly operating stores, work with our international wholesale partners for appropriate spaces and co-tenancies, and work through lease negotiations, a number of projects have now shifted into FY 2015. Specifically, while our North America projects \u2013 about 70 renovations and five new stores \u2013 are on plan. Approximately 50 international renovations and 10 new international stores have moved into fiscal 2016.", "We are now targeting about 100 global renovations in fiscal year 2015 and to open it about 40 to 50 new stores globally in this concept for a total of 140 to 150. As expected, this means we will have a very back loaded year in terms of store investment with approximately 75 renovations and about 25 to 35 new openings this quarter.", "Through the third quarter, we closed 56 North American retail locations, most in January as mentioned on our last earnings call, and we\u2019re on track to close approximately 70 for the full year. In addition, we have closed 13 outlet stores through the third quarter including ten Metro-only locations which we folded into existing stores leveraging the team and cross shopping opportunities. And as noted on our last call, we also closed the two outlet stores identified as a part of our learning agenda at the end of January.", "In North American department stores, we have already completed well over 200 projects over the first nine months, mostly installing open sell environments and replacing the old cake [ph] lines and have seen an improvement versus the balance of doors. We still expect to convert over 300 total locations from case line presentation to open sell this fiscal year. We are also on target with the Shop Manager program in the wholesale channel, with approximately 30 managers in key doors today with the goal of adding an additional 20 shop managers by the end of fiscal 2015.", "We are taking the learnings from our successful new stores and are using them to inform the development of the modern luxury concept for other channels. As noted, our first outlet stores have opened internationally during the third quarter and just about two weeks ago we opened our first new modern luxury outlet store in North America, in Savannah, Georgia. We are also working on both our wholesale store and travel retail concepts and have done our first set of warm-up stores that are not getting the full expression of modern luxury.", "On the Marketing and Customer Experience front, continuing with our comprehensive marketing strategy for spring we had a focus on Swagger and presented a New Dreamers campaign featuring actor Chloe Grace Moretz and recording artist Kid Cudi. Together they\u2019ve brought a more relatable and understandable approach to the campaign. We supported our Coach Swagger bags with a compelling and holistic global print and digital campaign including our viral hash tag what\u2019s your Swagger, driving over 250 million impressions, traffic, and sales.", "Earlier this month, we garnered over 100 million impressions during the Coachella Music Festival with our Coach Backstage Concert attended by global celebrities. We also saw increases in editorial mentions in all three major markets: North America, Japan, and China, while our editorial rank rose in North America and Japan while holding in China. And as we increased our positive brand impressions, we have also continued to pull back on our North America promotional activity. Consistent with our previously announced strategy, during the spring quarter, we held only bun invitation-only customer event in mid-March around Spring Break. We also reduced the cadence of EOS/sales from three a week last year to about two a month this quarter, thereby meeting our goal to be down to about two events per month by the end of the fiscal year.", "In addition, there were no Coach days in North American department stores during the third quarter as compared to an average of approximately 30 days across wholesale accounts in the third quarter of 2014. So while much of our journey remains in front of us, we are very pleased with what we have accomplished this far in FY 2015 and will continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.", "Turning to the results of last quarter, some key financials were first, net sales on a reported basis totaled $929 million versus $1.1 billion a year ago, a decrease of 15% including a 3% negative impact of currency. Second, earnings-per-share totaled $0.36, excluding transformation-related charges as compared to $0.68 in the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Third, international sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis and decreased 3% in dollars to $428 million from $441 million last year. China sales rose 10% in constant currency and 8% in dollars with positive comparable store sales while sales in our directly operated locations in Asia and Europe rose in constant currency as well.", "Henceforth, North American sales fell 24% to $493 million from $648 million last year on a 23% comparable store sales decrease. As expected, given the further reduction of EOSL during the quarter, looking at distribution and consistent with our annual guidance, there was a significant decline in our global, directly operated door comp reflective of our North America retail store closures, he majority of which as planned fell in January.", "In total, our global location comp was down 48, including a net decline of 54 in North America, two net closures in Japan, four net openings in mainland China, and four net openings in the rest of Asia. As you know, we are primarily focused on re-platforming our stores, elevating brand perception, optimizing our store fleet, and opening new locations selectively in key markets.", "Moving on to sales by channel and geography starting with our domestic businesses: our total revenues in North America declined 24% for the quarter with our directly operated businesses down 23%. As noted, total Q3 same-store sales declined 23%, with a further reduction in EOS events to twice monthly, pressuring total comps by about 11 percentage points as store comps declined 12%, a sequential improvement from the 16% increase posted in Q2 and 19% increase in Q1.", "As expected, in department stores, our sales trends at POS were well below the company\u2019s directly operated stores, reflecting both the elimination of Coach days, as I mentioned and the heightened promotional activity in the category. Shifting it into the channel declined to a somewhat greater degree than POS sales. It\u2019s worth reiterating that while we have been pleased with the relative out-performance of the locations we have converted to open sell, these were amongst our smallest stores and therefore haven\u2019t provided a significant overall contribution. We expect the fourth quarter will remain challenging at POS in this channel, given the planned decrease in year-over-year promotional activity for the spring season.", "Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women\u2019s and handbag/accessories market rose at a mid single-digit rate in the March quarter, showing a slight moderation from recent trends while the overall growth reflects an ongoing benefit from the secular shift into accessories from apparel. We continue to believe that the category will grow at about a 7% compound annual growth rate over our planning horizon.", "Turning to Men\u2019s, which represents 18% of the global category expense, or about $7 billion today: as we discussed, we\u2019re also continuing to drive our Men\u2019s business globally, primarily through new dual-gender stores. In the third quarter, Coach\u2019s global sales of men\u2019s bags and accessories were up slightly impacted by the weak yen and the pullback of promotion and EOS in North America. Backpacks and our new Hudson bag with a modern business sensibility have been particularly strong. And, as noted on our last call, we were delighted with the response to Stuart\u2019s first men\u2019s lifestyle presentation during Fashion Week at London collection men in January and look forward to his collection arriving in stores this fall. Therefore looking ahead, we remain bullish about the prospects for our Global Men\u2019s business and are continuing to target $1 billion in calendar 2017.", "Before we discuss international sales, I wanted to provide some more insight into our North American business and third quarter results. In aggregate and as planned, our total store comps was down low double-digits at negative 12%, with higher tickets offset by a decline in traffic which was pressured by the overall weak mall trends as well as lower conversion, which was greatly impacted by the reduction in promotion days in our retail and wholesale channels. Our total comp was pressured an additional 11 points by EOS as we pulled back from three flash sale events a week in last year\u2019s third quarter to about two events a month this spring.", "Looking at results sequentially, average transaction size in both channels rose in what the primary driver of the 4-point comp improvement in bricks-and-mortar stores as elevated fashion and compelling novelty drove improved handbag performance. And while mall traffic continues a secular decline during the spring as measured by Shopper Track, we did see a relative sequential improvement in our traffic from the holiday quarter despite the weather. Meaning, while still a drag to our overall comparable store sales, it was less onerous than in the second quarter.", "Conversion impacted by the pullback in promotional activity continues to be pressured as expected. And though we did not have any additional North American stores in our new concept opened in the fourth quarter, the four stores renovated and reopened during the holiday: Time Warner, Rodeo Drive, Fashion Valley and Manhasset continued to comp very positively individually and in aggregate, well above the balance of the retail fleet.", "Over the last few weeks, beginning in mid-March, we did complete several renovations of varying scope from warm-ups to more significant upgrades on 13 retail locations and also opened our first new modern luxury store in San Juan, our only retail opening in FY 2015.", "While early days for these locations, we\u2019re pleased with initial performance. By the end of the fiscal year, we expect to have completed about 35 additional renovations. We also continue to see relative out-performance in the 12 MSAs in North America where we are most focused and where we are distorting our attention.", "I know many of you are also interested to hear about the impact of those 56 retail store closures on revenues and in turn, sales transferred to the existing fleet. As a reminder, and as noted in our analyst day presentation last June, these were the least productive stores in our fleet. So their impact to overall revenues and operating income is very small. Similarly, the sales transfer and impacts to comp in those markets where other retail stores were present was also expected to be small.", "This January, when the bulk of these stores closed, the results have been inconsistent across markets. In some cases such as Miami and New Jersey and also Southern California, we have seen a lift, notably in traffic. In other areas, such as Chicago, we haven\u2019t seen any change yet. Given the short time period since our closures, we will continue to monitor results.", "We are also working on specific actions to steer and guide customers to other doors in their respective markets. As mentioned, we also closed ten Men\u2019s outlet stores which were successfully folded into women\u2019s locations in the same malls as well as two core outlet stores as part of our learning agenda originally discussed at our analyst day. These closures, both in January, were executed to better understand crossover between outlet and retail stores as well as our ability to influence purchase behavior. While very early days, thus far we have not seen any transfer from outlets to retail stores in these markets. At this early stage, it appears customers are dedicated to their retail channel and mall and little transfer to other outlets if we close the customer\u2019s primary store. Of course, we will continue to monitor these shoppers over the longer time period to see if these very early takeaways remain valid.", "Drilling down a bit more on our retail performance: while we have now anniversaries the tighter assortment of handbags, we continue to see absolute strength in our elevated products. More generally, the above $400 price bucket grew in penetration and saw another positive comp and continued to represent over 30% of handbag sales versus roughly 23% last year. More broadly, Leather continues to outpace logo across all channels, and we have designed it into this trend. It\u2019s both a shift that favors Coach longer term given our heritage in leather goods and elevates our impressions in the marketplace.", "In the third quarter, logo across all categories represented less than 5% of retail sales compared to less than 10% a year ago. And in Outlet, we\u2019re down below 30 % versus 40%. Importantly, this trend has also resulted in significant increases in average handbag price points for traditional luxury brands. Due to their previous reliance on vinylized canvas and/or [indiscernible] fabrication and a tendency to pass on increased costs of using leather to their consumers thereby creating additional space in the market and a further widening in our relative price points and value perception. Outside of handbags, we continue to see relative strength in our Lifestyle categories in the third quarter. Women\u2019s Footwear again increased its penetration from last year\u2019s levels of about 8%, growing to about 10% of North America retail sales in those stores carrying a full offering.", "Men\u2019s footwear, introduced last fall, was also well received in retail stores. In addition, we are seeing a positive response to our expanded Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s footwear assortment in outlet stores. In total, we saw a significant increase in footwear sales across all directly operated channels in North America. In Outlets, where the overall environment continues to be very promotional, the customer responded to the storytelling presentations throughout the store, along with supporting e-mail campaigns. Neon was a great example of this in March.", "As mentioned, we\u2019ve just opened our first modern luxury outlet store in North America in Savannah, where customers have been surprised and delighted by the elevated environment. As I have already talked to the global learnings around products, stores, and marketing in my opening, I\u2019ll move on to our fourth quarter initiatives.", "We are very excited about the arrival of Colorburst Swagger, which will be our Mother\u2019s Day key item and our festival of style featuring length-stitched patterns across multiple silhouettes in retail stores globally. For Mother\u2019s Day, we have brought back our hash tag My First Coach social media and digital campaign celebrating your first Coach in life, your mom. In June, we have a new story that turns out type in Taupe, shoulder bag, and rucksack shapes.", "In Outlet, our integrated Mother\u2019s Day floor set highlights our pretty pink floral. In June, we will bring in a new Americana floral print available in the totes and satchels. As discussed during analyst day and subsequent calls, our approach to customer events, formally known as PCE, are far fewer in number annually, about three, focusing specifically on our best customers during key holiday periods, such as our Black Friday event during the holiday and our Spring Break event in March. We expect to hold one event in the fourth quarter around Mother\u2019s Day, taking us to three for the year as planned.", "We are being far more tailored in our segmentation, selectively extending invitations. Separately with two semiannual sales now under our belt, we will continue this practice moving forward with our next event scheduled to begin around Memorial Day and end shortly after July 4th, taking advantage of the higher traffic during these holidays. This approach will support sustained sales growth and build our brand, reinforcing our multi-channel positioning. Overall, we are pleased with the steps we have taken to reposition Coach, notably in the North American Women\u2019s business, adding more emotion and excitement to the product offering and around our brand.", "Turning now to our International segment, which represents about a third of Coach\u2019s business, sales rose 4% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter but declined 3% on a reported basis impacted by the stronger dollar. As mentioned, China sales rose 10% from the prior year in constant currency and 8% in dollars with positive comparable store sales and slower distribution growth in line with our forecasts. We remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over time as the long-term drivers we have consistently mentioned remain intact including a rapidly growing middle class and overall shift from pure status to value as well as the recent anti-corruption and anti-extravagance campaigns favoring the affordable luxury segment and the evolving retail landscape with the development of new luxury shopping malls.", "While we are still targeting sales of $590 million to $600 million, which now reflect the negative impact of the stronger dollar, we expect that there will likely be continued volatility in the near term due to both macro issues and geopolitical events which are impacting trends in China and some key tourist markets. Consistent with our peers, we have seen continued and increasing traffic challenges in the Hong Kong as new demonstrations have targeted cross-border shoppers in key malls. We also experienced a pickup in Chinese tourist spending in Japan and Europe, especially around Chinese New Year aided by the compelling value the weaker yen and Euro has provided to the Chinese shopper. At this point, our other Asia direct businesses outside of China and Japan: South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore posted positive aggregate growth in the local currency.", "In Japan, we posted an 11% decrease in constant currency, somewhat better than expected as the difficult compare against last year\u2019s pre-consumption tax pulled forward and generally lackluster spending was somewhat offset by the Chinese tourist notably around lunar new year. Dollar sales declined 23%. In Europe, where our brand is small but growing rapidly, we generated significant double-digit sales growth in the quarter driven by both distribution and comp. We continue to believe that Europe represents a significant long-term opportunity for Coach, both with domestic shoppers and the international tourist, notably in key European cities where the affordable luxury segment is outperforming luxury.", "We\u2019re maintaining our sales forecast for FY 2015 of about $90 million and our goal to achieve over a half a billion in sales at retailers representing a mid single-digit share of the premium Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s bag and accessory markets over our planning horizon.", "Turning now to our global distribution planning: as they haven\u2019t changed materially from what we outlined on previous earnings calls, I\u2019ll be brief. We continue to expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase slightly in FY 2015, reflecting our North American fleet optimization. Our overarching focus will be on renovations and remodels to drive productivity. To this point and as guided previously in North America, our directly operated square footage will be down around 5% given the 70 retail and 15 outlet closures, offset by a number of expansions within the context of our transformation and the number of outlet store openings.", "And in Wholesale, as we have noted, we\u2019re moving to more open, accessible displays and rolling out a shop manager program. We expect our footprint in department stores to increase slightly in FY 2015. We plan to add about 30 locations resulting in a low single-digit increase in square footage while converting about 300 locations from case line presentations to open sell.", "Turning to China: we are still planning to open about 20 stores and could have about 10 closures resulting in about ten net openings. While we expect to open a few stores in our other direct Asia markets outside of China and Japan in FY 2015, our portfolio approach is focused on renovating key impact doors with our new modern luxury concept in order to drive our brand transformation and maximize productivity gains with modest growth of our footprint.", "Turning to Japan: in FY 2015, we continue to expect the total number of locations to remain the same with slight square footage growth from the new flagship and expansions of a few highly productive locations. Led by retail, our brand transformation plans in Japan focus on the renovation of key doors in Tokyo representing over 70% of traffic in that metropolitan area by the end of FY 2016 including the new flagship store in [indiscernible] , which opened in October. We will also renovate key locations in important cities throughout the country along with our flagship stores in Tokyo this summer. As a reminder, now that we have anniversaries last year\u2019s consumption tax increase, which was affected on April 1st, 2014, we would expect to see a rebound in our fourth quarter. Of course, reported sales will be substantially lower given the yen weakness.", "Moving to Europe: we plan to add about 10 directly-operated locations and more than 100 wholesale locations. Finally, and as we have expressed in the past, we also believe there was a significant opportunity for the Coach brand in global travel retail, which represents the majority of our international wholesale sales. At quarter end, we had a total of 215 international wholesale locations in 31 countries, which included 113 travel locations and expect to add about 25 net additional locations by year-end.", "Now I\u2019ll ask Jane to provide some additional detail on our financials and outlook for the balance of the year. Jane?", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen", "Thanks, Victor. Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter. Our quarterly revenues declined 15%, with North America down 24% and International down 3%.", "As noted, total sales would have been 3% higher excluding the impact of currency, with international sales up 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding transformation and other related charges, net income for the quarter totaled $100 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.36. This compares to net income of $191 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.68 in the prior year\u2019s third quarter. For the quarter, operating income totaled $146 million on a non-GAAP basis versus $253 million last year while operating margin was 15.8% versus 23.9%.", "During the quarter, gross profit totaled 665 million as compared to $781 million a year ago, while gross margin was 71.6% versus 71.1%. As expected, gross margin benefited from the reduction in North America promotional activity and was helped by out-performance in Japan relative to our expectations. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 55.8% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 47.2% in the year-ago quarter. Absolute SG&A dollars were essentially flat to prior year and well below our expectations despite a $10 million increase in marketing spend.", "There were three primary drivers in the variance to our forecast. First, our fleet had lower-than-expected depreciation and occupancy expense given the shift in timing of renovations and new store openings, notably flagships into FY 2015. This will also impact our fourth quarter which I\u2019ll speak to shortly. The second is currency as SG&A costs in the quarter benefited from the impact of the stronger dollar. Third, restructuring savings \u2013 as we continue to capture savings related to our restructuring sooner than originally anticipated and now expect savings of closer to $100 million in FY 2015.", "As I turn to GAAP metrics, let me recap key transformation and other related charges. With the realization of our restructuring savings, we now expect to incur pre-tax charges in the $300 million range associated with our transformation plan. $210 million of this charge has been taken over the last four quarters. As previously announced, these charges, which will be largely completed by the end of FY 2015, are related to inventory and fleet-related costs including impairments, accelerated depreciation, and severance associated with store closure.", "In total, we now expect to capture about $100 million in savings related to our transformation initiatives in fiscal 2015 and approximately 150 million in ongoing annual savings in fiscal year 2016. During the third quarter of FY 2015, the company recorded charges of 23 million under the company\u2019s multi-year transformation plan. These charges consisted primarily of accelerated depreciation for renovations, lease termination costs related to store closures, and organizational efficiency costs. These actions increased the company\u2019s SG&A expenses by $23 million, negatively impacting net income by $12 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share in the third quarter.", "Therefore, during the first five months of fiscal 2015, the company\u2019s recorded transformation related charges of $80 million and acquisition related costs of approximately 44 million. These charges increased SG&A expenses by approximately 479 million in total and costs of sales by $5 million, reducing net income by $56 million after tax or $0.20 cents per diluted share for the current nine-month period.", "Moving on to the balance sheet: inventory levels at quarter-end were $457 million, down 22% from Q3 in FY 2014. Cash and short-term investments did $2.02 billion as compared to $775 million a year ago. As expected during the quarter, we announced a closing of an underwritten public offering of 4.25% senior, unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $600 million. In addition, we amended our existing revolving credit facility to borrow up to $1 billion, up from $700 million previously. This amendment included the issuance of a five-year senior unsecured $300 million term loan. Therefore in total, we had borrowings of approximately $900 million outstanding as of the end of the third quarter.", "As previously shared, we expect to use these proceeds to cover our working capital needs in light of investments in our business, the acquisition of Stuart-Weitzman, and the new corporate headquarters. Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $157 million compared to $105 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $122 million versus $54 million in the same period last year.", "Our CapEx spending was $45 million versus $51 million in the same quarter a year ago. Based on renovation and flagship project timing, we now expect CapEx for FY 2015 to be in the area of $275 million to $300 million excluding the cost associated with the new headquarters. The capital costs associated with our new headquarters are now expected to be approximately $15 million in FY 2015, driven by construction timing. And, we are maintaining our current dividend at an annual rate of $1.35.", "Before I discuss our financial outlook, I want to touch on the pending Stuart-Weitzman acquisition. As Victor mentioned, the deal is on track to close next week. While I cannot provide more details at this time, as disclosed, we expect the Stuart-Weitzman business to be accretive from year one of transaction related charges including anticipated purchase accounting adjustments and contingent payments related to the transaction. We expect to use our cash to fund the purchase price. Also, keep in mind that our outlook for the balance of the year excludes the impact of Stuart-Weitzman, consistent with our previous guidance.", "Next quarter, post deal close, we will be in a position to provide details on the acquisition\u2019s impact on fourth quarter results in addition to providing fiscal 2016 guidance for both Coach and the Stuart-Weitzman brands.", "Turning now to our financial outlook for FY 2015: overall our annual guidance has not changed for FY 2015, although the noted project shifts and stronger dollar will impact reported sales and SG&A dollar spend. First on sales, we still expect to deliver a low double digit decline in constant currency in fiscal 2015. Given the strength of the dollar, we continue to expect sales to be down more on a reported basis. Overall, for FY 2015, we expect continued pressure on sales due to our reduced promotions and store closure activity. This guidance assumes that fourth quarter sales will be down by similar levels at Q3 on both a constant currency and reported basis.", "In the fourth quarter, we continued to expect an improvement in North America bricks-and-mortar comp despite the more difficult comparison. Our EOS pullback will pressure total North American comps by about 10 points. Coach Japan is expected to post positive growth in constant currency, benefiting from the lapping of the consumption tax increase and higher PRC tourist flows. However, we do expect softness in the rest of Asia, specifically in Hong Kong and Macau, based upon deteriorating conditions as has been noted in recent weeks. Keep in mind that in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we reported an increase in disposition sales which we will not anniversary given our current and clean inventory position.", "Gross margin is still projected to be in the 69% to 70% range for the year, reflecting our usual seasonality between the third and fourth quarters, with higher sourcing costs largely offset by favorable channel mix and lower promotional activity for the year. We expect our fourth quarter gross margin to be similar to the prior year. SG&A expenses are now expected to be slightly below prior year, reflective of our increased marketing spend and transformation initiatives, offset by shifts in fleet actions, currency, and the faster realization in savings than anticipated. Therefore we expect SG&A dollars to be down slightly in the fourth quarter. Taken together, we continue to expect operating margins to be in the high teens for the year.", "Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be in the area of 32% for the year, so there may be some variability in the fourth quarter.", "In closing, I would like to reiterate Victor\u2019s earlier remarks. We laid out a very clear plan last summer, and its execution is well underway. You heard this morning about our brand transformation progress around product, stores and marketing, as well as our key learnings and takeaways. And I will add that we are also on track from an investment and restructuring perspective. We have taken the majority of our total expected transformation related charges over the last four quarters, including rightsizing our inventory levels. We\u2019re investing in re-platforming our stores and wholesale doors and are on track to spend about $570 million over the next three years so the timing of some projects have moved to an FY 2015 as noted.", "We have begun to realize our cost savings, running a leaner, more efficient organization sooner than we expected. Therefore looking further ahead, we expect to realize an overall annual top-line improvement beginning in FY 2016 with FY 2017 being the year where we return to growth in line with the category. We have the resources to fund our plan while maintaining our dividend during our heavy investment period. Ultimately, our objective is to restore Coach to a place of best-in-class profitability and sustainable growth.", "I\u2019d now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Bob Drbul with Nomura.", "Bob Scott Drbul", "Hi. Good morning.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning, Bob", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen", "Morning, Bob.", "Bob Scott Drbul", "I guess the question that I have is, you know, this was I think the first quarter with some of the newer product in the Outlet business in North America. So can you just elaborate a little bit more what\u2019s going on in the Outlet business? Did it in fact show sequential improvement from the second quarter?", "Victor Luis", "Sure, Bob. The short answer is yes, it did. And as we have been very consistent in communicating, we really believe that transformation is about touching all of the consumer touch points: product, stores and marketing, and doing so across all three channels, our full price channel, wholesale and outlet. And even if we do believe that of course the full price channel will lead, we have been focused on the outlet channel, as you mentioned, with approximately one-third of the product in the outlet channel last quarter having been Stuart\u2019s designs. Specifically, we launched a collection called Margo in Q2, which in Q3 was joined, as I shared in my notes by Mickey, Ruby and Morgan, and we\u2019re very pleased with the performance there. And I would say most generally our approach in product of just providing value by putting a lot more make and quality into products has been incredibly well received. And we have seen that in a very strong increase in our ADTs.", "In terms of the stores, I mentioned in our notes, we just recently a few weeks ago opened up our first Modern Luxury concept store in is Savannah, Georgia. That is a new store. Many of you have seen our previous concept, most recently perhaps in Cabison, which is our Deer Park concept. And I think once you see the Modern Luxury outlet stores, you\u2019ll understand why we\u2019re really excited about this next evolution, and certainly seeing that in Savannah, where the very initial results have been beyond our own expectations.", "And lastly on the marketing front, while we don\u2019t outwardly of course market to the outlet consumer through advertising or social media or any other means, we do through direct e-mail. And of course most importantly through our in-store customer experience, visual merchandising and our vendors, and there we\u2019re making great strides as well in continuing to elevate that experience as well", "Bob Scott Drbul", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Matthew boss with JPMorgan.", "Matthew Robert Boss", "Hi. Good morning. So can you just help walk us through the bridge in your store comp between today and then your expectation for the return to growth at some point next year? And with that, when will we be fully apples-to-apples on a promotional basis?", "Victor Luis", "From a promotional basis in terms of being apples-to-apples, it\u2019s really looking toward July. Once we get beyond, of course, our seasonal clearance, which we will have comps this past year as well as of course getting beyond the event. From a third quarter of 2016, we will be apples-to-apples on EOS, which of course we have reduced from what was in essence three a week now to as I mentioned on my call two per month on average.", "Matthew Robert Boss", "Okay. And then on the margin recovery, what type of sales recovery is needed to move EBIT margin, you know, say back to mid 20s which we saw only a few years back? And do we need to think about any kind of expense build next year given some of the \u2013 it sounds like some of the store builds potentially shift into next year?", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen", "Yeah, Matthew, as we talked about in June when we laid out our long-term transformation plan. We will \u2013 right now in FY 2017, we\u2019ll return to growth in line with the category. And our guidance suggests that that\u2019s the point we\u2019ll be back in the higher 20% margin range. As you look at FY 2016, what we have called out is that some of our store renovations and flagships have shifted into FY 2016. So that will put some SG&A pressure into FY 2016. Again, we\u2019re executing the plan as laid out. There\u2019s just a shift in timing here.", "Matthew Robert Boss", "Okay. Great. Best of luck", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.", "Victor Luis", "Morning, Barbara.", "Barbara Wyckoff", "Hi, everybody. Can you talk about the dynamic of the U.S. full-price stores versus outlet traffic conversions? You talked about ADT being up in outlets. What about the full-priced stores? And then maybe touch on the mix a little bit. How has it changed?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. Pretty much consistent with what we have been experiencing last quarter, Barbara, and what we shared, which is performance has really been driven by ADT across both channels. Even if we have seen a sequential improvement in the traffic from the second quarter to the third quarter, it still remains a drag. Of course in full price, that\u2019s very much also driven by the broader pressure that we have seen across malls.", "In terms of other news in the full-price channel, very pleased still with the performance that we\u2019re seeing in the above $400 price bucket, which I mentioned in my notes is now still hanging at above 30% penetration compared to the 23% last year. Good performance in our footwear business across all channels, full price included, and of course beyond that driven by a reduction in conversion, which as we have consistently communicated is impacted by of course the promotional cadence year-on-year. In the full-price channel, once we get beyond semiannual sales, so into July, we\u2019ll be on a like-for-like comparison with promotions. So there we should see of course a change in those trends.", "Barbara Wyckoff", "All right. Thank you. Are you going to still be not participating in doing Coach Days in department stores? Or was that just a test for the spring season?", "Victor Luis", "No. That has been our strategy for the whole year, and that is our strategy goes forward.", "Barbara Wyckoff", "Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question will be Joan Payson with Barclays.", "Joan Payson", "Hi. Good morning.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen", "Morning, Joan.", "Joan Payson", "So just in terms of some of the dynamics we\u2019ve been seeing with tourist traffic in the U.S., could you just quickly touch on if that affected comps at all in North America? And then also just in terms of the overall category growth comments you had in terms of mid-single digit growth, it looks like Coach has now been more focused on basically product over $200. So are you seeing any differences in category trends in the over $200 versus under $200 segment?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. In the tourist flows we have not seen dramatic changes in our North American business. As I did mention our notes, the major change in flows of what we\u2019re seeing, especially in terms of the PRC consumer are really within Asia, with especially Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei picking up increased tourist flows at the expense of a reduction in Hong Kong and Macau for all of the reasons that most of you know of course with the geopolitical conditions there. In terms of the North American category, we have not seen necessarily a slowdown in the below 200 and increase in above 200. We have been speaking very much to our own strategies and two of course our own individual performance.", "In general, the slight slowdown that we talked about in the category has really been at the expense of the larger brands in the space, which of course is driven in part by our own pull-down in our promotional activities that we have mentioned very consistently.", "Joan Payson", "Great. Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.", "Ike Boruchow", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning.", "Ike Boruchow", "Victor, I just wanted to ask a higher-level question regarding your traffic and profitability within the full-price channel. So excluding EOS. So, you\u2019re doing a great job holding back from discounts and markdowns within your stores, but some of your bigger competitors are building larger clearance sections and going deeper on their sale merchandise. Is there a point where you need to evaluate your thought process around how you balance sales and margins? I guess basically does your customer need more value to come back into the store to get the traffic positive again is what I\u2019m asking?", "Victor Luis", "Yeah, of course in many ways that is job description for us, and we have to obviously continue to evaluate what is happening across all channels. EOS does not really impact the full price business. It has been a flash sales model focused on our outlet consumer database only. And in the case of the full-price channel and what we\u2019re seeing with the competitors and how promotional they may be, either seasonally or openly, for us it\u2019s really about continuing to improve our own product assortment and looking to balance price points across all of the price buckets.", "So rather than producing and introducing a product that\u2019s, say, $300 or $400 and having it on sale constantly in the full price channel for $30 or $40 off, our preference is to give the consumer value by giving them and creating consumer trust by giving them a great product at a suggested retail price. And then at the end of the season, that product which doesn\u2019t perform is the case with most fashion brands will go on sale, and then eventually if it doesn\u2019t sell there of course into our outlet channel. So our focus is really on getting the balance at full price within all of those buckets. We have seen that over the last quarter and communicated it specifically at gifting periods. And that is something that we are developing into.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen", "I would just add, Ike, that as we move to semiannual sale, one of the benefits that we saw is that it did pull new consumers into the store as we switched from PCs which went to our loyal consumers to semiannual sale, we saw new consumers enter the store during that period which was a benefit.", "Ike Boruchow", "Got it. Thanks so much", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.", "Anna Andreeva", "Great. Thanks so much. Good morning.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning, Anna.", "Anna Andreeva", "A question on inventories: very tightly managed, down 23%. Do you think any of that possibly constrained top-line in North America, and how do you feel about inventory content heading into the fourth quarter? And just curious, on the gross margin expectation for 4Q being flat, why couldn\u2019t we see upside to that given that you\u2019re pulling back on promotions pretty successfully? Thanks.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen", "Sure, Anna. Just as we said today, we\u2019re very pleased with our inventories. I think we\u2019re well-positioned. We feel that we\u2019re well-positioned to support our sales plan as we move forward and as we move forward and as we move into the fourth quarter, our inventory is fresh and in great shape. So we feel good about where we\u2019re at. We made a commitment to manage our inventory tightly as we came out of our transformation, and that\u2019s what we did.", "On your question on gross margin in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re really executing against our strategy, and that is to keep making our product, valuing our product, pull back on promotion, and balance the headwinds that we\u2019re seeing in rising sourcing costs and FX. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see play out in the fourth quarter as it\u2019s played out all year. There will be pushes and pulls. We expect a little bit more pressure from FX, and we\u2019ll see our production variances move more in line with what we had in the first half, which is about 50 basis points of pressure.", "Even though it\u2019s after 9:30, operator we\u2019ll take a couple of more questions understanding that our prepared remarks went a bit long. So you can continue to take Q&A.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company.", "Oliver Chen", "Thanks. Congrats on the progress of the brand management. Regarding Stuart and the outlet opportunity ahead, could you give us a yardstick from which you\u2019ll reach a half or three quarters and then as we think about the metrics, is this main impact as he illustrates more progress on this assortment ticket or traffic or a combination of both? And then, Victor, I just had a question on the inventory composition with respect to the pricing spectrum. Are you happy with the freshness across your different price points including, you know, the access?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. Let me first touch on the inventory one, and then I\u2019ll talk a little bit ability outlet products from Stuart and how that flows in. On inventory, we\u2019re very happy both with the freshness of the inventory and with the sell-throughs that we\u2019re seeing. We are really pleased with the product that we continue to launch in the full price channel, and as I mentioned in my prepared notes, especially what we\u2019re seeing with our new macro style in swagger and some of those styles in certain fabrications. We\u2019re very much in chase mode, and that is a collection that we will continue to develop into and have a lot of excitement and innovation that we\u2019re working into that line over the course of the next 12 months or so.", "In addition, we have been, as I mentioned in my reference to Ike\u2019s question, continually developing into the key price buckets and functionalities. We have some key tote silhouette coming out from June, another key carryall silhouette coming out in August, and other smaller cross-body especially at shopper price points but for the full price channel coming out throughout later in the fall and into spring into holiday and spring of next year. So very, very actively developing for balance across all price points.", "In terms of outlets and the continued rollout of Stuart\u2019s product, by fall and into holiday, the vast majority of outlet product will be new designs and even current designs that are there will get a certain freshening up facelift if you will so that all products will have Stuart\u2019s influence in it. We\u2019re very pleased. And there again our strategy continues to be to provide great value to the consumer at great price points, but certainly to continue to invest in giving the make and to continue to elevate the product.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you. Best regards.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And as a reminder, we do ask for one question per caller. The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey", "Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the improvement. I was in the Beverly Hills store last week, and I can tell you that it looked terrific.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Dana.", "Dana Telsey", "As you think about the gross margin impact of fewer promotions versus higher leather goods, how should we \u2013 because this is the first gross margin improvement we\u2019ve seen in, like, six quarters. How should we see that gross margin continue to trend and will more of the improvement come from the fewer promotions, higher leather goods? How are you seeing it? And are you seeing this penetration or product globally? Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Thanks, Dana. So the way our strategy is to balance the pullback in promotions with the increased make that we\u2019re putting into the product. So that\u2019s sort of the strategy. We balance those two with a very high gross margin. As we have called out through our transformation, we expect that to be in the 69% to 70% range. There\u2019ll be some pushes \u2013 pushes and takes in terms of sourcing costs and FX, but overall we\u2019ll continue to have our tailwind benefit as international grows sets the growth pace and that will continue to be a tailwind for gross margin overall. But it\u2019s really balancing those two and managing the headwinds and tailwinds.", "Dana Telsey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question today is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn Murphy", "Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to kind of your comments in the prepared script on higher promotional activity in the category. Are you seeing that across the board from your competitors? Is there a specific channel that that\u2019s showing up? And then in particular, and then if you take a step back, if the category remains increasingly promotional, are you worried about kind of the timeline as you kind of work on improving your own promotional cadence and kind of elevating the product in terms of the turnaround? Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Sure. Thanks, Erinn. We have seen of course the outlet channel by its very nature is a promotional channel. So there\u2019s nothing new there. It\u2019s always been promotional. And from our perspective there, the key is of course to engage and convert consumers coming in. We don\u2019t outwardly advertise to that channel, and it\u2019s about providing them with excitement. And I think that the step change that we\u2019re making across all of the consumer touch points in that channel with our new store concept, of course most importantly the new product, which is now across stores as well as our new visual merchandising guidelines, are proving to be the winning recipe there rather than providing further increased discounts at the moment. So very pleased there.", "In terms of the other channels in our own full-price channel and the shopping mall, I think there was some reference to some competitive brands potentially always being on sale. That is not our strategy. We \u2013 both in our full price stores and in .com we have the seasonal sales. We believe that that is the best way to build relationships with our consumers.", "In the case of the wholesale channel, we are not participating in our own Coach days, and I believe that was a question asked earlier by Barbara in terms of Coach-only events. We have reduced those, and that was a reduction of 30 \u2013 by 30 days compared to last year. Of course there are other promotional days that are across the channel that we participate in to some extent. Wholesale is really 8% of our total business, and we\u2019re really focused in driving the transformation plan per the strategy that we have laid out.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you. That concludes our Q&A. I will now turn it over to Victor for some concluding remarks. Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Thanks, Andrea. I want to once again thank you all for following us and continuing to be on this transformation journey. As a team, we\u2019re incredibly encouraged by the positive signs that we\u2019re seeing in the execution of our strategies as we continue to drive first and foremost fashion relevance for the Coach brand, as well as to differentiate it from the accessible luxury competition that has grown over the last 5 to 10 years.", "I want to recognize our entire Coach\u2019s team for their commitment and most importantly for continuing have the courage and the discipline to stay the course with our strategies, which are very much in the long-term interest of our brand health and of our business. And I know that I speak for all of us at Coach as we prepare to welcome the Stuart-Weitzman team to the Coach, Inc. family and looking out with great excitement to having them join us.", "So with that, I thank you all, and look forward to seeing you over the course of the next few months. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the Coach Earnings Conference.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Andrea Shaw Resnick.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly and annual results are Victor Luis, Coach's Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Coach's CFO.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon a number of important factors, including risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends, or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, controlled costs, successfully execute our transformation initiatives and growth strategies, or our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from the acquisition.

Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our fourth fiscal quarter and annual 2015 milestones and learnings and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives. Jane Nielsen will follow with details on financial and operational results for the quarter and year, along with our outlook for FY 2016. After that, we will hold a Q&A session where we will be joined by Andre Cohen, President, North America. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Victor will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Victor Luis, Coach's CEO.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning. Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we are pleased with our fourth-quarter and full-year progress on the comprehensive plan we laid out a year ago to reinvigorate our business and brand. Our execution of these strategic initiatives and resulting performance has been consistent with our expectations and underscores our confidence in the path we've chosen. As we moved through fiscal 2015, we drove sequential improvement in our North America bricks and mortar business while dramatically reducing the number of promotional impressions in the marketplace against the backdrop of heightened promotional activity.", "In addition, our international businesses posted moderate growth on a constant currency basis, highlighted by a double-digit increase in Europe and strong growth in China where sales approached $600 million. Sales growth in China was driven entirely by the Mainland, as Hong Kong and Macau continued to experience traffic declines from a decrease in PRC tourists.", "We also took an important step in becoming a multi-brand company with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, which will be an additional growth driver for the company. As noted previously, we will develop each brand separately. Over the long term, we will learn from each other, driving synergies across our respective businesses. Specifically, we will leverage Coach's international infrastructure and expertise in handbags and accessories to develop Stuart Weitzman's handbag and accessories business. And in turn, Coach will benefit from the Stuart Weitzman expertise in footwear development where they're proven leaders in fashion and fit. Though early days, we've been pleased with Stuart Weitzman's integration into the Coach Inc. family, leveraging our shared core brand equities and common values. Similar to Coach, it's a brand built on offering innovation, relevance and value to a loyal customer base and is known for its craftsmanship and quality.", "Now, as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across our three key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing as well as our updated learnings. Starting with product. Overall in fiscal 2015, we successfully re-platformed our offering with the introduction of Stuart Vevers product across all geographies, channels and categories. This new product is innovative and authentic to Coach, and we are pleased with the reaction from both existing and new customers to Stuart's first seasons. In addition to our successful fashion week presentations, we've started to engage in a rich dialogue with the fashion community driving awareness, relevance and credibility. More specifically, [technical difficulty] (05:26) designs represented virtually all of our retail stores' women's offerings during the fourth quarter, led by our key Swagger family, which we expanded to include new colors and shapes and the recent launch of the Carryall silhouette.", "The Swagger family is distinctively Coach, leveraging our signature iconic turnlock hardware. We reaffirmed that fashion, when supported by marketing, drives high sell-throughs. This has been the case with great success we've experienced with Swagger, and more recently with our Turnlock Tie Rucksack, which was the feature style worn by Chloe Grace Moretz in our spring ad campaign and arrived in stores in June, significantly exceeding expectations. We were particularly pleased with the performance of some of our playful disruptive offerings such as our Snoopy Collection which garnered global attention in social media and fashion press alike, driving engagement and traffic to stores.", "In our outlet stores globally, Stuart's impact has expanded with its product representing about half of our outlet stores' women's assortment during the fourth quarter. Generally, our fashion-inspired product has been well received by outlet consumers, which speaks to the halo that retail is providing to the overall brand. A great example of this success is our Badlands Print program which has had higher than expected sell-throughs. We know our outlook consumer is fashionable, yet value-conscious, and we are designing product for this customer that reinforces our overall brand's aesthetic and modern luxury positioning. In June, we presented our men's 2016 line at London Collection Men's and were delighted with the presence from fashion influencers in the editorial community, building on the positive buzz that was generated from our first show in January. And in September, we will have our first true runway show at New York Fashion Week, featuring the initial collection of our anniversary year, delivering in February 2016.", "On stores. As you know, this year, we launched and began the initial rollout of a new modern luxury store concept across retail and outlet channels globally. This design, which takes inspiration from our New York heritage, is compelling, warm and inviting, differentiating us from the white glass and chrome boxes of our past that are now pervasive in the marketplace. This store concept is a key element of our transformation strategy, aimed at changing brand perception. And we've been thrilled with the performance of our renovated and new stores in this format where customer response has been positive, particularly in North America where results have been ahead of internal projections.", "More specifically, during the quarter, we renovated 84 stores globally, bringing the total to 108 for fiscal year 2015. In North America, we had 66 renovations, 52 retail, including 45 full renovations and seven light-touch warm-ups as well as 14 outlets, consistent with our plan. In addition, we opened 26 new stores during the fourth quarter in the modern luxury concept for a total of 42 for the year, including a handful in North America. Therefore, at year end, we had a total of 150 stores globally in the new design, 80 in international, and 70 in North America, representing about 15% of our directly-operated store base. In North America, the 45 fully-renovated retail stores generated positive comps in aggregate in the fourth quarter, representing a significant inflection in trends post renovation and out-performance versus the balance of retail stores. Generally, the sales improvement has been driven by a lift in traffic, while conversion and ticket comps also outpaced the balance of chain.", "In outlet, though very early days with nearly all renovations occurring in late June, we've seen a significant improvement compared to the balance of fleet in the period post renovation. Internationally, we are also very pleased with the performance of our modern luxury doors, which, similar to North America, are outperforming the balance of locations. We are encouraged by the results we're seeing across geographies and channels in both new and renovated locations.", "Moving forward, we are accelerating our modern luxury store opening and renovation plans for fiscal 2016 and expect to complete about 60 renovations in North America and about 100 internationally, including the projects that shifted from fiscal year 2015 as previously announced. In addition, we expect to open 60 to 70 new stores during the year. Therefore, by the end of fiscal 2016, we would expect roughly 40% of our store base to be in the modern luxury concept.", "We are also pleased to share that as part of our global flagship strategy, in addition to our previously-announced Paris location, we are finalizing negotiations for a store on Fifth Avenue to open in calendar 2016. Our intention is to create a true Coach house, celebrating Coach's heritage and history of craftsmanship. With a bespoke facade and modern luxury interior, it will provide an appropriate showcase for the full expression of our women's and men's collections including bags, small leather goods, footwear and ready-to-wear, in addition to offering a full range of customization and leather services.", "In addition, based on our learnings in North America, we will no longer be doing light touch warm-ups as we found that these changes are not disruptive enough to drive a true inflection. Importantly, we have identified opportunities to cost engineer more extensive renovations for a cost not much greater than the warm-ups.", "As you know, the second part of our two-pronged store strategy is fleet optimization. For the year, in keeping with our plan, we closed 75 North American retail locations. In addition, we closed 14 outlet stores, including 11 men's-only outlet locations, which we folded into existing stores, leveraging the team and cross-shopping opportunity. And as noted in our previous calls, in January, we closed two outlet stores identified as part of our learning agenda, which I will discuss in more detail later during the call.", "In North American department stores, we completed 300 case lines to open sell conversions in line with our plan, which has enhanced the shopping experience and elevated brand presentation in this channel. We also introduced the shop manager program in the wholesale channel, hiring approximately 30 shop managers in fiscal 2015. This is below our goal of 50 for the year as we are maximizing the program's effectiveness on an individual location basis. Therefore, some of the hires have shifted into FY 2016. Importantly, moving forward, we are taking the learnings from our successful renovations in directly-operated stores and are using them to inform the development of the modern luxury concept for our North America wholesale channel. We expect to renovate over 50 doors in this new format in fiscal year 2016.", "On the marketing front, during the year and in keeping with our strategy, we made significant strides in building positive impressions, amplifying our brand voice across platforms, while at the same time, dramatically reducing promotional messages in the marketplace. Starting with our comprehensive marketing strategy, during the fourth quarter, we continued to build on our Dreamers campaign featuring Chloe Grace Moretz and Kid Cudi, which complemented our fashion campaign from the prior quarter. We expanded our social media presence in Q4, launching on two new social channels, Snapchat and LINE, a major platform in Japan and other Asian markets.", "Both new platforms allow us to reach new audiences with unique content. We've also seen increasing engagement on existing social platforms such as Instagram where follower growth increased over 65%, and engagement rose over 100% from the third quarter. We were amongst the first brands to Periscope our men's spring presentation at London Collection Men's, coupled with other social media amplification, driving four times the impressions that we saw from our fall presentation in the prior half.", "Most recently, in June, we began to launch our #coachpups campaign, which feature celebrity dogs with new Coach bags photographed by the iconic Steven Meisel. As of last week, the campaign had generated over 1 billion impressions globally, including the most successful film launch to-date on YouTube. In June, we hosted our unique 2015 Summer Party on the High Line, celebrating the creative energy of New York City and our company's support of the High Line, driving significant social buzz on Instagram and Twitter.", "And finally on marketing, in celebration of our New York roots and heritage in gloved tanned leather, we launched the partnership as the official luxury accessories brand of the New York Yankees to further drive brand awareness amongst male consumers. Marketing activities include in-stadium advertising, events and player initiatives.", "On the customer experience front, as we enter into the new fiscal year, we are very pleased with the progress that we've made in elevating our overall store customer experience. While we have long been known for great customer service, our elevated modern luxury approach provides our sales associates with the tools needed to enhance meaningful and authentic customer relationships, driven through knowledge and clienteling. In addition, in the next couple of months, we will introduce a new modern luxury uniform to our sales associates globally, signaling them as trusted brand ambassadors. We will also introduce a craftsmanship bar in select stores globally, providing monogramming and bag treatment services.", "And as we increased our positive brand impressions, we've also pulled back on our North American promotional activity. Consistent with our previously-announced strategy, during the fourth quarter, we reduced the cadence of invitation-only eOS flash sales from three a week last year to about two a month this quarter. This is consistent with the prior quarter and our goal to be down to about two events per month by the end of the fiscal year. In addition and as previously announced, we held our summer semi-annual sale event which began around Memorial Day and ended shortly after July 4. This was as planned and allowed us to take advantage of the higher traffic during these holidays.", "Also in keeping with our plan, there were no Coach-day events in North American department stores during the fourth quarter as compared to an average of approximately 30 days across wholesale accounts in the fourth quarter of 2014. And as a result of these efforts, we are seeing progress with consumers. Our annual North America brand-tracking survey fielded in late May and June showed an improvement among the broad premium market that Coach has perceived as less promotional, while our brand affinities are strong overall.", "So, while we understand this is a journey, we are pleased with all that we've accomplished this past year and will continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.", "Turning now to a discussion of global category trends. Overall for the year, we estimate that growth in the North American premium women's market, excluding moderate brands with an average handbag price point below $100, grew at mid-single-digit rate, approaching $12 billion as bags and accessories continue to represent a growing portion of her wardrobing spend. The premium men's market in North America demonstrated solid growth, also rising at a mid-single-digit pace to over $1 billion. Therefore, the combined North American premium women's and men's market rose at about 6% in FY 2015 to approximately $13 billion, with Coach representing a combined market share of about 17%.", "Before moving on, I did want to touch on some recent category trends. During the fourth quarter and specifically in the month of June, by our estimation, we did see a further moderation in category growth from the March quarter's mid-single-digit rate. Growth was primarily impacted by a slowdown among some top players.", "Importantly, against this backdrop, Coach's sales of women's bags and accessories, while still negative, actually improved sequentially in North America. Moving forward, we have long said and history shows that times of inflection in the category in North America and globally have been driven by innovation and differentiation. Simply put, consumers are looking to be inspired and delighted, and our transformation is focused on doing just that: creating desire through differentiation, great quality products that our consumers covet, and building brand resonance by sharing our rich and unique brand story.", "We continue to believe that there is no better place to be in fashion than handbags and accessories, with long-term growth potential in both developed and developing markets and have tremendous confidence in our team's proven ability to execute our vision globally. Therefore, while category trends may continue to be volatile in North America and globally in the near term, due in part to changing tourist flows and currency movements, especially the U.S. dollar and the euro, we are focused on capitalizing on the opportunity in front of us. More specifically, we remain confident in our ability to drive continued improvement in our business with a return to positive comps in North America by the end of fiscal 2016.", "And of course, as a lifestyle and multi-brand company, we also participate in categories outside of women's bags and accessories. We've consistently referred to men's as a growth driver for Coach, and I've already mentioned some of our initiatives to raise awareness through our global fashion presentations and collaborations. In FY 2015, as expected, our global men's business was approximately $700 million and represented 17% of Coach brand sales. We continue to be bullish about the prospect for our global men's category and are continuing to target $1 billion in sales in calendar 2017. We also remain focused on building Coach Inc.'s market share within the fragmented $27 billion global premium footwear category, which is growing at a mid-single-digit pace.", "Looking ahead, we see significant growth opportunities for the Stuart Weitzman and Coach brands. For context, Coach and Stuart Weitzman brands combined do approximately $800 million in global women's footwear sales at retail today, representing approximately 4% of the global premium women's $18 billion category and 8% of the $7 billion North American women's premium footwear category. While Jane will provide additional details on sales in both FY 2015 and FY 2016 distribution by geography, I did want to touch on some current trends and strategies by market, starting with North America.", "As you read in our release, for both the quarter and year, our total sales in North America were down 20%, impacted by our deliberate actions to curtail promotions and elevate brand perception. For the quarter, in aggregate and as planned, our total store comp was down at negative 10% in Q4, with higher ticket offset by a decline in traffic which was hurt in part by the overall weak mall trends as well as lower conversion. Our total comp was pressured an additional nine points by eOS as we pulled back from three flash sales events a week in last year's fourth quarter to about two events a month, in line with the third quarter and plan. Looking at results sequentially, both average transaction size and conversion comp improved, driving the comp uptick in our bricks and mortar stores as elevated fashion and compelling novelty styles drove improved handbag performance.", "I know many of you are also interested to hear an update on the impact of the 75 retail store closures on revenue and in turn, sales transfer to the existing fleet. As a reminder and as noted in our analyst day presentation last June and on our calls, these were the least productive stores in our fleet, so their impact to overall revenues and operating income is very small. Similarly, the sales transfer and impact to comp in those markets where other retail stores were present was also expected to be small. Since January, when the bulk of these stores closed, the results have been inconsistent across markets. In some cases such as Miami, Southern California and North Texas, we have seen a lift notably in traffic. In other areas such as Chicago and Georgia, we haven't seen any noticeable change yet, though we will continue to monitor overall results moving forward.", "As mentioned, we also closed 11 men's outlet stores which were successfully folded into women's locations in the same malls as well as two core outlet stores as part of our learning agenda originally discussed at our Analyst Day last year. As a reminder, these closures were executed to better understand the crossover between outlet and retail stores. To provide additional detail, we chose one store that was largely a tourist destination and one that had a higher penetration of local customers who primarily shopped at this location. Consistent with our expectation, customers shopping in the tourist store had a return rate that was similar to the balance of outset stores, meaning these customers did return to other Coach outlet stores.", "However, in the case of the local store, we saw a customer return rate that was about half the balance of chain, meaning these customers did not transfer to other Coach outlet stores. These results are consistent with our early findings and our expectations. We continue to see customers remain dedicated to their preferred channel. And if we close a customer's primary outlet store, we simply lose a substantial portion of the business. Of course, we will continue to analyze shopping behaviors over a longer time period to see if these early takeaways remain valid.", "Now drilling down a bit more on our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share. The above-$400 price bucket continued to grow in penetration, so another positive comp on a sales and unit basis and represented nearly 30% of handbag sales versus just over 20% last year. Leather continued to outpace logo across all channels, and we are designing into this trend. It is both a shift that favors Coach long-term giving our heritage in leather goods and elevates our impressions in the marketplace. In the fourth quarter, logo across all categories represented less than 5% of retail sales, and in outlet, logo was roughly a third of sales, down year-over-year in both channels. And as expected, we continued to see relative out-performance in the 12 MSAs in North America where we are most focused and where we are distorting our attention.", "As you know, over the last 15 months, we've changed our approach to customer events in the retail channel, moving to a semi-annual open sale model, while significantly reducing the number of targeted or closed customer events focused on our best customers, formally known as PCEs. As a result of these strategic changes, the number of days and dollars associated with the promotion decreased significantly on a year-over-year basis in fiscal year 2015. In terms of learnings, we have found that our semi-annual open sales have served as a recruitment vehicle for new customers.", "As a result, in FY 2016, we plan to test two short-duration open sale events over key periods such as Black Friday, with the intent of attracting new retail customers. At the same time, we plan to adjust the cadence and further reduce our closed targeted customer events to two a year, the next of which is scheduled to begin this September. Importantly, we continue to evolve and optimize the timing and type of events. Our goal is to further reduce the number of days on promotion in our retail channel in FY 2016.", "Moving on to International, most generally and similarly to North America, we're distorting our focus in developed markets towards maximizing productivity. We're taking a portfolio approach to our store base, investing in our best locations where we'll see the biggest return and culling where appropriate. While in developing markets, we're continuing to open stores taking advantage of the real estate opportunities, in all markets, we're increasing marketing and investment in the modern luxury store experience, using such elements as craftsmanship bars to underscore our heritage and history of authenticity.", "In China, consistent with what we and other brands have reported throughout the year, we're seeing significant volatility in results. Hong Kong and Macau continue to be impacted by the dramatic slowdown in inbound tourist traffic, notably from the Mainland. As noted, our business declined there in the fourth quarter and we expect this continued pressure in the near term. On the Mainland, we continued to see strong results driven by both distribution and comp. Despite some macro slowdown, we remain optimistic on the prospects of this market over time as the long-term drivers we've consistently mentioned remain intact.", "As shared, we met our greater China goal for FY 2015 at nearly $595 million and are targeting modest sale gains in FY 2016 of about 5%, similar to our growth in the fourth quarter, to about $625 million, reflecting the current market conditions. It's important to note that we do see the Chinese tourist as an increasingly large part of our business globally, and we have experienced strengthening in Chinese tourist spending in other locations. We are staffing into this trend, increasing the number of Mandarin-speaking associates in geographies such as Japan and Europe.", "Japan remains a mature market and we are distorting investment to our high-profile Tokyo location stores and flagships while optimizing our fleet. Our constant currency sales increase in the fourth quarter reflected the anniversary of the consumption tax increase and the rise in Mainland Chinese tourists, as I mentioned. The response to our new modern luxury stores from the Chinese \u2013 from the Japanese has been positive, seen most notably in conversion in these locations.", "In Europe, our brand is growing rapidly. We generated significant double-digit sales growth in the quarter and year, driven both by distribution and comp, and met our target of $90 million in sales for fiscal year 2015. We continue to believe that Europe represents a significant long-term opportunity for Coach, with domestic shoppers and the international tourists notably in key European cities, where the affordable luxury segment is outperforming traditional luxury. We have taken a dual-pronged approach to the region, growing our directly-operated store base in key European capitals and rapidly growing our brand through wholesale distribution, both department stores and multi-brand locations, to raise awareness with the local consumer.", "We are especially excited about the opening of our first Paris flagship on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 this fall. Overall, we expect that fiscal year 2016 will be another year of very strong growth with sales growing to about $125 million. Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single digit share of the premium men's and women's bag and accessory market.", "In our other directly-operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, which total over $200 million, our sales gains in aggregate have been modest, impacting by changing tourist flows, partially in response to country-specific issues, with MERS in Korea having a significant impact in the fourth quarter. Here too, we are focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives.", "Looking ahead, we are excited about our fiscal year 2016 product introductions which are focused on two primary initiatives, taking product learnings from fiscal year 2015: first, resetting Essentials, our core assortment. The turnlock tote available in crossgrain leather at a compelling $295 price point incorporates customer feedback around the Taxi Tote of fall 2014 by adding function and distinctive Coach elements, differentiating it from the competitive set. Stanton, which arrived in July, an everyday chic carryall with effortless style of the downtown New York Street it was named for, and expanding and updating our Edie family with additional sizes, including the Edie 31 and Edie 28 and in a new color palette.", "We are applying our learnings from last year during the holiday quarter. Specifically, our goal is to be a bolder destination for gifting with a balanced assortment and broader offering at opening price points, incorporating seasonal fashion elements such as shearling and shine. Second, we shall further develop our fashion families. Building on the success of Swagger, we are further animating this silhouette with color block and patch-work options and new shapes throughout the year. We are adding Mercer for spring, a new satchel offered in two sizes with a downtown attitude. And we are bringing in newness with Ace and Nomad, which were features of our Fall 2015 New York Fashion Week presentation. Both silhouettes, offered in glove-tanned leather, speak to our history.", "We are also looking forward to celebrating Coach's 75th anniversary in 2016, where we will fuse our brand heritage and legacy of craftsmanship with product innovation to reinforce our positioning as the original American house of leather. Without giving too much away, through this year-long celebration, you can expect a series of brand and product campaigns and events in support of our re-imaged iconic products, whimsical play concepts, and Coach as a fashion-relevant lifestyle brand. Activities kick off this September where we will present our collection of calendar 2016 at our first-ever, full runway show during New York Fashion Week.", "Now, I will turn it over to Jane for details on our financial results and guidance for the years ahead. Jane?", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Victor. Following Victor's overview of the highlights of the quarter and the year, as well as our transformation progress and learnings, I would just like to add that one year in, we are very much on track from an investment and restructuring perspective. We've taken the majority of our total expected transformation-related charges over the last five quarters totaling about $275 million, including right-sizing our inventory levels.", "We expect to incur the balance of these charges, around $50 million, by the end of FY 2016, primarily related to global store closures and organization effectiveness, bringing the total multi-year charge to about $325 million. We've invested in re-platforming our stores and wholesale doors, so the timing of some projects has moved from FY 2015 into FY 2016 as we've noted previously. We've been able to cost-engineer our new modern luxury concept, enabling us to do more extensive renovations at a lower overall cost.", "Therefore, we now expect to spend about $450 million to renovate our global fleet, down from previous guidance of $570 million. We've realized cost savings from our initiatives around restructuring and organization efficiency sooner than we expected, achieving about $100 million in FY 2015 and expect an incremental $50 million in FY 2016 for an annualized rate of $150 million. And we've exceeded the financial targets we set out for the Coach brand for the full year on a non-GAAP, constant currency basis. As you may remember, we expected to land FY 2015 at a low double-digit decline in revenues on a constant currency basis.", "And, for the Coach brand, sales were down 12% for the year on this basis. For North American comps, we originally expected store sales to be down high teens given the pullback in promotion, with a significant reduction in eOutlet, or eOS events, pressuring comp by an additional 10 points, yielding an aggregate comp of down in the high 20%s. For FY 2015, store comps were down 15% with sequential improvement each quarter, while total comps declined 22%.", "We targeted a gross margin of 69% to 70% for the Coach brand for the year and came in at 69.7% on a non-GAAP basis. We targeted growth of low- to mid-single digits in SG&A dollars for the Coach brand, but were actually down 1% on a non-GAAP basis, in part due to lower occupancy and depreciation expenses related to renovation and flagship store timing, the benefit of the stronger dollar and the realization of cost savings faster than anticipated. And we guided to a high teens operating margin, which actualized at a non-GAAP rate of 18.9% for the Coach brand.", "Finally, we originally expected CapEx to total about $350 million to $400 million excluding our headquarter spend in FY 2015 and actualized at about $200 million, with some shift into FY 2016 primarily associated with project timing, including some key flagship locations. Consistent with this shift, in total, our distribution growth for the year was flat across all channels and geographies. Similarly, our fourth quarter performance for the Coach brand was in line with expectations shared in our April call and in keeping with our annual guidance on a non-GAAP basis. For the Coach brand, our quarterly revenues declined 15%, with North America down 20% and International down 5%. On a constant currency basis, Coach brand revenues decreased 12% overall, with North America sales down 19% and International sales up 3%, reflecting the impact of the strong dollar, notably on the Canadian dollar and the yen.", "Our gross margin for the Coach brand was 69.5% in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis. The year-over-year increase in gross margin in Q4 was due to channel mix, driven by International sales outpacing North America, as well as a significant decline in disposition sales, partially offset by a negative production variance impact as expected. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales totaled 56.4% compared to 49% in the year-ago quarter, all on a non-GAAP basis.", "Therefore, taken together, the Coach brand non-GAAP operating margin was 12.7% in Q4. And on a Coach, Inc. non-GAAP basis, the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman in early May contributed $43 million to fourth-quarter and full-year revenue. Therefore, on a consolidated Coach, Inc. basis, sales declined 12% for the quarter or 8% in constant currency and declined 13% for the year or 11% in constant currency. Excluding transformation-related charges and acquisition costs, Coach, Inc. net income for the quarter totaled $85 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.31. Stuart Weitzman contributed $3 million and $0.01 to the quarter.", "Now turning to GAAP metrics, during the fourth quarter of FY 2015, we recorded charges of $66 million under our multi-year transformation plan. These charges consisted primarily of accelerated depreciation for renovations, lease termination costs related to store closures and organizational efficiency costs. In addition, we recorded costs of approximately $21 million associated with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman. These actions taken together increased the SG&A expense by about $83 million and cost of sales by about $5 million, negatively impacting net income by $73 million after tax or about $0.21 per diluted share in the fourth quarter.", "As a reminder, during the fourth quarter of FY 2014, we recorded charges of approximately $130 million for transformation and other related actions. These charges consisted primarily of the realignment of inventory, impairment charges and a portion of the costs related to store closures. In aggregate, these actions increased our COGS by $82 million and SG&A expenses by $49 million in the period, negatively impacting net income by $88 million after tax or $0.31 per diluted share. Therefore, including these charges, reported net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $12 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.04, bringing the total year net income to $402 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.45. This compares to FY 2014 fourth quarter net income of $75 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.27, which brought the total year FY 2014 net income to $781 million and earnings per share of $2.79 on a GAAP basis.", "Now, taking a deeper dive into the drivers of our fourth-quarter and full-year sales by geography, including distribution growth and starting with our domestic businesses. As you read in our release, our FY 2015 sales in North America decreased 20%. North American direct sales also declined 20% for the year with comps down 22%, including the impact of reduced eOutlet events, which pressured total comps by seven percentage points. At POS, sales in North America department stores declined about 20% from prior year, while shipments into this channel also declined similarly as planned. For the fourth quarter, North American sales fell 20%. Comparable store sales decreased 19%, reflecting a 10% decline in store comp with an additional nine percentage points of pressure from the decrease in eOS events.", "At POS, sales in North America department stores declined at mid 20%s versus prior year as expected, reflecting the elimination of Coach-specific promotional events from the prior year, while shipments into the department stores declined somewhat less.", "During the fourth quarter, we closed 19 North America retail stores, taking us to a net closure of 74 retail stores for the year. We also closed one and opened four outlet stores in the fourth quarter, taking us to a net closure total of three for the year, with 14 closures and 11 openings. We expanded a total of six stores during the year, two retail stores and four outlets. In total, our square footage in North America declined 6% for the year.", "In FY 2016, we would expect to close an additional 10 to 15 more retail stores as well as fold our three remaining men's retail stores into existing locations. We also expect to close a few outlet stores on a net basis. Taken together, with a number of relocations and expansions, we expect our directly operated Coach brand square footage in North America to be essentially unchanged in FY 2016.", "On the North America department storefront, we opened about 20 new doors for the year, taking us to about 975 locations. In FY 2016, we expect to convert most of the remaining 200 case lines as well as opening 10 additional doors.", "Moving to China, in FY 2015, our sales approached $595 million, up about 9% from prior year and in line with our guidance. Our fourth quarter sales rose 5%, with strong growth on the Mainland more than offsetting weak results in Hong Kong and Macau. During the fourth quarter, we opened a total of seven new stores, all on the Mainland, and closed one in Hong Kong. For the full year, as expected, we opened 21 new locations, but closed only three locations for a total of 18 net new locations, taking us to 171 in total. Some of the targeted closures have moved into FY 2016. Our square footage grew 22% for the year. In FY 2016, we expect to open about 20 to 25 new locations, closing about five to 10, with square footage growth of about 12% to 15%.", "In Japan, sales for the year were down mid-single-digits on a constant currency basis, as expected, impacted by the overhang of the April 2014 consumption tax increase. On a dollar basis, sales declined 17%, reflecting the weaker yen. For the fourth quarter, sales in Japan rose 2% in constant yen as we anniversaried the tax increase and saw increased tourist flows from the Mainland Chinese, while sales in dollars declined 15%. We had a net decline of two locations in Japan for FY 2015 and for the fourth quarter, but a 1% increase in square footage given the opening of the Shinjuku flagship.", "In FY 2016, we'll focus on our modern luxury renovations, notably in stores in and around Tokyo. At the same time, we expect to close about five to 10 net locations as we take a portfolio approach to optimizing our store base. In total, our square footage should decline 5% to 10% for the year.", "In Europe, sales rose nearly 50% to $90 million for FY 2015, while fourth quarter sales were up sharply as well. During the fourth quarter, we added three directly-operated locations, taking us to 34 for the year. We also added over 100 wholesale locations during the year, taking us to over 200. In FY 2016, we expect to open five to 10 directly-operated stores for square footage growth of 40%. In addition, we plan to expand the number of both wholesale and multi-brand locations.", "For our directly-operated businesses in Asia outside of China and Japan, sales rose slightly on a local currency and declined slightly in dollars for the year. During the fourth quarter, sales were essentially flat in local currency and declined at a mid-single-digit rate in dollar, impacted by the MERS outbreak and related slowdown in tourist traffic in Korea. During the fourth quarter, we opened one location, taking us to five net new openings for the year and ending FY 2015 with 102 locations in Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan.", "As noted previously, we are focused on developing our current store bases in these countries and don't expect additional openings or square footage growth. Taken together, in FY 2016, we would expect our global brand footprint for Coach across channels and geographies to be up low single digits in square footage.", "Moving on to the balance sheet, inventory levels at quarter end were $485 million, including $33 million of inventory associated with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman. This compared to ending inventory of $526 million for the Coach brand in FY 2014. Therefore, inventory declined 8% on a Coach, Inc. consolidated basis and declined 14% for the Coach brand, in line with sales. Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.5 billion as compared with $869 million a year ago.", "Given our debt issuance in the third quarter and the subsequent closure of the acquisition during the quarter, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal year. As previously shared, we expect to use these proceeds to cover our working capital needs in light of investments in our business and the new corporate headquarters.", "As noted in our press release, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3325 per common share, payable in late September, maintaining our annual rate of $1.35. We remain strongly committed to our dividend. And as our transformation takes hold, we expect to resume increasing our dividend at least in line with net income growth. Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $186 million compared to $316 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $111 million versus $254 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $75 million versus $62 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "For the fiscal year 2015, net cash from operating activities was $937 million compared to $985 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the fiscal year 2015 was an inflow of $738 million versus $766 million in the fiscal year 2014. CapEx spending totaled $199 million for the year compared to $220 in the prior year. The decline from previous guidance related to the shift in timing of retail store and wholesale remodels and openings into FY 2016 and related vendor payments.", "Turning now to our financial outlook for the Coach brand on a standalone, 52-week basis in FY 2016, which we included in our press release. First, on Coach brand sales, we still expect to deliver a low single-digit increase in constant currency in fiscal 2016. Based on current exchange rates, currency headwinds are expected to have an approximate 200 basis point negative impact on annual revenue growth, disproportionately impacting the first half and, most notably, the first quarter. We are projecting a low single-digit aggregate comp decline in North America with eOS pressuring comp in the first half as we continued to run about two events a month versus 13 events in last year's first quarter and 10 events in last year's second quarter. As previously noted, we would expect comp to improve throughout the year, with the most significant inflection occurring in 2Q, driven by product innovation, renovated modern luxury stores and our 75th anniversary marketing initiatives. We expect to reach positive comps in the fourth quarter.", "Gross margin is expected to be in the area of 70% on a constant currency basis, with negative foreign currency expected to impact gross margin by 80 basis points to 100 basis points. SG&A expenses, net of savings, are expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate in constant currency, somewhat less in dollars and ahead of sales reflective of our increased marketing spend, transformation initiatives and a higher occupancy and depreciation expense related to store renovation and flagship project timing shift from FY 2015 to FY 2016.", "We continue to expect at least $50 million in incremental cost savings from our transformation and restructuring initiatives. When modeling the year, keep in mind SG&A expenses are expected to grow faster in the first half, driven by investments in marketing spend associated with the 75th anniversary and, in part, offset by currency. Taken together, we would expect operating margin to be in the mid to high teens. Interest expense for the year is expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million.", "And finally, our tax rate is expected to be in the area of 28% for the year. We expect our rate to be lower in fiscal year 2016, primarily attributable to geographic mix of earnings, the anticipated closure of certain audits, the expiration of statutes in the fiscal year 2016 and the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credits. In addition, we are forecasting Stuart Weitzman brand sales in the area of $335 million on a dollar basis for fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% from FY 2015, driving Coach, Inc. consolidated revenue growth of high single digits and adding about $0.09 to earnings per diluted share, excluding financing, transaction costs and short-term purchase accounting adjustments. It should be noted that Stuart Weitzman's gross margin is well below Coach brand, and as is the company's operating margin. Over time, we believe there is an opportunity to drive both higher, as we increase efficiencies and drive international expansion.", "As a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include a 53rd week, which is expected to contribute about $75 to $80 million in incremental revenue and $0.06 in earnings per diluted share. We expect CapEx for FY 2016 for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $300 million, excluding the capital costs associated with the new headquarters, which are expected \u2013 now expected to be approximately $185 million in FY 2016.", "Over the next few years, our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach and our shareholder. And, third, capital returns. As I've stated before, as our transformation takes hold, we expect to resume growing our dividend at least in line with the net income growth. Underpinning all three \u2013 all of these priorities, our guardrails for allocating capital effectively are: maintaining strategic flexibility; strong liquidity; and access to capital markets.", "In closing, our transformation requires substantial investment and focused execution. We have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY 2016, building on the early successes we saw in FY 2015. We expect to realize a positive impact on the top line in constant currency beginning in FY 2016, with FY 2017 being the year we return to growth across the financials, leveraging top-line growth that we expect to be in line with the category, at least a mid-single digit rate and driving operating margin to the 20% area. We have the resources to fund our plan, while maintaining our dividend during our heavy investment period.", "Ultimately, our objective is to drive operating income dollar growth and restore Coach to a place of best-in-class profitability, which, reflecting the changing market dynamics, will now likely be in the mid to high 20%s given the required SG&A investments in marketing, customer experience and stores in a more competitive marketplace.", "I'd now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications", "Please note also that we will go obviously beyond the 9:30 timeframe in order to give analysts and investors a chance to answer questions. Operator, you may open the call up now.", "Operator", "Thank you. The first question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Bob.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Morning, Bob.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Good morning. I just had a couple questions, I guess. The first one is when you consider the moderation in the North American bag and accessory category growth driven by the deceleration you mentioned among major players, do you think this presents a challenge or an opportunity for Coach?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Bob, in the short answer, it's clearly an opportunity. What we're seeing of course in the short term is an overhang in the luxury market that is being driven by the macro issues and the extreme exchange rate volatility that we've discussed that is obviously impacting tourist flows. But we also do strongly believe that the consumer is simply waiting for more innovation; and clearly, there's an opportunity for Coach to drive market share and category growth by driving innovation in the marketplace and providing relevant brand experience as we have in the past.", "I had the pleasure of driving our business in Japan in what was a very mature market where we grew by taking market share, so this is not a new experience for us. We've long said and history shows that times of inflection in our category and in North America and indeed globally are driven by innovation. And simply put, consumers are looking to be inspired and delighted. And our transformation is very focused on doing just that: creating desire through innovative products, differentiated experiences that our customers are looking for and covet. And we strongly believe that at the end of the day, there's no better place in the fashion place to be than the handbag and accessories space. And with great execution, the terrific team that we have, we remain confident in our ability to drive positive comps by the end of FY 2016.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Great. And then if I could just ask a follow-up. When you reiterated this morning, I think, the return to positive comps, return to growth in the fourth quarter, and the return to growth in FY 2017, just when you look at all the noise in the marketplace and all the noise in the category, is there one or two main factors that continue to provide your confidence in this return to growth?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "For me, it really comes down to, Bob, as I mentioned, our ability to execute in all of the investment that we're putting behind our transformation and our confidence in our strategy. It really comes down to, first and foremost, as we mentioned the inflection that we're seeing in these 45 doors here in North America. We have 150 or approximately 15% of our global fleet now in the new concept. By the end of this fiscal year, we will have closer to 40% of the fleet. And we're really excited about the programs that we have ahead of us through products, through marketing as we celebrate our 75th anniversary, kicking off from September.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays.", "Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, good morning.", "Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Victor, I think you mentioned a positive consumer response to the new product that you put into those North American factory stores. Could you just provide a little more color on what you've been seeing in the outlets recently? Any change in traffic or ticket trends?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I'll ask Andre to step in and provide some context on that. As I did mention just to highlight, approximately 50% of the SKUs now in our outlet channel are new designs from Stuart. Andre?", "Andre Cohen - President, North America", "Yes. Good morning. We've actually seen an increase in average tickets in factory over the last few quarters, which we're pleased with, lots of it driven by Stuart's new product, which has been outperforming compared to the balance of our assortments. We've seen storytelling work really well in outlet, so collections such as Badlands which we launched in April-May, did terrifically. It was about 100% above our expectations, above our plan, sold through completely. So where we've taken bets in terms of more innovative products and more design, more make in the product, it's really resonated with consumers.", "Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.", "Janet Lynne Knopf - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning. It's Janet Lynne on for Anna. Congrats on seeing sequential improvement in the business.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Janet Lynne Knopf - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "So I guess just we were hoping with the category being more choppy in June, if you had been seeing more consistent performance in July, and what kind of category growth you have embedded for 2016 guidance?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Overall, we have \u2013 as we stated in our notes, we're looking at category growth into the medium term of mid-single digits. We remain confident in that 5% to 6% range. And in terms of July, we're very consistent with the guidance that we've just given. So no real change.", "Janet Lynne Knopf - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then one quick follow-up to Jane on the FX impact. Could we expect this to be more translational or transactional? And looking to 2017, should we expect the headwind to continue in the out-year if rates stay at current levels?", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, certainly the impact on revenue is translational. There is some impact that we called out in gross margin that relates to our hedging activities and impacts largely related to inventory.", "Janet Lynne Knopf - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from David Schick with Stifel.", "David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just to \u2013 thank you. To put it together, you talked about the category incrementally worsening of late, but your business having a little more traction of June. How should we put those two together? What are the things \u2013 obviously, there's been a little bit more time with the retouched stores, but if you could just put together what you think is impacting your relative delta for June? And then second, as a second question, how should we think about net advertising expense around the 75th anniversary, I guess, for the year?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. First, in terms of the first part of your question, David, there isn't really one thing. I mean, we've been very consistent in sharing the fact that we believe that's really all of the multitude of actions that we're taking around product, around our stores and around our marketing, whether it be traditional print or recent activities around social media and across channels, not just specific to any one channel. We've been very consistent about that in trying to be as focused as possible in these 12 major North American markets so that we can drive towards an inflection point for the total brand.", "Obviously, look, the clearest sign that we have of our strategy is, as we mentioned during our notes and have been very consistent with, we couldn't be happier with the doors that we've renovated. We're doing everything possible to move ahead at a further and quicker pace with those. What we've done in the last six months with 150 locations, new and renovated, is pretty unprecedented in our space globally for luxury brands. So pleased with that, and by the end of this fiscal year, we'll have another 40% \u2013 about 40%.", "In terms of the investment in marketing, we are going to increase our marketing spend by another $25 million, has been the plan this fiscal year, and we're very focused on that. And it'll be across a multitude of different areas from of course investments in our fashion show to the follow-up work across social media and as well, of course, everything related to what we're doing in partnerships and events, especially with Coach Backstage and music and the like to drive relevance across different consumer groups.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, David, just to add, just in aggregate, over the last two years, we're very much in line with the guidance we put out, which is a $50 million increase by the end of FY 2016 in total advertising. You'll see it in our release this year, and then we expect to continue next year.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "And to be clear, in total marketing, which will be a mixture of advertising, social media events and the like.", "David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Great. Thank you. Good morning. I'm sorry if I missed this, but could you just help us bridge the gap between how you've kind of guided fiscal 2016 with the fiscal 2017 operating margin guidance I think you gave at the Analyst Day. I think you said 20% to 25%. I'm assuming it gets a little bit lower than that just given the broader \u2013 kind of broader category issues of late. But just any context around just that bridge would be very helpful.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "That's right. So right now, we're guiding for FY 2017 in the range of 20%. It's a little bit of tightening based on the category dynamics.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on just the June overall category growth, recognizing it was low particularly in the June month, but was the overall category, was it kind of flat to low single, low to mid-single? Just any context around what that category grew just given it sounds like some of your competitors have had a little bit more of a tough time of late. That would be helpful. Thank you.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "We don't provide it for the month. I mean we're really looking at obviously results where we're taking it from public sources as well as our internal panel. And in general, as we said, we've had a slowdown from the previous quarter mid-single to low-single digits for the quarter.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you, guys...", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "We also know, Erinn, as reported by the ShopperTrak, the market intelligent (sic) [intelligence] (1:10:57) comps actually showed weakening in mall traffic in the month of June too. That was one of our inputs when we looked at the overall category.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks, Andrea. That's helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on some of the improvements in the quarter. Victor, could you clarify for us some comments on the renovated stores? Is your conversion in the renovated stores outpacing expectations at this point? I know you highlighted the traffic inflected, but I didn't quite understand the comment on conversion being better.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Morning, Michael. So, conversion improved sequentially across the entire chain and particularly so in the renovated stores. Overall, it's been a mixed bag of metrics improvement in the renovated stores. Traffic has been the most consistent one, but we've seen improvement in virtually every renovated store. Next is average ticket, that's improved also disproportionately. Conversion has been mixed. In some cases, it's been up, in other cases not. But overall, all metrics have moved positively in these 45 renovated stores.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, would you mind commenting on the June trend? I'm trying to sort out whether there was a shift in sales in June from moving the semi-annual sale.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "We had the semi-annual sale, Michael, as you'll remember, in both June, and we were not speaking only about us, we were talking about the overall category, as I referenced, as well as weaker traffic into malls in the month of June. Obviously, there are a lot of reports of other companies yet to come for us to provide a better analysis of what specifically happened in June. But, again, we did call out what we believe is a deceleration. And I know a number of the other analysts in the calls have also put it out in their research and their handpacks or their results.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And is there any way you can help us think about \u2013 I know you gave us some of the cadence with the inflection in the second quarter in the comp. Is there any way you can help us think about the trend in the first quarter and put some dimensions around that inflection in the second quarter and through the year?", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I think, Michael, what I'll say is, as we come out \u2013 we expect the most significant inflections to be in the second quarter. We'll have a significant \u2013 we'll have an increase in our modern luxury door renovations. You'll see our new product flows as well as 75th anniversary marketing initiatives. So as you're thinking about comps, the most significant inflection comes through in Q2. But really, we're thinking about it as a sequential progression through the year, getting to positive in that fourth quarter in North America.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications", "And it's probably worth noting obviously our 1Q comp guidance, our overall guidance for the trend over the year does incorporate what we're seeing in the markets, most recently in the June numbers. Can I also ask \u2013 I won't wait for the operator to do this, but you limit yourself to one question. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan Chase.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys. So, thinking longer term with the slowing in the category growth rate here currently, I mean, is there any way to think about any signs of stabilization? And then are you seeing any changes in the promotional cadence across the landscape as a result of some of the slower growth?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "I think there's been a lot of comments, Matthew, in the market about just the promotional environment in general, whether it be in department stores, the full-price malls or the outlet channel having picked up across the various categories, not just handbags and accessories, but fashion in general. And certainly what we're seeing go forward in terms of how to think about a stabilization in the category, as I'd mentioned, I think there's two or three things here. There's, first and foremost, the macro trends that we're seeing and especially in the luxury sector, handbags and accessories we know are very much driven as well by tourist in major markets. So I think that's one key impact that we'll see.", "And then secondly, it's going to be innovation. It's going to be brands coming forward and driving relevance and creating desire within obviously the various consumer segments. We're very focused on that with what we're doing and really looking forward to obviously driving forward with both our product and marketing and store initiatives in the months and quarters ahead.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then just quick clarification. Is the 28% tax rate this year, is that sustainable beyond this year or how should we think about it?", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "We see it as our go-forward tax rate for the period of our planning horizon.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Best of luck, guys.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Congrats on the solid innovation we're seeing. And our checks, we are noticing that you're couponing less in outlets, and you've also done a great job kind of value-engineering and high-quality product at compelling prices. Should we expect to continue to see no couponing in the outlet channel? And on the modern luxury renovation, as you have been experiencing these nice lifts in traffic, is that because of the store displays? I'm just curious about linking that to the positive, the window displays.", "Andre Cohen - President, North America", "We've been trying to focus more on outlet channel as a brand building channel, as we believe it is. It's got a distinct consumer who doesn't really shop across channels, and that's resulted in some more experimenting with different promotional strategies. Overall, our discount rates have reduced in outlets over the past few months, and it's a mix of, what we call, variable pricing, so no couponing and focusing on different price points and discount rates within the store and the occasional couponing to drive \u2013 to surprise consumers and drive incremental sales. So that's one part of it.", "The other piece is, going back to my earlier comments, we are trying to market in a more deliberate way to that consumer, so we've been focusing on specific windows in outlet and really trying to deliver more value through improved product, more storytelling, delivering a higher customer experience within our stores as well. So...", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "And, Oliver, I would say just as you look at that, that really reflects sort of what we're continuing to call for in terms of our gross margin outlook, which is really investing in the product, investing in higher quality, balanced by pullback in promotion with that FX being sort of a toggle over time, but continued benefit to gross margin of our international growth.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "And, Oliver, to your question, I think, specifically on the traffic in the modern luxury doors, which is across channels, not just the outlet, part of the answer would be, as you suggest, of course the window program, which we're really pleased with. It helps to differentiate us. But also in general, what we hear from our sales associates is just word of mouth as consumers come in and experience the location, sharing it with others and driving increased interest in the location and in the brand.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications", "Thank you, all. That concludes our Q&A. I will now turn it over to Victor Luis for some concluding remarks. Victor?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Andrea. I just want to close by thanking you all again for joining us. With the first year of our transformation fully behind us, I certainly could not be prouder of our team, the continued commitment and courage they are demonstrating and executing our plans. We have a unique opportunity, a brand with a unique heritage as America's original house of leather. And we fully plan to leverage that as we celebrate our 75 years as a brand by taking a very bold step forward, defining a modern Coach with our first full runway presentation this September.", "In addition, with the acquisition of the Stuart Weitzman brand, I believe that as a company, we're much better positioned to capitalize on the growth outside of handbags and accessories. In short, we're committed to our strategies. We're going to be steadfast in our investments that we've outlined behind our products, stores and marketing as we drive growth and relevance for both our brands over the long term. We have a firm belief that we will return to best-in-class, and we look forward in the months and quarters ahead to sharing our 75th anniversary with you.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Andrea Shaw Resnick.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head-IR & Corporate Communications", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Victor Luis, Coach's Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Coach's CFO. Andre Cohen, President, North America is also joining us.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon a number of important factors, including risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends, or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, controlled costs, successfully execute our transformation initiatives and growth strategies, or our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from the Stuart Weitzman acquisition.

Andre Cohen will speak to our North America business product performance and review our key programs for the holiday season.

This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Victor will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I'd now like to I'd now like to introduce Victor Luis, Coach's CEO.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning. Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we're pleased with our first quarter performance, which was consistent with our plan and reflected continued progress on our transformation journey. We drove further sequential improvement in our North America bricks and mortar business \u2013 led, as expected, by our retail stores \u2013 with this momentum continuing into the second quarter. Our international businesses posted moderate growth on a constant currency basis, highlighted by double-digit increases in Europe and Mainland China, as well as sales gains in Japan. Overall, our results underscore our confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will result in a return to topline growth in FY16 and positive North American comps by the end of the year.", "Importantly, we continued to successfully execute our brand transformation strategies in the quarter across our three key brand pillars: product, stores and marketing. Stuart Vevers' new products have been very well received by customers across geographies. Our Modern Luxury stores globally and across channels are performing well, and we're especially pleased with the ongoing positive comps we're generating in the North American retail stores which have been renovated, as we anniversary the delivery of Stuart's first collection in September.", "And we kicked off our 75th anniversary celebration by hosting our first true runway show during New York Fashion Week, receiving great engagement, editorial reviews, and positive trade feedback. We've also been pleased with Stuart Weitzman's integration into the Coach, Inc., family. During the quarter, Stuart Weitzman's performance was consistent with our annual guidance. We continue to see Stuart Weitzman gain traction internationally notably in Asia where the brand is still nascent, but has significant long-term potential.", "Now, as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across our three key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing, starting with product where Coach is clearly emerging as the house of design. During Q1, essentially all of our retail stores offerings both men's and women's were Stuart Vevers' designs. In handbags, we built on the success of Swagger with new colors and shapes, including a carryall silhouette. We also introduced two new handbags, the Ace and Nomad, which were very well received and reflect our new elevated design direction and focus on Coach's heritage glovetanned leather. Edie, which was introduced in new sizes, continued to do well as did the functional and stylish Turnlock Tote. And in all markets globally, we have seen a positive change in trend in our retail comp driven by new product and our Modern Luxury stores.", "In outlet, we continued to increase the offering of Stuart's designs with key new styles such as Blake and the Ava Tote. Novelty including exotic trim, metallic, and studded cross-grain trended well all at higher AURs. By the September floor set, Stuart's product represented about three quarters of the assortment across both genders. Of course, we were extremely excited to host our first complete runway show in September in a custom-built structure next to the high-line in front of what will be our new headquarters building. The show which was live streamed garnered international acclaim and overwhelmingly positive editorial.", "During the show, we debuted Coach 1941, named after the date Coach was found in New York City 75 years ago. The collection features ready-to-wear and a pinnacle assortment of bags and accessories with an emphasis on leather creativity and craftsmanship. Coach 1941 features distinct but complementary branding, design and product codes and is where the design team can be at their most innovative and experimental with the highest level of detailing and leather expertise is where the Coach brand explores the notion of what luxury and quality mean in a young, modern context. In addition, Coach 1941 provides us with the distribution opportunity both internationally and domestically with many key specialty accounts in luxury department stores.", "Today, we are seeing interest from pinnacle specialty retailers that have not traditionally offered the Coach brand such as Colette, Selfridges, Opening Ceremony, Saks, Nordstrom and others. We're thrilled by the reaction that Stuart's collection is generating and we see it as a clear vote of confidence for our strategic and creative direction. On stores, we're continuing to establish our new Modern Luxury concept stores globally, renovating and opening over 30 during the quarter and we are on target to end the year at 40% of our doors in the new format. Consistent with plans, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceeded the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world.", "We've also seen our new retail and outlet Modern Luxury stores, meeting or exceeding their targets in aggregate. And as part of our global flagship strategy, we opened our first Paris store earlier this month, a 6,500 square foot store on Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 in one of the city's most prestigious shopping districts. This opening is a pivotal moment for our developments across Europe and reflective of our strategy to drive increased fashion relevance.", "In addition, we just announced that we will be relocating our Regent Street store in London to a new flagship location also on Regent Street, but more desirable location where we will also be opening a separate Stuart Weitzman store, bringing the two brand stores to one iconic location on this desirable thoroughfare. And as discussed in our last call, we are also close to finalizing the location for a Coach flagship on Fifth Avenue to open in calendar 2016. Our intention is to create a true Coach house, celebrating Coach's heritage and history of craftsmanship.", "In North American department stores, we completed over 70 additional case-line conversions. We also continued to expect to renovate about 50 shop-in-shop locations to Modern Luxury in FY 2016. Finally, we have about 30 shop managers in place today and are beginning to see a real impact versus balance of chain and expect to hire another 20 by the end of the year.", "On the marketing front, we remain committed to creating desire for the Coach brand and further increasing our share of voice globally. To this end, we amplified our September New York Fashion Week runway show worldwide across our digital and social platforms, driving over 800 million impressions, approximately five times those generated during the Fall 2015 New York Fashion Week presentation of this past February. We ranked in Vogue's top ten shows of New York Fashion Week and we're the fourth most instagrammed show of the week.", "Also in September, we launched our fall fashion campaign, again shot by Steven Meisel and we will soon introduce our holiday campaign featuring Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz for the second season. We also teamed up with the New York Yankees becoming their official luxury accessory brand, capping the season with an event with Yankee's legend, Mariano Rivera, here in New York City. Leveraging our history and heritage with glovetanned leather and a well-worn baseball glove that inspired the Coach brand 75 years ago, this association is uniquely ownable by Coach and will drive awareness and engagement with core male consumers.", "And as we increased our positive brand impressions, we've also continued to pull back on our North American promotional activity, notably further reducing the number of eOS events from prior year. As a result of these efforts, we are seeing continued progress with consumers. Our quarterly North America brand-tracking survey fielded in September showed an improvement among category drivers that Coach is perceived as less promotional, while our brand affinities are strong among premium retail purchasers overall. So, as our plans unfold and we continue to show steady improvement, we are very pleased and proud of all that the Coach team has accomplished during the past 15 months and will continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.", "Turning now to a discussion of global category trends. Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessories market rose at a low single-digit rate in the September quarter, in line with recent trends. Importantly, against this backdrop, Coach's sales of women's bags and accessories, while still negative, once again improved sequentially in North America. And of course as a lifestyle and multi-brand company, we also participate in categories outside of women's bags and accessories.", "Men's is now at about 17% of our global net sales. We continue to believe it is a growth opportunity for the brand and are forecasting mid-single-digit growth during FY 2016. Over our planning horizon, men's remains a $1 billion opportunity. We also recently brought our men's footwear in-house including production management where we were previously only doing design. While the business is still in its infancy, we have been very pleased with our initial results. And of course, we also remain focused on building Coach, Inc.'s market share within the fragmented men's and women's $27 billion global premium footwear category, which we estimate will grow at a mid-single-digit pace over our planning horizon.", "Looking ahead, we see significant growth opportunities for the Stuart Weitzman and Coach brands. While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So, I'll turn it over to Andre for a discussion of North America.", "Andre?", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Thanks, Victor. As you read in our release, for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales in North America were down 11% as reported and 10% in constant currency. Our direct business excluding wholesale was down 12% as reported and 11% in constant currency. For the quarter in aggregate and as planned, our total store comp improved sequentially led by retail. It was down 8% with high ticket offset by a decline in traffic which was hurt in part by the overall weak mall trends as well as lower conversion. Our total comp was pressured an additional 1.5 points by eOS as we pulled back from about one flash sale event a week in last year's first quarter or 13 in total to about two events a month or seven in total, two in July, three in August and two in September, in line with the second half of FY 2015 and our plan.", "Looking at results sequentially, both conversion and traffic comp improved from fourth quarter levels driving the comp uptick in our bricks and mortar stores as elevated fashion and compelling novelty styles drove improved handbag performance. And even as we've anniversaried the arrival of Stuart's elevated product in retail, we continued to see strength in the channel through October. This further underscores our confidence in building to a positive North American comp by the fourth quarter, again led by the improvement in our retail stores with the most significant driver being conversion.", "Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. The above-$400 price bracket held in penetration, saw another positive comp on a unit basis and represented nearly 30% of handbag sales matching last year. The below-$300 price bracket also grew in penetration and posted a positive comp benefiting from our focus on essentials and achieving balance in the assortment, which bodes particularly well for holiday.", "As has been the case for quite a while, leather continued to outpace logo across all channels. In the first quarter, logo across all categories, represented less than 5% of North America retail sales. And in outlets, it was roughly 30%, down year-over-year in both channels. Now in stores, as Victor mentioned, we've been very pleased with the performance of our Modern Luxury stores, particularly in the North America retail channel, where comps remain positive. And in the outlet channel to date, we've also seen an improvement in trend post-renovation and relative outperformance versus the balance of outlet stores. We remain on target to renovate about 60 stores this year with approximately half expected to be completed prior to Black Friday.", "In addition to the physical changes to our stores, we've also changed our labor and staffing model notably in retail with a heightened focus on full-time store associates to create stronger relationships with our customers. Over the next year, we'll be adding craftsmanship bars to select flagship stores globally, providing customization options and leather services such as monogramming, harkening back to our roots as a leather goods manufacturer. We're also in the process of introducing a tier of leather services to all of our retail stores globally. Also in support of the customer experience, we continue to refine our modern luxury hosting ceremony and we've also just introduced a new store associate uniform globally.", "Turning to event marketing, as you know, over the last 15 months, we've changed our approach to customer events in the retail channel, resulting in a significant reduction in promotional activity on a year-over-year basis in FY 2015. In terms of learnings, as noted in the last call, we found that our semi-annual open sales, which will be known as the winter sale and the summer sale going forward, have served as recruitment vehicles for new customers.", "As a result, this year we will hold two shorter duration open sale events over key traffic periods including Black Friday with the intent of attracting new retail customers. As in the case of our original semi-annual open sale, we'll kick off the event with a VIP preview with a tiered offer and then open it up to the public. At the same time, we have adjusted the cadence and further reduced our closed targeted customer events to two a year, the first of which was held as planned in September with the next expected in the second half of FY 2016.", "Importantly, we continue to evolve and optimize the timing and type of events. Our goal is to further reduce the number of days on promotion in our retail channel in FY 2016. Looking ahead to holiday and applying our learnings from last year, our goal is to be a bolder destination for gifting with a balanced assortment and broader offering at opening price points. We'll incorporate seasonal fashion elements such as shearling, metallic and glitter across all categories for both men's and women's creating an emotional and compelling offering for the season.", "Specifically in retail, we will first continue our focus on brand elevation and fashion with Nomad, a sophisticated shoulder bag in glovetanned leather at $495 that's performed incredibly well. Second, animate essentials and build in our craftsmanship message through platforms such as patchwork and color block exotics in key silhouettes including Edie, Prairie and Crosby. And with new silhouettes, such as the Turnlock Tote, a very versatile bag with broad appeal at $350, which features refined pebbled leather and superb functionality. Third, become the holiday gifting destination with a variety of gifts at key price points, including some compelling gift boxes across women's and men's.", "Finally, we'll also be a bolder destination for men's with key new silhouettes focused on backpacks and incorporating seasonal fashion elements such as prints, color blocks and varsity stripes. As we move into holiday for North America outlets, we're excited about our continued product innovation in this channel. At the end of the first quarter, we introduced the Blake collection and have seen great early success notably with a carryall and shoulder bag silhouettes. Blake was launched as a premium price in outlets and we continue to see that our customer will pay higher prices for great fashion items that are proprietary to Coach. Building on the success of our Phoebe and Christie collections, we're introducing updates to these best-selling items with additional hardware details and a broader range of sizes as we expand these collections across a broad range of colors in leather and logo options.", "For holiday outlet, we'll offer compelling and emotional novelty items featuring three key stories that are aligned with our global message: shearling, metallic and glitter. We'll also have an increased presence of gift sets at three times the investment we had last year providing a robust offer of gifts under $100 for both women and men. We will be supporting this holiday initiatives and expressing the warmth of the season in our advertising showing Chlo\u00eb in beautiful shearling carrying the new metallic Swagger projecting fun and optimism. Our gift guide both in-store and digital will be bright and bold featuring more #coachpups and our store windows globally will feature an oversized snowflake comprised of the Coach codes including the iconic Turnlock.", "In summary, we are encouraged by our performance and excited for holiday. We believe that our initiatives across the brand pillars will drive an inflection in North America comp in the second quarter.", "And now turning it back to Victor for international.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Andre. Moving on to international. Most generally and similar to North America, we're distorting our focus in developed markets towards maximizing productivity. We're taking a portfolio approach to our store base investing in our best locations where we'll see the biggest return and culling where appropriate, while in developing markets we're continuing to open stores taking advantage of real estate opportunities. In all markets, we are increasing marketing and investing in the Modern Luxury store experience using elements such as the craftsmanship bars to underscore our heritage and history of authenticity.", "In Greater China, our first quarter sales rose 3% in constant currency, in line with annual target with double-digit growth on the Mainland and with positive comps offsetting weak results in Hong Kong and Macau. Hong Kong and Macau continue to be impacted by a dramatic slowdown in inbound tourist traffic, notably from the Mainland. Despite some macro slowdown and stock market gyrations in China, we remain confident in our $625 million forecast for FY 2016 even at current exchange rates and optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long-term as the drivers we've consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever.", "It's important to note that we do see the Chinese tourist as an increasingly large part of our business globally, and we have experienced the strengthening in Chinese tourist spending, notably in Japan and Europe. We are staffing into this trend increasing the number of Mandarin-speaking store associates in these geographies. To that end and as expected, Japan sales were up 6% on a constant currency basis, benefiting from increased tourist flows from Mainland Chinese. On a dollar basis, sales declined 10% reflecting the weaker yen. While Japan is a mature market where we are distorting investment to our high profile Tokyo stores and flagships while optimizing our fleet, we are continually assessing and leveraging the opportunity with the tourists.", "In addition, the response to our new Modern Luxury stores from Japanese consumers has been quite positive, seen most notably in conversion in these locations. In Europe our brand is continuing to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. I mentioned the importance of our Paris flagship in raising awareness with both domestic consumers and tourists and we will continue to look for other flagship opportunities with a focus on other major European cities. Overall, we continue to believe that FY 2016 will be another year of very strong growth with sales growing to about $125 million. Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over a $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium men's and women's bag and accessory market.", "In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales were up slightly in local currency and declined in dollars. Here too, we are focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives. Finally, I would point out that we're seeing disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which while small are important to growing brand awareness. In the first quarter, we saw strong growth in those distributor operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail has been impacted by MERS in South Korea and the volatility of tourist flows globally notably in Hong Kong and Macau. Generally, across geographies we are on track to meet our guidance, while we continue to execute our brand transformation.", "Now I will turn it over to Jane for details on our financial results and guidance for the year ahead. Jane?", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results for the consolidated business of Coach, Inc., as well as the Coach brand and Stuart Weitzman ending with our outlook for FY 2016. Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results, as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. Overall, our first quarter performance was consistent with our expectations.", "Starting with Coach, Inc., on a consolidated basis, net sales totaled $1.03 billion for the first fiscal quarter compared with $1.04 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 1%. On a constant currency basis, total sales increased 3% for the period. Gross profit totaled $697 million versus $719 million a year ago, while gross margin was 67.7% versus 69.3%. SG&A expenses of $532 million compared to $503 million in the prior year, an increase of 6%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A totaled 51.7% compared to 48.4% in the year ago quarter. Operating income for the quarter totaled $165 million compared to $217 million in the prior year, while operating margin was 16% versus 20.9%.", "Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter as compared to net interest income of $1 million in the year ago period. Net income for the quarter totaled $113 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.41. This included a contribution of $11 million or $0.04 per share from Stuart Weitzman. This compared to net income in the first quarter of FY 2015 of $146 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.53.", "Now drilling down to performance by brand and starting with the Coach brand. As a reminder, all the comments I'm about to make are on a non-GAAP basis. Net sales for the Coach brand totaled $943 million for the first fiscal quarter compared to $1.04 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 9%. On a constant currency basis, total sales decreased 5% for the period. Gross profit totaled $647 million, while gross margin was 68.6% pressured by about 60 basis points from currency. SG&A expense totaled $497 million, a decrease of 1%. SG&A expenses in the first quarter were somewhat lower than our expectations and reflected a reversal of prior-year accruals, as well as a shift in marketing timing. The stronger dollar also was a benefit to expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses totaled 52.7%. Operating income was $150 million, while operating margin was 15.9%.", "Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. Stuart Weitzman brand net sales totaled $87.5 million for the first fiscal quarter. Gross profit for the Stuart Weitzman brand totaled $50.6 million resulting in a gross margin of 57.8%. SG&A expenses were $35.5 million or 40.6% of sales. Operating income was $15.1 million representing an operating margin of 17.2%. During the first quarter of FY 2016, the company recorded charges of $13 million under its multiyear transformation plan. These charges consisted primarily of organizational efficiency costs and accelerated depreciation for store renovations. In addition, the company recorded costs of approximately $11 million associated with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman. These actions taken together increased the company's SG&A expenses by about $23 million and a cost of sales by about $1 million, negatively impacting net income by $17 million after tax or about $0.06 per diluted share in the first fiscal quarter.", "As a reminder, we have taken the majority of our total expected transformation related charges over the last six quarters, totaling about $290 million, including rightsizing of our inventory levels. We continue to expect to incur the balance of these charges by the end of FY 2016 primarily related to global store closures and organizational effectiveness, bringing the total multi-year charge to about $325 million.", "Now moving to global distribution. As you know, our overarching focus continues to be re-platforming our stores, elevating brand perception, optimizing our store fleet, and opening new locations selectively in key markets. During the quarter and consistent with our annual guidance, there was little change in our global directly operated door count. As we are now including a table detailing our openings and closures by geography and brand in our press release, I'll just touch on the highlights. In total, we added eight net Coach brand locations worldwide, all outside North America. We also opened two Stuart Weitzman locations in the quarter, one in the U.S. and one in Europe.", "Looking to the full year and starting with North America, in FY 2016 we continue to expect to close a total of approximately 20 retail stores and close a few outlet stores on a net basis. Taken together with a number of relocations and expansions, we expect our directly operated Coach brand square footage in North America to be essentially unchanged for the year. On the North American department store front, we ended the quarter with about 975 locations, no change from the previous quarter. And in FY 2016, we still expect to open about 10 doors.", "Moving to China, we still expect to open about 25 new locations for the year, closing about 5 to 10 with square footage growth of about 12% to 15% in FY 2016. In Japan, as previously announced, we will focus on our modern luxury renovations notably in stores in and around Tokyo. We'll continue to take a portfolio approach to optimizing our store base and expect about five closures and a 5% to 10% decline in our square footage for the year. In Europe, in FY 2016, we expect to open 5 to 10 directly operated stores for a square footage growth of 40%. In addition, we ended the first quarter with over 225 wholesale and multibrand locations and will continue to leverage the wholesale opportunity moving forward.", "In our directly operated businesses in Asia, outside of China and Japan, we are focused on developing our current store base and don't expect additional net openings or meaningful square footage growth this year. Taken together in FY 2016, we continue to expect our global Coach brand footprint across channels and geographies to be up low single digits in square footage. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect to open approximately 10 new directly operated locations in FY 2016.", "Moving to the balance sheet, inventory levels at quarter end were $575 million, including $32 million of inventory associated with Stuart Weitzman. This compared to ending inventory of $597 million for the Coach brand in the year ago period. Therefore, inventory declined 4% on a Coach, Inc. consolidated basis and 9% for the Coach brand, in line with net sales. Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $908 million a year ago. Given our debt issuance in the third quarter of FY 2015 and the subsequent closure of the Stuart Weitzman acquisition, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter.", "As previously shared, we expect to use these proceeds to cover our working capital needs in light of investments in our business and the new corporate headquarters. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $8 million compared to $139 million last year in Q1. Free cash flow in the quarter was an outflow of $61 million versus an inflow of $99 million in the same period last year. Working capital changes contributed to the majority of the decline in cash driven by two factors. First, higher bonus payments in the first quarter of FY 2016 versus last year as we met the performance goals laid out a year ago. Second, accelerated timing of payments. These primarily related to inventory as we prepared for the upcoming holiday season, store fixture prepayments for bulk procurement and transformation related activities. Finally, our CapEx spending was $69 million versus $40 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Turning now to our financial outlook for the Coach brand on a standalone 52-week non-GAAP basis in FY 2016. As our annual plans have not changed from those shared on our fourth quarter FY 2015 earnings call, I'll be brief. First, on Coach brand sales, we expect to deliver a low single-digit increase in constant currency in fiscal year 2016. Based on current exchange rates, currency headwinds are expected to have an approximate 200 basis point negative impact on an annual revenue growth disproportionately impacting the first half.", "We are projecting a low single-digit aggregate comp decline in North America with eOS pressuring comp again in the second quarter, as we continue to run about two events per month versus about 10 events in last year's second quarter.", "As previously noted, we would expect comp to improve throughout the year with the most significant inflection occurring into \u2013 in the second quarter, the holiday quarter, driven by product innovation, renovated modern luxury stores, and our 75th anniversary marketing initiative. We expect to reach positive comps in the fourth quarter.", "Gross margin for the Coach brand is projected to be in the area of 70% on a constant currency basis with negative foreign currency effects expected to impact gross margin by 80 basis points to 100 basis points. SG&A expenses net of savings are still expected to grow at mid-single digit rate in constant currency and somewhat less in dollars. Expense growth ahead of sales is reflected at increased marketing spend, transformation initiatives and higher occupancy and depreciation expenses related to store renovation and flagship project timing shifts from FY 2015 to FY 2016 as discussed previously. However, given the favorability realized in Q1, which was also driven in part by the reversal of prior-year accruals, we now expect SG&A expenses to come in at the lower end of this mid-single-digit constant currency range.", "We continue to expect at least $50 million in incremental cost savings from our transformation and restructuring initiatives. Taken together, we expect operating margin to be in the mid to high teens. Interest expense for the year is estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be in the area of 28% for the year. The expected rate reduction on a year-over-year basis is primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings, the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credits, the anticipated closure of certain audits and the expiration of statutes in 2016, which will significantly impact our tax rate in the third quarter.", "In addition, we are forecasting Stuart Weitzman brand sales to be in the area of $335 million on a dollar basis for fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% from FY 2015 driving Coach, Inc. consolidated revenue growth to high-single digits and adding about $0.09 to earnings per diluted share excluding charges associated with financing, short-term purchase accounting adjustments, contingent payments and integration costs. As previously noted given the lower gross margin and operating margin profile of the Stuart Weitzman business relative to the Coach brand, it will be a negative impact to consolidated gross margin rate. We expect this impact to be about 80 basis points to 90 basis points to Coach, Inc. gross margin and pressure operating margins by roughly 50 basis points in FY 2016.", "As a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include a 53rd week in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is expected to contribute approximately $75 million to $80 million in incremental revenue and $0.06 in earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis.", "We still expect CapEx for FY 2016 for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $300 million, excluding the capital cost associated with the new headquarters, which are expected to be approximately $185 million in FY 2016. There has been no change in our capital allocation policy and over the next few years our first priority is to continue to invest in our business, as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. Our second priority, strategic acquisitions is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach and our shareholders.", "And third, capital returns. As I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividends to grow at least in line with net income growth as our transformation takes hold. Underpinning all three of these priorities are our guard rails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity, and access to the capital markets.", "In closing, we have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY 2016 and we're pleased with our progress to-date. Building on this momentum we remain confident in our long-term targets. Importantly, we believe that we have the resources to fund our plan, while maintaining our dividend during our heavy investment period.", "I'd now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.", "And our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities. You may ask your question.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Bob.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Bob.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "I just have a couple quick question. The first one is when you look at the Chinese sales globally, it appears that many luxury brands are seeing declines in their business to the Chinese globally. However, you noted yours was up. What do you think is driving that? And second quick question if I could is within the outlet business, can you just talk about \u2013 are you driving the outlet business with a higher discount rate or what's the trend in full price product in there, and just maybe talk a little bit more about the success you're having there?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Bob. I'll take the first one, and then pass on to Andre for the second one on outlet. In terms of China, as you mentioned, we're really pleased to be bucking the trends that many of our traditional competitors are reporting. I have just had the pleasure of spending a week with our teams in Shanghai, in Hong Kong, visited our renovated flagship stores first on Canton Road and then at Hong Kong Plaza in Shanghai, as well as IFC in Hong Kong, and was really pleased and proud of the work that the team is doing on the ground. All of those locations are being incredibly well received and our team is managing our brand incredibly well in what is of course a very turbulent environment, not only with the exchange rate fluctuations and the impact on traffic into Hong Kong and Macau, but also the domestic stock market gyrations which are now very well-publicized.", "As to the mainland itself, as we noted, our revenue has held at double-digit growth with positive comps and this is very much similar levels to what we saw in the fourth quarter. We continue to see the slowdown in Hong Kong and Macau with the Chinese as well, of course, as in South Korea with the impact of MERS and some slowdown here in North America due to currency fluctuations, but we have seen PRC growth in the mainland, of course, and in Japan and Europe more than make up for those drops in the specific locations mentioned.", "In the medium-term, I think we can expect the MERS impact to lessen in South Korea. In fact, we are already, as we head into this quarter, beginning to see that which is great news. And over the medium term we also expect a better Hong Kong, Macau trend, especially in Q4, as we anniversary the slowdown there. I just think it really speaks to the great work of our teams and increasingly our transformation taking hold. I'll now pass on to Andre for your question on outlet.", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Hello, Bob. For outlet, well, first in general, we've been pleased with the sequential improvements of the business there from the last quarter to this one. Discount rates are actually slightly lower than they were last quarter, so we're making progress there with more elevated product and a high share of Stuart Vevers designed product. And in terms of your question on full-price product in outlet, actually the proportions remained similar to what it's been historically, actually slightly lower, so there's slightly more made-for-outlet product selling through at the moment.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Joan.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head-IR & Corporate Communications", "Good morning, Joan.", "Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I think you talked a little bit about the under $300 handbag comping positively now, and I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail in terms of what percentage of the business that segment is, when the last time it was that it comped positive? And then in hand with that, you also mentioned that Logo was still down year-over-year. So just when you expect that piece of the business to stabilize?", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Sure. So essentially our above $400 business, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, was up in units. We've seen a very good growth between $400 and $600, a significant comp growth there, above $600 assortments being a little lighter than it was last year, so there we saw a drop actually, which resulted in a drop in AUR about $400 and that's an opportunity we see in the future for 1941 as we launch that label. Now below $300, we've actually filled gaps in the assortment, so there we've seen a significant increase and we think that bodes really well actually for the holidays where we had gaps as we know last year.", "Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And just in terms of the Logo business as well?", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "The Logo business has continued decline, as we focused on leather, capitalizing on a trend in the market that's moving more towards non-Logo products. So it's down this quarter. I don't see that trend changing significantly over the next couple of quarters.", "Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer. You may ask your question.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, and congrats on seeing nice progress.", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Thank you.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "I guess a question on the comp improvement. Is that being driven more by outlet versus full-price or should we think both channels are performing about equally right now? And as we think to the positive comp inflection in the fourth quarter of 2016, should one channel lead the other? Thanks so much.", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Sure. So we've seen improvements in terms of comps sequentially in both channels. It has been led by retail where there we've seen good trends in both conversion and traffic improving sequentially. ADT average transactions have remained positive in retail. We've seen a similar trend in outlet but a bit more muted than in retail.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.", "Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne Agee CRT", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Good morning, Ike.", "Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne Agee CRT", "I just wanted to quickly talk about the North America comp, specifically the eOS impact, just 1.5% this quarter, well below last quarter's impact. I would've thought there would've been a larger drag this quarter. Maybe, Victor, can you comment if anything changed during the quarter, meaning did you expect a greater negative impact before the quarter started and maybe pull back less for some reason? And any color would be helpful.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. Very much per our plan, Ike. Last year this time we had 13 events. We've been very much planning about two per month and that's very much what we did this quarter as you heard in Andre's prepared remarks with seven events. So very much per our expectations, nothing different.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "And, Ike, for Q2 you'll recall we're overlapping ten events in the prior-year fiscal quarter, so we called out that we'd expect the impact to be slightly less in Q2.", "Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne Agee CRT", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. You may ask your question.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning. You guys have a really heavy mix of your annual earnings that happen during the holiday. So obviously the stock takes a lot of cues from trends in the second quarter. You've obviously been very clear about guiding us to the biggest sequential improvement of the year happening in the second quarter in the comps for North America. Obviously, you've talked a few times about identifying a few gaps in the assortment with the bags under $300, but can you give us a little bit more of how you're thinking of \u2013 how you build up your plan to get to that bigger step-up, because I think it will be pretty meaningful for the path of the stock from here.", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Sure. So it's really about the three pillars that we've been talking about for the past two quarters coming together, so products, marketing obviously and distribution. In terms of product, as I mentioned earlier, we have filled gaps in the below $300 bracket, which I think were an opportunity last holiday season. So a lot more in both channels, frankly, retail and outlets, a lot more of an offering in the below $300 bracket. We've also added I think a lot more emotion and elevation at the same time in our stores, a big focus on gifting, I mentioned shearling, metallics, glitter, et cetera, in full price and outlet. The other thing in outlet is we had a gap we know, an opportunity last year in gift sets below $100. We tripled our investment in that area.", "So I think we're positioned much better in terms of product, certainly, than we were a year ago. We're also building on the momentum of all the marketing activities that started with the runway show. That continues to gather momentum and obviously we're continuing to see strength in our modern luxury renovations. So we think the three pillars are going to be slowly coming together this quarter. Also I should note that the momentum that we saw in Q1 has continued into October, so that we think bodes well for the holiday.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "If I could follow up with one quickly. The comment that we still expect comps to go positive by fourth quarter, can you talk about, with the outlet driving so much of the North America comp, what do you need to happen between today and the fourth quarter at the outlets? You said they're still negative but improving sequentially at a slower pace than retail. What do you think \u2013 which of maybe the components' traffic conversion need to accelerate the most to get to the overall North America comp positive by fourth quarter?", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Sure. We think the conversion is the metric that's going to be improving the most. We've maintained positive ADTs. We see that continuing, but conversion is the metric that we're expecting to improve sequentially in both channels the most.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. You may ask your question.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Hi. Thanks for the comments and the product is looking really sequentially improved. Regarding...", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Oliver.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Sure. The outlet side, we're just curious about the progress on the renovations and learnings that you've had on your earlier renovations versus the ones you're doing going forward and any changes you're making kind of to the store experience there and how you assort Stuart's and lay out Stuart's new product.", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Yes. So we've seen on the outlet front first in product an increasing share of Stuart designed product and that's been impacting performance obviously. The modern luxury renovations that we've completed so far have been outperforming the rest of the chain, so that's given us confidence to continue to deploy that plan. The one learning I'd say is in the men's renovations, men's modern luxury renovations in outlet where we've seen less of an impact candidly and I think that comes from the fact that the men's doors are more recent doors. The modern luxury doesn't look as different as it does from the core doors, so our focus is going to be more on our core outlet doors in terms of renovations.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Oliver, we talked about it last quarter, but one of the learnings that we did call out last quarter was just that our lighter touch renovations were not yielding the improvement that we had expected, and so we've moved away from essentially the paint and carpet, if you will, to actually doing a little heavier renovation, which gets us the lift as we replace fixturing. The good news is that our overall cost of renovations through bulk purchasing and procurement activities has gone down, so we're able to accommodate that shift, while lowering our total capital cost expectations for our fleet renovation.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And on the outlet side, you're pleased with the renovations and kind of how the customer has been shopping the newer stores there.", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Very much so, Oliver, and I would say globally.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. Thank you. Best regards.", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Thank you.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Randy Konik with Jefferies. You may ask your question.", "Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC", "Yes. Thanks a lot. Quick question on the outlets again. So I think you talked about the Logo penetration in full-price down to about 5%, but I think you said 30% in outlets. So is that Logo penetration, is that still a headwind then in the outlet division? And strategically, how do you think about where you want the Logo penetration to be in outlets versus where they are in full-price? And if I could just add one more, are you seeing any differences in product trends in the wholesale channel from what you're seeing in the retail channel at current time? Thanks.", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "So the Logo penetration has dropped in outlet. It's at about 30% now versus roughly 40% a year ago. It's an integral part of the business. It's obviously become smaller than it was a few years and quarters ago. We see that continuing to decline slowly, while leather has been comping positive in outlet, and that's something that I think is very consistent with Coach's core equities. We stand really for leather, so. The wholesale question I may let Victor on.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I didn't get the question.", "Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC", "I'm just curious if you're seeing any differences in product trends or product perception or what people are buying in your wholesale channel distribution relative to the retail channel distribution. Just curious there.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, not dramatically. Of course, we're seeing a slightly higher promotional cadence within the wholesale channel in general, a little bit more price competition which is leading to the below $300 bucket having a higher penetration overall, but in general I would say no really dramatic differences.", "Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC", "Helpful. Thank you.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. Your next question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. You may ask your question.", "Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Brian.", "Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I guess two questions. I know you guys do a lot of customer surveys out there. So with the category growing low-single digits, just curious, I mean, what are you hearing from your customers regarding where their spending is? Are their closets full of handbags already or they're just waiting for more newness? And then on the store closing side, can you talk about maybe what kind of transfer rate you're seeing or maybe the web shopper? What are you watching to see what the right footprint may be is for your full-price business? Thanks very much.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'll take the first question and then pass on to Andre in terms of the store closings here specifically in North America, Brian. In terms of the consumer survey, it's very much as you mentioned, we see consumers a little bit on the sidelines. Obviously there's a lot of macro and currency and other issues that are impacting global trends today. But as we've mentioned over the last call and, again, I think are seeing in our most recent quarterly survey, consumers are looking to be inspired and they're looking for newness and innovation. Our transformation is very focused on that and we're incredibly excited, of course, by the progress that we're seeing, especially through our full-price channel. Andre, maybe on the...", "Andre Cohen - President-North America Region", "Sure. So we've seen very minimal transfer of sales from closed doors. The doors we closed were primarily smaller doors that had limited material impact on the rest of the chain. And look, we'll continue to evaluate and optimize our fleet. As leases come up, we'll make decisions on continuing on closures so that's an ongoing process. We are closing about 22 doors this year, as Jane mentioned, so that's in the plans.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your questions.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the progress.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Erinn.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "I was hoping you guys could clarify the October trends. I mean you mentioned in North America improving quarter-to-date. What have you seen in China just given that October encompassed Golden Week? And then I guess the follow up on the wholesale side of the business, I would just love to hear how department stores are managing their open-to-buy dollars in the handbag category overall. And then there's a lot of concern on traffic in department stores broadly, both apparel, footwear (1:00:34). Did that vary much for you throughout the quarter? Thanks.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head-IR & Corporate Communications", "Thanks, Erinn, for your 42 questions. I'll pass that over to Victor.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I would say we haven't seen any change from the previous quarter to this quarter in any one of those areas. Very consistent really. PRC has continued along the same lines as we saw last quarter and I would say that in the department store it's very consistent as well.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head-IR & Corporate Communications", "Thank you all. That concludes our Q&A. It is now 9:30 AM. The market is opening. I will now turn it over to Victor Luis for some concluding remarks. Victor?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you all for listening. I just want to close by thanking and congratulating our Coach teams globally. Thanks to their hard work, their perseverance and, of course, their excellence in execution, our transformation remains very much on plan. We're pleased with the progress that we're seeing here in North America, of course, with the sequential improvement in our business which has been led, as we have always expected, by our full-price channel where we have put the greatest investments and focus. In what is a rather turbulent global environment for the category, our balanced and strong franchise in Asia as well as our greenfield opportunity in Europe is serving us well.", "And lastly, I'm excited by the emerging trends that we've seen at the Stuart Weitzman brand, not only thanks to the very strong product foundation that they have but also thanks to the very strong and growing momentum that we're seeing with them in Asia. So all bodes well for us for the rest of the fiscal year. Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude the Coach earnings conference.

(Broker)", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to this Coach Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Andrea Shaw Resnick.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Victor Luis, Coach's Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Coach's CFO. Andre Cohen, President, North America, is also joining us.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon a number of important factors, including risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, control costs, successfully execute our transformation initiatives and growth strategies, or our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from the Stuart Weitzman acquisition.

You may find the corresponding GAAP financial information or metric as well as the related reconciliation on our website, www.coach.com/investors, and then viewing the earnings release posted today.", "Now, let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2016 milestones and learnings, and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives. Andre Cohen will discuss our North America business in more detail. Jane Nielsen will follow with details on financial and operational results for the quarter, along with our outlook for the balance of FY 2016. After that, we will hold a question-and-answer session. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Victor will then conclude with some brief summary comments.", "I'd now like to introduce Victor Luis, Coach's CEO.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning. Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations and reflects the most significant progress to-date on our transformation plan, despite the difficult retail environment globally. We drove further sequential improvement in our North America bricks and mortar business, led, as expected, by our retail stores, while our outlet store channel also strengthened against the backdrop of lower tourist traffic and a highly promotional environment.", "Our international businesses posted strong growth on a constant currency basis, highlighted by double-digit increases in Europe and Mainland China as well as sales gains in Japan. Overall, our results continue to give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will result in the return to top-line growth this fiscal year and positive North American comps by our fourth fiscal quarter.", "Importantly, during the holiday period, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Our broader gifting assortment resonated with our customers globally across all price points and in all channels. We continued to transition more of the fleet into our modern luxury concept with a significant increase in remodels prior to holiday, driving results globally and the continued positive comps in the North American retail stores which have been renovated. Finally, our holiday marketing struck a fine balance between fashion and bolder, more relatable gifting messages.", "We are also excited about Stuart Weitzman's results during the quarter, which exceeded expectations. Boots, in particular, sold well, notably in domestic retail stores and in spite of the unseasonably warm weather. Stuart Weitzman's strong outperformance against the category clearly reflected the brand's strong development of fashionable trend-right product as well as its growing relevance with increasing numbers of consumers globally. We are also excited to see Stuart Weitzman continue to gain traction internationally, notably in Asia where the brand is still nascent but has significant long-term potential.", "Importantly, we are effectively integrating Stuart Weitzman into Coach, Inc. while continuing to successfully execute the Coach brand transformation. Since acquisition, we've strengthened the Stuart Weitzman team by bringing in new talent. Specifically, we've recruited a new chief merchant while also leveraging Coach leaders and handbag specialists in product development roles and in senior finance and human resources positions.", "Now, as have been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across our three key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing, starting with product, where Coach is clearly emerging as a house of modern fashion design. During the second quarter, as in Q1, essentially all of our retail stores' offering, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers' designs. Handbags continued to be driven by the Swagger family, with the Nomad Hobo also a key bestseller for the season. Essentials, including the Edie shoulder bag group, the Prairie Satchel and the Turnlock Tote were also great gifts at key price points. And our gift box program resonated globally.", "In outlet, we continued to increase the offering of Stuart's designs and updates, representing about 90% of the assortment with key new styles, such as Blake launched in late Q1, and the reimagined Phoebe and Christie groups in women's, as well as a strong group of backpacks driving our men's business.", "Our gift box program, where we distorted investment, also was very successful. In the wake of our first complete runway show in September, our new Coach 1941 collection received significant attention from top tier specialty retailers and luxury department stores. The collection will debut next month in Saks, Nordstrom's, Opening Ceremony, Fred Segal and Jeffrey New York, as well as Colette in Paris, LUISAVIAROMA, Umeda Hankyu in Japan, Galleria West in Seoul and Lane Crawford in Greater China. Of course, it will also be available at select Coach retail flagships globally, with all stores receiving the iconic Saddle Bag, which arrived earlier this month and was the buy-now feature of our September fashion show.", "We also just presented at London Collection Men's the overwhelmingly positive reviews from both the editorial and retail communities. Naturally, we're thrilled by the attention that Stuart's collections are generating and see it as a clear vote of confidence for our strategic and creative direction.", "On stores, we're continuing to establish our new Modern Luxury concept stores globally, renovating and opening over 65 during the quarter, including 24 renovations and two new Modern Luxury stores in our directly-operated North American business, taking us to about 250 across all channels worldwide. We remain on target to end the year at 40% of our doors in the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends in comps, which exceeded the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. We've also seen our new retail and outlet Modern Luxury stores meeting or exceeding their targets in aggregate.", "In North American department stores, we completed six additional case-line conversions, renovated four shop-in-shop locations to Modern Luxury in 2Q, and added four Modern Luxury shops. Finally, we have about 30 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus balance of chain and expect to hire another 20 by the end of the year.", "On the marketing front, we remain focused on creating desire for our brands and building emotional connections with consumers globally. During the holiday season, we were decidedly more fun and festive in our marketing approach, including a lighthearted holiday film with the tagline #GiveCoachOrElse, which aired on network television in the U.S., a first for the brand, and globally on our brand websites and social media platforms, driving over 135 million impressions worldwide. And our popular Coach Pups campaign brought smiles to consumers' faces.", "Looking forward to the first half of calendar 2016, we will begin to celebrate our 75th anniversary, focusing on our distinctive brand proposition. No other American brand in our space can claim the unique combination of heritage and craftsmanship that is our DNA, fused with the modern fashion sensibility of Stuart's vision. Next month, we will debut our Heritage campaign, featuring Coach icons and starting with the recently launched Saddle Bag. The global brand campaign is a key vehicle to communicate our authentic history as America's original house of leather.", "We're also excited about our Coach Vintage initiative, a highly-coveted collection of four of our most iconic bags that we've reclaimed, masterfully restored, and hand-embellished by artisans, modernizing them for today. The collection has been curated for sale in premium channels worldwide including Colette in Paris and Barneys in New York and Los Angeles. We will also feature installations in Tokyo, Shanghai, and Beijing, as well as a global online auction. You can learn more about Coach Vintage on coach.com, where we have an environment dedicated to several of our 75th anniversary initiatives.", "In the digital arena, we launched e-commerce in the UK early in the quarter and drove over 0.5 million visits to the site during the period. In the U.S., we continued to gain traction through mobile devices, which represents over half of our online visits. And for holiday, we launched enhancements to coach.com, with personalized e-gifting, where customers sent Coach products as digital gifts. And as we increased our positive brand impressions, we continued to reduce the number of eOS events from prior year, and are now at our planned sustainable cadence of about two events a month or six to seven a quarter.", "As a result of these efforts, we have seen continued progress with consumers in our quarterly North America brand-tracking survey, fielded in December. Importantly, our overall brand affinities remain strong with consumers. And this quarter, we were particularly pleased to see notable improvement among category drivers in the high quality and unique attributes compared to six months ago, which we believe is a direct reflection of the investments we have put into the make of our product.", "So, as our plans unfold and we continue to show steady improvement, we are very pleased and extremely proud of all that our team has accomplished during the past three seasons to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from an accessible luxury handbag and accessories brand to one of the most relevant modern luxury brands in fashion. We're excited to see our vision and direction take hold and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.", "Turning now to a discussion of category trends, overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessories market was essentially flat in the December quarter, with unit growth still quite positive, offset by lower AURs given the heightened levels of promotional activity.", "Importantly, against this backdrop, Coach's sales of women's bags and accessories, while still negative, once again improved sequentially in North America. And, of course, as a lifestyle and multi-brand company, we also participate in categories outside of women's bags and accessories. Men's, which represents about 17% of our global net sales, posted strong results in the quarter. We continue to believe it is a growth opportunity for the brand and are still forecasting mid single-digit growth during FY 2016. Over our planning horizon, we believe men's remains a $1 billion opportunity.", "We also recently brought our men's footwear in-house, including production management, where we were previously only doing design. While the business is still in its infancy, we have been very pleased with our initial results.", "And, of course, we also remain focused on building Coach, Inc.'s market share within the fragmented men's and women's $27 billion global premium footwear category, which we estimate will grow at mid-single-digit pace over our planning horizon. Looking ahead, we see significant growth opportunities for the Stuart Weitzman and Coach brands in this category.", "While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So I'll turn it over to Andre for a discussion of North America.", "Andre Cohen - President, North America", "Thanks, Victor. As you read in our release for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales in North America were down 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. Our Direct business, excluding wholesale, was also down 7% as reported and 6% in constant currency. In aggregate and as targeted, we drove a significant inflection in our business this holiday, led by retail.", "Comp trends also improved in our outlet stores, with record Black Friday weekend sales. Overall, our total store comp was down 3% year-over-year, with high ticket offset by lower conversion and a decline in traffic, which was hurt in part by the overall weak mall trends. Our total comp was pressured an additional point by eOS, as we pulled back from 10 events in last year's second quarter to seven in total.", "Now looking at results sequentially, as planned, an improvement in conversion drove the inflection in comp as our initiatives across product, stores, and marketing built momentum. Our in-store traffic trends also improved on a sequential basis, despite a significant worsening in overall mall traffic.", "Against this backdrop of deteriorating traffic, specifically in the outlet channel, competitive pressures intensified and we responded with a higher level of promotion than expected. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver a positive North American comp by the fourth quarter, again led by the improvement in our retail stores, with the most significant driver being conversion.", "Now, turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on products, the above-$400 price bracket rose in penetration, saw another positive comp on a sales and unit basis, and represented about 35% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year. The increases showed continued progress of our elevation strategy, with higher price points and more fashion-forward products such as Nomad and Swagger performing strongly.", "In addition, our gifting offer, covering a broad arrange of styles and price points, also registered well, driving balance in our assortment, with the below-$300 price bracket posting a positive sales and unit comp in the quarter. Our Essentials bags, such as the Turnlock Satchel, Prairie Satchel, and Scout hobo were important drivers, as was an extended offering of holiday giftables and accessories.", "As has been the case for quite a while, leather continued to outpace logo across all channels. In the second quarter, logo across all categories represented less than 5% of North American retail sales, and in outlet, it was under 30%, down year-over-year in both channels.", "Now, in stores, as Victor mentioned, we've been very pleased with the performance of our Modern Luxury stores, particularly in the North America retail channel, where comps remain positive, with now 66 stores renovated, including 14 added in the first half.", "In the outlet channel to-date, we've also seen an improvement in trend post-renovation and relative outperformance versus the balance of outlet stores. As noted, we've not seen the same level of inflection in outlet, given the newer store base, notably in men stand-alones. To-date, we have completed 26 outlet renovations, including 12 in the first half, and opened a total of five outlet stores in the new format, three in FY 2015 and two year-to-date. We remain on target to renovate about 60 North American stores this year.", "In terms of elevating our customer experience, our stores in Time Warner Center in New York, Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 in Paris and Shanghai Hong Kong Plaza, are the latest installations of our concept craftsmanship bars. We'll be refining and deploying the concept to select flagship stores globally, providing customization options and leather services, such as monogramming, which harken back to our roots as a leather goods manufacturer.", "We're also in the process of training dedicated leather services specialists in each craftsmanship bar. This is a truly unique and differentiating feature of Coach stores, which is delighting customers across all markets.", "In addition to the pinnacle craftsmanship bar experience, as we reinforce our positioning as America's original house of leather, we're also rolling out three core leather services, leather care, monogramming and repairs assessment, in all stores globally. The initial impact of these services has been very positive, driving conversion and repeat purchase.", "Also in support of the customer experience, we continue to refine our Modern Luxury Hosting Ceremony and introduced a new store associate uniform globally in October. This is another step towards creating a more consistent Modern Luxury in-store experience, with our staff looking and feeling more stylish and elevated.", "Now turning to event marketing, as you know, over the last 18 months, we have changed our approach to customer events in the retail channel, resulting in a significant reduction in promotional activity on a year-over-year basis in FY 2015. In terms of learnings, as noted on the last two calls, we found that our semi-annual open sales, which are now known as the winter sale and the summer sale, have served as recruitment vehicles for new customers. As a result, this year, we're holding two shorter-duration open sale events over key traffic periods with the intent of attracting new retail customers.", "The first of these occurred around Black Friday, including a VIP preview with a tiered offer, which we then opened up to the public. We're very pleased with the results, with the events both bringing in new customers and reactivating lapsed ones. Similarly, our winter sale, which started and ended earlier than last year, was also quite successful.", "At the same time, we've adjusted the cadence and further reduced our closed targeted customer events to two a year, the first of which was held as planned in September with the next expected in March, which will include a single pass-along invitation for a friend in our direct-mail invitations. As a reminder, the timing of this year's event is consistent with last year. Importantly, we continue to evolve and optimize the timing and type of events. Our goal is to further reduce the number of days on promotion in our retail channel in FY 2016.", "Now looking ahead to spring and summer, in retail, we just kicked off Coach's 75th anniversary by introducing the Saddle Bag, an archival glovetanned leather bag offered in multiple sizes and modernized with an array of colors and trims. Additional anniversary styles that were launched in the March quarter include the Dinky Bag, pouches in small leather goods, and an archival rucksack in men's.", "As Victor noted, Coach 1941 will launch in conjunction with Spring Fashion Week in February with a comprehensive product expression in our top 50 locations, as well as key handbags in all stores. We'll add new styles with our bestselling Swagger family in fun fashion colors and unique novelty patchwork. Additionally, we're launching new styles in the Nomad Hobo group and a new silhouette, the Mercer Satchel, in stores since last week, all of these new bags speaking to our important category-driver segment.", "We'll also continue to animate essentials with the launch of Turnlock Edie priced at $395, with chain straps and Turnlock details differentiating it from bestselling key item Edie. And we'll add a fun layer of novelty prints, studs and grommets to play up essentials. The Chelsea Crossbody, a key under-$300 item, will also launch in Q3.", "Our Men's business in the third quarter will be driven by continued momentum in backpacks, our first Men's collection launch, and distortion in marketing spend on the category. In-store merchandising will position Men's more front-and-center and we'll animate the collection with media support and in-store events.", "In outlet, given the response we've historically seen to novelty, we're most excited about Peanuts, a key initiative for Q3. Peanuts just launched last week in stores and is off to an exceptionally strong start. As you may remember, Peanuts was introduced in retail last year and drove very strong interest in the brand. As always, we'll focus on key high-traffic moments, including Martin Luther King weekend, just passed, and Presidents' weekend coming up in February.", "To this end, the Billie Backpack, launched just in time for MLK weekend, is off to a strong start. Next month, we'll re-launch key styles such as Kelsey, Phoebe and Christie in on-trend seasonal colors, when our novelty assortment will feature hologram, wide floral, and stud detailing. In March, we'll introduce Carlyle, a cool and highly functional shoulder bag showcasing our iconic Turnlock.", "And now, turning it back to Victor for International.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Andre. Most generally and similar to North America, we're distorting our focus in developed markets towards maximizing productivity. We're taking a portfolio approach to our store base, investing in our best locations where we we'll see the biggest return and culling where appropriate.", "In developing markets, we're continuing to open stores, taking advantage of real estate opportunities. And in all markets, we are increasing marketing and investing in the Modern Luxury store experience, using elements such as the craftsmanship bars we discussed to underscore our heritage and history of authenticity.", "In Greater China, second quarter sales rose 5% in constant currency, in line with our annual target, with double-digit growth on the mainland and with positive comps offsetting weak results in Hong Kong and Macau. Hong Kong and Macau continue to be impacted by the dramatic slowdown in inbound tourist traffic, notably from the mainland. At this juncture, with very limited visibility to an evolving macroeconomic environment, we are only updating our previous guidance of $625 million to reflect the renminbi devaluation since our last earnings call, resulting in an updated annual forecast of about $610 million", "Importantly, despite short-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term, as the drivers we have consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever. It's important to note that we still see the Chinese tourist as an increasingly large part of our business globally and have experienced the strengthening in Chinese tourist spending, notably in Japan and Europe. We are staffing into this trend, increasing the number of Mandarin-speaking store associates in these geographies.", "To that end and as expected, Japan sales were up 2% on a constant currency basis, despite a decrease in square footage, benefiting from increased tourist flows from Mainland Chinese. On the dollar basis, sales declined 3%, reflecting the weaker yen. While Japan is a mature market, where we are distorting investment to our high-profile Tokyo stores and flagships while optimizing our fleet, we are continually assessing and leveraging the opportunity with tourists. In addition, the response to our new Modern Luxury stores from Japanese consumers and tourists alike has been quite positive, seen most notably in conversion in these locations.", "In Europe, our brand is continuing to grow rapidly through new directly-operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Specifically in the second quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace on a total and comparable store sales basis, despite the negative impact resulting from the tragic attacks in Paris.", "Importantly, during the quarter, we opened our Paris flagship on Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9, a significant milestone in our brand development and evolution in Europe, raising awareness with domestic consumers as well as tourists.", "We will continue to look for other flagship opportunities, with a focus on major European cities. Overall, we continue to believe that FY 2016 will be another year of very strong growth, with sales growing to about $125 million. Overall planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium men's and women's bag and accessories market.", "In our other directly-operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales were up modestly in local currency and declined in dollars. Here, too, we have focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives.", "Finally, I would like to point out that we have seen disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which, while small, are important to growing brand awareness. In the second quarter, we again saw strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail has continued to be soft due to volatility of tourist flows globally, notably in Hong Kong and Macau.", "On a net sales basis, revenue grew significantly in the quarter, driven by shipment timing to ensure appropriate inventory positions for Chinese New Year. Generally, we are very pleased with the execution of our brand transformation as we continue to position the Coach brand for long-term success while effectively supporting the growth and development of the Stuart Weitzman brand and navigating the volatile global economic trends and currency fluctuations in the intermediate term.", "Now, I will turn it over to Jane for details on our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2016.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second fiscal quarter results for the consolidated businesses of Coach, Inc. as well as the Coach brand and Stuart Weitzman, ending with our outlook for FY 2016.", "Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results, as well as the related reconciliations, can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.", "Starting with Coach, Inc. on a consolidated basis, net sales totaled $1.27 billion for the second fiscal quarter compared with $1.22 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 4%. On a constant currency basis, total sales increased 7% for the period. Gross profit totaled $859 million versus $841 million a year ago, while gross margin was 67.4% versus 69%.", "SG&A expenses of $574 million compared to $542 million in the prior year, an increase of 6%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A totaled 45.1% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 44.4% in the year-ago quarter. Operating income for the quarter totaled $285 million compared to $299 million in the prior year, while operating margin was 22.4% versus 24.5%.", "Net interest expense was $6 million in the quarter as compared to net interest income of approximately $400,000 in the year-ago period. Net income for the quarter totaled $188 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.68. This included a contribution of $13 million or $0.05 per share from Stuart Weitzman. This compared to net income in the second quarter of FY 2015 of $200 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.72.", "Turning now to performance by brand and starting with the Coach brand; as a reminder, all comments I'm about to make are on a non-GAAP basis. Net sales for the Coach brand totaled $1.18 billion for the second fiscal quarter compared with $1.22 billion reported in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 3%. On a constant currency basis, total sales decreased 1% for the period.", "Gross profit totaled $799 million, while gross margin was 67.7%, down 130 basis points overall, including 110 basis points from currency. Our consolidated Coach brand gross margin continued to benefit from channel mix, with our international segment outpacing. However, our gross margin in North America declined on a year-over-year basis. Margin was negatively impacted by increased promotion in our outlet and wholesale channels in response to heightened discounting activity in those channels, as Andre mentioned. Higher average unit costs also pressured our gross margin in North America as we continued to invest in product innovation, providing our customers with an elevated product offering at compelling price points.", "International segment gross margins increased from prior year, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency. SG&A expenses totaled $536 million, a decrease of 1%. SG&A expenses in the second quarter were somewhat lower than our expectations and reflected lower occupancy costs as well as a shift in marketing timing. The stronger dollar also was a benefit to expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses totaled 45.4%. Operating income was $263 million, while operating margin was 22.3%, in line with expectations.", "Turning now to Stuart Weitzman, Stuart Weitzman brand net sales totaled $94 million for the second fiscal quarter, with strength in boots and domestic retail driving a beat in our sales and margin projections for the quarter. Gross profit for the Stuart Weitzman brand totaled $61 million, resulting in a gross margin of 64.3%. SG&A expenses were $38 million or 40.8% of sales. Operating income was $22 million, representing an operating margin of 23.6%.", "During the second quarter of FY 2016, the company recorded charges of $14 million under its multi-year transformation plan. These charges consisted primarily of organizational efficiency costs and accelerated depreciation for store renovations. In addition, the company recorded costs of approximately $10 million associated with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, which primarily includes charges attributable to integration-related activities, contingent payments and the impact of limited life purchase accounting. These actions taken together increased the company's SG&A expenses by about $24 million, negatively impacting net income by $18 million after-tax or about $0.07 per diluted share in the second quarter.", "Our total transformation-related charges over the last seven quarters were about $305 million. We continue to expect to incur the balance of these charges by the end of FY 2016, primarily related to global store closures and organizational effectiveness, bringing the total multi-year charge to about $325 million.", "Now moving to global distribution, as you know, our overarching focus continues to be replatforming our stores, elevating brand perception, optimizing our store fleet and opening new locations selectively in key markets.", "During the quarter and consistent with our annual guidance, there was little change in our global directly-operated door count. As we now include a table detailing our openings and closures by geography and brand in our press release, I'll just touch on the highlights. In total, we added one net new Coach brand location globally in addition to four Stuart Weitzman locations in the quarter, three in the U.S. and one in Europe.", "Looking to the full year, as our overall plans have not changed materially, I'll be brief. In FY 2016, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly-operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance continues to assume that Coach brand's square footage in North America will be essentially unchanged in FY 2016. Internationally, distribution growth will be led by Europe and China, where we are continuing to project double-digit increases in square footage in FY 2016.", "In Japan, we continue to estimate a mid-single-digit decline in square footage as we take a portfolio approach to optimizing our fleet. And in our directly-operated businesses in Asia outside of China and Japan, we continue to focus on developing our current store base and expect only modest square footage growth this fiscal year.", "Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we continue to expect to open approximately 10 new directly-operated locations in FY 2016.", "Moving to the balance sheet, inventory levels at quarter-end were $438 million, including $29 million of inventory associated with Stuart Weitzman. This compared to ending inventory of $447 million for the Coach brand in the year-ago period. Therefore, inventory declined 2% on a Coach, Inc. consolidated basis and was down 9% for the Coach brand.", "Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $1.1 billion a year ago. Given our debt issuance in the third quarter of FY 2015 and the subsequent closure of the Stuart Weitzman acquisition, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter. As previously shared, we expect to use these proceeds to cover our working capital needs in light of investments in our business and the new corporate headquarters.", "Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $302 million compared to $445 million last year in Q2. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $196 million versus $406 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $106 million versus $39 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Before turning to FY 2016 guidance, I did want to provide you with an update on the status of our investment in our new headquarter building at Hudson Yards. As you know, we've long-stated our belief that our investment in Hudson Yards would be monetizeable over time. Given today's real estate market strength and high demand for Hudson Yards, we believe now is the right time to explore selling our interest in the Hudson Yards joint venture while securing our future need for space by entering into a long-term lease there. We have begun to pursue these options with our partner-related companies. While it's too early to speculate, it is unlikely that any sale of our interests or other transaction would close until after our fiscal year ends and we move into our new space.", "As noted in our press release, we're maintaining our fiscal 2016 constant currency revenue growth and operating margin guidance for the Coach brand while raising our consolidated operating income outlook based on second quarter results.", "So turning now to our financial outlook for the Coach brand on a standalone 52-week non-GAAP basis in FY 2016, first, on Coach brand sales, we still expect to deliver a low single-digit increase in constant currency in fiscal year 2016. Based on current exchange rates, currency headwinds are now expected to negatively impact our annual revenue growth by 225 to 250 basis points. We are still projecting a low single-digit aggregate comp decline in North America in FY 2016. As previously noted, we expect comp to improve throughout the year, driven by product innovation, renovated Modern Luxury stores, and our 75th anniversary marketing initiatives. We continue to expect to reach positive comps in the fourth quarter.", "Operating margin is still expected to be in the mid to high teens with some shift between the gross margin and expense ratio from previous guidance. To this end, gross margin for the Coach brand is projected to be in the range of last year's margin, or about 69.5% on a constant currency basis, with negative foreign currency effects now expected to impact gross margin by 90 to 100 basis points.", "SG&A expenses net of savings are now expected to grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency, while growth is expected to be roughly flat in dollars. The lower projected rate of growth is based on favorability realized in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect at least $50 million in incremental cost savings from our transformation and restructuring initiatives. Interest expense for the year is estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million.", "Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be in the area of 28% for the year. The expected rate reduction on a year-over-year basis is primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings, the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credits, the anticipated closure of certain audits, and the expiration of statutes in 2016, which is expected to significantly lower our tax rate in the third quarter.", "In addition, based on Stuart Weitzman's outperformance during the holiday quarter, as noted, we are now forecasting the brand's sales to be in the area of $340 million on a dollar basis for fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% from FY 2015, driving Coach, Inc.'s consolidated revenue growth to high single digits on a constant currency basis and adding about $0.12 to earnings per diluted share, excluding charges associated with financing, short-term purchase accounting adjustments, contingent payments, and integration costs.", "As a result of the higher sales and margin outlook for the Stuart Weitzman's business versus our original expectations, taken together with our projection for the Coach brand, we are raising our operating income outlook for Coach, Inc. for fiscal 2016. This includes an estimated negative impact of about 70 basis points and 20 basis points on a consolidated gross margin and operating margin, respectively, from Stuart Weitzman, a lesser impact than previously anticipated.", "As a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include a 53rd week in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is expected to contribute approximately $75 million to $80 million in incremental revenue and $0.06 in earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis.", "We still expect CapEx for FY 2016 for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $300 million, excluding the capital costs associated with the new headquarters, which are expected to be approximately $185 million in FY 2016.", "There has been no change in our capital allocation policy. And over the next few years, our first priority is to continue to invest in our business, as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation. And we're putting our capital against this opportunity.", "Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act, if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholder. And third, capital return, as I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividend to grow at least in line with net income growth as our transformation takes hold. Underpinning all three of these priorities are our guard rails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.", "In closing, we have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY 2016 and we're pleased with our progress to-date. Building on this momentum, we remain confident in our long-term targets. Importantly, we believe that we have the resources to fund our plan while maintaining our dividend during our heavy investment period.", "I'd now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Bob Drbul of Nomura. Your line is now open.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Bob.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Bob.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "I guess I've got two questions. The first one is can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of what's going on in the category today and how important that is for your continued progress and return to positive comps? And the second question that I have is can you just talk a little bit about how your current business trends are?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. In terms of the category, Bob, there's no doubt in our mind that the secular shift from apparel to accessories definitely continues, and that there isn't a better space to be in, in the fashion space than handbags and accessories. In the short-term, however, there is some volatility driven by macro issues and, of course, the extreme exchange rate volatility that we have seen, which is impacting tourists.", "At the same time, we strongly believe that the consumers are looking for innovation. They're looking for quality, value and, most of all, they're looking for authenticity. And we don't believe there is a brand better positioned to take advantage of that than us. Given our authenticity of heritage and craftsmanship that's very much our DNA, when blended with Stuart's creative vision and the terrific reviews that we continue to get towards our product, our stores and our marketing, we're incredibly excited by the results that we're driving, by the differentiated positioning that we're driving and are very much seeing those results continue to your second question, as we enter the third quarter. We're very much seeing similar trends with guidance contemplating a return to North America comps going positive in the fourth quarter, per Jane's comments.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Morning, Ike,", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications", "Hi, Ike.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Victor, so your North American comps have been getting better for almost two years now. I guess my question is do you have a way of looking at the customer and who they are? Meaning, is this a function of the former Coach customer who maybe left the brand, is starting to come back or is this new customers starting to come in? And then, do you feel that it's the product, the store experience, the marketing, what do you think is the biggest driver in your opinion today? Thanks.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ike. It's really both. We're seeing new customers come into the franchise. And what's most exciting, of course, is that we're seeing that happen not only through handbags and accessories, but also through the small businesses that we're now driving in apparel through Stuart's collections. And we're also seeing some lapsed consumers come back. And that is very exciting given the 75th anniversary plans that we have ahead of us and our continued reinforcement of what's true to Coach, which is really a focus on glovetanned leather and all of the activities that Andre discussed as it relates to the customer service experience that we're driving in our stores with the craftsmanship bars as well as the marketing activities.", "In terms of the areas of biggest impact, Ike, I would say it's a combination of all. It's very difficult to really peel this apart. We're driving total brand impression. We, of course, see the most significant inflection in those stores that have been transformed, as you heard in our prepared notes. The North American full-price stores in aggregate still very much comping positively, including those very first stores now that we have lapped that we opened post-Black Friday of 2014. So really excited by the continued performance in those locations and excited by what we're seeing not only here in North America, but also globally where the pre-post on those locations is very much outpacing the rest of the fleet.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. Good luck.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Oliver Chen of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Congrats. And also on the 1941 collection, which looks great.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications", "Thanks, Oliver.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Regarding your comments, Andre, on the outlet channel, the outlet channel has been a little bit tough sector-wise, but do you continue to see kind of a continuation of the need for higher levels of promotion? And what's the nature of that? Is it couponing or just sharper price points? And just a quick one, Victor, from a bigger-picture perspective, were there any aspects that you would have done differently, just as you post-game the quarter? Thanks.", "Andre Cohen - President, North America", "So in general terms, as we'd anticipated, retail led, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. The positive thing is we also saw a sequential improvement in the Outlet business. And that was led by conversion. We maintain a higher average ticket in outlet. That was driven by UPT primarily.", "I think in terms of how we dealt with the higher level of competitive promotional activity, we tried to be as nimble as possible. We played with couponing. We shifted within variable pricing in stores, handouts, multiples, et cetera. So we tried to be as nimble as we could. We were a little less blunt than we were in the past with sort of a one-off 50%-off coupon. We varied a lot our toolkit I'd say in promotions.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, Oliver, it's important \u2013 as we've come out of Q2, as we've revised our Coach brand gross margin guidance slightly, we've incorporated the activity in the heightened competitive activity into our guidance for the Coach brand gross margin for the full year.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I would just add, Oliver, and connected to your question, in terms of key learnings, first, the most significant learnings, obviously, were those related to Stuart's collection, launching the first season over a year ago in terms of just having enrichened our gifting offer and having a richer presentation of price points across various buckets, right, in outlets from the $150 of course and into full price above the $400 bucket, and you saw the balance of that and heard about that in Andre's remarks.", "Overall, though, it continues to be the same strategy and focus, which is to continue to give the consumers more value, not only through pricing, of course, and it's important to recognize that outlet is a promotional channel and consumers do go to that channel specifically for deals, but also through what we're doing with experience. Those of you who have had the opportunity to visit our Modern Luxury outlet stores I think see and feel that, and that continues to be a major program for us as we also continue to put make into the product and give consumers value across all of our channels.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Great job on the balance of fashion versus gifting and best regards.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Oliver.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Oliver.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray. You may now ask your question.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. Victor, I was hoping for you to talk a little bit more about your digital strategy. As you fuel that, can you just talk about the signposts that you're monitoring that do suggest that you're getting that millennial customer shopping the Coach brand today?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. I think that when it comes to digital, we're really focused on a couple of key strategies. Obviously, there's e-commerce, and not only what we're doing here in North America. One of the major steps that we've taken over the last, I would say almost two years now since the beginning of our transformation strategies, of course, was to pull back on our eOS strategies. You've seen us put a lot of emphasis on bringing innovation to coach.com as a full-price vehicle as well as to everything that we're doing, of course, digitally through social media gaining very, very quick relevance for the brand, especially through Instagram, which has been a major focus for Coach.", "Internationally, you've heard during our prepared remarks today that we have just opened a new e-commerce site in Europe, having started with the UK. Our plans will be to roll that out across Europe over the next 12 months, while we also continue to gain traction in Asia. I'm happy to report that our teams in Asia have in many ways been leading the way in those markets for the entire category. In Japan, we've made great progress getting onto Line, and in China, not only Sina Weibo, where we're one of the leading \u2013 I believe still the leading fashion brand in terms of number of followers, but also on WeChat, where we've also been leading the way.", "So I would say globally, we are where the millennials are today engaging with brands. It's not just about the channel. However, we know that it's about the content. And there, we're incredibly pleased with the work that Stuart's doing, with the reviews that we're getting from the editorial community and from the bloggers that, of course, influence the millennial consumer. So it's a process. We're very much on our way, and it's very exciting to see the progress that we are making.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Thanks for the color, and best of luck.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from David Schick of Stifel. Your line is open.", "David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Morning, David.", "David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And congratulations on the success in Weitzman. So you talked about having the flexibility to act with more acquisitions. Could you talk about how Weitzman will work within the overall Coach out a couple years, and then how you would think about other acquisitions? What are the ways you would think through that?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, David, at the moment, we're obviously very, very focused still on integrating Stuart Weitzman. I couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing with that brand, the team, and the traction that they're gaining. It really speaks to the strategy that we have and what we internally have called modern luxury, which is getting a collection of brands together that have quality, that have authenticity, and, at the same time, share in fashion relevance and can engage in a modern way with consumers.", "In the case of Stuart Weitzman, what we're seeing is really an affirmation of all the due diligence that we've done. It's a terrific brand with amazing fit, amazing quality, superb supply chain, truly a leader in the space in the U.S. And in a season where boots were not selling given the unseasonably warm weather, they were the top performer across all channels, whether it be here in top-tier department stores in the U.S., Europe, and in China where they're gaining increasing relevance which is very exciting for us.", "And it's not only the products. They're doing an amazing job engaging with consumers. We talked about what Coach is doing, of course, online, but what the Stuart Weitzman team has been doing with their marketing is a great example for us at Coach and indeed for the entire industry as they engage with more youthful consumers online.", "In terms of longer term, it's very much consistent with what we have shared. We will, of course, be leveraging the Coach team to support Stuart Weitzman in the development of their handbag and accessories business. We discussed already the talent that is already working on that project. And by the end of this calendar year, beginning of next, we should begin to see some of that product hit the Stuart Weitzman stores.", "In addition, the Stuart Weitzman team will be supporting Coach with the footwear supply chain opportunities that exist when it comes to fit and certainly comfort and potentially longer-term, in a more meaningful way as well. And we're supporting the Stuart Weitzman brand already in some significant ways with real estate, and we've talked about Regent Street, where we will be opening the first Stuart Weitzman flagship in the UK next to the Coach flagship there later this year.", "David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications", "We can take one more question.", "Operator", "The next question is from Anna Andreeva of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks so much. Good morning and congrats to the team.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Anna.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "I guess a follow-up on the category in North America, could you share how much of the deceleration is the AUR pressure? I think you said the units are still up nicely. And do you need the category to bounce back at all for Coach to achieve those positive comps by the fourth quarter? Thanks so much.", "Andre Cohen - President, North America", "Yes. In terms of what we've seen in the market, there's been a deceleration of AURs and units going up. In the case of Coach in retail, we actually drove positive ADT. (60:26) So that's an important factor in Q2. So and as I mentioned earlier, we've seen that sequential improvement in our overall business, particularly led by retail, with conversion improving sequentially and our traffic also improving sequentially quarter-over-quarter.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. In terms of the second part of your question, the short answer is no. We're really excited about the traction that we're seeing in our brand sequentially. Since the start of our transformation, we've seen our comps in North America improve by 20 points, irrespective of what's happened in the category. And so as we look to the future, this is really about driving relevance for the Coach brand. It's not to say that we're immune to what's happening around us, but we're very, very focused on executing our plan. And we're very pleased with the results that we're seeing and very much looking forward, as guided, to achieving positive comps in North America in the fourth quarter.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "That's great. Best of luck.", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications", "Thank you. That concludes our Q&A. I will now turn it over to Victor Luis for some concluding remarks. Victor?", "Victor Luis - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Andrea. I just want to close by, first and foremost, thanking all of you for joining us again and looking forward to seeing, of course, and hearing from you again during the rest of the quarter as we visit with some of you individually. I also want to thank and congratulate both the Coach and the Stuart Weitzman teams for their hard work and the commitment to driving our second quarter results and truly the fantastic development that we're seeing in our brands against what is a volatile global backdrop.", "Our brands are special. They represent decades of blending a unique know-how in the crafts that we have with modern-inspired design of our teams. And it's fitting for us that in the 75th anniversary of Coach as we celebrate that this year that we will again drive growth by fusing very much the history that we share and the authenticity of our craft with the vision of our creative teams. And thank you all for being with us.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Global Head, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Feature results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon a number of important factors including risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, control costs, successfully execute our transformation and operational efficiency initiatives and growth strategies or our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from the Stuart Weitzman acquisition.", "Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a complete list of risks and important factors.

This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 AM, we will then conclude with some brief summary marks.", "I would now like to introduce Victor Luis, Coach's, CEO.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning, thank you Andrea and welcome everyone. As noted in our press release we are very pleased with our third-quarter performance which was consistent with our expectations and reflects the return to growth for Coach across the key financial metrics of sales, operating profit and bps. We drove further sequential improvement in North America direct business with both channels strengthening similarly while the Internet also contributed to results this quarter. Our international businesses posted strong growth on a constant currency basis highlighted by double-digit increases in Mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in Japan and other Asian countries.", "We were especially gratified by our ability to drive this inflection for the brand against the backdrop of macroeconomic and promotional headwinds and amid volatile tourist flows globally. Overall, our results continue to give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will continue to drive topline growth this fiscal year and positive North American comps in the fourth fiscal quarter. ", "Importantly, during the third quarter we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing.", "Our elevated Coach 1941assortment resonated in our retail stores globally as well as in key new specialty retail accounts having debuted in Nordstrom Saks Opening Ceremony, Fred Segal and Jeffrey New York as well as Colette in Paris, LUISAVIAROMA, Umeda Hankyu in Japan, Galleria West in Seoul and Lane Crawford in Greater China. In outlet our snoopy fashion vignette was particularly well-received and we will continue to surprise and delight the consumer in this channel with increased levels of innovation. We continue to transition the fleet into our modern luxury concept driving comp improvement.", "Finally, our new heritage marketing campaign focused on originality and authenticity highlights Coach's key competitive differences separating us from the landscape of both legacy European luxury and American accessible brands. We are also pleased by Stuart Weitzman's results this quarter. As noted in our press release we expect to close on the acquisition of the brands Canadian distributor in the fourth quarter. Longer-term, we continue to believe that Stuart Weitzman has significant potential in the integration to-date reflects our ability to operate as a multi-brand company.", "And as Jane will discuss in more detail we also announced an operational efficiency plan today focusing on creating a more agile streamlined corporate structure enabling us to be more responsive to rapidly changing business conditions. The plan includes the elimination of over 300 positions worldwide representing about a 10% decrease in global corporate staff or about a 2% reduction in our total workforce.", "These actions will allow us to emerge as a global brand led company with fewer layers, larger spans of responsibilities and a consistent global voice across merchandising and marketing. To this end, we are promoting two seasoned Coach executives Andre Cohen and Todd Kahn. Andre is being promoted to President, North America and Global Marketing adding North America wholesale as well as global marketing customer experience and digital to his responsibilities.", "Todd is being promoted to President, Chief Administrative Officer & Secretary and will expand his scope to include IT, supply-chain, global environment and procurement. They are both proven leaders with experience across many aspects of Coach's global business and a well-prepared to address the opportunities ahead of us as we continue to transform.", "Most importantly, they have consistently delivered results for our brand and company in their respected 8 year tenures. In addition, Diane Mahady has assumed the role of Global Head of Merchandising for the Coach brand. In this Diane will oversee merchandising for the entire Coach portfolio including women's, men's and licensed categories.", "With these changes Gebhard Rainer, President and Chief Operating Officer and David Duplantis, President, Global Marketing, Digital and Customer Experience will be leaving Coach. I want to take this opportunity to thank both Gebhard and David for their important contributions to the company. Gebhard notably for his work on the successful integration of Stuart Weitzman over the last year and most recently for his leadership in our restructuring and efficiency initiatives.", "And David who has made significant contributions to Coach over his 18 year tenure and role spanning North America merchandising, e-commerce and digital and global marketing. He was a key player in building Coach into a leading global lifestyle brand establishing our digital footprint in most recently in our brand transformation. The entire Coach team has great admiration and respect for Gebhard and David significant accomplishments and we wish them the best.", "Now, it has been our recent practice I would like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across the three Coach brand pillars of product, stores and marketing. Starting with product, where Coach is clearly emerging as the house of modern fashion design.", "During the third quarter as in the first half of the year, essentially all of our retail channel assortment both men's and women's were Stuart Weaver's [ph] designs. It was however the first quarter that included Coach 1941 and emphasized our elevation strategy. This was a pivot from holiday where we distorted the under $300 price point in our gifting assortment. The rouge, saddle and dinky [ph] have all performed well with price points up to $800 and above. The Swagger family which anniversary it's original launch in February 2015, comp to comp with the new Mercer Satchel also contributing to results.", "Essentials while deemphasized were highlighted by the introductions of the Turnlock Edie, Edie 31 and Prairie. In outlet the offering of Stuart's designs in updates represented over 90% of the assortment with key new styles in women such as the Sierra Satchel, the City Zip Tote and the Mini Bennett performing well along with the Phoebe and Christie groups [ph].", "On the men's side a strong group of bags and backpacks drove our business. We also had an exceptional response to the snoopy fashion vignette as mentioned proving that this customer will respond to innovation and novelty. After the success of our first complete runway show in September and the Coach 1941 launch we followed up in February at New York Fashion Week introducing our 1941 fall collection. Once again, it received significant attention from the fashion press as well as top-tier specialty retailers and luxury department stores.", "On stores, we are continuing to establish our new modern luxury concept stores globally, renovating and opening 40 during the quarter including six renovations and two new modern luxury stores in our directly operated North American business taking us to about 290 across all channels worldwide. We remain on target to end the year at over 400 of our doors including wholesale in the new format. Consistent with plans these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps which exceed the balance of fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world.", "We are especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we are driving in our renovated North America retail stores including those stores that have now anniversaried there remodels. In North American department stores we renovated eight shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in the third quarter. Finally, we have about 35 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus the balance of doors and expect to hire another 15 by the end of the year.", "On the marketing front, we remain focused on creating desire for our brand amplifying our fashion positioning and our 75 year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality, building emotional connections with consumers globally. In February we debuted our heritage campaign featuring Coach icons and starting with the saddle bag followed by the dinky bag in March.", "This global brand campaign is a key vehicle to communicate our authentic history as America's original house of leather with taglines such as, We Got Our Heritage The Old-Fashioned Way, We Inherited It, setting us apart from the direct competitors who are often inspired by our archives. Also position to amplify our brand heritage we are very pleased with the response to our Coach vintage initiative. A collection of highly covered bags for the 1970s and 80s that we've reclaimed masterfully restored and hand embellished by Coach Artisans modernizing them for today in making each a one-of-a-kind. The collection was a big hit during its debut launch at Colette in Paris in December and later saw success at Barneys New York.", "Our next installations will be available in premium locations in Beijing, Tokyo and Hong Kong with a global online auction completing the initiative later this fall further amplifying our storied heritage and fashion credibility to a cool audience. Our fashion advertising campaign supported the launch of Coach 1941. Focused on the saddlebag and shot by photographers Steven Meisel, it has captured the attention of consumers worldwide through our bold positioning in social, out of home and prints [ph].", "And resonating with our broad audience and primarily position through the digital channels, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Kid Cudi continue to be the faces of our celebrity campaign. Once again our runway shows we\u2019re highly engaged and amplified through social media with our London Men's Show in January garnering over 150 million impressions and our February New York fashion week show driving over 700 million impressions and ranked number three of the top mentioned hashtags by WWD during New York Fashion Week reflecting the increasing vibrancy of our brand.", "And our online instashop runway initiative featuring the rouge bag sold out within an hour. On Coach.com, we\u2019re further enhancing our emotional bonds with our visitors through a series of personalization initiatives including the recent introduction of our customizable store repatch. We've also evolved our suite of monogramming initiatives and introduced a feature that allows for adding a charm to bags to making them even more personal.", "Looking forward to the balance of calendar 2016, we will continue to amplify our fashion positioning while celebrating our 75th anniversary focusing on our distinctive brand proposition. No other American brand in our space can claim the unique combination of heritage and craftsmanship that is our DNA fused with the modern fashion sensibility of Stuart's vision. As a result of these efforts we are seeing continued progress with consumers. Importantly, in our quarterly North America brand tracking survey fielded in March we saw an increase in category drivers as a percentage of Coach consumers and strength in our overall brand affinities.", "So as our plans unfold and the momentum builds we are delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty retailer and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design defining modern luxury. We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction and will continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.", "Turning now, to a discussion of category trends. Overall, we estimate that the North America premium women's handbag and accessories market grew at a low single-digit rate in the March quarter. Our quarterly survey also showed a higher handbag purchase intent among the broad premium purchases versus six months ago. Importantly, Coach's sales of women's bags and accessories once again improved sequentially in North America. And of course, as a lifestyle and multi-brand company we also participate in categories outside of women's bags and accessories. Men's which represents about 17% of global net sales on an annual basis posted strong results in the quarter.", "We continue to believe it is a growth opportunity for the brand and is still forecasting mid-single-digit growth during FY \u201816. Over our planning horizon, we believe men's remains a $1 billion opportunity. In North America, we have tested and intensified men's focus in key stores which entailed increased marketing support and enhanced assortment in a more prominent location in-store.", "With a strong response from consumers we will be expanding our men's presence in the fourth quarter and specifically we will be rolling out men's to over 25 more retail and 40 more outlet doors. And of course, we also remain focused on building Coach, Inc. market share within the fragmented men's and women's $27 billion global premium footwear category which we estimate will grow at a mid-single-digit pace over our planning horizon.", "Looking ahead, we see significant growth opportunities for the Stuart Weitzman and Coach brands in this category. While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market starting with North America. As you read in our release for the quarter our total Coach brand sales and direct business in North America were up both 1% as reported in 2% in constant currency.", "In aggregate, we drove another significant improvement in our direct businesses in the third quarter. Comp trends in both retail and outlet stores accelerated while the Internet contributed to aggregate comp as well. Overall, our comp was flat lead as expected by retail including a slightly positive impact of our e-commerce business which contributed less than one percentage point. Higher ticket and higher conversion were offset by a decline in traffic which was hurt in part by the overall weak mall trends.", "As a reminder, we have now fully anniversaried the pullback in eOS and in preferred customer events which impacted both our coach.com and retail businesses. Therefore, going forward we would expect our online business to move at least in-line with our store trends. Now looking at results sequentially, as planned improvements in both conversion and traffic from the second quarter drove results with tickets still positive. While Easter contributor to our comp, this was offset by a shorter winter sale period which ended about 10 days earlier than last year. Importantly, our performance underscores our confidence in delivering positive North America comp by the fourth quarter.", "Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. The above $400 price bracket rose in penetration saw another positive comp on a sales and unit basis and reported about 40% of handbag sales up from about 30% last year. The increases showed continued progress of our elevation strategy driving our handbag AUR to over $300 in the quarter for the first time since FY '09. As planned we deemphasize the entry price point gifting assortment coming out of holiday and therefore saw a decline in the 300 and below handbag price segment.", "And after several years of decline in logo penetration and gains in leather our North America logo business has stabilized at less than 5% in retail and about 25% in our outlet channel similar to the prior year. We will continue to monitor consumer preferences and fine tune this balance as needed.", "Now on stores, as mentioned, we have been very pleased with the performance of our modern luxury stores particularly in the North America retail channel where comps remain positive with now 67 stores renovated including 15 added in the last nine months. As noted, we are especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we are driving in those stores that have now anniversaried there remodels. In the outlet channel as noted previously, our results have been more mixed and we have not seen the same level of inflection given the newer store base notably in men's standalones.", "To-date, we have completed 31 outlet renovations including 17 in FY \u201816 and opened a total of seven outlet stores in the new format three in FY \u201815 and four year-to-date. We remain on target to resonate about 60 North American stores this year. In terms of elevating our customer experience this quarter we made significant progress in leveraging our leather services to differentiate the Coach experience and to drive conversion while opening three new craftsmanship bars globally [indiscernible] and Sendai, Japan and King of Prussia in Philadelphia.", "Turning to event marketing. In FY \u201816 we've continued to evolve and optimize our events with the goal of further reducing the number of days on promotion and as previously mentioned, our plan included two closed or targeted events this fiscal year, the first of which was held in September and the second of which occurred in March consistent with prior years timing. We will also run two shorter duration open sales events over key traffic periods, Black Friday and Mother's Day. We've been encouraged by the behavior of new customers acquired during sales events who subsequently engage in full price purchasing at the same rate as new customers acquired during the non-promotional periods.", "Looking ahead to spring and summer, in retail we are excited about introducing our first ever pre fall collection rounded [ph] in handbags and ready to wear with new animations and sizes of the best-selling rogue and new novelty platforms and the iconic Coach Dinky and saddlebags. We will continue to implement our elevation in fashion strategy in all doors with additions to the popular swagger family in a rainbow of fun fashion colors and unique colorful exotics.", "Additionally, we had SKU adds in the Mercer Satchel and market [ph] tote coming in May. Men's trend strength continues into the fourth quarter driven by ongoing traction in leather goods ready-to-wear and footwear with enhanced store placement and marketing distortions. And in June, we will be celebrating our 75th anniversary with a special collaboration with another storied American brand to be announced later this spring.", "In outlet we are heading into Mother's Day which will feature elevated floral novelty via leather [indiscernible] details and print. Our gift offering is robust including boxed sets, color print in small bags and small leather goods and newness into jewelry. In May, we have launched a rainbow color story aligned with our retail stores featuring some of our strongest new styles that launched in the third quarter including the Sierra Satchel. Just in time for Memorial Day we will reintroduce our reversible toast which was the bestseller during the holiday season.", "In June, we tell an Americana story featuring an update to our best-selling [indiscernible] print in totes and small bags which are important key drivers for the summer season and we're also excited to roll out men's to all outlet locations anchored by leather backpacks, messenger bags and an assortment of wallets and belts.", "And now moving on to international, in greater China our third-quarter sales rose 2% in constant currency driven by double-digit growth and positive comps on a the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macau -- on the Mainland, excuse me. Hong Kong and Macau remained weak and continues to be impacted by a dramatic slowdown in inbound tourist traffic notably from the Mainland. At this juncture, with very limited visibility to an evolving macroeconomic environment and tourist spending flows we\u2019re updating our annual forecast to be in the area of $600 million to reflect continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau.", "Importantly, and despite near-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term as the drivers we have consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever. It's important to note that we see the Chinese consumers and increasing part of our total business. During the third quarter, our global business with the Chinese continued to grow. Declines in travel flows into North America and Europe notably France, along with continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau were more than offset by strong domestic spending and growth in Chinese tourist spend in other key travel destinations including Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia.", "To that end, sales in Japan were up 7% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a dollar basis reflecting the strong yen despite a decrease in square footage. Sales again benefited from increased PRC tourist flows and the positive response to our new modern luxury stores from Japanese consumers and tourists alike seemed most notably in conversion in these locations. We would expect some slowdown in the constant currency growth of our Japan business in the fourth quarter as we anniversary the dramatic increase in Chinese tourist last spring. In Europe our brand is continuing to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations, and comps. Our overarching focus continues to be building the brand awareness with both local domestic consumers as well as tourists.", "In the third quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace driven by both distribution and comparable store sales. As many brands have referenced, we did experience relative softness in France in the quarter due to weaker tourist traffic following the tragic terrorist attacks.", "Overall, and despite these headwinds we are maintaining our FY \u201816 sales outlook of about $125 million. Over our planning horizon our goal is to achieve over a $0.5 billion in sales at retail representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium men's and women's bag and accessory market. In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales growth was solid across the entire region and local currency but declined in dollars. Here to we are focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives.", "Finally, I would like to point out that we are seeing disparate results in our international wholesale businesses which while small are important to growing brand awareness. In the third quarter our overall sales at POS increased moderately driven by strong growth in those distributor operated locations focused on the domestic consumer while travel retail blowup [ph] was relatively weaker due to volatility of tourist spending flows globally. On a net sales basis revenue grew modestly in the quarter driven by shipment timing with the second quarter.", "In closing, we are encouraged with the momentum of our business across all of our regions and the return to growth for the company. Most importantly we are proud of the progress we have made along our transformation journey in the evolving perception of the Coach brand and Coach, Inc. as we move from the specialty retailer to a house of modern luxury brands.", "Now I'll turn it over to Jane for details of our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2016. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Victor, and good morning. Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details. Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.", "Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter which marks a return to growth for the company. With an inflection across the key metrics of sales, operating profit and earnings. These results clearly reflect the positive impact of our transformation strategy augmented by the Stuart Weitzman business. Consolidated net sales totaled 1.03 billion for the third fiscal, an increase of 11% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis total sales increased 13% for the period.", "Net sales for the Coach brand rose 3% in dollars and 4% on a constant currency basis with both the North America and international segment up on a year-over-year basis. Stuart Weitzman brand sales were 79 million in the quarter, total gross profit was 713 million, an increase of 7% compared to the year ago period while gross margin was 69% versus 71.6% last year negatively impacted by foreign currency and the inclusion of Stuart Weitzman in this year's margin.", "Coach brand gross margin was 69.9% and included approximately 110 basis points of pressure from currency. In terms of trends by segment, North America gross margin declined on a year-over-year basis but to a lesser extent than in the first half of the year as planned. Margin continued to be negatively impacted by increased promotions in the outlet and wholesale channels in response to heightened discounting activity. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of an improved mix of elevated product sales and higher initial markups primarily in our outlet stores. International segment gross margin increased from prior year excluding the negative impact of foreign currency.", "Stuart Weitzman brand gross margin was 58.2% in the first quarter and pressured overall consolidated gross margin by 90 basis points as expected. Consolidated SG&A expenses were 561 million, an increase of 8% versus prior year. As the percentage of net sales SG&A totaled 54.3% compared to 55.8% in the year ago quarter. Coach brand SG&A expenses increased 1% consistent with expectations and totaled 54.8% as a percentage of sales.", "Stuart Weitzman SG&A expenses were 39 million or 48.9% of sales. Total operating income for the quarter increased 4% from last year to a 152 million while operating margin was 14.7% versus 15.8%.", "Operating margin for the Coach brand was 15.1% in the quarter, importantly we were pleased with our margin results in Q3 and are confident in our path to operating margin expansion beginning in the fourth quarter of FY \u201816. Operating margin for the Stuart Weitzman brand was 9.3% and pressured Coach, Inc. consolidated operating margin by 40 basis points in the quarter. Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter as compared to 1 million in the year ago period.", "Net income for the quarter totaled a 124 million with earnings per diluted share $0.44, up 24% and 23% versus prior year respectively. This included a contribution of $5 million or $0.02 per share from Stuart Weitzman. The charges under our previously announced transformation plan have totaled 313 million to-date including 9 million in the third quarter as outlined in detail in this morning's press release.", "We continue to expect to incur the balance of these charges by the end of FY \u201816 primarily related to global store closures and organizational effectiveness bringing the total multiyear charge to about 325 million.", "Now moving to global distribution, as you know, our overarching focus continues to be re-platforming our stores, elevating brand perception, optimizing our store fleet and opening new locations selectively in key markets. In total, we closed nine net Coach brand locations globally primarily related to store closures in North America as planned. In addition, we opened one Stuart Weitzman directly operated location in the quarter.", "Looking to the full-year, in FY \u201816 we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance continues to assume that Coach brand square footage in North America will be essentially unchanged. Internationally, distribution growth will be led by Europe and China where we continue to project double-digit increases in square footage.", "In Japan, we continue to estimate a mid-single-digit decline in square footage as we take a portfolio approach to optimizing our fleet. And in our directly operated businesses in Asia outside of China and Japan we continue to focus on developing our current store base and expect only modest square footage growth this fiscal year. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution we continue to expect to open approximately 10 new directly operated locations in FY \u201816.", "Moving to the balance sheet, inventory levels at quarter end were $464 million including 27 million of inventory associated with Stuart Weitzman. This compared to ending inventory of 457 million for the Coach brand in the year ago period. Therefore, inventory rose 2% on a Coach, Inc. consolidated basis but was down 4% for the Coach brand. Cash and short-term investments stood at 1.3 billion as compared to 2.0 billion a year ago. Given our debt issuance in the third quarter FY \u201815 and the subsequent closure of the Stuart Weitzman acquisition, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately 900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter.", "As previously shared, we expect to use these proceeds to cover our working capital needs in light of investments in our business and the new corporate headquarters. Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was 199 million compared to 167 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $98 million versus 122 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $101 million versus 45 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Now turning to our outlook, as noted in our press release, we are maintaining our overall FY \u201816 guidance for both the Coach and Stuart Weitzman brands. Starting with our outlook for the Coach brand on a standalone 52-week non-GAAP basis for FY \u201816. Coach brand sales are still expected to increase at a low single-digit rate in constant currency in fiscal year 2016. Based on current exchange rates currency headwinds are expected to negatively impact annual revenue growth by 225 to 250 basis points.", "We are still projecting a low single-digit aggregate comp decline in North America in FY \u201816 while reaching positive comps in the fourth quarter. Gross margin for the Coach brand is still projected to be in the range of last year's margin of about 69.5% on a constant currency basis with negative foreign currency effects expected to impact gross margin by 90 to a 100 basis points.", "SG&A expenses net of savings are still expected to grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency while growth is expected to be roughly flat in dollars. We continue to expect at least 50 million in incremental cost savings from our previously announced transformation initiatives. This guidance also includes the expected small positive impact from savings related to the operational efficiency initiatives as outlined in today's press release.", "Taken together, operating margin is still projected to be in the mid to high teens. Interest expense for the year is estimated to be in the area of 30 million and finally our tax rate is still expected to be in the area of 28% for the year. The expected rate reduction on a year-over-year basis is primarily attributable to the geographical mix of earnings, the ongoing benefit of available foreign tax credits, the anticipated closure of certain audits and the expiration of statutes in 2016.", "In addition, we are continuing to forecast Stuart Weitzman brand sales to be in the area of 340 million on a dollar basis for fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% from FY \u201815 driving Coach, Inc. consolidated revenue growth to high single digits on a constant currency basis and adding about $0.12 to earnings per diluted share excluding charges associated with financing, short-term purchase accounting adjustments, contingent payments and integration costs.", "Keep in mind, we continue to project a negative impact of about 70 basis points and 20 basis points on a consolidated gross margin and operating margin respectively from the inclusion of Stuart Weitzman given the margin profile of the business. As mentioned, we are also excited to announce the purchase of Stuart Weitzman's Canadian distributor which is expected to close in Q4 and have an immaterial impact on this year's results.", "As a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include a 53rd week in our fiscal fourth quarter which is expected to contribute approximately 75 million to 80 million incremental revenue and $0.06 in earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis.", "We expect CapEx for FY \u201816 for Coach, Inc, to be the area of $250 million excluding the capital cost associated with the new headquarters which are expected to be approximately 175 million in FY \u201816.", "Before concluding, I did want to provide you with an update on the status of our investment and our new headquarters building at Hudson Yard. As you know, together with our partner related companies we are exploring options to sell our interest in the Hudson Yard's joint venture while securing our future need for space by entering into a long-term lease there.", "It remains unlikely that any sale of our interest or other transaction would close prior to our fiscal year end. Importantly, our capital allocation policy remains unchanged and over the next few years our first priority is to continue to invest in our business as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation and we are putting our capital against this opportunity.", "Our second priority, strategic acquisitions is also about growth, while we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders.", "And third, capital returns. As I\u2019ve stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividends to grow at least in-line with net income growth as our transformation takes hold. Underpinning all three of these priorities, our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic sensibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our progress to-date. Our third-quarter results mark the return to topline operating profit and earnings growth and underscore our ability to drive sustainable growth for the Coach brand and Coach, Inc. To this end, we continue to expect FY \u201817 to be the year when Coach brand returns to growth across all financial metrics leveraging topline growth that is expected to be in-line with the category.", "We remain committed to driving process improvements to be a more agile, focused and effective organization while also creating the flexibility to pursue our creative vision and drive growth across our brand. In support of this goal and as Victor mentioned, today we announced a series of operational efficiency initiatives focused on creating an agile and scalable business model. In aggregate, we expect to incur pretax charges associated with these actions of approximately $65 million to $80 million which will be reflected beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. It will be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2017. The significant majority of these charges will be recorded in SG&A expenses.", "Importantly, combined with other key measures previously implemented under our transformation plan, these initiatives are expected to enable us to reach our previously stated goal of about a 20% operating margin for the Coach brand in fiscal year 2017 despite increased category and macroeconomic uncertainty and while continuing to invest in our growth strategies.", "With that, I would now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul. Sir, you may ask your question.", "Bob Drbul", "I\u2019ve a two-part question on sales really. Given that you mentioned January was impacted by the shorter winter sale and your accomplish [indiscernible] for the quarter, wouldn\u2019t that suggest that you are already running a positive comp for the last two months February and March? And the second part of it is, taking it one step further when you think about your guidance for the positive North American comp in the fourth quarter, would that suggest you\u2019re running a positive comp right now as well?", "Victor Luis", "Thanks for the question, Bob, it's certainly hard to argue with the math and I think that you can certainly safely assume that we did indeed have positive comps in February and March as you suggest.", "In terms of the fourth quarter, look we still have a couple of months ahead of us but certainly is a team we remain confident in our guidance of positive North America comps for the quarter?", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. ", "Ike Boruchow", "So I guess Bob took sales I'll take margin. So I just wanted to dig into the fiscal '17 margin comment about 20% for the Coach brand so that's pretty impressive step up from what looks like will be something around 17% to 18% this year. Can you just kind of walk us through the drivers there? Maybe bucket the biggest opportunities as you see it and conversely what you think are the biggest headwinds you face on the margin front as you get into next fiscal year?", "Jane Nielsen", "Sure, you know, as we've stated our operating margin guidance for fiscal FY \u201817 is really premised on the return to growth in-line with the category of the Coach brand. We now expect the category to be in the low to mid-single-digit range, a very stable growth margin on a constant currency basis of 69% to 70%. So stable gross margin, top line growth and then we will leverage SG&A to get to the operating margin expansion that leverage SG&A fully incorporates what we called out in our original transformation plan which was the restructuring actions that we will conclude with this fiscal year and a small benefit from the operational efficiency initiatives that we announced today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open. ", "David Schick", "So I'll go back to sales on a longer-term basis. You talked about e-commerce impacting the comp positively and also you talked about the net effects of the Chinese consumer in different markets.", "Could you talk about how to think about e-commerce impacting your, over the long-term you know going forward and again, sort of on a net basis what's the right way to think about the longer-term trend in the Chinese tourist impacting all these different markets?", "Victor Luis", "Sure, in terms of e-comp we have now of course anniversaried all of this eOS pullback so we would expect it to grow at least in-line with what is happening in our store network. Of course look, the consumers are continuing to shift online so I will not be surprised if it is growing at a slightly faster pace than the store network from here on out now that we have comped all of the pullback.", "In terms of the Chinese consumer and the excitement, look, first and foremost, the long-term opportunity with the Chinese consumers is as present as ever. I could not be more excited about what we're seeing in terms of even government policies still focused on domestic consumption, the infrastructure continued to develop in the mainland which is obviously helping domestic consumption as well, as well as the continued traction that our team is driving for the brand there and it's absolutely vital of course because relevance on the Mainland will mean relevance wherever the Chinese consumer chooses to shop as they travel globally.", "Today what we are seeing most recently as I mentioned earlier is of course the impact of the terrorist attacks in France and specifically in Paris having a direct negative impact on Chinese tourists flows there, we\u2019re seeing slightly negative flows here into the U.S. as well of course as continued negative flows into Hong Kong and Macau. That is one area where we thought in the fourth quarter we would have seen ourselves comping the fall from last year and we have not.", "But that's more than being offset by the very strong growth that we have continued to see in Japan, Korea and increasingly in Southeast Asia and although many of those markets are distributor run, we\u2019re very excited by what we\u2019re seeing in Thailand and in Australia as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Erinn Murphy", "I wanted to focus on the outlets actually. I realized that they are lagging the full price in part on plan but maybe speak a little bit more about some of the initiatives you're working on to close the gap in performance between full pricing whether you can expound upon the upcoming [indiscernible] that you have in this channel and any tweaks that you're making now to the remodel strategies you\u2019ve gone deeper into that? Thank you.", "Andre Cohen ", "Well first let me start by saying both channels actually improved on a similar rate sequentially so we are pleased with the performance both in retail and in outlet. We had always said that retail was going to lead so the retail performance in absolute terms is slightly ahead of outlets. Basically a couple of main areas we've been working on in outlets specifically one is design and innovation. We've realized through the vignette I think Victor mentioned in his prepared remarks on snoopy that when you have got real innovation and emotion it trumps price. It was successful and it's something that we are planning to replicate over the next few quarters both in terms of these one-off sort of we call them play concepts and more generally in terms of putting more design and innovation in the outlet channel.", "In terms of the modern luxury renovations, they have not been as successful as in retail. We've not moved the needle that much, that said we have got a number of learnings that we are currently addressing. We have used our Woodburry common store as a pilot where we have done things such as moving more product to the floor. We\u2019ve realized that when there is too much product on the wall, not enough on the floor it effects impedes conversion. We've fragmented the store a bit too much so you don't get a sort of 360 view when you enter the store etcetera. So loads of small operational improvements. The positive news is that in Woodburry when we started these tweaks about two or three months ago we have seen an improvement in the control of the metrics conversion in ADT, so good learnings and we're going to keep implementing them throughout the chain.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Randy Konik of Jefferies. Your line is now open. ", "Randy Konik", "I guess just back on the outlets. You\u2019ve done a great job on the full price channel getting rid of those promotions and moving to a more full price higher average ticket business. You talked a little bit about, just a little bit about the increased promotions and outlet wholesale. Can you give us some perspective on what inning we are in their where you can potentially maybe walk a little away from those promotions? And just a little more flavor there will be very helpful. Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "I will let Andre start with outlets and then I'll take the wholesale channel.", "Andre Cohen", "Sure, so we have certainly seen the environment become more competitive in outlet generally over the past couple of quarters. Traffic has continued to drop and competitive intensity has increased. So we have been pragmatic in dealing with that. We have been promotional where we had to be, we have pulled up where we could.", "Going forward again the plan is to innovate more to just have a high content of newness, innovation and more emotional play concepts to offset the price pressures we have seen over the last couple of quarters.", "Victor Luis", "In terms of the wholesale channel, look, I think all of you who traveled to the department store world where we are present in North America obviously very aware of the environment. You may also follow a lot of the brand trackers that are out there in terms of sales to understand what is happening with promotions and AUR in that channel and I would say that we are in the very early inning there of our transformation. As many of you know, we've invested now and I just mentioned in my prepared remarks in 12 locations in the new concept, that's out of a thousand that we have across North America. We are investing in the shop manager program for the Top 50 locations by the end of this fiscal year and in both of those cases we are seeing a inflection versus the rest of the fleet.", "In addition of course, we have made very significant progress in our penetration with the Tier 1 department stores with 1941 while also pulling back on those Coach specific promotional days. Irrespective of all of that, the absolute number of chain wide sale days continues to be an issue in that channel and we continue as a team to have discussions with our partners about a couple of areas.", "One, first and foremost is the potential for the pull back on all our promotions which would include our exclusion and cooperation with our partners from the bulk of storewide event and quite frankly we are also looking at potentially exiting lower volume doors going forward. So these are considerations we are taking right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen of Cowen & Co. Your line is now open. ", "Oliver Chen", "Regarding inventories, our question is regarding inventories and what are the thoughts regarding the next few quarters in holiday in terms of the context of the handbag sector and the promotional environment? And also in context of how you are thinking about how you will bucket prices with the 300 below versus the above 400 mix? Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "I'll let Andre start with first and foremost the bucketing strategy and dealing with seasonality in that area and then Jane will take total inventories.", "Andre Cohen", "Yes, so as you know for Q2 our holiday quarter we had beefed up our gifting assortment to be able to just offer a wide range of prices and that strategy worked well. Coming out of Q2, we focused on our elevation strategy with 1941 launching across the bulk of the chain. We have seen a significant improvement in our $400 and above price point. It's now 40% of the business.", "Overall our AUR handbags have actually record high of $300, that\u2019s the highest we have been in handbags since fiscal '09. So the elevation strategy is working. Obviously as we get into the more holiday periods we will flex with again with a wider gifting assortment at a wide range of price points.", "Jane Nielsen", "Oliver, if you look at inventory, as it's been our case, we always look to match inventory roughly in-line with our sales growth outlet. So I think you'll start to see inventories and very modest growth in the fourth quarter and moving into FY \u201817 is very much in line with our sales outlook and expectations.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti of UBS. Your line is now open. ", "Michael Binetti", "I know there been a few questions on the outlets. If I could just -- I guess I was just thinking a little bit more broadly about North America brand sales. As we think about your guidance next year Jane for low to mid-single digits North America comp growth roughly in line with category, I guess by channel you sound clearly more comfortable with the sustainability of what you are seeing in full price.", "Do the outlets in your mind need to be positive to deliver that kind of low to mid -singles on a sustainable basis for the blended comp? And if so maybe just a few comments on what you're seeing that gives you confidence that the outlet channel contributes you know at the positive level in the next year.", "Jane Nielsen", "So I just want to clarify that our guidance just to be specific is for North America would be our growth and globally in line with the category which we now see to be low to mid-single digits as is our custom will come back with more specific guidance in Q4, but what we've seen is a sequential improvement in both channels they improved this quarter similarly and we would expect to see continued improvement as we move into FY \u201817.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. ", "Anna Andreeva", "We are hoping to talk about the initial CapEx expectations in '17. As the headquarter investment rolls off, how should we think about the free cash flow generation in the business and as we think about priorities for cash could we I guess expect a dividend increase as net income is inflicting now? And just quickly follow up on what sounds like positive quarter to-date comp are you seeing improvement in the outlet channel as well? Thanks so much.", "Jane Nielsen", "So why don\u2019t I take the cash flow and dividend and then I will turn it over to Andre on the outlet channel. So as our net income growth and we complete the buildout of our headquarter building you will see a corresponding cash flow growth as we move into FY \u201817 as expected. Our dividends is really a part of our priorities for cash and our priorities for cash are really unchanged.", "First and foremost, investing in the organic growth of our business. Second priority being M&A value creating acquisitions. As I said, nothing eminent but we want to remain open and flexible should we find something that we believe will create long-term value for Coach, Inc. in our shareholders and then finally is the return of capital to shareholders with our commitment to the dividend. We look at our dividend annually with our Board in August as we talked about in April 2014. We will look at the dividend in August that coincides with our year-end results and outlook for the following year and make a determination at that time.", "Andre Cohen", "In terms of just the fourth quarter, we\u2019re left unplanned with -- we're still working towards a positive comp for the quarter. We've seen all the indicators that we saw at the end of the third quarter, still maintaining the momentum and we\u2019re on plan, I'm not sure what -- all I can say at this point.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you. That will conclude our Q&A as we are now past 9:30 and the market has opened. I will now turn it over to Victor for some concluding remarks. Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Thank you Andrea. Let me just thank everybody for joining us. A very important quarter for us this past third quarter as it marks a return to growth for the Coach brand. I could not be more excited with the momentum in our business and as a team, we are obviously very proud of the evolving perception not only of the Coach brand but up Coach, Inc. and our impact in the marketplace.", "The positive impact of our brand transformation augmented by of course Stuart Weitzman is clearly reflected in the overall financial performance with terrific inflection across all of our key metrics with sales, profit and earnings growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of '13.", "The turnaround of course that we've achieved to-date underscores our confidence in driving sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc. over the long term and I could not be prouder of our entire team for the work and commitment that they have put in to driving our brand and the passion that they are showing to win in the marketplace.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Andrea Shaw Resnick.", "Andrea Resnick", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly and annual results are Victor Luis, Coach's Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Coach's CFO.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters of fiscal years.", "These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations, based upon a number of important factors including risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, control costs, successfully execute our transformation and operational efficiency initiatives and growth strategies or our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from the Stuart Weitzman acquisition.", "Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a complete list of risks and important factors. Please note that historical trends may not be indicative of future performance.", "Also, certain financial information and metrics that will be discussed today will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items related to our transformation plan, operational efficiency plan and Stuart Weitzman acquisition-related charges as well as the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, where noted.", "The company's sales and earnings per diluted share results have also been presented both including and excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. You may identify non-GAAP measures by the terms non-GAAP, constant currency, excluding the impact of foreign currency or excluding the additional week.", "The company believes that presenting these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors and others in evaluating the company's ongoing operations and financial results against historical performance and in a manner that is consistent with the management's evaluation of the business. You may find the corresponding GAAP financial information or metric as well as the related reconciliation on our website, www.coach.com/investors, and then viewing the earnings release posted today.", "Now, let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our fourth fiscal quarter and full year 2016 results and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives across markets. Jane Nielsen will continue with details on financial and operational results and our outlook for FY 2017.", "Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session, where we will be joined by Andre Cohen, President, North America and Global marketing; and Todd Kahn, President and Chief Administrative Officer. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. We will then conclude with some brief summary remarks.", "I'd now like to introduce Victor Luis, Coach's CEO.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning. Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press [Audio gap]", "Good morning, everyone. Sorry for the technical difficulties we had there on the line. We will start with my remarks and then proceed to Jane. And we will extend time at the end for Q&A. Again, apologies for the technical difficulties; I think we're up and running here again.", "Let me just first thank you, Andrea, again, and welcome, everyone, to our call. As noted in our press release, we are delighted with our strong fourth quarter performance, in which we achieved positive North America comps, for the first time in over three years, and drove increases across key financial metrics. These results capped a year where we returned the Coach brand to growth, while elevating brand perception globally, thereby reaching an important milestone in the transformation journey we laid out over two years ago.", "Indeed, I could not be more pleased with and proud of our team's execution of the transformation plan over the last two years, as we track to our goals in spite of the significant and unanticipated volatility in tourist spending flows as well as the range of macroeconomic, geopolitical and promotional headwinds.", "In the quarter, our North American direct businesses accelerated, while we continued to implement strategic actions to elevate our positioning and streamline our distribution in the very promotional department store channel. Our international businesses continued to generate growth, highlighted by double-digit increases in Mainland China and Europe, as well as sales gains in our directly operated businesses in Southeast Asia. Most importantly, we achieved the expected inflection and profitability, as we leveraged our expenses in the growth in our business. Overall, our results give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will continue to drive top and bottom line growth as we enter the new fiscal year.", "Looking ahead for fiscal 2017, our strategic priorities for the Coach brand include reenergizing our brand and category by continuing to innovate and establish our unique modern luxury positioning. We will continue the brand's elevation through a fuller expression of Coach 1941 in stores and online while driving our Men's business even further across all channels.", "In addition, we will focus on raising brand awareness and relevance globally through the rollout of flagships in key fashion capitals, while continuing to renovate our existing store base. And in marketing, we will continue to differentiate Coach through a combination of fashion and heritage, distorting investments to key regions and ensuring the message is relevant and increasingly aspirational for the broader market. This will include the relaunch of Coach fragrance with our partner, Interparfums, starting this fall.", "And for Stuart Weitzman, we will: drive our leadership position in fashion boots during the key winter selling season; continue to diversify our offering outside of boots, by developing iconic styles in pumps, sandals and flats; drive global awareness and brand relevance through impactful marketing in the launch of New York and London flagships; and leverage our new leadership to bring the Stuart Weitzman brand into its next chapter of growth as a multi-category player.", "Now, moving to our results, during the fourth quarter, as in the preceding quarters of fiscal year 2016, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Most generally, we elevated our retail offering globally with the Coach 1941 assortment resonating in our retail stores and top-tier specialty stores, highlighted by iconic silhouettes such as the Saddle Bag and Dinky and new icons such as the Rogue.", "Also in retail, our Mickey collaboration, launched worldwide in June, was particularly well received, driving significant brand interest and buzz. We continue to transition the fleet into our modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement.", "Finally, our Heritage marketing campaign, focused on originality and authenticity, highlighted Coach's key competitive differences, separating us from the landscape of both legacy European luxury and American accessible brands.", "We are also pleased by Stuart Weitzman's performance this quarter, which drove annual results for the brand exceeding our original estimates. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of the brand's Canadian distributor, including 14 retail stores which transitioned to direct. We also announced the appointment of Wendy Kahn as Brand President and CEO, who will join Stuart Weitzman from Valentino next month, succeeding Wayne Kulkin who will remain as a consultant supporting our corporate strategic agenda in Footwear.", "And just today, Stuart Weitzman announced that Giovanni Morelli, currently Leather Goods Design Director of Men's and Women's Non-Apparel categories for LOEWE, will be joining the brand next May, succeeding Founder and Executive Chairman, Stuart Weitzman, who will become Chairman at that time.", "Giovanni will be reporting to Wendy and brings to the brand a wealth of experience in accessories and footwear design, having worked extensively at Marc Jacobs, Chlo\u00e9 and now LOEWE. Giovanni's unique attention to detail, craft and quality with his global modern sensibility will drive the Stuart Weitzman brand leadership in footwear design, while bringing his rich and varied experience in leather luxury goods to the brand's language.", "Now, as has been our recent practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to build momentum across the three key brand pillars of product, stores and marketing; starting with product, where Coach is clearly emerging as a house of modern fashion design.", "During the fourth quarter, as in the first nine months of the year, virtually all of our retail channel assortment, both men's and women's, were Stuart Vevers' designs. It was the second quarter that included Coach 1941 and emphasized our elevation strategy. Overall, Women's in retail was driven by leather goods and growth in 1941 silhouettes. In our fashion families, the Swagger comped the comp growing in both sales and productivity, and Mercer also contributed to results.", "We are now focused on two product lines for global retail: Coach New York, our broadest assortment, which includes Essentials and our fashion families; and Coach 1941, our collection runway line, which includes our most elevated handbags as well as Ready-To-Wear, Footwear and other categories. Given success of the collection and consumers' embrace of higher price points, we expect to significantly expand it across our directly operated store network. And by holiday, all of our retail stores will offer a range of 1941 handbags.", "The key retail strategies we are implementing include: the continued elevation of the assortment with the further rebalancing between Essentials, fashion families and 1941; and a move from 12 to eight deliveries in our retail channel, first, to better align with the fashion calendar, notably with higher-end specialty retail, and also to drive improved productivity in each delivery. This will allow our families to work harder for us for longer.", "We are also excited to launch our women's fragrance line with Interparfums in the coming weeks and months across Coach retail stores as well as in major department stores, specialty stores and duty-free shops worldwide. The launch will be supported by an extensive integrated marketing and communications campaign, including television spots in September featuring Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz.", "In outlet, Q4 marked the introduction of a new Stuart designed silhouette in two sizes: the Harley, which is performing very well. In addition, Stuart introduced an expanded breadth of novelty prints and styles, like the reversible tote and MINI Bennett. These prints clearly signaled summer and delivered strong story-telling in our stores.", "Also in the fourth quarter, the consumer response to the men's product expansion to all outlet centers was exceptional. While backpacks continued to be a top performer, we were especially pleased by the performance of men's novelty prints, which underscored that our men's customer is willing to invest in fashion pieces as well as modern classics.", "Looking ahead in outlet, you will also note a product and pricing architecture similar to retail: starting with our value product, such as the reversible tote; essentials, such as Phoebe; and fashion, including collaborations and sophisticated handbags such as Blake. Pinnacle product also continues to be very important, as our most elevated offering with the highest amounts of novelty. In FY 2017, you will see some standalone disruptive outlet collaborations unique to this channel, such as PAC-MAN this fall. Finally, men's is going to be a major focus in outlet, and we expect it to be over 20% of the business by the end of the fiscal year.", "On stores, we're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening approximately 165 during the quarter, including 45 renovations and one new modern luxury store in our directly operated North America business. In total, we renovated and opened about 300 modern luxury locations worldwide in FY 2016, taking us to just over 450 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our target to end the year with over 400 doors in the new format. Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends, and comps which exceed the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world.", "We're especially excited about the ongoing positive comps we're driving in our renovated North America retail stores, including those stores that have now anniversaried their remodels. Of course, transforming our stores is more than just the physical design. It's the experience our store teams provide each and every single day. I am so proud that our mystery shopper scores, our key metrics that demonstrate how well we deliver our unique modern luxury experience, surpassed 80% this quarter. In addition, it's great to see how customers are responding to our new leather services, such as monogramming and leather conditioning, with new services to be introduced throughout 2017.", "In North American department stores, we renovated over 35 shop-in-shop locations to modern luxury in the fourth quarter. Finally, we have about 40 shop managers in place today and have seen a significant impact versus balance of doors.", "Separately and as noted in our release, one of our key strategic initiatives in the year ahead will be elevating the Coach brand in the North America wholesale channel. As discussed previously, through 1941, we have already started adding new locations in top-tier specialty in North America and globally. In FY 2017, we will also be rationalizing our department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25%, or by over 250 locations, as well as reducing markdown allowances to the channel, given the high level of promotions.", "While we understand that consumers may use department stores for trial and shopping across brands, the high level of promotional impressions created negatively impact our long-term brand health, while generating confusion across channels.", "As we look towards FY 2017, the last year of our heavy-lifting phase, we will focus on renovating the balance of our targeted store base. By year-end, modern luxury doors will, in aggregate, represent the vast majority of our traffic.", "I should also note that we are very excited about our global flagship focus in FY 2017, stores which we view very much as key retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach House on Fifth Avenue and our Regent Street flagship, both opening in time for holiday. We are also excited to announce our first flagship in Italy, opening in Milan by the end of the calendar year on the prestigious Via Montenapoleone.", "On the marketing front, in the fourth quarter, Mickey was the big news, with a range of impactful and creative executions globally, generating over 950 million impressions. The launch created substantial buzz, with both the most fashion-engaged fans and Coach lapsed customers with our messaging of cool fashion and quality glove-tanned leather.", "More generally, during the quarter, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion positioning and our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality.", "In FY 2017, we want to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for her with a singular message that cuts through. Coach's unique modern luxury proposition focusing on leathercraft and Stuart's vision of Coach New York cool, familiar Americana interpreted with a twist from New York's original house of leather design.", "We will leverage the opening of Coach House on Fifth Avenue as a global anchoring moment and will amplify regionally via openings on Regent Street in London, Via Montenapoleone in Milan and China World in Beijing.", "As a result of these efforts across all customer touch points, we're seeing continued progress with customers. Importantly, in our North America brand tracking survey fielded in June, we saw strength in our overall brand affinities, while the percentage of customers who viewed Coach as ubiquitous declined versus a year ago.", "So as our plans unfold and the momentum builds, we're delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty retailer and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury. We're excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction, and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.", "Turning now to a discussion on category trends, as we look ahead to FY 2017, there is no doubt that the challenges that existing today affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general, will persist. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain. Currency crosswinds are affecting tourist flows, and the recent geopolitical events and tragic terrorist attacks are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, visibility into category growth is limited, as the landscape continues to rapidly shift.", "This volatility was evident throughout FY 2016 and notably in the most recent quarter, as you've seen in some of the varied results already reported by several brands in our space. Overall, we estimate that the North American premium women's handbag and accessory market grew at a low single-digit in the June quarter, resulting in slight growth for the year. And while men's growth was somewhat faster, given its relatively small penetration to the total, the premium men's and women's handbag and accessories category also grew at a low single-digit rate for the year. Coach's share of the combined market was 16% in FY 2016.", "While Jane will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. Starting with North America, as you read in our release, for the quarter, our total Coach brand sales rose 9% and our direct business 10% on a dollar basis and 11% in constant currency. Excluding the additional week, total North America sales rose 1%, reflecting the pullback in wholesale shipments, while direct sales rose 2%, driven by the 2% increase in comparable store sales on a 13-week versus 13-week basis.", "Comp trends in both retail and outlet stores accelerated, while the Internet contributed approximately one percentage point to aggregate comp this quarter. Overall, our aggregate comp was up 2%, led, as expected, by retail, while outlet comp was essentially flat.", "Higher ticket drove overall comp, while very slight changes in traffic and conversion netted to a flat overall number of transactions. We are especially pleased by the results we are seeing on coach.com, with our fashion launches and unique collaborations, such as Mickey, pointing to increased engagement with the most fashion-engaged online customers.", "Most importantly, the fourth quarter marked a return to positive North America comp for the first time since the third quarter of 2013, and the seventh sequential improvement since our transformation began two years ago, representing a 26% comp swing since the first quarter of FY 2015.", "Now, turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product, the above $400 price bracket rose in penetration, saw another positive comp on a sales and unit basis and represented about 40% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year. As planned, and as discussed back in April, we de-emphasized the entry price gifting assortment since coming out of holiday, and therefore saw a decline in the $300 and below handbag price segment.", "Turning to event marketing, in FY 2016, we continue to evolve and optimize our events with the goal of further reducing the number of days on promotion. Exiting this year, we are comfortable with the cadence and type of events we're hosting, and don't expect a significant change in the year ahead. Naturally, there may be some tweaks to the dates, type, or duration, but the overall days should be fairly stable, with our first preferred customer event for September anniversarying the prior year.", "And now, moving on to international, in the fourth quarter, international Coach brand sales rose 15% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis. For the year, Coach brand's international sales increased 5% in dollars and 9% in constant currency. As noted in our release, the additional week of sales in FY 2016 added approximately $32 million to overall International segment sales. Therefore, excluding the additional week, fourth quarter sales rose 6% in dollars and 5% in constant currency, while full year sales increased 3% in dollars and 7% in constant currency.", "Turning to details by geography - and please note the comments I'll make will be on a 13-week and 52-week basis. Greater China sales increased 5% in dollars in the quarter, with double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales on the Mainland offset, in part, by continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 10%. For the year, sales increased 2% in dollars and 5% in constant currency to approximately $605 million, slightly ahead of our most recent guidance of approximately $600 million, despite a further devaluation in the renminbi since our last earnings call.", "Notably, our constant currency sales growth for the year was consistent with our original expectations provided last August, despite the evolving macroeconomic environment and tourist spending flows, as well as sustained softness in Hong Kong and Macau. Importantly, and despite near-term volatility, we remain optimistic on the prospects for this market over the long term, as the drivers we've consistently mentioned are more relevant than ever and as our China team continues to do an excellent job of building our brand equity in that market.", "It's important to note that we still see the Chinese consumer as an increasing part of our total business. During the fourth quarter, our global business with the Chinese continued to grow. In addition to strong domestic spending, we experienced growth in other key destinations, including Southeast Asia. This growth was partially offset by declines in travel flows into North America and Europe, notably France, along with continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau.", "In addition, and as expected, we also saw a decline in Chinese tourist flows into Japan, impacted by currency fluctuations and the anniversary of the dramatic increase in Chinese tourists last spring. To that end, in the fourth quarter, Japan sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis but rose 7% on a dollar basis, reflecting the stronger yen. For the year, sales rose 2% in constant currency and were essentially even with the prior year in dollars, benefiting overall from an increase in PRC tourist flows on an annual basis and a positive response to our new modern luxury positioning from Japanese consumers and tourists alike.", "In Europe, our brand continues to grow rapidly through new directly operated stores, wholesale locations and comps. Our overarching focus is to build brand awareness with both domestic consumers as well as tourists. In the fourth quarter, our business grew at a double-digit pace, driven by both distribution and comparable store sales. We experienced relative softness in France in the quarter, impacted by weak tourist traffic, as mentioned.", "Overall, and despite these headwinds, our sales rose 50% to $135 million in fiscal 2016 and exceeded our guidance of $125 million. Over our planning horizon, our goal is to achieve over $0.5 billion in sales at retail, representing a mid-single-digit share of the premium women's and men's bag and accessories market.", "In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales growth in the fourth quarter was solid across the entire region in local currency and rose at a low single-digit rate in dollars. For the year, sales increased high single digits in constant currency, but declined slightly in dollars. Here, too, we remain focused on driving productivity through our transformation initiatives.", "Finally, I would point out that we're seeing disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which, while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased modestly, driven by strong growth in those distributor-operated locations focused on the domestic consumer, while travel retail was relatively weak due to the volatility of tourist spending flows globally.", "On a net sales basis, revenue was down in the quarter due to shipment timing. For the year, both POS and net sales declined slightly, as softness in travel retail offset growth in distributor-run locations targeting domestic customers.", "In closing, we are encouraged with the momentum of our business and proud of the progress we've made along our transformation journey, elevating the perception of the Coach brand and Coach, Inc. as we've earned increasing acceptance as a house of modern luxury brands.", "Before handing over to Jane for details of our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2017, I would like to touch on our CFO transition. First, as you know, we announced Jane Nielsen's departure in June, which will become effective later this month following the filing of our 10-K. This will be Jane's last earnings call with Coach.", "Jane has played an important role as a terrific partner to me and the Coach executive team as we have executed our brand transformation. I speak for the entire team in thanking her and in wishing her every success in her future. At the same time, I could not be prouder of the bench that we have across Finance and especially the leadership role that Andrea Shaw Resnick will play as our Interim CFO until we appoint a permanent successor. You all know Andrea well. She's been an important partner to me and our business in crafting and the communication of our strategies and we'll ensure we don't miss a beat in their execution.", "I would now like to pass on to Jane. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Thank you, Victor, for those kind words and for the privilege of working at this outstanding company. Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details. Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results, as well as the related reconciliation, can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.", "We are extremely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, as we drove increases across the key metrics of sales, operating profit and earnings. We achieved positive comps in North America while continuing to grow our business internationally, and we leveraged this growth with significant improvement in our operating margin for the quarter.", "The strong fourth quarter capped a year of important financial milestones. In fiscal 2016, we generated overall top line growth for Coach, Inc., while tightly controlling our inventory. We drove a sequential improvement in our North America comps throughout the year, while achieving our revenue targets for Europe and Greater China against a volatile macro backdrop.", "We continued to invest in our brands, while delivering our margin target for FY 2016, ending the year with an operating margin of over 17%, in line with guidance of high-teens, including a Coach brand gross margin slightly above prior year, excluding the impact of currency. In addition, we successfully integrated the Stuart Weitzman business, which outperformed our original revenue and earnings per share projections for the year.", "Turning now to the details, before I begin, please note that the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in fiscal 2015 included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively. The 53rd week contributed $84 million to 2016 fourth quarter and fiscal year sales, including $77 million in Coach brand revenue and $7 million associated with Stuart Weitzman. The additional week added $0.07 to earnings per diluted share.", "The following discussion of performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 includes the 53rd week. Focusing on Coach, Inc., net sales totaled $1.15 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 15% on both a reported and constant currency basis. For the year, net sales totaled $4.49 billion, an increase of 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis from fiscal 2015.", "Gross profit in the fourth quarter totaled $783 million, an increase of 13%, while gross margin for the quarter was 67.8% compared to 69.0% last year. Gross profit for the year totaled $3.05 billion, an increase of 5%, while gross margin was 68.0% compared to 69.6% in FY 2015.", "SG&A expenses totaled $608 million in Q4, an increase of 7%, or 52.7% of sales as compared to $566 million or 56.4% in the year-ago period. For the year, SG&A expenses were $2.28 billion, an increase of 7%, and represented 50.7% of sales as compared with 50.8% a year ago.", "Operating income for the quarter was $175 million, an increase of 39%, while operating margin was 15.1% versus 12.6%. Operating income totaled $777 million in FY 2016, a decrease of 2%, while operating margin was 17.3% versus 18.8% a year ago.", "Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter as compared to $6 million in the year-ago period. Net interest expense was $27 million in FY 2016 as compared to $6 million in FY 2015. Net income for the quarter totaled $126 million compared to $85 million a year ago, with earnings per diluted share of $0.45, up 47% versus prior year. Net income for the full year totaled $552 million, an increase of 4%, with earnings per diluted share of $1.98, including a $0.12 contribution from Stuart Weitzman's.", "Now moving to global distribution, in total, we closed 11 net Coach brand locations globally in the fourth quarter to end the year with 954 directly operated locations worldwide. In addition, we finished FY 2016 with 75 directly operated Stuart Weitzman stores, including 14 locations associated with the acquisition of the Canadian distributor which closed in the fourth quarter.", "Overall and consistent with our plan, our global Coach brand directly operated square footage rose low single digits for the year, with North America square footage essentially even with prior year and International up mid-single digits.", "In FY 2017, we expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to be up low single digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with continued net store closures. Internationally, we expect distribution growth to again be led by Europe, where we are planning another year of significant square footage growth, driven by new stores including our flagship on Regent Street.", "In Greater China, we are projecting a mid-single-digit increase in square footage, driven by net new store openings on the Mainland, partially offset by a modest decline in units in Hong Kong and Macau. In our directly operated businesses in Southeast Asia, we expect little change in both units and square footage, while in Japan, we are planning for additional store closures resulting in a mid-single-digit decline in square footage. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect five to 10 net new directly operated locations in FY 2017.", "Moving on, inventory levels at the quarter end were $459 million compared to ending inventory of $485 million a year ago, a decrease of 5%. Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $249 million compared to $186 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $129 million versus $111 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $120 million versus $75 million.", "For the full fiscal year 2016, net cash from operating activities was $759 million compared to $937 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the fiscal year 2016 was an inflow of $362 million versus $738 million in the fiscal year 2015. CapEx spending totaled $396 million for the year, including approximately $145 million of CapEx associated with the new headquarters compared to total CapEx of $199 million in FY 2015.", "At the end of the fiscal year, cash and short-term investments stood at $1.3 billion as compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, and our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $900 million at the end of the fiscal quarter.", "Turning to Hudson Yards and a discussion of our capital allocation policy, last week, we completed the sale of our interest in 10 Hudson Yards in New York City, resulting in a gain of approximately $30 million. At the same time, we entered into a 20-year lease for the headquarter space at approximately $65 a square foot for the first five years. This transaction is leverage neutral and increases the flexibility of our balance sheet, while, at the same time, securing a long-term lease for our company with minimal net impact to our P&L.", "As planned following the sale, we paid down approximately $300 million of our term loan, with no prepayment penalty. In addition, we will receive net proceeds of approximately $125 million later this fiscal year related to the sale of our previous headquarters' buildings on 34th Street. We should receive the proceeds within 45 days of vacating the buildings and, therefore, expect receipt during or by the end of the second fiscal quarter.", "Overall, we are very pleased to monetize our investment in Hudson Yards, where our commitment was key to kicking off the project. Our new headquarters brings both our brands, Coach and Stuart Weitzman, together under one roof in a modern workspace very much reflective of Coach values and sensibility.", "The transaction was long planned for and there is no resulting change in our capital allocation policy. Our first priority is to continue to invest in our business, as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation, and we're putting our capital against this opportunity.", "Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act, if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders.", "And third, capital returns, as I've stated before, we are committed to our dividend and expect our dividend to grow at least in-line with the prior year's operational net income growth, as our transformation gains momentum. To this end, as noted in our press release, the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3375 per common share payable in early October, maintaining our annual rate of $1.35.", "Underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively; maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.", "Now, turning to our outlook for fiscal 2017, on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis, we expect total revenues for Coach, Inc. in fiscal 2017 to increase by low to mid-single digits, including the expected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 to 150 basis points, based on current foreign exchange rates. This continues to assume a positive low single-digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year.", "In addition, we are initiating an operating margin forecast for Coach, Inc. of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North America wholesale channel, including the closure of about 25% of doors and a reduction in markdown allowances. Excluding this impact, Coach brand operating margin would be in the area of 20% for fiscal 2017, consistent with prior guidance.", "Interest expense is expected to be in the area of $25 million for the year, which incorporates the benefit associated with the pay-down of the term loan, as announced.", "The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is projected to be about 28%. We expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of 283 million. Taken together, we are projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year, and we expect CapEx for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $325 million in FY 2017.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our progress to-date. We have a clear strategy and a well-articulated implementation plan for FY 2017, building on the successes we have achieved in our first two years of transformation.", "Importantly, we expect FY 2017 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top-line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiatives, which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization.", "Overall, the strength of our brands, the clarity of our vision and the dedication and proven execution capabilities of our team gives us continued confidence in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc. over the long term.", "I'd now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Ike Boruchow. Your line is now open.", "Ike Boruchow", "Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the return to positive comps.", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Ike.", "Victor Luis", "Thanks, Ike.", "Ike Boruchow", "So I guess on North America, I think you said the North America outlet comp was essentially flat in the quarter, which I don't think a lot of people expected, given what some other brands have said about tourism and traffic the past quarters or so. I just wanted to ask, what are you assuming is the run rate of that channel for you guys in North America going forward? And then, just a quick one on top of that, given the timing of initiatives and multi-year compares and the choppy environment, should we assume much, if any, North America comp variability or volatility by quarter or by half this year? Thank you very much", "Victor Luis", "Thanks, Ike. I'll let Andre answer that for you.", "Andre Cohen", "Morning. So first, we're really pleased with the sequential improvement we've seen in the outlet channel over the last several quarters. It remains a very productive, important channel for Coach, as you know. For FY 2017, going forward, we're really looking at comps in outlet being sort of either side of flat. And over time, as conditions in the market improve, we're hoping to be able to reduce our promotional stance in that channel.", "Now, as to your second question, we're expecting comps to basically be positive across all quarters for FY 2017. So...", "Ike Boruchow", "Okay, thank you.", "Victor Luis", "And, Ike, in terms of your comments on tourists, we have not seen a dramatic shift quarter-to-quarter. In fact, what we have seen is a slight decrease in Chinese, which has been made up by increases in our Japanese and Korean tourists here in the U.S. Overall, global flows have remained pretty consistent to the trends that we have seen in the past: France being negatively impacted, of course, by terrorist attacks; continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau; and now Japan anniversarying, of course, the massive increase last year of PRC tourists. Southeast Asia continues to see tremendous benefits from the PRC tourists.", "Ike Boruchow", "Got it. Thanks. Congrats again.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Erinn Murphy. Your line is now open.", "Erinn Murphy", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping maybe you could dig in a little bit more about the decision to exit 25% of your North American wholesale doors. How should we be thinking about effectively the sales and the margin impact from the strategic pull-back as we look at your fiscal 2017 guidance?", "Victor Luis", "Morning, Erinn. Jane?", "Jane Nielsen", "Yeah, so, Erinn, as you think about 2017, essentially our guidance for the Coach brand is essentially unchanged, except for the impact of North America wholesale. When you think about that, we expect that impact to be about a point to sales growth, most notably in Q1. Obviously, it's a high operating margin channel and will flow through to our operating margin. But the most significant impact will be in Q1.", "Erinn Murphy", "Okay. And then, Jane, I guess, for you, how should we think about gross margin for Coach, Inc. for the full year, given that change as well?", "Jane Nielsen", "Yeah, so you'll see Coach brand gross margin maintain that 69% to 70% range that we guided to two years ago.", "Erinn Murphy", "Okay. And if I could just sneak in one more for Victor, just on pricing architecture, you guys have obviously seen a very nice response to 1941 collection. Could you share with us what type of consumer you're seeing in terms of the trade-up? Is it the last consumer? Is it a new consumer? And then, on a full year basis, just how should we think about the product mix in terms of those buckets that you break out, under $300, $300 to $400 and $400-plus? Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Sure. We're seeing both current Coach fans engaging well with 1941, lapsed consumers and especially pleased with what we're seeing online, Erinn, as we're getting a younger consumer that maybe has not engaged with Coach and is much fashion-engaged through coach.com engaging with newness as well. And that's especially true at the beginning of the fashion seasons or during special launches, such as we've just experienced with Mickey. And that is the case, of course, in most of our mature markets. Quite different, of course, in developing markets like Europe where we're starting with 1941 as the true first impression that these consumers have of Coach in an increasing way.", "In terms of how we see the balance, and we discussed in our prepared remarks the balancing of the assortment between, if you will, the essentials, fashion and 1941, we are increasing the presence of 1941 to the whole network, as I discussed. I think that during gifting periods, as has been the case in the past, you will see us, of course, increase that assortment with lower price points taking a larger share of the mix, which would be our plan for this holiday as well. But overall, I think you're going to see us continue to see how high is high as consumers engage incredibly well with the message that we're putting out there and understand both the quality of what 1941 represents, but also the fashion messaging.", "Erinn Murphy", "Thank you, and congratulations.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our next question comes from Anna Andreeva. Your line is now open.", "Anna Andreeva", "Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, and congrats to the team.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Anna.", "Jane Nielsen", "Good morning.", "Anna Andreeva", "I guess two questions; first, with all the volatility out there, what kind of category results in North America are you guys embedding, either here in the first quarter or for the year? And secondly, a question on e-commerce, now that eOS impact has been lapped and e-commerce is contributing again, remind us about the size of this business. Is profitably higher versus corporate average? And how big do you think this business could ultimately get? Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "Okay, I'll let Andre discuss e-commerce in a bit. In terms of the category, per our remarks, just given the uncertainty in what's happening in both the macro and geopolitical environment, the trends on tourists, we see that it is difficult to plan an acceleration in the overall category, of course, in the short term. And, in fact, there are, just as we had two years ago, very specific actions in the pull-back of our eOS, which led to some impact on total category growth.", "I know that many of you are aware that some of our competitors are discussing similar actions at the moment, which will also impact category growth, especially here in North America.", "I would just add that in terms of our own guidance, we built it bottoms up. It's based on our views on our own distribution growth, our own comp expectations by market and by region, driven by as well our own innovation across product, stores and marketing and what we expect for the Coach brand. Andre, on web?", "Andre Cohen", "Yes. So web performed really well. It generated about a point of our two points of overall comp growth, both web channels, full price and eOS, performed well. We're seeing, I think as we mentioned earlier, a really much more fashion-engaged consumer engage with the web, particularly when we've got more elevated product, novelty and some of these collaborations like we saw with Mickey. We see that business continuing to grow in line with the balance of Coach going forward, at least in line, I'd say.", "Jane Nielsen", "Yeah, and its profitability gross margin is about in line with the rest of the business, but the operating expenses are obviously advantaged to give it a higher operating income level.", "Anna Andreeva", "Terrific. Thanks, and best of luck.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Jane Nielsen", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our next question comes from Oliver Chen. Your line is now open.", "Oliver Chen", "Hi. Congrats on solid results, and, Jane, also best regards. We'll miss you.", "Jane Nielsen", "Thanks, Oliver.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Oliver.", "Oliver Chen", "Victor, on your comments about going from eight to 12 (sic) [12 to eight] (59:05), could you brief us on how that will manifest in terms of which collections do you think will benefit from this increased flow? And how do you just ensure that the store continues to look integrated and tell the right story in terms of the customer reception to that flow? And on the decision on department stores, it would be great if you could just brief us on the strategic rationale and how you'll evaluate making sure that the ones that you're exiting are the right ones for the brand at large? Because it is a category where certain customers still have a lot of loyalty to that channel, so I just want to make sure I understand why that was the right time. Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Oliver. First on the product flow, you mentioned eight to 12. We mentioned in our notes going from 12 to eight, and we think, of course, that's what you meant, the 12 to eight flow, which is for...", "Oliver Chen", "Yes.", "Victor Luis", "It's important to note for full price only. In our outlet channel we continue to drive monthly newness with monthly flows. In our full price channel, we're moving from 12 to eight, and the reasons there are two. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're really wanting to align much more closely with the fashion calendar, as we engage increasingly with top-tier specialty and tier 1 department stores across the world, and wanting to have our launches be much more impactful as we put much more marketing muscle behind them. And the perfect example of that could be a collection such as Mickey, which in the case of Japan is today, still very much being rolled out through special events with key department stores in that market.", "So it's really about having the newness, such as Rogue and other 1941 bits of the assortment play a more important role for a slightly longer period of time and, therefore, drive more efficiency.", "And then on wholesale, Andre?", "Andre Cohen", "Yeah, so in terms of department stores, look, they remain a critical part of our brand-building in North America, so it's an important channel for Coach. We do want that channel to treat the brand in a way that's consistent with the way we're doing it now in retail distribution, direct distribution. And so we're basically exiting: one, lower volume doors, so doors that are below a certain threshold of volume and where we're no longer seeing a Coach consumer shopping; and second, it's a channel that's become very promotional over the last few quarters, as you know, and we have decided that we'd no longer support knock-down allowances to the level we did in the past. So that's going to naturally exclude us from a number of events in that channel, and it will help to return the brand to health along all of its touch points, not just our direct operated distribution, so.", "Victor Luis", "Yeah, Oliver, I would hate for anyone to believe that we don't have belief, if you will, in the wholesale channel. We have terrific relationships with all of our partners. This is very much a surgical move that is meant to drive the long-term sustainable health of our brand. And we also want to avoid, as I said in my prepared remarks and as Andre has reiterated, that confusion between channels, so a very important move for us.", "Oliver Chen", "Thanks. The elevation looks great. Best regards.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Jane Nielsen", "Thank you, Oliver.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Randy Konik. Your line is now open.", "Randal Konik", "Great. Thanks. Just want to follow up on the comments around 1941 expansion into all stores, can you kind of give us more specific, I guess, color on what you mean by presence? What kind of SKU count should we expect in the stores? And how do you think about the presentation aspects of it and the marketing aspects around the product? Just kind of get some color on how we should expect things to kind of progress there.", "And then, just back on the greater than $400 penetration question, I think, was asked earlier, is there any kind of specific kind of threshold where you would see, you know, we should get towards a goal of maybe 50% of the mix is greater than $400 and that would be it, or how should we be thinking about what is the optimal mix from a price point perspective in the assortment? Thanks.", "Andre Cohen", "In terms of 1941, what we're taking to full store distribution in North America is handbags, so we'll have about 20 SKUs of handbags. Actually, it's already happened in the last week that have hit all the doors. Basically, these are bags that go from Dinky at $300 to Rogue at $800 and above, so we're not taking our ready-to-wear to full distribution at this point. It's a key piece of our brand building. 1941's resonated very strongly with all levels of distributions being put in. And we felt it needed to have a consistent expression of the more elevated brand across the entire fleet in the U.S. and Canada.", "Victor Luis", "And in terms of a specific target, I would say that we really don't have one. The consumer is going to help us decide that. And it's going to have a very different face seasonally, as I mentioned earlier. During holiday, we'll have, obviously, gifting play a more important role in the assortment. And, therefore, we would expect AURs to be lower. And during seasonal launches, especially at the beginning of each fashion season as we enter increasingly with 1941 into a fashion cycle, you'll see that during periods like March/April, September/October/November, you will have higher AURs play a more important role as the fashion launches play a more important part of our mix.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Binetti. Your line is now open.", "Victor Luis", "Morning, Michael.", "Jane Nielsen", "Michael? Operator, would you move onto the next, please?", "Operator", "Yes. Our next question comes from Christian Buss. Your line is now open.", "Victor Luis", "Morning, Christian.", "Christian Buss", "Yes. Hello. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cost disciplines that you're implementing. Where's the progress there, and have you found any incremental areas as you look towards fiscal 2017 and 2018?", "Jane Nielsen", "We continue to execute against the operational efficiency plan that we outlined in the last quarter, where we focus on becoming a more nimble, agile, less-layered organization. We've made progress against that goal. You saw it show up in our fourth quarter operating margin, as we leveraged top line sales to expand our operating margin. And that is incorporated into our FY 2017 guidance.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Dana Telsey. Your line is now open.", "Dana Telsey", "Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the return to positive comps. Congratulations.", "Jane Nielsen", "Thank you, Dana.", "Victor Luis", "Thanks, Dana.", "Dana Telsey", "As you think about Stuart Weitzman and its contribution this past year, how do you look at Stuart Weitzman in fiscal 2017 and it contribution? And just lastly, the 1941 collection gaining more prominence, what percent of the SKUs should it account for? And is it a higher margin than the core? Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "In terms of Stuart Weitzman - and I'll let Andre touch on here in North America, specifically 1941. We answered part of that question earlier, Dana. But in terms of Stuart Weitzman, we expect it to grow double digits, which is in line with previous guidance. Of course, it'll be aided by the take-back of the Canada distribution, those 14 direct stores that we touched upon in our prepared remarks.", "I'm especially excited about everything we're learning about that brand: how it's resonating; the strength of its supply chain; the strength of its international and growing consumer profile; and most importantly, by the wonderful new talent that we're also bringing in that will help this brand over the medium to long term evolve into a broader luxury brand, with a strength, for sure, to come in handbags and accessories as well.", "In terms of the question on 1941, I'll let Andre just touch on that for you.", "Andre Cohen", "So it varies by tier of distribution. Obviously, in our top-tier, it's probably about a third of the assortment and down to about a quarter in our more entry-level stores. And that's an evolution. We'll get there over the next couple of quarters.", "Jane Nielsen", "Yeah, Dana, as you think about Stuart Weitzman, especially in the coming year, we do expect a low double-digit growth rate. There is a fair amount of volatility in both sales and profit as you move through the year, given the high mix of its penetration into wholesale.", "Dana Telsey", "Thank you.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you. That will conclude the Q&A portion of our call. I'll now turn it back over to Victor Luis for some concluding remarks. Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Let me first thank you, Andrea, and thank you, Jane, for all of your contributions. I want to close by just congratulating all of our global teams, both in the Coach and Stuart Weitzman brands, for their hard work and dedication in driving not only the development of our brands, but, of course, our business during what has been a very volatile year in the broader environment.", "I also want to thank all of you on the phone who've been following us, especially over the last 24 months, and have seen the continued unfolding and realization of our creative and business vision. While there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the global environment and the category in the short term, I remain incredibly optimistic about the long-term opportunities in our categories, not only handbags but increasingly footwear and outerwear in both developed and developing markets, and the prospects that exists for the world's middle classes.", "Most of all, I have tremendous faith in our teams and our brands, as we define a new vision for luxury that is based on quality, craftsmanship and a modern fashion sensibility that is both approachable, optimistic and inclusive and represents the best of our New York and American values that resonate so well across the world.", "Thank you, all.", "Operator", "This does conclude the Coach earnings conference.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Director of Investor Relations at Coach, Ms. Christina Colone.", "Christina Colone - Coach, Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Victor Luis, Coach's Chief Executive Officer; and Andrea Shaw Resnick, Coach's Interim CFO. Andre Cohen, President, North America, is also joining us to discuss initiatives for the holiday season.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements. This includes projections for our business in the current or future quarters of fiscal years within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner.

You may find the corresponding GAAP measure as well as the related reconciliation on our website, www.coach.com/investors, and then viewing the earnings release posted today.", "Now, let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our first fiscal quarter 2017 results and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives. Andre Cohen will speak to our North America business, product performance and review our key programs for the holiday season. Andrea Resnick will follow with details on financial and operational results for the quarter along with our outlook for FY 2017. After that, we will hold a question-and-answer session which will end shortly before 9:30. Victor will then conclude with some brief summary remarks.", "I'd now like to introduce Victor Luis, Coach's CEO.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter, highlighted by continued positive comparable store sales in North America and growth internationally, including double-digit increases in Mainland China and Europe as well as sales gains in our directly operated businesses across Asia, outside of Greater China and Japan.", "We remained focused on elevating the Coach brand through compelling product, differentiated store environments and emotional marketing. At the same time, we implemented the strategic actions necessary to reposition the brand and streamline our distribution in the promotional North American department store channel.", "Despite this deliberate pullback, we achieved growth across key financials, including sales, gross profit and operating income as well as double-digit earnings growth. Overall, our results give us confidence that the cumulative impact of our actions will drive top line and bottom line growth per our guidance for the fiscal year.", "As we've outlined previously, for fiscal 2017, our four strategic priorities for the Coach brand include: reenergize our brand in the category by continuing to innovate and establish our unique modern luxury proposition; continue the brand's elevation through a fuller expression of Coach 1941 in stores and online while driving our men's business even further across all channels; focus on raising brand awareness and relevance globally through the rollout of flagships and key fashion capitals, while continuing to renovate our existing store base; and differentiate Coach through a combination of fashion and heritage marketing campaigns, distorting investments to key regions and ensuring the message is relevant and increasingly aspirational to the broader market. This included the relaunch of Coach fragrance with our partner, Interparfums, in September.", "And for Stuart Weitzman, we will drive our leadership position in fashion boots during the key winter selling season, augment our leadership in boots by developing iconic styles in pumps, sandals and flats, while also laying the foundation for the relaunch of the brand's handbag assortment, drive global awareness and brand relevance through impactful marketing and the launch of New York and London flagships during the holiday quarter, leverage new leadership both on the management and creative side to bring the Stuart Weitzman brand into its next chapter of growth as a multi-category player.", "Now, moving to our results. During the first quarter, we delivered on our plan across businesses and geographies, while continuing to successfully execute our brand transformation across the key consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Most generally, we continued to elevate our retail offering globally with the Coach 1941 assortment resonating in our own stores as well as top-tier specialty and department store accounts.", "Of course, we continue to transition more of our fleet into the modern luxury concept, driving comp improvement. Finally, our fall campaign, photographed by Steven Meisel, featured actress Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, against the backdrop of New York, beautifully capturing the spirit and energy of the city. We also ran our first-ever TV commercial for the launch of the new Coach fragrance together with our partner, Interparfums.", "At Stuart Weitzman, we're driving global awareness and brand relevance, gaining traction with the important international and millennial consumer. During the quarter, we continued to drive key investments in management and creative talent as well as infrastructure to support the long-term multi-category growth. Wendy Kahn officially joined as Brand President and CEO in September and we also hired elite footwear designer, Daniele Michetti, who starts this week and will report to Executive Creative Director, Giovanni Morelli, upon his arrival this spring.", "While brand sales were essentially even with the prior year this quarter, primarily due to shipment timing and repositioning of our UK business ahead of the opening of our first retail store on Regent Street, we continue to expect a double-digit sales increase in fiscal year 2017. Indeed, we are extremely pleased by our performance in the early fall-winter season as our strength in boots gains momentum across channels and geographies. Now, as has been our practice since we implemented our transformation strategy more than two years ago, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to drive relevance across the three Coach brand pillars of product, stores and marketing.", "Starting with product, where Coach has emerged as a house of modern fashion design. The key retail strategies we are implementing include, the continued elevation of the assortment with the further rebalancing between Coach New York and 1941, and a move from 12 to eight deliveries in our retail channel, first to better align with the fashion calendar, notably with the higher end specialty retail and also to drive improved productivity as we align deliveries with seasonal marketing.", "During the quarter, our women's retail performance was driven by leather goods and growth in 1941 silhouettes, the Rogue, Saddle Bag and Dinky as well as the novelty Tea Rose and varsity patch platforms. Also during the quarter, we introduced the Drifter family and a smaller version of Mercer. Mickey, which had successfully launched late in FY 2016, built into early Q1 before selling through in most silhouettes.", "In outlet, men's continue to be a major focus for the business and is on plan to be over 20% of the channel by the end of the fiscal year. New style launches in outlet during the first quarter included the Tyler Tote, the Charlie backpack and the Mini Charlie. Signature and leather exotic mixed platforms in dressy silhouettes were well received, and we had a strong customer response to seasonal neutrals.", "On stores, we're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening 40 locations during the quarter, including three renovations in our directly operated North America business, taking us to nearly 500 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our target to end the year with over 700 doors in the new format, representing the vast majority of our traffic.", "Consistent with plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps, which exceed the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. Of course, transforming our stores is more than just the physical design. It's the customer experience our store teams provide each and every single day.", "I'm delighted that our Mystery Shopper Scores, our key metric that demonstrates how we will deliver our unique modern luxury experience, was up again in Q1 at over 80% this quarter as compared to 70% when we started tracking them a year ago. In addition, it's great to see how clients are responding to our new leather services, such as monogramming and leather conditioning, with new services to be introduced throughout 2017.", "Across the global fleet, there were 17 Craftsmanship Bars installed as of the end of the quarter. We also just launched Coach Journey, an online multi-language learning platform which is globally scalable. It is designed to engage and develop our store associates into knowledgeable modern luxury brand ambassadors through a robust development program and monthly product, service and styling skill training.", "In our 75th year, we are very excited about our global flagship focus. We view these stores very much as key retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach Houses on Fifth Avenue in New York City and Regent Street in London, both opening this month, in time for the important holiday season. We will also open our first flagship in Milan, Italy, by the end of the fiscal year on the prestigious, Via Monte Napoleone.", "In North American department stores, where we're repositioning the brand, we did not do any renovations this quarter. We did continue to implement our shop manager program and see a significant impact versus balance of doors in key accounts. As noted on our August call, one of our strategic initiatives this year is elevating the Coach brand in the North America wholesale channel. As discussed previously, through 1941, we have already started adding new locations in top-tier specialty retail stores in North America and globally.", "We are now also in the process of rationalizing our North American department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% or by over 250 locations over the fiscal year, as well as reducing promotional events in the channel. In the first quarter, we closed the first group of these locations, about 120, and expect to close the remainder in our third quarter this upcoming spring season.", "On the marketing front, the quarter kicked off with the successful launch of our Mickey collaboration. We were also thrilled about the reaction to our third-ever 1941 Runway Show this past September, which garnered positive editorial feedback while generating close to 1 billion impressions globally.", "More generally, during the quarter, we remained focused on creating desire for our brand, amplifying our fashion positioning, and our 75-year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality.", "This year, we want to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for consumers with a singular message that cuts through; Coach's unique modern luxury proposition, focusing on leather craft and Stuart's vision for Coach New York cool, familiar American culture interpreted with a twist from New York's original house of leather design.", "As a result of these efforts across customer touch points, we're seeing continued progress with consumers. Importantly, in our North America brand tracking survey fielded in September, Coach's perception of positive brand momentum increased among category drivers versus a quarter ago, while our brand affinities were strong with consumers overall. In addition, category drivers' view of the Coach brand as original increased versus a quarter ago, reflective of our product and marketing strategies.", "We are delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty leather and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury. We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction and will continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.", "Turning now to a discussion of category trends, as we look ahead to the balance of fiscal year 2017, there is no doubt that the challenges that exist today affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general will persist. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain. Currency crosswinds continue to affect tourist flows, and geopolitical events are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, visibility into the category growth remains limited as the landscape continues to rapidly shift.", "This volatility was evidenced throughout FY 2016 and in the most recent quarter. Overall, we estimate that the North American premium men's and women's bag and accessories market was flat to up low single digits in the September quarter, which we believe has been impacted by negative trends seen in the U.S. department store space.", "While Andrea will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So, I'll turn it over to Andre for a discussion of North America. Andre?", "Andre Cohen - Coach, Inc.", "Thanks, Victor. As you read in our release, for the quarter, total North American Coach brand sales decreased 3% on both a reported and constant currency basis, reflecting our deliberate department store pullback, while direct sales were flat. Importantly, the September quarter marked a continuation of positive comps in North America.", "Our bricks and mortar comps rose approximately 4% in the quarter, driven by ticket and conversion, while traffic was down modestly. Overall, our aggregate comp was up approximately 2%, with e-commerce, notably lower eOS flash sales, impacting results.", "Generally, our coach.com retail site demand is similar to our retail stores. For most of the category, the dotcom channel is overwhelmingly a promotional one, with most of our competitors having perpetual sale shops available. As you're aware, we have a clear strategic direction to limit our promotional stance online, given the negative impact on long-term brand health.", "Finally, our business through international tourists in our stores rose during Q1, with declines in Chinese tourist traffic more than offset by other nationalities, notably Japanese and Korean visitors.", "Now, turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product, we continue to drive brand elevation with the above-$400 price brackets rising in penetration to over 50% of handbag sales, up from about 30% last year and generating another positive comp on a sales and unit basis. This drove handbag AURs to over $300.", "Turning to event marketing, as noted on the last call, we came out of FY 2016 comfortable with the cadence and type of events we'd hosted. We held a preferred customer event for September, anniversarying the prior year though slightly shorter in duration and which excluded 1941 products. And we'll hold a Black Friday event followed by our semiannual winter sale in December.", "Looking ahead, our goal is to be the destination for gifting with a compelling assortment and broad offering across price points. We'll incorporate fashion elements such as studs and hologram platforms with a strong nod to our archives, featuring glovetanned leather across all categories for both men's and women's, creating an emotional and compelling offering for the season.", "Specifically in retail, we will, one, continue elevation strategy with further animations of Rogue; two, establish Coach as a year-round gifting destination; three, continue to leverage our unique leather craft which is exemplified by appliqu\u00e9s and quilting in our Coach New York offering and through the use of distinctive materials and techniques such as embroidery and beading in our 1941 collection; and finally, launch several major new platforms, including our iconic 1941 duffle reinvented with increased functionality and Brooklyn, a reimagined carryall with increased functionality addressing the business bag opportunity.", "As we move into holiday in North America outlets, we'll accelerate our strategy to drive more innovation and emotion in the channel through limited editions, collaborations and the launch of new silhouettes and platforms. We're also focused on continuing to grow the men's category and we'll celebrate our first holiday season with men's available in all of our outlet centers. In October, we kicked off the second quarter with a dual-gender limited-edition Pac-Man collection in all our North American outlet doors. This was our first collaboration strictly for the channel and we've been extremely pleased with the results.", "Building on the success of the introduction of Tyler, we're continuing to launch new silhouettes like the Central Satchel and City Zip Tote. For holiday, outlet launches a bold expression of five key prints and a wide array of metallics across multiple categories. Gift sets and novelty items continue to be big drivers for the season. And for Black Friday, we launch another dual-gender limited-edition leather bear collection in all our doors. We've seen great success with these disruptive playful moments in our stores both in bags and in novelty categories.", "We'll be supporting these holiday initiatives and expressing the playfulness of the season in our advertising. The holiday campaign is all about our Coach dinosaur, Rexy. Buzz has been building around her for months beginning with London Collections Men in January, by celebrity dressing and a collaboration with Colette. Building on this excitement, this week we're launching a global Rexy campaign with a video where she comes to life in the workshop linking this pop character to our heritage of leather craft. The campaign continues with our celebrity friends amplifying Rexy and our emotional heritage gifting assortment across multiple platforms, including digital and social media.", "In summary, we're encouraged by our performance and excited for holiday. We believe that our initiatives across the brand pillars will continue to drive positive traction in North America.", "And now turning it back to Victor for international.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thanks, Andre. Moving on to Coach brand's international performance. As noted in our release, in the first quarter, international Coach brand sales rose 7% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. By geography, Greater China sales were essentially even with prior year in dollars in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 5%, driven by double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales on the Mainland, offset in part by continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau. In Japan, sales rose 11% on a reported basis benefiting from the stronger dollar while constant currency sales decreased 7% impacted by a decline in Chinese tourist spend as we lapped last year's dramatic increase.", "In Europe, our sales grew at a double-digit pace in the quarter, driven by new distribution and positive double-digit comps, excluding Paris, where our business continues to be impacted by weak tourist traffic. Post the Brexit vote, we've actually seen very strong results in the UK, benefiting from the currency weakness and increased traction with the local consumer. In our other directly-operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, mainly South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales rose low-single-digit in dollars and in constant currency.", "Finally, I would point out that we're continuing to see disparate results in our international wholesale businesses, which while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased modestly, driven by strong domestic performance, offset in part by relatively weaker tourist location results. On a net sales basis, revenue also increased over the prior year.", "Now, I will turn it over to Andrea for details on our financial results and guidance for the year ahead. Andrea?", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2017. Please note the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.", "We're pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, which marks continued progress against our transformation plan and momentum in our business. Our sales increased over the prior year, driven by positive comps in North America and continued growth internationally and despite the strategically positioning of the Coach brand in the promotional North American wholesale channel.", "Operating margin expanded significantly over prior year once again this quarter, fueled by higher gross margin while we continue to invest in our brands. Taken together, we generated double-digit growth in net income and earnings per share. And our balance sheet remains extremely healthy with a clean inventory position and sufficient cash to support our strategic initiatives, while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend.", "Now, turning to the details. Coach, Inc.'s net sales totaled $1.04 billion for the first fiscal quarter, an increase of 1% on a reported basis and a decrease of 1% on a constant currency basis, including approximately 150 bps of pressure related to the company's strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand positioning in the North American wholesale channel. Coach brand sales increased 1%, including positive North America comp store sales and continued international growth, as Victor and Andre have discussed. Stuart Weitzman brand sales were essentially even with prior year in Q1, impacted by wholesale shipment timing. To this end and as expected, second quarter-to-date Stuart Weitzman brand sales are up double-digits.", "Total gross profit totaled $715 million, an increase of 3% versus prior year, while gross margin increased 120 basis points to 68.9%. Coach brand gross profit increased 3% while gross margin increased 120 basis points over prior year to 69.8%, which included about 40 basis points of pressure from currency. By segment, total North America gross margin increased over prior year, including our directly-operated business, where both gross profit dollars and gross profit rate grew over prior year.", "International segment gross margin increased over prior year, excluding the negative impact of currency. Stuart Weitzman gross profit rose 2%, while gross margin increased approximately 100 basis points over prior year. Total SG&A expenses increased 1%, approximately in line with sales, to $538 million, and represented 51.9% of sales as compared to 51.7% in the year ago period.", "Coach brand SG&A expenses decreased 1% and represented 51.9% of sales compared to 52.7% in the year ago period, an improvement of 80 basis points. Stuart Weitzman brand SG&A expenses were $45 million, compared to $36 million a year ago due to store occupancy costs and the timing of marketing expenses, as well as the company's strategic investments in team and infrastructure.", "Coach, Inc. operating income rose 7% to $177 million, while operating margin increased 100 basis points over prior year to 17% even. Coach brand operating income increased 13%, while operating margin increased 200 basis points over prior year to 17.9%.", "Stuart Weitzman brand operating income of $7 million was down versus prior year based on the timing of net shipments as well as key investments to support long-term multi-category growth, as discussed. Net interest expense was $6 million in the quarter as compared to $7 million in the year ago period. Total net income for the quarter was $126 million compared to $113 million a year ago, with earnings per diluted share of $0.45, up 10% versus prior year.", "Now moving to global distribution. In total, we closed a net of two Coach brand locations globally in the first quarter to end the period with 952 directly-operated locations worldwide. In addition, we opened two net Stuart Weitzman directly-operated stores to end the quarter with 77 locations. In FY 2017, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly-operated square footage to grow low-single-digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly-operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with net store closures in both our retail and outlet channels.", "Internationally, we expect a mid-single-digit increase in square footage led by significant growth in Europe and a mid-single-digit increase in Mainland China, partially offset by a high-single-digit square footage decline in Japan as well as a modest unit decrease in Hong Kong and Macau. In our other directly-operated business in Asia, we expect a little change in both units and square footage. Closing with Stuart Weitzman distribution, we expect to open five to 10 net new directly-operated locations in fiscal year 2017.", "Moving on, inventory levels at quarter-end were $547 million compared to ending inventory of $575 million a year ago, a decrease of 5%. Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was an outflow of $38 million compared to an inflow of $8 million last year. Our CapEx spending was $68 million in Q1 versus $69 million last year.", "Free cash flow in the quarter was an outflow of $106 million versus an outflow of $61 million in the same period last year. During the quarter, we received approximately $675 million in net proceeds associated with the sale-leaseback of the Hudson Yards building. And, as announced, we used a portion of these proceeds to pay down our term loan of approximately $300 million with no prepayment penalty. As such, our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $600 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter compared to approximately $900 million a year ago.", "At the end of the fiscal quarter, cash and short-term investments stood at $1.5 billion as compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. As a reminder, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $125 million during this fiscal quarter related to the sale of our previous headquarters building on 34th Street.", "Turning to our capital allocation policy, which has not changed, our first priority is to continue to invest in our brands, as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation and we're putting our capital against this opportunity.", "Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While we have nothing planned imminently, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach, Inc. and our shareholders.", "And third, capital returns. We're committed to our dividend and expect our dividends to grow at least in line with prior year's operational net income growth as our transformation gains momentum.", "As always, underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.", "Now, turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis, which has not changed, so I'll be brief. We still expect total revenues for Coach, Inc. in fiscal 2017 to increase by low single digits to mid-single digits, including an expected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 basis points to 150 basis points based on current exchange rates. This continues to assume a positive low single-digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year and in each quarter.", "As a reminder, we would expect Stuart Weitzman top line variability quarter-to-quarter, given the nature of the business and its high penetration of wholesale. In addition, we are maintaining our operating margin forecast for Coach, Inc. of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning in the North American wholesale channel.", "As an aside, for you modelers out there, we should note that our 2Q will likely include SG&A dollar growth ahead of sales due to the timing of our 75th anniversary celebrations, notably marketing activities surrounding the opening of Fifth Avenue and Regent Street. We continue to expect interest expense to be in the area of $25 million for the year. The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is still projected at about 28%. And we expect our average weighted diluted shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of 283 million. Taken together, we are projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year. And we continue to expect CapEx for Coach, Inc. to be in the area of $325 million in FY 2017.", "In closing, we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and the consistency of our execution against a volatile backdrop building on the successes we've achieved in our first two years of transformation. Importantly, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiative, which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc. over the long-term.", "I'd now like to open it up to Q&A.", "And apologies for any technical difficulties that you experienced early in the call. Operator, go ahead and queue up the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "All right. And our first question comes from Mr. Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Sir, you line is now open.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Morning, Bob.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "I don't think you talked about comp by store channel in North America. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color there and specifically on the Internet business in North America?", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Sure. As you know, Bob, we saw our comp of nearly 4% this quarter across channels in bricks and mortar, which is not the strongest comp that we've seen in over three years and I couldn't be happier with our performance across both channels, and as Andrea mentioned with the expansion in gross margin that we saw in our direct business. In retail, the impact is from broader distribution of Coach 1941 that we've been working on over the last couple of quarters especially of course the continued rollout of our store concept as well as the great work being done by our sales associates with the enhanced service experience.", "In outlets, as we look to engage with the broader consumer, really proud of the level of innovation and the team as the team has been leveraging a lot of inspiration both from our retail stores and as we mentioned even a few very specific outlet specific innovation such as Pac-Man, which has gotten us off to a very good start earlier this quarter and couldn't be more excited by the level of innovation that we have actually, especially in the back half of this year.", "In terms of your question online, Bob, as you know most of the category uses dotcom as a promotional channel with perpetual sale on their sites. We have a very clear strategy to limit our promotional stance online. We have no 24/7 sale on coach.com. Generally, I can share with you that coach.com retail site demand was similar to our retail stores.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on a very solid quarter.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you, Ike.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So pretty impressive Coach brand gross margin performance in the quarter, so congrats there again. Just hoping to dig through that a little more. Maybe, Andrea, specifically could you talk about the North American margin in the quarter, maybe how much of a benefit was there to gross margin from the wholesale repositioning? And then does your outlook for the remainder of the year incorporate any kind of improvement in the outlet margin performance that you've been seeing in the past quarter or so?", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "Sure. So when you look at gross margin in the quarter, for overall, the Coach brand, there were a couple of areas of benefit and a couple of areas of hit. So starting off on channel mix, channel mix was a positive in the quarter to us. Product mix and cost were actually a very large positive, which we in turn returned to consumers in terms of pricing and value. Not a complete offset but a partial offset there.", "And then in terms of the currency impact, currency was a negative impact in the quarter we talked to about 40 basis points. Interestingly, there was an impact of the yen and that's really about OCI and the yen hedge loss position in the quarter as well as a negative impact in other Asian currencies and on the R&D in terms of the China currency impact.", "For North America specifically, North America gross margin improved in the quarter for the same reasons that I discussed. I'm sure one of the things you're interested in specifically, our outlet, North America store gross margin was actually up in the quarter, so glad that we were able to take the benefit of lower costs and, as I said, returned some but not all of that to the consumer. We did have a small hit in North America from currency and our guidance for the year does bake in these continued benefits from both AUC, or average unit cost, as well as an overall impact of returning that to the North America retail and outlet consumer in terms of pricing. So a nice balance there, as we move through the year.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks so much. Appreciate all the color. Congrats.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our third question on queue comes from David Schick from Consumer Edge Research. Sir, your line is now open.", "David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. You talked about macro volatility. Obviously, we hear that a lot. We see it a lot. But could you talk about how the macro volatility you mentioned in your release plays out in the different businesses that you see? How should we think about if macro volatility were to increase going forward, how to expect that to impact the businesses?", "And then secondarily, the pre-follow-up would be that the category, essentially, categories in which you play have evolved, and so how do you see the different interplay of the categories to define a sort of aggregate category growth? That would be of interest as well, as you've done more in different sort of subcomponents of the categories. Thank you.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. In terms of your question on macro, David, obviously, it's very, very hard to predict. As we know, the geopolitical impacts most recently, whether it be terrorist attacks and where those happened and the impacts that can have, are almost impossible to predict. They do lead, most lead to of course shifts in tourist flows, especially as well as in some markets, even short-term to medium-term impacts on domestic demand.", "The biggest impacts that we have seen outside of those short-term geopolitical have been mostly currency swings. There has been a lot of talk, of course, about the Chinese tourists, where they're increasing and where they're decreasing. We've seen, with the appreciation of the Japanese yen, decreases in tourist spending in Japan. We've seen pickups in Korea, and, of course, we have seen a pretty strong drop-off in Mainland Europe, but especially in Paris, which is a very important destination.", "In terms of the categories, we have just, obviously, with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, made a bigger bet on footwear. We're excited about the long-term opportunity in that category for us, a $28 billion opportunity. But generally, into the medium-term and long-term, we continue to believe there is no better space to be in fashion than the handbag and accessories space. We're excited about that as an opportunity, of course, not only in developed markets here in our home market, the U.S., Europe, which is really a greenfield opportunity for us. I could not be more excited about the team that we have on the ground there and the great work they're seeing. We're beginning to see decent traction now, especially with the UK domestic consumer and as well in developing markets, of course, where there's still so much of untapped opportunity with growing middle classes globally. So, that's, I hope, answer to your question.", "David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question on queue comes from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great. Thank you. Good morning. I think you guys said in your prepared remarks that the $400 price point with that 50% penetration. Just to clarify, is that full price only, or is that overall Coach, Inc., and then \u2013 or Coach brand?", "And then as you head into the second quarter where gifting is the key focus, how should we think about the penetration rate between that over-$400, the under-$300 price points? And then last, how many stores in North America have the 1941 1941 (53:39)? Thanks.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you, Erinn. We'll let Andre answer that.", "Andre Cohen - Coach, Inc.", "Morning. So starting with the $400 price bracket, that has grown, as you know, as we mentioned, significantly this quarter. Going into the holiday quarter, we see a continuation of the growth of that $400 price point bracket, but we've also significantly expanded our assortment below $400 with a gifting focus. And we're particularly excited about that. The heritage gifting collection it's called, that's hitting the stores in the days ahead. And we'll give some good balance to the assortment to take advantage of the gifting opportunity.", "In terms of the distribution of 1941, it's now in our full retail distribution. It's been in full distribution since August, and it's been performing I have to say very well at every level of every tier of store, not only our sort of more top-tier stores.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Yes, so, Erinn, to your first question, it is just in the retail channel, not across both channels, of course. And as Andre mentioned, really excited year-on-year about the heritage gifting, which should probably lead to a decrease in that $500 slightly during the quarter.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Got it. Thank you, guys, and best of luck.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question on queue comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks a lot. Victor, you've made a lot of progress with the evolution towards the house of fashion design and also the Stuart Weitzman acquisition. As you think about the long-term in terms of what you're creating, what do you think about an American multi-brand house and how you'll think about allocating capital and synergy opportunities as you may or may not create a multi-brand kind of company?", "And then just curious. There was a lot of great commentary on bringing service back to stores. What are your high level thoughts about what the industry is facing with traffic and how you can continue to motivate the Generation Z and the new generations to come just to come into physical stores at large?", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thanks, Oliver. In terms of the progress that we've made, of course, not only with the Coach brand, but now, of course, as a dual-brand company, I couldn't be more excited about our ability to leverage the knowhow that we have in Coach to support, of course, Stuart Weitzman. Incredibly excited about the new talent that we've recruited to that brand, both the CEO, Wendy Kahn; the Creative Director, Giovanni Morelli, who joins us in the spring; and as we announced today, Daniele Michetti, who joins us as the lead shoe designer reporting into Giovanni.", "More broadly, in terms of our capital allocation strategy and what could come next, we've been very consistent. We have a tremendous amount of work and opportunity within the Coach brand and the Stuart Weitzman brand. That is our first priority. Our second priority, as you've suggested, is to look at value-additive acquisitions. Of course, we're going to be very selective in acquisitions that allow us to build platforms for long-term growth, that allow us to leverage our global infrastructure and on organizational capabilities and our skill sets, which is obviously building brands and retail management and a terrific supply chain in our core space. Most importantly, we look for great brands. We're not as committed to any specific nationality, so I would keep that in mind.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "He has a second question, I'm sorry, I've just been reminded, in terms of the physical stores and service. I couldn't be, as I mentioned in my response to Bob's question, happier with what the teams are doing across both retail channels. As you've seen, we've driven a positive 4% comp nearly in our bricks and mortar stores. I believe that it's not one specific channel or one specific action, Oliver, that leads to the positive results. It's about a total brand experience. We're committed to being very active digitally and engaging with the millennial and indeed with the broader consumer that's increasingly engaging online.", "And we want to provide her with a great experience whether she decides to shop in our stores or online. What we're being very careful about is managing those promotional impressions, especially in the online channel, which we know is global, transparent and can create a tremendous amount of confusion. And, therefore, a lot of the steps that we've taken both in the online channel and as well, I would say, as we have shared repeatedly in the wholesale channel where we're looking to manage our brand more effectively for long-term growth.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks a lot for those comments. Appreciate it.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "Operator, we will take additional questions beyond 9:30 given the technical issues that we had at the beginning of the call.", "Operator", "And our next question on queue comes from Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on navigating the environment really well.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thanks, Anna.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "I guess one clarification and one question. First on the flash sales headwind that you experienced during the quarter, has that now been lapped or should we continue seeing some of that going forward? And then secondly on Stuart Weitzman, were operating margins up during the quarter excluding the marketing shift and how do we think about the profitability of this brand for the year? Thanks.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Okay. I'll let Andrea discuss the Stuart Weitzman in a bit. In terms of the eOS, no further comments other than what I've said earlier. And I think the main driver there as we've mentioned is that we're not in a very active recruiting mode. It's a closed database to those that shop in our bricks and mortar stores and that have been in our database. And so therefore we will continue to probably see some shrinkage in eOS go forward.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "In terms of the Stuart Weitzman operating margin, Anna, as you know, gross margin was up during the period on a year-over-year basis and so was the SG&A expense line which actually rose significantly during the period. We've called out part due to marketing expenses but there were also additional items. For example, as you may remember, we bought in the Canadian distributor there. So we had those directly-operated expenses of the Canadian stores that we did not have in the year ago period.", "We also had higher retail occupancy costs. Just like Coach, but of course it's more magnified for Stuart Weitzman. We have the occupancy of both the Fifth Avenue and Regent Street stores hitting the P&L there in terms of occupancy expense where we have no sales yet. So we had those as well. There were a couple of other items that impacted it but it was not only marketing timing just to keep that in mind.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Best of luck, guys.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "For the year, I would say that our operating margin for Stuart Weitzman should be in the realm of where it ended last year. And that is what we had expected when we entered this year.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Terrific. Best of luck, guys.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "Go ahead, operator.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question on queue comes from Randy Konik from Jefferies & Company. Sir, your line is now open.", "Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC", "Yes. Thanks a lot. So I want to just talk to the cyclicality of the margin structure, gross margin, that is, across the channels, because it was very positive to hear what the \u2013 it sounded like the gross margin was up in the outlet channel and the strategy has been more about \u2013 I think less about just driving units for units or revenues for revenues but driving a healthier, better margin business and being smarter with the promotional cadences and so forth.", "So can we just get some perspective on where the \u2013 just at a high level, where we are in the cyclicality peak trough between the channels? Because it seems to me there'd be a lot more gross margin opportunities still left in the outlet channel. Just wanted to explore that a little further. Thanks.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "Yes. Randy, I think, it's a good question. As you may remember, last year, I believe it was in our January call regarding our second \u2013 December quarter. We talked about outlet promotional activity ratcheting up. We saw that in the competitive environment hours ratcheted up as well. So we don't lap that until let's say partway through this second quarter. So we would continue to see that. Now we are experiencing lower average unit cost, higher initial markup, which is allowing us to fund, if you will, and pass that on to the consumer. But we start to lap that, to your point, through the second quarter. I am fresh out of crystal balls right now, and I'm not sure that we're going to see a significant lessening in the environment in the second half of the year.", "But, presumably over time, we'll be able to actually keep some of those lower average unit costs on the outlet side. One thing I will mention is we are having and will have for the full year a small benefit associated with the reduction of sales in our wholesale channel. So that will help. And, obviously, we're experiencing lower average unit costs on the retail side as well. And we're seeing nice growth in those AURs and ADTs, as Andre talked about. So I think that probably sort of explains what's going on, on the outlet side and what we're looking at for the balance of the year. As you know that we've reiterated our guidance for the year of 69% to 70%.", "Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "My pleasure.", "Operator", "And our next question on queue comes from Michael Binetti from UBS. Sir, your line is now open.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. Just really quickly, I wanted to touch on the comment that tourism was I guess better or less bad. Could you clarify for me, was that related to the U.S.? I know you made some global comments. But is your sense that tourism's getting better in the U.S. and how meaningful of a change there or so? And then can you help us think about whether the tourism, the outlets \u2013 I'm sorry the tourist outlets are getting better? Or maybe if there's any kind of signs of improvement or trend change in the outlets that are largely shopped by domestic customers?", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Okay. I'll let Andre chime in on that.", "Andre Cohen - Coach, Inc.", "So without going into the details by channel, we did see a slight growth in tourism in the first quarter, a slight decrease in Mainland Chinese tourists to North America, but actually more than offset by other Asian nationalities, particularly Koreans and Japanese.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. And then I think you mentioned that the category for premium accessories for men and women was flat, slightly positive. I think in the past you've spoken just on women's. Is there any way you could help us clarify between the two and if you saw a change in women's that would be worth calling out as well?", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "No. No major shift across channels. I mean it's what we've talked about which is basically the fact that the department store impact has been, obviously, a slight drag. And what we have seen, of course, is that all of the major luxury channels, of course, report with men's and women's together. And we've seen a little bit of an uptick with a few specific luxury players that are impacting both, and therefore, consolidate across all brands.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Congrats again.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our last question on queue comes from Mr. Brian Tunick from the Royal Bank of Canada. Sir, your line is now open.", "Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats as well. I guess you guys usually share with us what innings you think maybe we're in. So I was wondering if Victor or Andre could talk really about the factory channel and maybe talk about what inning you guys think we're in from a store remodel perspective, a product development perspective, including the men's growth. And then if you still believe the retail being the halo for factory will take a few more quarters to really set in from a brand perception perspective. Thanks very much.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Well I'm rooting for Cleveland tonight. There is one or two Chicago fans here in the rooms, but of course, Game 6 we're looking for an end this evening. A big Tito fan, given my affiliation with the Red Sox. I will just add that in before I answer your question.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "Oh, my God.", "Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "So, to your baseball metaphor I think, obviously, look, if we're looking at the outlet channel, we're still in the very early stages in terms of the rollout of the autumn luxury concept itself. Andre and the team leveraging a lot of the consumer insights work at tweaking that concept for it to be more effective. The major impact that we're seeing in that channel is really from the great level of innovation that Stuart and the team are putting into product, and the overall halo impact of the brand as we continue to speak to the broader consumer more directly. And I think you'll see that pick up in the quarters ahead, specifically for holiday, and even more so as we look at the third and fourth quarters. I would say that from a store perspective, we're maybe in the second innings specifically to your question, from a product perspective maybe we're in the middle innings and of course we don't market to that consumer outside of what happens either in the mall itself or in direct email communication with her so I would say that there we are pretty advanced.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "I think we've gone into extra innings here. So, Christina, you want to sum it up?", "Christina Colone - Coach, Inc.", "Sure. That concludes our Q&A. I will turn it over to Victor Luis for some closing remarks.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you. Let me just apologize again to all of you for taking a little bit of your time and apologize on behalf of our service provider. Just want to thank you all for joining us this morning, want to again thank and congratulate both the Coach and the Stuart Weitzman teams for their hard work and to the performance that they are driving on behalf of our shareholders in this rather volatile environment.", "Very excited about the quarters ahead. We have terrific bolt product marketing and wonderful retail experience as planned ahead as we open this quarter in a few weeks both Coach House here in New York as well as in London to cap our 75th anniversary. So, thank you, all, and look forward to chatting live with many of you.", "Operator", "This does conclude the Coach earnings conference, and we thank you for your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Afterwards we will open the floor for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Christina Colone, Coach\u2019s Senior Director, Investor Relations.", "Christina Colone", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Victor Luis, Coach's Chief Executive Officer; and Andrea Shaw Resnick, Coach's Interim CFO. Andre Cohen, President of North America and Global Marketing, is also joining us.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements. This includes projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about risks and another important factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also, certain financial information will be presented on a non-GAAP basis.

Victor will then conclude with some brief summary remarks.", "I'd now like to introduce Victor Luis, Coach's CEO.", "Victor Luis", "Good morning. Thank you, Christina. And welcome everyone. As noted in our press release, we are pleased with and proud of our performance this holiday season, particularly in light of the challenging and volatile global retail environment. ", "Our team delivered top line growth in each of our segments, highlighted by positive comparable store sales in North America with solid demand across channels and overall gross margin expansion. We continued to grow our business internationally with notable strength in Europe and mainland China which represents significant opportunities for our brands. Importantly we opened our first Coach House global flagship locations on Fifth Avenue in New York City and Regent Street in London which represent the fullest expression of our modern luxury vision to date and celebrate our heritage and seventy-five year history of craftsmanship. ", "And despite our deliberate pullback in the North America wholesale channel and unanticipated currency fluctuations, we delivered double digit earnings growth in the quarter. We were also thrilled with Stuart Weitzman\u2019s results this quarter as we continued to implement our strategic priorities for the brand. We advanced our leadership position in fashion boots and booties during the winter selling season while driving global awareness and brand relevance through impactful marketing and the launch of key global flagships. This quarter strength which reflected strong growth in directly operated channels as well as the anticipated shift in wholesale shipments from the first quarter took brand sales growth to double digit for the first half and we continue to expect Stuart Weitzman sales to increase at a double digit pace this fiscal year. ", "More generally, we continued to execute the Coach brand transformation across the consumer touch points of product, stores and marketing. Our gifting assortment resonated with our customers globally across all price points and in all channels. We continue to transition more of the fleet into our modern luxury concept while enhancing our customer experience. ", "Finally, our holiday marketing was bold, innovative and fun, driving a dramatic increase in impressions globally. Also, during the holiday period we continued to elevate our brand through global celebrations of our seventy-fifth anniversary, including our first dual-gender runway show in early December here in New York City. ", "We also announced Coach\u2019s partnership with the actress and singer Selena Gomez. Her work with Coach will be wide ranging and begin with her appearing in Coach\u2019s fall 2017 fashion campaign. It will also include a special product collaboration for launch in the fall across our global network and with major wholesale partners.", "Organizationally, we've announced two new leaders. First, Kevin Wills will join our team as chief financial officer in the coming weeks. Kevin is a proven leader who brings nearly thirty years of broad based and relevant retail and finance experience to Coach. His expertise and strong operational track record make him a valuable addition to the leadership team. ", "We're also delighted about the recruitment of Carlos Becil, coming in a newly created role of chief marketing officer for the Coach brand. Carlos is joining us from Equinox where he held the role of chief marketing officer for the last four years .In his new role, Carlos will partner with Stuart Vevers and our global marketing teams to continue to innovate and bring our brand messages to broader audiences around the globe. ", "I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank Andrea who has held the position of interim CFO over the last several months. She and our proven finance team ensured we continue to execute our strategies flawlessly. And I know you are all pleased to learn that Andrea will continue in her leadership role as global head of investor relations and corporate communications. ", "Now, as has been our practice since we implemented our transformation strategy more than two years ago, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to drive performance across the three Coach brand pillars of product, stores and marketing. ", "Starting with product, where Coach has emerged as a house of modern fashion design. In retail in the holiday quarter we successfully launched Heritage Gifts, a powerful year round dual gender gifting strategy grounded in glove tanned leather featuring pops of color and a balance of emotionally novel giftables. ", "Retail also continued to focus on elevation and fashion in Q2 with the expansion of Coach 1941 handbags and the launch of our first ever all-door pre- spring collection. Building upon product innovation, 1941 continues to be Coach's vehicle to deliver playful iconic Americana inspired themes.", "In outlet, as we touched on during our last call, we kicked off the quarter with a very successful outlet only Pac-Man collaboration. Metallics, florals and patents and dressy silhouettes were also well received. In addition, the exclusive playful holiday prints anchored by our animated Coach bears collection drove consumer engagement via strong messaging to our outlet customers, including Windows, mailers, emails and in-store experience. Men\u2019s continued to be a major focus for outlet and is on plan to be over 20% of the channel by the end of the fiscal year.", "On stores, we're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening 46 locations during the quarter, including four in our directly operated North America business, taking us to about 540 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is very much in line with our target to end the year with over 700 doors in the new format, representing the vast majority of our traffic. Consistent with the plan, these renovations have been driving significant inflections from previous trends and comps which exceed the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. ", "Of course, as we've said before, the in-store customer experience is a key component of our brand elevation strategy, which is based upon, first, differentiating the Coach experience through leather and craftsmanship; and secondly, developing personalized clientele and customer events. ", "I am delighted that our mystery shopper scores, our key metric that demonstrates how well we deliver our unique modern luxury experience, were up again in the second quarter at over 85% as compared to about 75% in last year's holiday quarter. In addition, it's great to see how clients are responding to our new leather services such as monogramming and leather conditioning, with new services such as unique MOG stamps being introduced throughout the year. Across the global fleet, there were 26 craftsmanship bars installed as of the end of the second quarter and we expect to add twelve more in the second half of the fiscal year.", "We remain very excited about our global flagship focus. We view these stores as important retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. These flagships include our Coach Houses on Fifth Avenue in New York City and Regent Street in London, both successfully opened during the second quarter in time for the important holiday season. Earlier this month we opened the Kuala Lumpur Pavilion flagship in Malaysia and will soon open our first flagship in Milan, Italy during February Fashion Week.", "In North American department stores where we're repositioning the brand, we did four renovations last quarter and continued to see positive results from our shop manager program without performance versus the balance of doors in major accounts.", "As noted, when we entered the fiscal year, one of our key strategic initiatives is elevating the Coach brand into North America wholesale channel. Through 1941, we've added some new locations in top tier specialty stores in North America and globally. We are now also in the process of rationalizing our North American department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% or by over 250 locations over the fiscal year, as well as reducing promotional events in the channel. In fall, we closed the first group of these locations, about 120, while the number of days on sale in department stores were reduced by about 40%. And we remain on track to close the balance of targeted doors this spring season.", "On the marketing front, we held events across the globe celebrating the culmination of our anniversary year. Our global influencer driven campaign was our most significant one yet with over 2.6 billion global impressions, up 160% from last year's holiday season. Color was important in creating visual impact, highlighted by our Heritage Gifting program. ", "Large scale experiential marketing, including events in Europe and in Japan, such as our Covent Garden pop-up installation also drove engagement. Similarly, multiple brand moments around celebrity births, Coach House opening events and #Coach75 extended the life of our anniversary campaign. And to cap our anniversary year, as mentioned, we held our first dual-gender runway show in December in New York City generating excitement and brand buzz globally. ", "More generally, during the quarter we remained focus on creating desire for our brand highlighting our fashion positioning and our 75 year legacy of design innovation, craftsmanship and quality. Our goal is to enhance brand perception and make the category exciting for consumers with a singular message that cuts through: Coach\u2019s unique modern luxury proposition focusing on leather craft and Stuart\u2019s vision of Coach New York cool, familiar American culture interpreted [ph] with a twist from New York's original house of leather design. Of course, signing Selena Gomez as the new face of Coach will amplify the coach message given her very substantial global following, especially on social media.", "As a result of these efforts across customer touch points, we are seeing continued progress in consumer perception. Importantly in our U.S. brand tracking survey fielded in December, Coach\u2019s repurchase intent with category drivers increased versus a year ago, while our brand affinities were strong with consumers overall. In addition, fewer consumers viewed the brand as promotional versus a year ago which we believe reflects our deliberate pullback in events over the last two years. ", "We are delighted with our progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach\u2019s transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty leather and accessories brand to a true House of fashion design. We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction and as has been our custom, we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward. ", "Turning now to a discussion of category trends. As we look ahead to the balance of FY\u201917, we believe the challenges that exist today affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general will persist. This volatility was evidenced throughout FY\u201916 and the first half of FY\u201917 impacted by the U.S. election this fall and the significant strengthening of the dollar over the last few months.", "Overall, with limited data points given the delayed year end reporting for several brands, we estimate that the North American premium men's and women's bag and accessories market was flat to up low single digits in the December quarter which we believe has continued to be impacted by negative trends seen in the U.S. department store space.", "While Andrea will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market. So I'll turn it over to Andre for a discussion of North America. ", "Andre Cohen", "Thanks, Victor. As you read in our release for the quarter, total North American Coach brand sales increased 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, including the negative impact of our deliberate department store pullback. ", "Direct sales rose 5% in the quarter. Importantly, the second quarter marked the third consecutive quarter of positive comps in North America. Our brick and mortar comps rose approximately 4% in the quarter driven by ticket and conversion while traffic was down moderately. Overall, our aggregate comp was up approximately 3% with e-commerce impacting quarterly results. As you're aware we have a clear strategic direction to limit our promotional stance online given the negative impact on long term brand health.", "Finally, our business to international tourists in our North America stores was essentially even during Q2 with declines in Chinese tourist traffic once again offset by other nationalities, notably Japanese and Korean visitors. Generally international tourists are less significant to the category and to luxury in general during the holiday season given the increased gifting purchases by domestic customers.", "Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on products. We continue to drive brand elevation with 1941 representing approximately one third of handbag sales in our top tier retail stores, consistent with plan. The penetration of the above $400 price brackets increased to nearly 50% of handbags sales, up from about 30% last year and generated another positive comp on a sales and unit basis. And as noted, we were also excited by the performance of our retail gifting assortment across categories. The iconic Dinky bag at $295 resonated with consumers, while novelty giftables increased over prior year and exceeded expectations. ", "Turning now to events marketing. In the second quarter we again held a Black Friday event, this time with a fixed percentage off offer but importantly excluding 1941, a significant part of our assortment as mentioned. This was followed by our semi-annual winter sale. In the third quarter we would again expect to hold a closed preferred customer event in March. ", "Looking ahead to spring, our goal is to continue to elevate and differentiate the brand by offering innovation and emotion through our product assortments, marketing and the in-store experience. We\u2019ll also continue to position Coach as a year round gifting destination.", "Specifically in retail, we will continue to reinforce our craftsmanship through the reinterpretation for Coach New York of our western rivets [ph] which was launched on the runway in Coach 1941. The cool kid static of 1941 takes on a more feminine flair with beautiful semi precious stones embellishing these highly wearable styles. In 1941, we will launch a new Rogue tote, at $695 which builds on the success of the now iconic Rogue bag with structured luggage handles, Bombay stitching details and a cool edgy all-day look.", "We will also expand the Tea Rose platform with wild tea rose, its boldest expression yet with a mix of leather, resin and metal flowers. Finally, we relaunched our best selling Edie Shoulder Bag with a whole new look, plus a new larger size the Edie 42.", "And for outlets as we transition into spring, we're excited to refresh the color palette and infuse retail inspired looks with bright colors, trend right color blocking and runway chic floral prints. In addition, we're launching two limited edition collections where we pay homage to our hometown of New York City and to our iconic designer Bonnie Cashin.", "Men's will continue to grow by expanded lifestyle assortments to additional centers with increased marketing support. We look forward to our floral explosion in March when we introduce our new feminine petal bag, a drawstring silhouette designed to resemble a flower in bloom, and in the fourth quarter we're very excited about the launch of Disney for outlets which was our strongest ever collaboration in retail.", "I\u2019ll now turn it back to Victor for a discussion of international.", "Victor Luis", "Thanks, Andre. Moving on to Coach brand\u2019s International performance. As noted in our release, in the second quarter International Coach brand sales rose 3% on a reported basis and 1% on a constant currency basis. ", "By geography, Greater China sales were essentially even with prior year in dollars in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 6% with positive comparable store sales overall. We continued to drive strong results on the mainland while Hong Kong and Macau experienced significant improvement in the quarter. ", "In Japan, sales rose 9% on a reported basis while constant currency sales decreased 2%, impacted by a decline in Chinese tourist spend as we lapped last year's dramatic increase. In Europe, our sales grew at a double digit pace in the quarter driven by new distribution and positive double digit comps. We've continued to experience very strong results in the UK benefiting from the currency weakness and increased traction with the local consumer. We were particularly pleased to open our Coach House location on Regent Street in London during the quarter where results to date have been strong and above expectations. ", "In Paris, our business for the quarter continued to be impacted by weak tourist traffic, though we did see relative improvement in December as we anniversaried the negative impact resulting from last year's tragic terrorist attacks.", "In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales decreased low single digits in dollars and in constant currency. Our results were impacted by softness in Korea where macro-economic headwinds have pressured spending from domestic consumers. Excluding Korea, our business in our other directly operated Asian markets in aggregate rose mid-single digits in dollars and in constant currency.", "Finally, I would point out that we're continuing to see disparate results in our international wholesale businesses which while small are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, our overall sales at POS increased slightly, driven by strong domestic performance offset in part by relatively weaker tourist location results. On a net sales basis, revenue also increased over prior year.", "Now I'll turn it over to Andrea for details on our financial results and guidance for the balance of the year. Andrea? ", "Andrea Resnick", "Thanks, Victor. Victor and Andre have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second fiscal quarter results as well as our outlook for FY\u201917. Please note the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. ", "We are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter, particularly in light of the volatile backdrop. Our sales increased over prior year in each of our segments highlighted by positive comps in North America, continued growth internationally and strong performance of Stuart Weitzman. And on this higher level of sales, our gross margin expanded significantly over prior year. ", "We also made important investments in our brand and business as projected and delivered double digit growth in net income and earnings per share despite the strategically positioning of the Coach brand in the North American wholesale channel and headwinds associated with currency. Importantly our balance sheet remains extremely healthy with a clean inventory position and sufficient cash to support our strategic initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend.", "Now turning to the details. Coach, Inc.'s net sales totaled $1.32 billion for the second fiscal quarter, an increase of 4% on a reported basis, including a positive impact of 40 basis points related to currency translation, a smaller benefit than originally anticipated given the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar. ", "In addition, and as expected, the company\u2019s strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand\u2019s positioning in the North American wholesale channel through a reduction in promotional events and door closures negatively impacted sales growth by approximately 100 basis points in the quarter. Coach brand sales increased about 2%, including positive North America comp store sales and continued international growth as both Victor and Andre have discussed. Stuart Weitzman brand sales rose 26% as expected. ", "Consolidated gross profit totaled $906 million, an increase of 6% versus prior year while gross margin increased approximately 110 basis points to 68.8%. Coach brand gross profit increased 4% while gross margin increased 130 basis points over prior year to 69% even which included a benefit of approximately 30 basis points from currency. ", "By segment, total North America gross margin increased over prior year, including our directly operated business where we grew both gross profit dollars and gross margin rate over prior year. International segment gross margin increase over prior year both on a reported and constant currency basis. Stuart Weitzman brand gross profit rose 26% while gross margin rate was even with prior year. ", "As projected, total SG&A expenses increased 7% to $612 million and represented 46.3% of sales as compared to 45.1% in the year ago period, reflecting in part the impact of currency and investment in Stuart Weitzman, as well as higher marketing spend versus prior year. ", "Coach brand SG&A expenses increased 4% and represented 46.5% of sales compared to 45.4% in the year ago period. Stuart Weitzman brand SG&A expenses were $53 million compared to $38 million a year ago due to an increase in store occupancy costs associated with new openings, the timing of marketing expenses as well as the company's strategic investments in team and infrastructure. ", "Coach, Inc. operating income rose 3% to $294 million while operating margin was 22.3% essentially even with prior year\u2019s 22.4%. Coach brand operating income increased 3% while operating margin increased 20 basis points over prior year to 22.5%. Stuart Weitzman brand operating income was $23 million or 19.8% of sales versus $22 million or 23.6% of sales in the prior year, reflecting key investments to support long term multi category growth as discussed. ", "Net interest expense was $5 million in the quarter as compared to $6 million in the year ago period. Total net income for the quarter increased 12% to $211 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.75, up 11% versus prior year.", "Now moving to global distribution. In total we opened a net of eight Coach brand locations globally in the second quarter to end the period with 960 directly operated locations worldwide. In addition we opened five net Stuart Weitzman directly operated stores to the end the quarter with 82 locations. In FY\u201917 we continue to expect our Coach brand directly operated square footage to grow low single digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with net store closures in both our retail and outlet channels. Internationally we expect a mid single digit increase in square footage led by significant growth in Europe and a mid single digit increase in mainland China, partially offset by a low double digit square footage decline in Japan, as well as a modest unit decrease in Hong Kong and Macau. In our other directly operated businesses in Asia, we expect a little change in both unit and square footage. ", "Finally, turning to Stuart Weitzman distribution. Year-to-date we've opened a total of seven net new locations and do not expect any additional openings for the balance of the fiscal year. ", "Moving on, net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $366 million compared to $302 million the prior year. Our CapEx spending was $54 million in Q2 versus $106 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $312 million versus $196 million in the same period last year. As expected during the quarter we received approximately $125 million in net proceeds related to the sale of our previous headquarter buildings.", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $465 million compared to an ending inventory of $438 million a year ago. At the end of the fiscal quarter, cash and short term investments stood at $1.8 billion as compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. ", "Our total borrowings outstanding were approximately $600 million at the end of the fiscal second quarter compared to approximately $900 million a year ago, reflecting the pay-down of our term loan in the first quarter as previously discussed. ", "Turning to our capital allocation policy, which has not changed. Our first priority is to continue to invest in our brands as we have a compelling opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value creation and we're putting our capital against this opportunity. ", "Our second priority, strategic acquisitions, is also about growth. While there is nothing imminent, we want to have the flexibility to act if and when it's in the best interest of Coach Inc. and our shareholders. ", "And, third, capital returns. We are committed to our dividend, expect our dividend to grow at least in line with prior year\u2019s operational net income growth as our transformation gains further momentum.", "As always, underpinning all of these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity and access to the capital markets.", "Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis. We are maintaining our operational outlook for FY\u201917 while adjusting our revenue guidance based solely on current exchange rates. As you know our previous fiscal 2017 revenue guidance was for an increase of low to mid single digits, including an expected benefit from foreign currency of approximately 100 to 150 basis points. Given the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar we are now projecting revenue to increase at a low single digit rate including an expected negative impact from foreign currency of 50 basis points for the full year, therefore representing a 150 to 200 basis point swing from previous guidance. This implies that currency will pressure top line results by over 100 basis points in the second half of the fiscal year based on current exchange rates.", "This guidance continues to assume a positive low single digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year and in each quarter. We also continue to project double digit revenue growth for Stuart Weitzman for the year.", "As an aside for you modelers out there, while we're projecting overall low single digit revenue growth in the second half of the year, we're forecasting topline variability by quarter. Specifically our nominal revenue is expected to decline in the third quarter based on: first, the negative currency impact of about 100 basis points; second, calendar shift in North America, including the later timing of Easter which falls into the fourth quarter this year versus the third quarter last year; third, our strategic North America wholesale initiatives with a continued reduction in promotions and the next tranche of door closures planned for 3Q; and finally, an expected shift in Coach international wholesale shipment timing from the third quarter into the fourth quarter based on our visibility into second half orders. Offsetting this, we're projecting strong topline growth in Q4 benefiting in part from those identified calendar and shipment timing shifts and despite an expected negative impact from currency of over 200 basis points.", "Most importantly we are maintaining our operating margin forecast for Coach Inc., of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand\u2019s positioning in the North American wholesale channel. ", "We continue to expect interest expense to be in the area of $25 million for the year. The full year of fiscal 2017 tax rate is now projected at about 26% with a significantly lower tax rate forecasted in 3Q versus 4Q consistent with our typical cadence based on the anticipated of expiration of statutes in the third quarter. And we expect our average weighted diluted shares outstanding for the year to be in the area of 283 million. ", "So taken together we're still projecting double digit growth in both net income and earnings per share for the fiscal year and we continue to expect CapEx for Coach Inc. to be in the area of $325 million. ", "In closing, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter and the consistency of our execution against a volatile backdrop building on the successes we have achieved thus far in our transformation. Importantly we expect -- we continue to expect FY\u201917 to be the year when we return to growth across all financials, leveraging top line growth and supported by our operational efficiency initiatives which have allowed us to become a more nimble organization. Overall we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach Inc. over the long term. ", "I\u2019d now like to open it up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. ", "Robert Drbul ", "Hi good morning. I just have two quick questions for you please. The first one, can you provide a little more color on the second quarter North American comp by channel? And then the second question is, can you provide a little more granularity exactly on the third quarter versus the fourth quarter and the big movements there? ", "Victor Luis", "Sure, I'll take the North America comp question and then Andrea will jump in with the guidance question. Bob, we're obviously very pleased with our performance in the second quarter in North America where we saw demand grow across all of our direct channels with an expansion in our gross margin. As you know in the first quarter we have a total comp of 2%. We saw that grow to 3% with our bricks and mortars comp being 4% for the holiday quarter, really benefiting from all of the actions that we have been taking over the last couple of years to drive our transformation across both channels. In retail, we're seeing our elevation take hold with the broader distribution of Coach 1941 and the continued rollout of our modern luxury concept. And I couldn't be prouder of the engagements of our teams with our consumers across both channels as well. And in outlets, we are seeing a level of innovation from our design teams at a level that we haven't seen in the past and that's really beginning to resonate. Of course that includes as we suggested during our prepared remarks some of those wonderful collaborations that we have seen. ", "Andrea Resnick", "In terms of our third versus fourth quarter guidance, I think the first thing I'd point out is we maintained our operational outlook for the year, including the expectation of a low single digit North America comps in both 3Q and 4Q. Obviously as we discussed we expect some variability between the quarters along with pressure from FX in the second half. ", "In the third quarter, as I enumerated our top line is being negatively affected by a number of timing items, including the shift of Easter into the fourth quarter as well as our international wholesale shipments which in turn are being driven by the change in our delivery to better match the fashion calendar. In addition, while not a comp impact our third quarter of last year \u201816 included the post-Christmas week. This year, due to the calendar shift that fell into 2Q and will not be included in 3Q. Of course in North America wholesale we're closing that next tranche of doors to get us over to 250 this quarter and in the fourth quarter where we started to pull back last year will begin to anniversary that impact of those strategic actions, so less of an impact on the year over year basis. Therefore projecting very strong topline growth in Q4 benefiting in part from these calendar and shipment timing shifts and despite a negative impact from currency which will -- if current rates hold, impact us by about 200 basis points, so a very strong fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.", "Ike Boruchow ", "Good morning everyone. Congrats on a nice quarter. So just taking a step back focusing on the Coach brand\u2019s profitability. So I imagine high 60s gross margins are probably not planned to move much higher from here over time. So I just kind of wanted to ask a big picture, where you see the Coach brand margin longer term and kind of how do we get there -- I don't think anyone expects 30% margins again. But how high is high today and I'm just asking because you deleveraged SG&A this quarter and I think you did in Q1 as well within the Coach segment. And I'm just wondering how you're planning out the investments needed to drive the top line of the Coach brand versus your goal of taking the operating margins higher over time? ", "Andrea Resnick", "Sure, sure. I think you're absolutely right there. In terms of gross margin, when you look back to 2014 when we originally gave our guidance we absolutely assumed that our gross margin would stay in 69% 70% ex-currency impact. And the real question is, at the time was the SG&A leverage and as we said as we try to positive comps, we\u2019ll will begin to overall leverage that SG&A spend which we absolutely accept that. I think since 2014, the necessity to invest in our brand, higher overall occupancy costs etc for all brands, has probably brought down the upper end of that best in class profitability. But we're still focused on driving our profitability from these levels. We're very comfortable with it. We've shown the ability to lever as we would see the top line growth. So we do expect our operating margin to continue to move higher from here and we're very comfortable with that guidance. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Schick with Consumer Edge Research.", "David Schick ", "I\u2019d like to put a couple different comments together into one question. So Victor, you talked about --", "Andrea Resnick", "One question David.", "David Schick ", "Right -- house of fashion design -- it\u2019s really one question I promise -- house of fashion design, you\u2019ve done less distribution, you\u2019re having great success at the higher price points. I guess what I am trying to say is your vision for Coach in 2020 and beyond, there is a lot of street focus constantly on the category, should we think less about the category and more about your core competencies of what you are doing across categories? How should we think about that, not margin but what Coach is now really great at and how that drives the long term future?", "Victor Luis ", "Yeah, well, obviously we're really great in our core category and that will remain a core competency going forward, David. We don't see ourselves becoming an apparel play, if you will. Obviously we've also talked about layering on other categories and we've made a very important acquisition in Stuart Weitzman, that has made us a very significant player both here in the U.S. and increasingly internationally in footwear. We're going to be leveraging that know-how of course for the Coach brand as well, especially as we take back our license later this calendar year and begin both the development design and production of shoes in house to have footwear become an increasingly important part of the Coach brand go forward. ", "As well, we do see outerwear as an area of growth for us. If you look at what we're doing with all of our runway shows and anything that you see within our stores you will see that outerwear plays a very important part of our apparel play, if you will, of what we're doing in terms of giving context to the Coach woman and the Coach man much more so than I would say a standard tops and bottoms T shirt and jeans type of business. We're not interested in getting into a basics business. So those three categories combined represent an $80 billion global opportunity and today at $4.5 billion, we obviously have a very small stake in that and so within both the Stuart Weitzman brand where you will see us add with our new creative director, handbag business and then within the Coach brand as we add footwear and outerwear you will see us take an increasingly large share of those three pieces of the pie.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn Murphy ", "Good morning. You guys as you\u2019ve elevated the brand, can you talk a little bit more about what you're finding about the consumer who have been purchasing that 1941 collection? And then I think you said that you'd be introducing this spring a Rogue at $695, I think it's a little bit of a sharper price point than you've seen in the balance about Rogue collection, but who do you view as the incremental consumer there? Thanks.", "Andre Cohen", "Sure. So we\u2019re really seeing two groups of consumers responding to 1941. The first one, as we expected, is new consumers who hadn't really connected with the brand in the past and who find that they\u2019re sort of more fashion forward, a bit understated aesthetic 1941 really works for them. But what was more surprising for is is that we\u2019re finding a lot of lapse consumers returning to the brand because -- consumers who lapsed in our sort of logo heyday who were coming back because of the leather -- on the leather static of 1941. So that was, I\u2019d say, a positive surprise for us.", "In terms of price points, really 1941 stretches from $295 for a Dinky back which has been one of our top sellers especially across the holidays all the way up to $1500 for a Rogue bag in exotics. So we don't see it as being purely a high high price point collection, it doesn't drive the above $400 comp clearly but it's not just that, it spreads across a wide range. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Co. ", "Oliver Chen ", "Hi congratulates on really solid results. Victor, we had a question regarding the long term path and strategic acquisitions. What are your thoughts about Coach in the future in terms of being a multi brand modern luxury house? You've done a great job but sort of I am just curious about your general thoughts around that framework, and on the gross margin line which is very impressive, what should we model or think about going forward in terms of the Coach brand gross margin it was really impressive this quarter? Just curious about some more details of the drivers. Thank you. ", "Victor Luis", "Sure. Andrea will answer the gross margin question in a minute. In terms of how we think of Coach and go forward, I believe that before the Stuart Weitzman acquisition we've been clear that we see Coach Inc. being larger than just the Coach brand. Obviously we've made our very first and significant acquisition with Stuart Weitzman, we're really pleased with the results there. The team has done an amazing job, we\u2019re continuing to drive that business and obviously we have continued to invest both in managements and into design talents and I'm very excited about the opportunity for Stuart Weitzman and I would say before thinking about the larger vision beyond those two brands that our team is very focused on executing in our core business and organic business and doing a terrific job and driving both the transformation of the Coach brand as well as in driving the Stuart Weitzman brand which we see moving beyond footwear into handbags and accessories player as well in the years ahead. ", "So as we think about acquisitions beyond Stuart Weitzman, Oliver, we've been very very consistent for years now in terms of our capital allocation strategy. Obviously we've been very excited about thinking of the three categories as I touched upon earlier that we believe are the closest to us and the most branded in the fashion space, handbags and accessories, footwear and outerwear especially and that would be obviously part of our consideration set, we're not interested in turnaround plays, we're very interested in brands that are great brands and that growth potential where we can leverage both our skill set, our structure, our systems, our infrastructure, supply chain and know how that we have in helping great brands develop global. ", "Andrea Resnick", "In terms the Coach brand gross margin in the second quarter which was up 130 basis points including about 30 basis points from currency. We once again had a benefit from channel mix in there. Probably the most significant was the ongoing lower product costs which were somewhat offset but not completely offset by our ability to pass that along to lower prices to our customers, the product cost a big positive impact forward. As we move forward through the balance of the year we would expect in the second half for our gross margin for the Coach brand continue to be expanding on a year over year basis most notably in the third quarter. Again we would expect channel mix to actually be in a slightly really bigger benefit in the third quarter, ongoing benefit from product costs as well as the end of the day continued source margin expansion for the close poach brands in the second have notably in third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.", "Anna Andreeva ", "Great thanks so much. And congrats guys on that navigating the environment really well. A question was on remodels and the outlet channel, specifically I think you had mentioned that the recent ROI was better than when they initially. Can you maybe provide some color on that? How many stores have been remodeled currently and how should we think about the opportunity down the road and then secondly just quickly the flash sale impact moderated this past quarter. How do we think about that headwind going forward?", "Andre Cohen", "Sure. Good morning. So we mentioned I think last call we've been doing research both through our consumer insights group and field teams to try and understand how consumers react to this new remodel. There are few actions we took based on those findings, a few months ago that is starting to pay off where we are seeing improved results, so larger rooms, not so much segmentation within the stores, more tables to make the products more accessible. We've got a new findings we are now acting on, particularly that\u2019s a signage in the stores, more visible Windows that are being implemented as we speak. And we've seen strong performance actually, these outlets are more luxury remodels. Overall we\u2019ve remodeled so far 69. ", "Victor Luis", "In terms of the flash sales -- our EOS impact as we call it internally are e-outlet store which is as you call the flash sales model, the impact in the second quarter was really a slight bump versus previous performance of around Black Friday, gifting in general. Overall as we have stated in the past we are not actively recruiting new consumers into the database, we\u2019re only mailing those who shop within our outlet channel. And so I would again expect the database to continue to shrink and its performance to consume shrink as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS Securities.", "Michael Binetti ", "Hey guys, good morning, great quarter. I think your answer is, I was hoping over from another call. But I just want to get a little bit more -- a little more detail on the margin outlook. I mean I think you guys have done a really nice job of helping us think about the longer term outlook as I look through your Power Point from 2014 here. So a lot of that thinking was obviously at a time when the category is growing a lot faster. So I guess we know that prior peaks for your business aren't the best North star for models on the operating margin opportunity but we've talked about the opportunity for the brand to return to mid twenty's over time. And Andrea, I think you just said it was chime in that, the best in class number that you gave at the Analyst Day changed a little bit. Given what you know about the category and your growth rates today, is mid-20s still an appropriate rate to think about over the next few years? And if so, what do you think are the biggest sources of leverage is at the top line trajectory we see today?", "Andrea Resnick", "Michael, I think I gave that answer to Ike I but I don't mind this is happening later year. I think the biggest point of leverage is obviously the returns to positive growth and positive comp. And so you've already seen that come through in our results, we backed to continue to come through in our results. Our target has always assumed continued sales growth for Coach, stable gross margins and leverage in expenses. While we're going to continue to invest in our business and those items really haven't changed. And that's what we're going to maintain going forward and you've seen that leverages come through already. So I think the path -- the trajectory remains positive and as I already mentioned to Ike.", "Michael Binetti ", "I'll call Ike for the rest. Thanks. ", "Andrea Resnick", "Or check the transcript. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. ", "Mark Altschwager ", "Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could provide a bit more detail on your current growth outlook for China. It's encouraging to hear the pressure has eased in Hong Kong, Macau. So I guess what inning are you in with right sizing your footprint in that region and do you have a view on when it can return to growth? And then looking at the mainland just any current thoughts on where the store fleet stands today and how you're thinking about balancing brick and mortar versus digital growth longer term, just, what is the growth algorithm we should think about for mainland China medium to longer term? Thank you. ", "Victor Luis", "Yes, there may be some confusion because you mentioned return to growth, we've been growing very strongly in China since we took that business back in 2008, I believe it was, and have grown it from what was approximately a $30 million business to over $600 million today. Team has done an amazing job in driving our distribution there. Today we're at approximately across Greater China which would include Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, 191 doors, we have 172 doors in China, still very much opportunity for growth in second and third tier cities. As you may know, China has approximately 200 or more cities with a population of a million or more and given more accessible price points we believe we're going to be seeing continued opportunity for us to develop distribution beyond what the traditional luxury brands have and have tremendous opportunity of course to continue to grow within same stores there as the middle class continues to evolve in that markets and as we continue to see of course the population urbanizing. So the long term story within mainland China is very very exciting indeed. ", "In terms of Hong Kong and Macau we've seen a much better performance over the last quarter. And that is very a significant for us, it's a very important market of course especially for PRC tourists and it's been 18 to 24 months since we saw the first protests from Occupy Central and I think all of us in retail and luxury retail especially are very happy to see that market\u2019s stabilized and hopefully in the future become a source of growth.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Brian Tunick ", "Pretty tough environment. I guess wanted to hear more about the factory channel perspective, did you guys feel like the holiday overall was more promotional in the factory channel when you looked at your competition? Can you maybe talk about from a product perspective what percentage today is Stuart design and the halo, you've talked about in the full priced stores? And as we think about the comp improvement at the factory channel, how much it come from AUR versus conversion over the next couple of quarters? Thanks very much.", "Andre Cohen", "Good morning. The factory channel was very promotional this Q2, we saw our competition go deeper than they've ever gone. So the environment itself was deeply promotional. We were driven really by innovation as Victor mentioned earlier, a couple of really impactful new launches. The PacMan was one of them and then we had our Bears collection around Christmas that were highly highly successful. So I think we navigated the promotional environment, focusing more on innovation really than just deep discounting. Most of the product today in factories is designed by Stuart. We have a small share of retail leads that end up in factory but it's primarily new designs and I think we talked about a year ago about the factory outlet. There was -- aimed to a fast tracking innovation, we're seeing the results of that over the last few months and very pleased with this. Traffic continues to be challenging in general in the channel. So we are counting on both conversion and higher ADTs, average tickets to drive growth and productivity. ", "End of Q&A", "Christina Colone", "Thank you. That concludes our Q&A. I'll now turn it back over to Victor Luis for some closing remarks. ", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Christina. As is our custom I just want to close by, first and foremost congratulating all of our teams across the world both in the Coach and the Stuart Weitzman brands for all of their hard work and dedication. Against what is a continuing volatile and unpredictable global market, I couldn't be prouder of all of them, their commitment to driving innovation, the strong engagement that they have with consumers across the globe. And it's truly their hard work that is reflected in our results. And I thank their commitments and their can-do spirits and thanks to them that we remain very optimistic about the long term opportunities for our brands. Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.", "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Global Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Coach, Andrea Shaw Resnick.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results are Victor Luis, Coach's Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Wills, Coach's CFO. Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements.", "This includes projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about risks and other important factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Also, certain financial information will be presented on a non-GAAP basis.

You may identify these non-GAAP measures by the terms non-GAAP and constant currency.

Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our third fiscal quarter 2017 results and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives across markets. Kevin Wills will continue with details on financial and operational results for the quarter and our outlook for the business for the balance of the year.", "Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session where we will be joined by Andre Cohen, President, North America. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 AM. We will then conclude with some brief summary remarks.", "I'd now like to introduce Victor Luis, Coach's CEO.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. Our solid performance this quarter was very much in line with our expectations and continued to reflect our strategic initiatives. In a volatile and complex global environment, we delivered continued positive comp store sales for the Coach brand in North America and gross margin expansion in each segment, while tightly controlling costs.", "We continue to drive growth in our directly-operated Europe and Mainland China businesses, which represent the most significant geographic opportunities for our brands. And, despite our deliberate pullback in North America wholesale channel and the impact of calendar shifts, we delivered earnings growth.", "At Stuart Weitzman, we're executing on our plan, driving global awareness and brand relevance, and gaining traction with the millennial consumer. The response to spring newness has been particularly strong, and we continue to expect sales to increase at a double-digit pace for both the fourth quarter and the year.", "We're also making key brand investments in management, creative talent, and infrastructure to support long-term, multi-category growth. To this end, we're especially excited about the arrival of Giovanni Morelli, who joins the brand this week as Creative Director.", "In addition, we announced a new leadership structure and strengthened our Coach brand team during the quarter, a critical step in Coach, Inc.'s evolution as a customer-focused, multi-brand organization. I'm particularly excited about the addition of Josh Schulman, who'll join us next month in the newly created role of Coach Brand President and CEO, as well as the elevation of the Ian Bickley to a new Coach, Inc. position as President of Global Business Development and Strategic Alliances spanning all businesses and brands.", "Separately, Andre Cohen will be leaving Coach at the end of June to return home to Asia with his family. Andre has been a great partner to me and a strong leader of our businesses in Asia and North America. I deeply appreciate his friendship and contributions over the last nine years, but naturally, we respect his family's decision to return home to Singapore.", "Now as has been our practice since we implemented our transformation strategy almost three years ago, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to drive performance across the three Coach brand pillars of product, stores, and marketing.", "Starting with product, where Coach has emerged as a house of modern fashion design. In retail, we continue to successfully expand our assortment of 1941 handbags, complemented by a broader offering of 1941 wallets and small leather goods, driving brand elevation and innovation across categories.", "We built upon leather craft through expanding our Tea Rose platform in impactful new color combinations in fashion embellishments like studs, fringe, and florals. We saw very strong customer appetite for the neon pink and black Tea Rose combination which performed well for this season.", "We also re-launched the Edie shoulder bag with functionality enhancements along with the new larger size, the Edie 42.", "In outlet, we followed up our exclusive holiday collection with new limited edition assortments for spring, inspired by our own rich brand heritage. We introduced the New York City Stories collection, featuring the City's skyline that inspires our team every day along with other playful and emotional New York City icons. This was followed by our Bonnie Cashin collection, featuring Coach's first Creative Director whose influence can still be seen in our brand today.", "Finally, we launched our floral collection inspired by our own 1941 collection with prints seen in our very first runway show at New York Fashion Week in September of 2015 and introduced last spring in retail. These playful patterns were featured on our best-selling leather goods along with our new petal shoulder bag and were extended throughout our dual-gender lifestyle categories, including ready-to-wear and footwear.", "The Coach outlet take on spring featured a whimsical floral message that leveraged our runway assets to great success and executions that were understandable and very appealing to the broader outlet consumer.", "On stores, we're continuing to establish our modern luxury concept globally, renovating and opening 50 locations during the quarter, including 17 in our directly-operated North America business, taking us to nearly 600 modern luxury locations globally across all channels. This is in line with our target to end the year with over 700 doors in the new format, representing the vast majority of our traffic.", "Consistent with the plan, these renovations have been driving comps which exceed the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. Of course, as we've said before, the in-store experience is a key component of our brand elevation strategy, which is based upon: first, differentiating the Coach experience through leather and craftsmanship; and secondly, developing personalized clienteling and customer events.", "I am delighted that our Mystery Shopper Scores, our key metrics that demonstrate how well we deliver our unique modern luxury experience, were up again in the third quarter at over 85% as compared to about 75% in last year's third quarter. In addition, it's great to see how clients are responding to our new leather services such as monogramming and leather conditioning, with new services such as unique emoji stamps and a customizable bag program being introduced throughout the year.", "Across the global fleet, there were 28 Craftsmanship Bars installed at the end of the third quarter and we expect to add about seven more by the end of the fiscal year. And our Made to Order Rogue custom bag service has been a resounding success at our Fifth Avenue Coach House.", "Also, after a successful Q2 North American rollout of Coach Journey, our innovative and interactive service training program, we expanded it in Q3 to include all our directly-operated stores in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, and South Korea, and are implementing it in China.", "We remain very excited about our global flagship focus. We view these stores as important retail and marketing investments for the Coach brand. Early in the quarter, we opened the Kuala Lumpur Pavilion flagship in Malaysia and opened our first flagship in Milan, Italy, during February Fashion Week, which was followed by our flagship in Florence, Italy.", "As noted, when we entered the fiscal year, one of our key strategic initiatives is elevating the Coach brand in North America wholesale channel. To this end, we've renovated 60 doors to-date and have continued to see positive results from our Shop Manager program.", "Importantly, through 1941, we've added new locations in top-tier specialty stores in North America and globally. At the same time, we have also rationalized our overall North America department store distribution, taking our door countdown by about 25% or by over 250 locations, as well as reducing promotional events in the channel.", "As you know, in the fall, we closed the first group of these locations, about 120, while the number of days on sale in department stores were reduced by about 40%. We closed the net of more than 140 during the third quarter and expect another few to be closed in the fourth quarter, while spring season to-date, February and March, our days on promotion, are down 35%.", "On the marketing front, for the first time at New York Fashion Week in February, we held a dual-gender runway show to significant critical acclaim. To this end, we were thrilled when Coach Creative Director, Stuart Vevers, was awarded the distinguished honor of 2017 Designer of the Year by the American Apparel & Footwear Association at the American Image Awards last week, and are equally excited that in his first year of eligibility, Stuart has been nominated for the CFDA Accessory Designer of the Year.", "As you know, we recently began working with Selena Gomez, the new face of Coach. The reaction on social media was instantaneous and electric, with her first two posts for Coach getting very high engagement, garnering nearly 5 million and 6 million likes, respectively, on Instagram.", "Our first events with Selena were in tandem with Step Up, an organization supported by our Coach Foundation focused on empowering young women from underserved communities and encouraging them to dream big. These events drove 1.7 billion impressions globally.", "She has also collaborated with Stuart on a custom handbag, which will be in our retail stores and select department locations globally later this fall. Most importantly, our first global handbag advertising campaign with Selena will hit in July and run through this fall/winter and will be followed by a second campaign in spring/summer 2018.", "As a result of these efforts, we are seeing continued progress with consumers. Importantly, in our North America quarterly brand tracking survey fielded in March, we saw strength with the broad premium market across key emotional and functional attributes, while discount perceptions, an important measure of brand health, declined once again this quarter.", "So as our plans unfold and the momentum continues to build, we are delighted with the progress and proud of all that our team has accomplished to drive Coach's transformation. The Coach brand is very much on its way to evolving from a specialty retailer and accessories brand to a true house of fashion design, defining modern luxury. We are excited to see our creative vision and direction gain traction and we'll continue to update you on these initiatives as we move forward.", "Turning now to a discussion of North American category trends. Clearly, the challenges impacting the category in specific and consumer spending in general have persisted in 2017. This volatility was evidenced throughout calendar 2016 impacted by the U.S. election in the fall and the significant strengthening of the dollar over the last several months.", "We estimate that the North American premium men's and women's bag and accessory market was again flat to up low-single-digits in the March quarter, which we believe has continued to be impacted by negative trends seen in U.S. department stores as brands, including ours, have pulled back from the channel.", "While Kevin will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market, starting with North America.", "As you read in our release, for the quarter, total North American Coach brand sales decreased 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis including the negative impact of our deliberate department store pullback.", "Direct sales declined 2% in the quarter. As a reminder, this decline was in line with our expectations, given the Easter shift, which hurt us in Q3 and will be a benefit in Q4, as well as the loss of the important post-Christmas week, which fell into our Q2 results this year.", "Importantly, the third quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comps in North America. Our bricks and mortar comps rose slightly over 3% in the quarter, driven by conversion and ticket, while traffic was down moderately.", "Overall, our aggregate comp was also up over 3% with e-commerce having a negligible impact on quarterly results.", "Finally, our business with international tourists in our North American stores was slightly lower during Q3, negatively impacting comp by under a point, with declines in Chinese tourist traffic once again mostly offset by other nationalities, notably Japanese and Korean visitors.", "Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. The penetration of the above $400 price bracket increased to over 55% of handbag sales in North America up from about 40% last year, and generated another positive comp on the sales in unit basis.", "The increase was driven from success in both Rogue and Swagger silhouettes. As planned, 1941 handbags represented about 40% of handbag sales in our top-tier retail stores. We also experienced strength in small bags and accessories driven by crossbodies, clutches, and wristlets, which offer a high level of versatility and functionality at compelling price points.", "Turning now to event marketing, our semi-annual sale concluded early in the quarter and we held our closed preferred customer offer in March, which anniversaried the same event last year, but excluded 1941, a significant part of our assortment as mentioned.", "In the fourth quarter, we would again expect to hold a short duration sale around Mother's Day and kickoff our semi-annual summer sale. Looking ahead to the balance of spring and early summer, our goal is to continue to elevate and differentiate the brand by offering innovation and emotion through our product assortment marketing and the in-store experience. We will also continue to work to position our assortment and Coach as a year-around gifting destination.", "Specifically, in retail, we will first, offer a compelling Mother's Day story anchored by Souvenir Embroidery, a fun and play-full platform with trend-right embroidered patches supported by a disruptive campaign. We also launched the Bowery Crossbody, a feminine and sharply-priced small bag with a delicate chain strap as the perfect gift for mom.", "Second, we launched Coach space, a fun and out of this world capsule that celebrates space exploration's role in the American imagination. We've created instantly iconic product that features bright and graphic space-themed patches on key 1941 silhouettes, including Dinky, Rogue, and the Saddle Bag.", "Third, we introduced the new Bandit Hobo, a wearable, soft and streamlined shoulder bag. The Bandit is a chic functional bag that highlights the natural drape of our beautiful leathers. Unique detailing includes a detachable interior pouch that can convert into a second bag, offering a premium two-in-one functionality.", "Finally, we will debut the Swagger Shoulder Bag 20, driving innovation below $400. The Swagger Shoulder Bag 20 is a sleek, sophisticated and on-trend addition to the iconic Swagger family that easily transitions from day to night.", "And for outlet, as we transition into summer, we are excited to launch a fresh take on our Mother's Day novelty assortment with gifting items across all price points and even offering personalized hang tags for mom on this special holiday.", "Starting in spring, we introduced an expanded assortment of hang tags, bag charms, and small leather accessories that drive impulse shopping and allow for fun personalization opportunities for all customers and for all occasions.", "Following Mother's Day, we will have a full launch of a Disney and Coach product collection for outlet; our largest ever collaboration in this channel, which will span all of women's and men's leather goods and lifestyle categories.", "We've taken inspiration from our best-selling retail styles from our successful collaboration with Disney a year ago, and translated them to a broader assortment for the outlet customer. Rounding out Q4, we will have our first ever Father's Day mailer as we introduce our new men's bond backpack and a range of exciting boxed gift items.", "And now, moving on to international results for the Coach brand. As noted in our release, in the third quarter, international Coach brand sales declined about 4% on a reported basis, including about 70 basis points of pressure related to currency translation. By geography, Greater China sales declined 2% versus prior-year in dollars and increased 2% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong growth and positive comps in Mainland China, partially offset by continued softness in Hong Kong and Macau.", "In Japan, sales rose 2% on a reported basis, while constant-currency sales decreased 1%, impacted by a decline in Chinese tourist spend as we have not yet fully lapped last year's dramatic increase.", "In our other directly-operated Asian Markets outside of China and Japan, namely South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, sales decreased low double-digits in dollars in constant currency.", "Our results were primarily impacted by continued softness in South Korea, where macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds have pressured spending from domestic consumers and tourists.", "In Europe, our directly-operated sales grew at a double-digit pace in constant currency during the quarter, while the wholesale business was negatively impacted as planned by a shift in shipment timing related to the change in fashion deliveries. This shift is expected to benefit Q4. Therefore, total sales in Europe increased slightly in constant currency and declined modestly in dollars.", "Finally, I would point out that we're continuing to see volatile results in our international wholesale businesses, which while small, are important to growing brand awareness. For the quarter, as planned, our sales declined double-digits on a net sales basis, impacted by shipment timing, which we expect to reverse in Q4. Sales also declined on a POS basis in Q3.", "In closing, we are proud of the progress we've made along our transformation journey and the evolving perception of the Coach brand and Coach, Inc., as we move from a specialty retailer to a house of modern luxury brands.", "Now I turn it over to our new CFO, Kevin Wills, for details on our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2017. Kevin?", "Kevin G. Wills - Coach, Inc.", "Thanks, Victor. It's a pleasure to be with you on my first Coach earnings call. Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the third quarter results, as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2017.", "Please note, the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results as well as a related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.", "Our overall financial performance in the third quarter was consistent with our expectations, despite the volatile backdrop. Our sales were down in the quarter, as projected, impacted by calendar shifts and the deliberate pullback in the department store channel in North America, as well as wholesale shipment timing internationally.", "That said, we drove positive comps for the Coach brand in North America and gross margin expansion in each reportable segment, while tightly controlling costs and continuing to invest in our brands.", "Taken together, we delivered another quarter of solid earnings growth. Importantly, our balance sheet remains extremely healthy with a clean inventory position and sufficient cash to support our strategic initiatives, while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend.", "Now, turning to the details, consolidated net sales totaled $995 million for the third quarter, a decrease of 4% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant-currency basis. In addition and as expected, the company's strategic decision to elevate Coach brand's positioning in the North American wholesale channel through a reduction in promotional events and door closures negatively impacted sales growth by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter.", "As expected, Coach brand sales decreased approximately 4% in aggregate, but increased in North America on a comp store basis. Stuart Weitzman brand sales rose 1%, while being negatively impacted by wholesale shipment timing.", "Consolidated gross profit totaled $706 million, a decrease of 1% versus prior year, while gross margin increased approximately 190 basis points to 70.9%. Coach brand gross profit decreased 2%, however, gross margin expanded 180 basis points over the prior year, including approximately 20 basis points of benefit from currency to 71.7%.", "Stuart Weitzman brand gross profit rose 8% and gross margin rate increased approximately 390 basis points over the prior year, reflective in part of channel mix, the benefit of currency and lower promotional levels.", "Total SG&A expenses decreased 3% to $544 million and represented 54.6% of sales as compared to 54.3% in the year-ago period. Coach brand SG&A expenses decreased 4% to $500 million and represented 54.6% of sales compared to 54.8% in the year ago period. Stuart Weitzman brand SG&A expenses were $44 million compared to $39 million a year ago, due to an increase in store occupancy costs associated with new openings, as well as the company's strategic investment in team and infrastructure.", "Consolidated operating income rose 7% to $162 million, while operating margin was 16.3%, an increase of 160 basis points versus prior year. Coach brand operating income increased 8%, while operating margin increased 200 basis points over the prior year to 17.1%. Stuart Weitzman brand operating income was $6 million or 6.9% of sales versus $7 million or 9.3% of sales in the prior year, reflecting key investments to support long-term multi-category growth, as discussed.", "Net interest expense was $4 million in the quarter as compared to $7 million in the year ago period. Total net income for the quarter increased 5% to $130 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.46, up 4% versus prior year.", "Now, moving to global distribution. In total, we closed five net Coach brand locations globally in the third quarter to end the period with 955 directly-operated locations worldwide. In addition, we ended the quarter with 82 Stuart Weitzman directly-operated locations, no change from the previous quarter.", "In fiscal year 2017, we continue to expect our Coach brand directly-operated square footage to grow low single-digits globally. This guidance assumes that Coach brand directly-operated square footage in North America will decline slightly with net store closures in both our retail and outlet locations. Internationally, we expect a mid to high single-digit increase in square footage.", "Finally, turning to Stuart Weitzman directly-owned, op distribution. Year-to-date, we've opened a total of seven net new locations and we expect to close one location in the fourth quarter.", "Moving on, net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $202 million compared to $199 million last year. Our CapEx spending was $70 million in Q3 versus $101 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $131 million versus $98 million in the same period last year.", "Inventory levels at quarter end were $479 million compared to ending inventory of $464 million a year ago, representing an increase of approximately 3% in support of planned sales growth in the fourth quarter.", "At the end of Q3, cash and short-term investments were $1.9 billion as compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. Our total borrowings outstanding were $592 million at the end of Q3 compared to $869 million a year ago, reflecting the paydown of our term loan in the first quarter, as previously discussed.", "Now, turning to our capital allocation policy, which has not changed. Our first priority is to continue invest in our brands in order to drive sustainable growth and value creation. Our second priority is strategic acquisitions, looking for great brands with opportunities for expansion. And third, returning capital to shareholders with a focus on dividends.", "As always, underpinning these priorities are our guardrails for allocating capital effectively, which are maintaining strategic flexibility, strong liquidity, and access to the capital markets.", "Now, let me address our outlook for fiscal year 2017 on a non-GAAP 52-week versus 52-week basis. We are maintaining our operational guidance for the year and continue to project revenue to increase at a low single-digit rate, including the impact of currency.", "This guidance continues to imply strong top line growth in Q4 on a 13-week versus 13-week basis, benefiting in part from the calendar and shipment timing shifts, which negatively impacted us in Q3.", "As a reminder, these impacts include the shift in the Easter and the inclusion of the week leading up to the July 4 holiday, as well as the shift in Coach International wholesale shipment timing due to the change in the delivery calendar in fiscal year 2017.", "Importantly, this guidance continues to assume at least a positive low single-digit comp for the Coach brand in North America for the year and in the fourth quarter. We also continue to project double-digit revenue growth for Stuart Weitzman for the year.", "We are maintaining our consolidated operating margin forecast of between 18.5% and 19% for fiscal 2017. This guidance incorporates the negative impact of both Stuart Weitzman and the strategic decision to elevate Coach brand positioning in the North American wholesale channel.", "We now expect the interest expense to be approximately $20 million for the year based on the lower interest expense actualized to-date. The full year fiscal 2017 tax rate is still projected at about 26%, with a return to a significantly higher tax rate in Q4 versus Q3, consistent with our typical cadence, and we continue to expect our average diluted shares outstanding for the year to be approximately $283 million.", "Taken together, we're still projecting double-digit growth in both net income and earnings per diluted share for the year. And we now expect consolidated CapEx to be approximately $300 million in fiscal year 2017.", "In closing, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and the consistency of our execution against the volatile backdrop, building on the successes we have achieved thus far in our transformation. Importantly, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 to be the year when we return to both revenue and earnings growth. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth for Coach, Inc. over the long-term.", "I'd now like to open it up for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the North American performance. Specifically, was there any variation between the full-price stores and the factory stores in terms of comp and if you could also just address you mentioned traffic, but any big variation on the traffic side on either segment would be helpful.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Good morning, Bob. Andre?", "Andre Cohen - Coach, Inc.", "Good morning, Bob. So as \u2013 we're pleased with the performance in both our channels actually and as you know, it's \u2013 we are starting to see the impact of the transformation taking hold. So in retail, brand innovation is really taking hold with the broader distribution, our $400 and above AUR bags are up on a comp basis. They represent more than 55% of our business.", "We're seeing in outlets as well innovation increasing with \u2013 taking inspiration from our own retail collections with, for example, last quarter, after all explosion that did very well. So, pleased across both channels. No major difference in traffic between channels.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you, Bob.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice quarter.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So Victor, you touched on the North America wholesale channel and the door closures that have taken place this year. Just kind of curious if you could give us how you're thinking about next fiscal year's potential feature door closures within the wholesale channel and then just tying that together, how could \u2013 are there any impacts on the Coach brand margin that we should keep in mind for next year, the trajectory of the Coach brand margin recovery? Thank you so much.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Sure. I'll ask Andre to speak a little bit about obviously the closures that we had talked about in our speakers' notes and thinking go forward.", "Andre Cohen - Coach, Inc.", "So by the end of this fiscal year, we would have closed about 250 doors. We continue to look at our wholesale channel and to pull out of doors that we feel don't make sense from our perspective and perspective of our partners and we want to continue to look at promotions very carefully and to partner with our department store wholesale partners to continue to reduce promotional pressure.", "In terms of margin, as you know, the wholesale businesses represent a very small part of Coach's overall business, so we don't see a material impact from that perspective.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you, Ike.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Schick with Consumer Edge Research.", "David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to build off of Bob's question around some of the tickets. So you've talked about the success of 1941, impressive mix, it's been I guess part of the store investments in clienteling, it's all coming together with the work you've been doing. Is there any more granularity or any other ways you can slice this than the above $400? We see the price points in the editorial that it's generating. Anything that could help us understand what's happening inside that business that's really doing well above $400 would be helpful.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Let me touch on that. Good morning, David. Certainly, look, there's been a tremendous level of innovation across full-price handbags and 1941. We've benefited from that. I think the consumer is perceiving the value at those price points which speaks to both design, quality of the leathers, and obviously make.", "And of course, as you mentioned, the total store experience with our sales teams benefiting tremendously from the Coach journey and modern luxury sales training that we've put in place and we've seen that impact our secret shopper scores as we mentioned in our speakers' notes, up from 75% about a year ago now to over 85%, which really speaks to consumers engaging, understanding the transformation.", "Certainly, as we go forward there is still opportunity for us to be innovative across the lower price points in the full price category. And I think you'll continue to see us, as we mentioned in the speakers' notes, work very hard to make our full-price business a year-around gifting destination with innovation across all price buckets.", "David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Thank you.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you, David.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great. Thanks. Good morning and welcome, Kevin. I guess my question is for Victor. You've made a number of key talent hires off-late, the Coach brand is tracking well. I would love if you could expand upon some of your comments you made earlier on building a customer-focused multi-branded portfolio. Could you just talk about kind of what's next and with the success of 1941, does that change or kind of impact your decision of brands that fit well within your portfolio? Thanks.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "We've been pretty consistent, Erinn. Obviously, we've talked just about great brands. I wouldn't comment any more specifically than the comments that we've laid out in our speakers' notes and what we've talked about in the past. Obviously, we're looking to leverage the strengths that we have as an organization whether that be our supply chain or whether that be, of course, our ability to develop and grow brands globally and leverage the teams that we have across the world who are very gifted and proven in growing brand at retail. At this point, I simply would not comment any further on acquisition activity and won't do so unless and until there's something specific to announce.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Congratulations. Victor, the people changes in the organization that you've created for the long time. The global business development and strategy role, what are some of the key priorities there, and why did you see the need for that role, it sounds like a nice opportunity. How do you think about Coach over the next 5 to 10 years? And just sort of a minor question, we were curious about how average unit costs trended and if there is anything we should know in terms how you are balancing the AUC and giving features to the customer in the context of innovation versus managing promotional levels prudently? Thank you.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you, Oliver. It was a bit difficult to hear you. But if I understood correctly, I think your first question was specifically on Ian and his role as President of Global Business Development. And then your second question was on AUCs. I'm going to ask Kevin in a minute to speak on AUCs.", "In terms of Ian's role, he'll play a very important role supporting both of our brands. We obviously believe that each brand has a very unique positioning. But there is an opportunity for us to leverage know how whether that be, of course, in relationships with our landlords globally, as well as working with licensee partners and others as we look to develop both the Stuart Weitzman and the Coach brand, and of course, any future acquisitions that we can make.", "It'll set us well to provide some leverage on the front end of the business as Ian partners with both the CEO of Stuart Weitzman, Wendy Kahn, as well, of course, as the CEO of the Coach brand, Josh Schulman, who joins us in June. A specific example of that, for example, could be in the case of Stuart Weitzman supporting that organization, the take-back of certain markets, which is a skill that obviously we have very strong experience in from past work that we've done at Coach and specifically which Ian has led in his career. Kevin?", "Kevin G. Wills - Coach, Inc.", "Sure. Good morning, Oliver. On the \u2013 if I understood your question around average unit costs and related to the margin versus the increased cost, obviously, there's a balancing act there as we are elevating part of the 1941 product. There's more cost that go into that, but we're balancing that. You think about the components of our bags whether it's the leather, the tanning, the hardware, each have their own individual kind of inflationary, deflationary factors. So it's a \u2013 again, it's a balance and we're looking that across the chain. And I think you're seeing that balance work itself out in our gross margin rate performance.", "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Best regards.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you, Oliver.", "Kevin G. Wills - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, guys, and let me add my congrats as well.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thanks, Anna.", "Kevin G. Wills - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Good morning. I'll follow up on Oliver's previous questions. Really strong results on the gross margin line. Maybe talk about expectations for the fourth quarter and just puts and takes on this line item as we think about 2018? And quickly also, what was the Easter shift headwind to the third quarter? Just trying to gauge the benefit to expect for 4Q? Thanks.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Sure. I'll let Kevin jump in on that one.", "Kevin G. Wills - Coach, Inc.", "Well, good morning, Anna. I think, we outlined basically our expectations for the balance of \u2013 for the full year and given the Q3 year-to-date results, you can see it affecting what we're expecting for the fourth quarter. We're continuing to expect improved performance in the fourth quarter.", "On the Easter shift, there's a number of, kind of, puts and takes on the sales line in the quarter. But that was probably about a, let's call it, around a point impact in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, as -imprecise size, but we'd estimate around a point in the gross margin. Probably we're not seeing improvement in the fourth quarter.", "Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Terrific. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the M&A strategy. More broadly speaking, a couple of quarters ago, I believe, you mentioned that one of the categories or criteria was you're trying to avoid turnaround situations. And I wanted to push you a little bit on this, especially given the transformation that you guys have executed for the Coach brand over the last few years, kind of, shrinking to grow, reducing proportionality, elevating the brand, bringing into more fashion and innovation globally. Is that a skill-set you think you can apply, especially, as you look across the landscape to other brands where that \u2013 where there might be a strong underlying brand asset, but there is a lot of struggle and challenges going through the evolution of all the changes that are happening at retail and wholesale channels and things like that. I wonder if it's something you think about a core competency having gone through what the company has gone through so successfully that you could apply in other similar branded situations in the global soft lines and accessory space? Thanks.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Good morning, Omar, and thanks for the question. Look, certainly, we have a very gifted and talented team. And obviously, with the work that we've done with Coach, this isn't our first transformation. There are folks in this company who have been here 20 years, 25 years, who have gone through this in the past with our first what one could consider our first transformation just prior to our IPO, and obviously also speaks to the fact that we have a great brand in Coach.", "Specific to your question around whether we're interested in turnarounds, first and foremost, Omar, we're looking for great brands, brands that have the potential for growth. Brand health and consumer perception for us is absolutely critical. We're not looking for brands that have, in essence, lost their way or need to be completely repaired or repositioned in the minds of consumers. Healthy brands that have a unique positioning and that certainly allow us to use the skill sets that you referred to, to diversify whether that be our consumer target or a specific consumer attitude or segments of the markets or perhaps the geography channel or category are what interests most and what we're most focused on. I think that Stuart Weitzman, of course, is an acquisition that we're extremely pleased with and is a good example of that.", "Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC", "Thank you, Victor. Good luck.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you, Omar.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Good morning and congratulations, everyone, and welcome, Kevin. As you think about the penetration to the over $400 price point now being 55% or so, where do you see that, and how do you see the portfolio price points emerging? And on marketing spend, it certainly is a big benefit. How do you see marketing spend contribution going forward and will there be other variances in marketing spend? Selena Gomez has been terrific and how do you see the events with her moving forward? Thank you.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Good morning, Dana. First, on Selena, we're really pleased, obviously, with our partnership so far. It's in its very, very early stages. And in fact, had a big day with Selena yesterday as she wore Coach for the Met Gala, and the play that we're seeing in both digital and traditional media, television to newspapers, magazines, and of course, all of their online channels, has been absolutely terrific, if not electric, in the last 24 hours.", "We expect Selena to really kick off, however, fully with the very first handbag campaign that will hit in July. That will then lead to through all the fall winter, and then later this year, we will be shooting the campaign for next spring-summer. And so we have a full year ahead really of activities and advertising that will hit, featuring Selena and, of course, leveraging her very, very extensive online following, where I believe today she's north of 116 million to 117 million followers on Instagram alone.", "As it refers to the above \u2013 and just to close on your marketing question, I would not expect total marketing dollars to change beyond what we are investing this year on a go-forward basis. In terms of the penetration on the above $400, Dana, I would not expect a significant additional growth in handbag AUR. Certainly, there's a potential for ticket growth as we launch other categories whether that be ready-to-wear, of course, our soft accessories and footwear becomes an increasingly important category for us as well.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird.", "Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I also wanted to follow-up on gross margin, really nice performance this quarter. Can you give us a sense of the outlet pricing environment and whether you think the tide is beginning to turn there? If so, what's driving it?", "And then bigger picture, Coach brand gross margin seems to be trending towards the higher end of that 69% to 70% range you've consistently discussed. So just wondering if you see potential for some upside there as we look into fiscal 2018 and any puts and takes we should be thinking about? Thank you.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "First, on outlet, I'll let Andre jump in and then Kevin will answer your question on total gross margin.", "Andre Cohen - Coach, Inc.", "So we haven't seen the outlet pricing environment improve. If anything, it's become more competitive, more promotional over the last couple of quarters at least. And we've tried to manage that basically through an increased pipeline of innovation.", "Kevin G. Wills - Coach, Inc.", "And Mark, this is Kevin. On the gross margin, obviously, we're not providing any outlook or guidance as it relates to 2018 at this point in time. So, no specific comments on that.", "However, as we've clearly articulated, we do see there's an opportunity to increase the operating margin of this business over time. And all the actions we're taking, we hope we'll be able to improve the bottom line. But no specific comments at this time relative to 2018.", "Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. Can I just ask you a quick modeling question and then a follow-up? Could you just help us bottom line where you think reported revenues land in the fourth quarter? I think with all the shifts going on between the third quarter and the fourth quarter and the extra week, there's a bit of confusion on \u2013 I'd hate to get off the call without having a clear idea of where we're headed. I think the 53rd week is maybe a two-point headwind to the year in the fourth quarter. But maybe beyond that, can you just help us clarify on where you think the fourth quarter trend revenue \u2013 reported revenue would land?", "Kevin G. Wills - Coach, Inc.", "Sure, Michael. This is Kevin. Obviously, as you noted there's some puts and takes with some of the timing. At a top line level, I would say somewhere around plus mid-single digits versus the 13-week reported basis in 2016, which was at $1.070 billion. I wasn't here, but I know in the press release last year in the fourth quarter, we did call out the impact of the 53rd week on the revenue, and it was around $84 million, and I believe about $0.07 a share. So between those two, I believe, you would be able to back end an approximate number.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And if I could ask one quick follow-up. Victor, I know at the Analyst Day, it was a long time ago, and the category was much different than it is today, but you guys highlighted where you saw the Coach brand margins could go at that time into best-in-class in the category I think was high 20s% with an year-mark.", "I know we beat this up with \u2013 several analysts asking about this quarter and past quarters. It is leaving us a little bit off balanced, not having some kind of a north star to think about for that brand. And obviously, the category is very volatile. But can you just help us with how you see the profitability of the brand evolving over the next few years? Where you think best-in-class should land in the categories you guys are in with the brand and the position where you're at today and the price points where you're at today?", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Sure. First and most importantly, we expect to drive operating leverage in the Coach brand and our sales growth beyond 2017. As you suggested at our Analyst Day, we guided that Coach brand will get back to best-in-class by 2019. And at this juncture, given the lack of visibility in the current environment, putting a specific number out there for what best-in-class will be two years down the road would simply be an exercise in fall's precision.", "Look, of course, both Coach brand and Coach, Inc. today continue to evolve in terms of our channel mix, geographic mix, our category mix as we bring footwear and other categories in-house to become a more important part of our business. And it's very likely that we will be a very different company by 2019. Our focus has been and will continue to be overall profitable growth and operating margin dollars.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Very helpful. Thanks.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research.", "Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC", "Good morning. Let me add my congratulations and congratulations to Stuart for the recognition.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC", "You're welcome. My question is on inventory at the end of the June, at the end of the fourth quarter. How should we think about that given there's layering in a little bit more higher AUC product for 1941. And then, if you could quickly comment on outlet. It sounds like there was a little bit better quality of sales, so the overall competitive and promotional environment at outlet relative to the holiday coming out of that one was very challenging? Thank you very much.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Sure. I'll let Andre speak to outlets, and then Kevin will speak to total inventory.", "Andre Cohen - Coach, Inc.", "We were pleased with our performance in outlets in Q3, again, driven mostly by product innovation. Frankly, we haven't seen an improvement in the competitive environment at all compared to Q2. It's remained as promotional, if not more so, than in Q2.", "Kevin G. Wills - Coach, Inc.", "On the inventory level, we feel very good about where we ended the quarter. Obviously, we've commented on sales expectations for the fourth quarter. So, we believe inventory is in line with our sales expectation and certainly from a currency and content perspective, we feel good about the inventory.", "Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC", "Great. Thank you very much. Great job on the product. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question this morning. Our final question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great, thanks. I'll add my congrats as well.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you, Brian.", "Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I guess curious between -thanks \u2013 the 1941 collection and then Selena Gomez. Are those two very distinct customers you're trying to get into the door? Are you seeing, on the 1941 side, customer reactivation from older \u2013 Coach customers, are they new customers?", "And on the Selena side, is to bring back the millennials? Just trying to think about how you're going to balance those two barbell thoughts. And then on the category, what do you think it's going to take to resume a mid-single digit category growth kind of number. Is it we need to get past these wholesale pullbacks? Is it AURs? What it is going to take you think for the category to resume mid-single digits?", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Sure. First on your question on 1941 and Selena, they're not, definitely not looking at different strategies if you will, both intended to drive brand relevance and engagements across a broad consumer. In the case of 1941, our initial strategy was very much focused on engaging the upper end of the wholesale channel, both here in North America and in Europe. But we're really pleased with the engagement that we're seeing in our entire full price fleet with all of Coach consumers, both lapsed and new consumers coming into the brand.", "The Selena strategy is very much about bringing the transformation message, leveraging, of course, a very strong digitally engaged celebrity across her channels as well as our own channels, not only here in North America but globally and bringing more awareness of what we're doing to that broader consumer. Her collaboration with Stuart on the handbag, which launches this fall and a couple of other small items that we're very excited about should help us as well. It is priced at a sharper price points. And then the traditional 1941 collection in handbags, which has been above $500 and the Selena handbag will be below $500.", "On the category in mid-single digits, I think the \u2013 look, the most certainly pullback in department stores is one key factor. There's no doubt about that. And once we see some of the cross-channel tensions, if you will, settle, one would expect the category to grow more robustly. I think at the end of the day, it's going to come down to innovation. It's going to come down to consumers engaging with great brands and everything that we're doing is very, very much focused on that. What I would share as I've shared with all of you very consistently. I just don't feel that there is a better category in the fashion space to be in as handbags and accessories continues to be the category that consumers use most as an investment item to express their individuality and everything that we're doing is focused on playing a leadership role in this space.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you. That will conclude our Q&A. Victor, over to you for some closing remarks.", "Victor Luis - Coach, Inc.", "Thank you, Andrea. As has become our custom, I just want to close by congratulating our global teams, both within the Coach and the Stuart Weitzman brands for all of their hard work and dedication to our brands and to our consumers. I could not be prouder of them and their commitment for continuing to drive innovation, strong engagement with our consumers across the globe and excellence in execution of our strategy. And it's truly thanks to them that I remain incredibly confidence in our future as a house of consumer-led brands that is focused on innovation and long-term sustainable growth.

We now have the key leadership and design talent to drive long-term performance both in growing the global footwear category and in Stuart Weitzman\u2019s nascent accessories business.", "And as you know, we also took a major step in our corporate transformation with the acquisition of Kate Spade & Company which closed in July, becoming the first New York based house of modern luxury lifestyle brands. Kate Spade brings a unique brand attitude and additional consumer segments to the Coach, Inc. portfolio. We expect that this acquisition will enhance our position in the attractive and growing 80 billion global premium handbag and accessories footwear and outerwear market.", "After the last three years of our transformation and acquisitions, the three brands of Coach, Inc. are today united in a common philosophy, first, driven by brand led strategies that focus on the consumer and on an inclusive approach to luxury; second, a focus on innovation across product, marketing and experiences both in our stores and in our digital channels.

We have a significant opportunity to grow our business in lifestyle categories, notably in men\u2019s through continued growth in bags and small other goods, as well as in our dual-gender offerings of footwear and outerwear.", "We are particularly excited to launch the new Coach women's footwear assortment both in our stores and in the wholesale channel, following the take back of our license at the end of FY \u201917. Even within our core category of women's leather goods, we have the potential to fulfil many more of our customer\u2019s functional and occasional needs across price points and attitudes.", "A key element of this strategy will be adding renewed excitement and diversification in our product offering notably in the $300 to $400 handbag price point in retail. We will also look to focus innovation in our customer experience by expanding our personalization and luxury leather services both across our store and e-commerce platforms.", "We believe that we have an opportunity to build a relationship focused sales culture, anchored by our modern luxury selling ceremony to deepen the bond between our associates and customers, ultimately driving frequency of purchase of brand loyalists and new customer acquisition.", "Of course, we still have room to grow the Coach brand geographically, notably in Europe which is largely untapped and in China which still has significant potential both from a domestic and travel retail perspective, as well as a new market such as Russia and India through distributor partners.", "And finally, in Coach Brand marketing we are particularly excited about our work with Selena Gomez with the fall campaign heading now and her namesake bag arriving in stores at the end of the month.", "Moving to Stuart Weitzman, we expected to drive double-digit growth as we evolve the brand identity across all consumer touch points under the leadership of CEO Wendy Kahn and Creative Director, Giovanni Morelli.", "This includes defining unique brand codes, differentiating the brand from the competitive set. Giovanni and the team are focused on launching the new creative direction for Stuart Weitzman, including Giovanni\u2019s first footwear collection in April 2018 and a new handbag collection and for winter of 2018.

At the brand level, our focus remains on delighting customers in the distinctly Kate Spade way, full of color and playful sophistication.", "Since we announced a deal in May, I've enjoyed getting to know more about the Kate Spade brand, team and culture. We are excited that Kate has significant opportunity for global growth across channels and geographies, while ensuring that we take the right brand enhancing actions early on to manage discount impressions in the market.", "What we know today is that Kate Spade is a strong unique brand with leadership and the attributes of fashionable, fun and feminine bringing, important attitude and customer diversification to the Coach portfolio.", "Our research has shown very little overlap between our three brands with Kate having the most traction with millennials. It is a brand with highly productive retail and outlet stores and a strong top tier department store presence in North America.", "Outside of the US, there is significant opportunity in Japan, the second largest handbag and accessory market in the world and where the brand already has a strong presence, but it's still under penetrated.", "We're also really pleased with the initial response to Kate Spade in the UK market and excited about the long-term growth opportunities in China, where our initial brand tracker shows promise and consumer traction for the brand.", "As we look ahead for Kate Spade in FY \u201918, we are taking several steps to position the brand, building a foundation for solid and sustainable growth and taking a page or two from Coach's own playbook.", "We were significantly curtail promotional impressions by reducing surprise sales and pulling back on wholesale disposition. We will also accelerate innovation in the core handbag and accessories categories, along with ready-to-wear and tech leveraging the Coach Inc. supply chain and product development capabilities.", "We will review the store fleet and leverage opportunities to maximize the brand's global footprint, notably in the outlet channel where the brand is under penetrated. We will wind down Jack Spade brand, refocus the license portfolio and concentrate on the most significant women's opportunities, women's handbags, ready-to-wear, tech accessories and footwear, both domestically and internationally. And we will tailor the brands whimsical and fun marketing messages ensuring that it resonates in all key global markets.", "I am excited to partner with the terrific Kate Spade team as Interim CEO, as we look to both capture synergies and more importantly drive global resonance and growth.", "Now as has been our practice, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken to drive Coach Brand performance. Starting with product, where I am pleased and proud to say that Coach has been recognized as a house of modern fashion design with Stuart Vevers winning the CFDA Accessories Designer of the year award in June.", "In retail, [Technical Difficulty] continued to block brand elevation increasing the penetration of 1941, as well as innovation across price points and attitude. In Q4, outlet delivered our largest brand collaboration to date with Mickey [ph] arriving in mid-May at twice the size of our successful Peanuts collaboration.", "On stores, in the fourth quarter we\u2019ve continued to establish our modern luxury concept globally ending the year with just over 720 locations in the new format across all channels and in line with our target.", "Consistent with the plan, these renovations have been driving comps, which exceed the balance of the fleet in the vast majority of stores around the world. As you know, one of our key strategic initiatives during a FY \u201817 was elevating the Coach Brand in North America wholesale channel.", "We've added new locations in top tier specialty stores, while also rationalizing our overall department store distribution, taking our door count down by about 25% to just over 750 at year end. In addition, we reduced promotional events in the channel with our days on sale down by over 35% for the year.", "On the marketing front, Selena Gomez's first global handbag advertising campaign for the Coach Brand hit in July and will run through this fall/winter followed by a second campaign in spring summer 2018.", "Following a global PR burst around Selena and Coach in late June, our multi-touch point media and owned channel marketing launched on July 6th, focused on driving awareness engagement and recruitment.", "Through the end of July, we achieved 2.5 billion impressions, an uptick in recruitment across social channels and a significant increase in North America web traffic. As a result of all these efforts, we are seeing continued progress with consumers, importantly in our quarterly US new brand tracking surveys fielded in June, we saw strength for the Coach brand with a broad premium market across key emotional and functional attributes.", "While this comp perceptions, an important measure of brand health declined versus prior year once again this quarter. In addition, among category drivers, Coach's perception of having high quality handbags increased. Moving forward with the addition of Kate Spade we will have much more to share with you as a house of brands.", "Turning now to a discussion of category trends. As we look ahead to FY \u201918, we expect that the channel, consumer and macro dynamics that exist today affecting the category in specific and consumer spending in general will persist.", "Channel shifts continued to impact traffic. The macroeconomic environment is uncertain. Currency cross-winds are affecting tourist flows and geopolitical events are negatively impacting sentiment. As a result, visibility into category growth is limited as the landscape continues to rapidly shift.", "Overall, we estimate that the North America premium women's and men's handbag and accessories market was essentially flat in the June quarter and for the year, which we believe has continued to be impacted by negative trends seen in the US department store space, as brands, including our own have pulled back from the channel. As in FY \u201916, we saw men\u2019s grow faster than women\u2019s in North America.", "Globally, the premium handbag and accessory category accelerated in FY \u201917, both on the US dollar and local currency basis, up mid single digits. While Kevin will provide additional details on sales and distribution by geography, we wanted to touch on some current trends and strategies by market.", "All the compares are against last year's 13 week period, thereby excluding the 14th or 53rd week. Starting with North America. As you read in our release for the quarter our total Coach Brand sales rose 4%, including the negative impact of our deliberate department store pullback.", "While our direct business rose 5% on a dollar basis and 6% in constant currency, over [Technical Difficulty] over 4% in the quarter. Higher conversion drove the overall comp with in-store traffic trends significantly improving from third quarter, reflecting the Easter shift though still slightly negative.", "Most importantly in the fourth quarter we comped the comp, given that the fourth quarter of FY \u201816 was the first positive quarterly comp we achieved post the implementation of our transformation plan.", "Finally, our business with international tourists in North American stores was slightly lower during Q4, negatively impacted by under a point with declines in Chinese tourist traffic once again mostly offset by other nationalities, notably Japanese and Korean visitors.", "Now turning to our retail performance and the metrics we traditionally share on product. The above $400 price bracket rose and penetration, saw another positive comp on sales and unit basis and represented over 45% of handbag sales, up from about 40% in last years fourth quarter.", "We also experienced strength in small bags and accessories, driven by cross-parties, clutches and wristlets, which offer a high level of versatility and functionality at compelling price points.", "The four, our below $300 penetration was similar to prior year with the biggest shift out of the $300 to $400 handbag price bracket of focused innovation in the quarters ahead.", "Men's was very strong in the fourth quarter at almost 20% of total Coach Brand sales.", "For the fiscal year, at POS our men\u2019s sales totalled over $840 million and we now believe men's is well over a $1 billion opportunity for the Coach Brand. To this end, I am very pleased to welcome Cristiano Cathy [ph] previously President of Jack Spade to the Coach brand as SVP, Head of Men's.", "In this newly created role, he will be responsible for men\u2019s global merchandising and bringing together the teams from design, product development, wholesale sales and marketing to amplify our investment in this tremendous business opportunity.", "As we look ahead to fall to Coach Brand, in retail our goal is to continue to elevate and differentiate the brand by offering innovation and emotion through our product assortment, marketing and in-store experience. We will expand 1941 Rogue family through introduction of additional size offerings and further refresh our leather craft assortment across price points and functions. Looking ahead to fall in outlet, we are excited to launch Coach Vivo [ph] City just in time for back-to-school shopping.", "Overall for FY \u201818 in outlet, while we continue to update and elevate our leather goods assortment with new silhouettes every season, we are excited to grow our women's and men's lifestyle categories with more frequent deliveries of ready-to-wear newness and an expanded footwear collection.", "And in men\u2019s, we plan on continued growth through expansion across all categories, capitalizing on the strong momentum from our men's growth seen in FY \u201917. Most generally and across all channels globally, we are very excited about the introduction of Coach own branded women's footwear after taking back the license at the end of FY \u201817.", "For perspective, the global women's and men's premium footwear market is approximately $28 billion and growing with women's representing about two thirds of the total. We are starting with a focused and curated offering of about 100 skews for pre-fall with limited wholesale distribution of about 120 wholesale doors. We are building into pre-spring and spring for about 100 to about 175 skews with a more dressy assortment and look to grow distribution from there.", "We will be using key Coach codes, such as Shadow Elks [ph] Shearling, Charms, metal Horse and Carriage branding. In addition, we will incorporate proprietary craftsmanship details such as the Tea Rose and Studding, which we\u2019ve become known for and building on styles and classifications where we already have seen some traction.", "We are focused on three key areas, introducing proprietary design elements, establishing brand codes in the category and perfecting fit and comfort by leveraging learning\u2019s from Stuart Weitzman.", "And now moving on to international. In the fourth quarter international Coach Brand sales rose 6% on a reported basis and 9$ on a constant currency basis benefiting from wholesale shipment timing as projected. For the year, Coach Brand international sales increased 3% in dollars and 2% in constant currency.", "Greater China sales increased 3% versus prior year in dollars and 7% in constant currency on a 13 week basis, driven by double-digit growth and positive comparable store sales on the Mainland offset in part by softness in Hong Kong and Macau.", "For the year, Greater China sales were about even with prior year in dollars, while sales rose 5% on a constant currency basis in 2017. Importantly and despite a rapidly evolving retail landscape, we remain optimistic on the prospects [Technical Difficulty] as the drivers we have consistently mentioned remain relevant and our China team continues to do an excellent job of building our brand equity in that market.", "In Japan sales declined 3% in dollars and approximately 1% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. For the year, sales increased 4% in dollars and decreased 2% on a constant currency basis impacted by a decline in Chinese tourists spend lapping last year's dramatic increase, as well as an overall decrease in square footage as we optimized our retail footprint.", "In our other directly operated Asian markets outside of China and Japan, mainly South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia sales decreased mid-single digits in dollars and declined similarly in constant currency for both quarter in the year, due primarily to weakness in Korea where macro-economic and geo-political headwinds continued to pressure spending from domestic consumers and tourists.", "In Europe, we experienced a strong increase in sales during 4Q \u201817 driven by double-digit growth in directly operated channels and benefiting from planned shift in wholesale shipment timing as previously announced. For the year, sales rose approximately 15% in dollars and 20% in constant currency.", "Finally, I would point out that we're continuing to see volatile results in our international wholesale business, which increased on a net sales basis in the quarter due to shipment timing as expected while POS sales declined. For the year, net sales increased modestly and sales at POS decreased as weaker tourist location results offset domestic growth.", "In closing, we are encouraged with the momentum of our business and proud of the progress we've made along our transformation journey elevating the perception of Coach Brand globally. Of course, we're also very pleased with the integration and performance of Stuart Weitzman as we strengthened the leadership team and positioned the company for long-term growth across geographies and categories.", "And for Kate Spade, we look forward to unlocking the brand's potential and updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.", "Now I'll turn it over to our CFO Kevin Wills for details on our financial results and guidance for fiscal 2018.

Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results, as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2018.", "Please note the comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results, corresponding GAAP results, as well as a related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today.", "Now turning to the details and focusing on Coach Inc. Net sales totalled $1.13 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, as compared to $1.15 billion in the prior year, excluding the additional week included in fiscal 2016 results, net sales increased 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis.", "For the year, net sales totalled $4.4 9 billion even with the prior year, excluding the additional week included in fiscal 2016 results, net sales increased 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis. As planned, the company's strategic decision to elevate the Coach Brand\u2019s positioning in the North American wholesale channel through a reduction in promotional events and/or closures negatively impacted sales growth by approximately 60 basis points and 150 basis points in the fourth quarter in fiscal year 2017 respectively.", "Gross profit in fourth quarter totalled [Technical Difficulty] while the gross margin rate for the quarter was 66.8% compared to 67.8% last year. As expected, we experienced a year-over-year decline in gross margin in the quarter, specifically channel mix which was a benefit in the first nine months of the year negatively impacted gross margin in the quarter. In addition, as we're now anniversary lower product cost this benefit did not fully offset the ongoing negative impact resulting from promotional activity, notably the North America outlet channel, where the environment remains very competitive.", "Coach Inc. gross profit for the year totalled .$3.08 billion, while gross margin was 68.7% compared to 68% in the prior year. SG&A expenses totalled $577 million in Q4 or 50.9% of sales, as compared to 52.7% in the year ago period.", "For the year, SG&A expenses were $2.27 billion and represented 50.6% of sales as compared to 50.7% a year ago. As noted in our press release, SG&A expense for both Q4 and full year 2017 included $20 million in non-cash charges relating to the impairment of select stores and a negotiated reduction in a prior purchase commitment for certain store fixtures that we deem no longer appropriate.

Net interest expense was $19 million in fiscal year \u201917, as compared to $27 million in fiscal year \u201816.", "The effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, as compared to 24.7% in the prior year quarter. For the year, effective tax rate was 23.2% versus 26.4% in fiscal 2016. Our tax rate will vary throughout the year given the diversity of our sales base and resolution of various tax issues. To this end, our fourth quarter tax rate benefited from the geographic mix of earnings.", "Net income for the quarter totalled $142 million compared to $126 million a year ago with earnings per diluted share $0.50. Net income for the year totalled $609 million compared to $552 million last year with earnings per diluted share of $2.15.", "Excluding the additional week in fiscal 2016, earnings per diluted share increased 32% and 13% for the quarter and full year respectively.", "Now moving to global distribution of the brand. For the Coach Brand we opened seven net locations globally in fourth quarter and eight net locations during the year, finishing fiscal year \u201817 with 962 directly-operated locations worldwide.", "Overall and consistent with plan, our global Coach Brand directly-operated square footage rose low-single-digits in fiscal year \u201817, with North America square footage down slightly versus the prior year with net store closures in both retail and outlet offset by higher single-digit square footage increase in international, led by growth in Europe and Mainland China.", "For Stuart Weitzman, consistent with our plan, we closed one location in the fourth quarter , while opened up six net locations for year, ending fiscal year \u201817 with 81 directly-operated stores globally.", "Now turning to our cash flows.

At the end of the fiscal year, cash and short term investments were $3.1 billion, as compared to $1.3 billion a year ago.

Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, we borrowed $1.1 billion in term loans, which combined with cash on hand allowed us to fully fund the acquisition of Kate Spade, which closed on July 11th.", "Now turning to our capital allocation policy. Our long-term priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to invest in our brands in order to drive sustainable growth and value creation. Secondly, we will seek strategic acquisitions looking for great brands with opportunities for expansion. And finally, returning capital to shareholders with a focus on dividends.", "Since outlined on these priorities some years ago, our strong balance sheet has provided flexibility to invest in the Coach Brand transformation, successfully acquire two great brands in Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade with modest leverage, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.", "Moving forward, we remain committed to a conservative balance sheet management. To that end, we expect to reduce outstanding borrowings to $1.9 billion by the end of fiscal 208, with a repayment of $800 million six-month term loan with excess cash. At the same time, we\u2019re maintaining our dividend at an annual rate of a $1.35.", "Now turning to fiscal 2018. As we look to fiscal 2018 it will clearly be a year of change as we integrate the Kate Spade business. One of those changes will be our reportable segments. Given the acquisitions Kate Spade and move to brand president reporting structure, we are shifting to reportable segments by brand.", "This is consistent with how we have organized the company and how we will operate our business. With this change beginning in fiscal 2018, we plan to drive global brand comps. In addition, given the significant evolution of the company from a mono-brand specialty retailer when we announced our transformation plan in 2014 to a house of brands today, the guidance provided over three years ago is no longer applicable to current business and structure.", "Going forward, we will provide annual guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call for the year ahead. As always, we remain committed to transparency and providing you with information to track our progress against our plans.", "During fiscal 2018, we will naturally incur a number of integration and one-time charges associated with Kate Spade acquisition. I will provide more details on these expected charges in a few moments. But note, that these charges will be excluded from our non-GAAP results. Additionally, the Kate Spade results will be included in the Coach Inc. results starting on July the day subsequent to closing.", "Now turning to our outlook on a non-GAAP basis. We expect total revenues for Coach Inc. in fiscal 2018 to increase about 30% versus fiscal 2017 to $5.8 billion to 5.9 billion with low single digit organic growth. This includes the expectation for low single digit Coach Brand global comps and a low double-digit increases Stuart Weitzman brand sales.", "In addition, we expect the acquisition of Kate Spade to add over $1.2 billion in revenue. The Kate Spade revenue projection includes the impact of a planned strategic pullback in the wholesale disposition and online flash channels and assumes a high single digit decrease in comps for the fiscal year.", "In addition, we are projecting operating income growth of 22% to 25% versus fiscal 2017 driven by mid single digit organic growth, the acquisition of Kate Spade and estimated synergies of $30 million to $35 million. These synergies are expected to offset in part the reduction in profitability from the strategic and deliberate pullback of the Kate Spade wholesale disposition and online flash sales channels.", "Taken together, the Kate Spade business and resulting synergies are expected to add approximately $130 million $140 million to operating income. We have owned Kate Spade for just over a month and have been working diligently to identify synergy opportunities.", "To-date, we are very pleased with our findings as we expects to realize approximately $30 million to $35 million of fiscal year \u201818 synergies, which annualized to run rate synergies of approximately $50 million. This compares with their original expectation of annualized run rate synergies of $50 million by the third year post the acquisition. Much work remains on synergy front and we look forward to updating you on our longer term opportunities in the quarters ahead.", "Interest expense is expected to be about $90 million for the year. The full year fiscal 2018 tax rate is projected at about 25% to 26%. As noted in our press release, in fiscal year \u201818 the company is adopting Accounting Standard Update, ASU 2016-09 for accounting of employee share-based payments. This will influence our effective tax rate as certain tax impacts that were previously recorded to equity will now be included in income tax expense.", "Further, .because the tax impacts are defined by the company\u2019s stock price, Restricted Stock Units or RSUs and Performance Restricted Stock Units or PRSUs vesting and when employees exercise their stock options, the timing and amount of the impact cannot be estimated and are therefore excluded from this guidance. That said, the majority of RSUs and PRSUs vest in the first quarter of the fiscal year and accordingly it is likely that first quarter fiscal rate could be most impacted.", "We expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year to be approximately 289 million. Overall, we are projecting earnings per diluted share for the year in the range of $2.35 to $2.40, an increase of about 10% to 12%, including low-to-mid single-digit accretion from the acquisition of Kate Spade consistent with our previously communicated forecast. We also expect our CapEx for Coach Inc. to be approximately $325 million in fiscal \u201918.", "As previously noted, we will be incurring a number of integration and one-time charges associated with Kate Spade acquisition and integration. These charges will include such items as transaction fees and integration costs, which includes severance, store closure cost and inventory valuation adjustments. We expect $40 million to $45 million related to acquisition transaction this estimate for integration charges remains working process at this time and we can\u2019t anticipates pretax charges to be in $150 million $200 million range in fiscal 2018, with approximately $35 million being non-cash. Additionally, we expect to incur approximate $10 million in operational efficiency charges.", "Now turn to our debt and capital structure. Post the Kate Spade acquisition, our total debt was approximately $2.7 billion. As previously noted we intend to repay our $800 million six-month term loan with cash on hand and end 2018 with $1.9 billion of debt.", "We remain committed to a conservative capital structure and moderate leverage and based on free cash flow and cash on hand we may elect to further reduce indebtedness by prepaying long-term bank debt.", "Finally, our fiscal year \u201818 directly operated distribution plan by brand is as follows. We expect 15 net closures globally for Coach Brand with net closures in North America and Japan, partially offset by net openings in Europe and Mainland China.", "We expect approximately five net Stuart Weitzman openings in fiscal year \u201918, and for Kate Spade we expect 20 to 25 net openings globally and across channels with majority of new door growth coming in the outlet channel. As you know, these net openings were partially offset the reduction in online [ph] flash and wholesale disposition as we build the foundation for long-term brand health.", "It is important to note that due to the Kate Spade acquisition, we expects significant variability between quarters throughout the year and across all financial metrics based on the implementation of strategic initiatives and realization of synergies, as well as the variability in brand and channel mix, as well as currency.", "Taken together, we expect these factors to have the most significant negative impact on firs quarter, resulting in mid-to-high single-digit declines in operating income versus fiscal 2017. We expect to deliver double-digit operating income growth in quarters two, three and four, pattern to be uneven in fiscal 2018, we expect to realize annual operating income growth of 22% to 25% as previously mentioned.", "Similarly, we would expect a higher inventory to sales ratio that has been our recent history due to elevated inventory levels at Kate Spade. We will protect the brand by not moving excess inventory into the disposition market but rather primarily flow into our own network into the second half of the year. Therefore, we would expect inventory to sales ratio to improve as we move through fiscal 2018.", "In closing, we will grow both our Coach and Stuart Weitzman brands in the year ahead, while successfully integrating Kate Spade, which we expect o be accretive to our fiscal 2018 results. Overall, we remain optimistic about global opportunities and we are committed to driving long-term sustainable growth across our portfolio of our brands.", "I\u2019d now like to open it up for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.", "Christian Buss", "Yes. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations for Kate Spade in international markets in the near term. How much are you willing to push that business going forward?", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Christian. We're very excited about Kate Spade brand and its international opportunity. Look, just comparing with Coach Inc. where we are in the four key global markets, first and foremost of course, there's tremendous opportunities still here in the U.S. We got a brand that basically is in a 178 locations relative to our 400 as you heard, on our speakers notes we definitely see opportunity to manage the outlet channel more proactively here in North America. So that's one.", "And then is the three key international markets, Japan, China and Europe, we see tremendous opportunity. The brand is more mature in the Japanese market where there are 88 locations, relative to where Coach is for example with a 180, 184-5 locations, we definitely see an opportunity in that market and then in Europe and in China we\u2019re especially excited because we're in our infancy in Europe. There are seven locations, Kate's doing really well in the U.K where it just getting its footing if you will with the first seven locations in UK and Ireland and then one location, six in the U.K. and Ireland, one location in Paris, but especially excited by the initial results there.", "And then in China, we are today in approximately with a distributor partner at 33 locations relative to 175 to 180 for the Coach Brand. And we see an opportunity of course to grow our awareness in all of these markets, as an example here in the U.S. Kate\u2019s unaided awareness is 31% relative to Coach\u2019s 71% and in Japan which is the second largest market in the world for us and indeed for Kate and for the category, Kate\u2019s awareness is 15% unaided relative to Coach\u2019s 51%. So we're very focused on the international opportunity. And I think you'll hear a lot about that in the quarters ahead.", "Christian Buss", "Great. Thank you very much and best of luck.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.", "Bob Drbul", "Hi, good morning. I guess the question is, could you elaborate a little bit more on the traffic results you know, for the Coach business, both full line and outlet and how the quarter progressed and how do you see the fall progression?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. I'll let Josh jump in. I'll take that question. Overall Bob we've been seeing very consistent traffic trends over the last few quarters. More or less, I would say in the negative single digits range. Obviously we've been driving the business through conversion, great product and pretty consistent across both channels with maybe the full price store suffering a little bit more from the traffic perspective than the outlet channel.", "Bob Drbul", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn Murphy", "Great, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could unpack a little bit more about the reversal of gross margin in the fourth quarter. I think you highlighted channel mix and then you talked about [indiscernible] outlet. Could you just speak a little bit more about - what how much those impacted the margin in the quarter?", "And then was there any impact from the [indiscernible] license take back in Q4, is that going weigh on gross margins in fiscal \u201918? Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "Sure. And I'll let Kevin take that.", "Kevin Wills", "Good morning, Erinn. Few components I guess on the gross margin change, as we said on our Q3 call in May we didn't expect the fourth quarter gross margin to contract given that we began anniversarying some of the product cost benefits that drove the gross margin expansion in quarter one and three.", "We did achieve some cost reductions in Q4, but at a lower level as compared to the prior quarters and it was not sufficient enough to offset the promotional activity which basically stayed approximately same as in prior quarters. We also had expected to reduce the outlet promotion based on some innovations in product that we had put in the channel, however due to [audio break] products not fully resonating what consumers expected we did not [indiscernible] the promotions as planned.", "We also felt like that we missed a little bit on logo product and as we observed during the fourth quarter a broad emerging trend towards more logo products, which were going to be getting into as we move into the second quarter of this year.", "And as you noted, we did have some FX impact in channel mix and what we're seeing in the gross margin on [indiscernible] also note that as we move into fiscal \u201818 we do expect a year-over-year decrease in margin rate with more pressure in the first half with a significant majority of this year-over-year decline being attributable to Kate Spade business which runs at a lower gross margin rate.", "As it relates to the [indiscernible] question that will be a negative impact to the gross margin rate as we move into \u201918 as we come in earlier. That was a last year\u2019s business previously that was effectively 100% [audio break] about a little bit of headwinds as we move into fiscal \u201918, but we certainly think it\u2019s the right strategic long-term decision for us.", "Erinn Murphy", "Got it. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.", "Ike Boruchow", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Kevin just was wondering if you could give just a little bit more color on the Q1 op income decline you talked about just what exactly the drivers are that are negatively impacting you so much to start the year.", "And then just you talked about Kate Spade comps and high single digits for the year. Again, just any color you know first half versus back half, should we expect that to be much worse than high single digits to start and then Easter at the year. Just any color would be really helpful?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. I\u2019ll let Kevin speak to the first quarter, I can then \u2013 I\u2019ll take the comp question on Kate.", "Kevin Wills", "Sure. Morning, Ike. There is a number of factors that are weighing in on the first quarter and I'll kind of try to unpack those for you. First on the sales, we do have some calendar shifts in the first quarter where we see some sales probably going to be moving from Q1 into Q2. We also expect probably some more FX headwinds on both sales and margin in the first quarter.", "Also keep in mind as we said earlier, we did not own the Kate Spade business until July 12th. So there's about $33 million to $35 million thereabouts of sales that occurs on the July period that we do not get credit for prior to us acquiring them.", "On the gross margin side, we do expect some continued pressure into the \u2013 in the first quarter, although at a lesser degree than we experienced in the fourth quarter and as I said earlier, as we moved into the second quarter we believe we're going to be in a better inventory position to be able capitalize on some emerging trends.", "And then on \u2013 thinking about from a pro-forma from the Kate Spade perspective, again we're going to see some pressure there from a gross margin. ", "On SG&A side we got some puts and takes there. But as the top line we see a little bit of pressure creating some difficulty on the leverage perspective and I would also note that if you\u2019re thinking about it on a pro forma basis with Kate [indiscernible] they did have some good news in their last year September quarter ended relative to [reverse in] [ph] incentive compensation benefits that they had been accruing for in their first half. So we're up against that.", "And then finally I would note that you know, you add all that together we're not expecting a meaningful operating profit contribution from Kate in Q1 due to the actions that we\u2019re taking combined with the fact that their fiscal \u2013 our fiscal Q1 has not traditionally been a large profit contribution from the Kate business.", "Victor Luis", "And then Ike in relation to comp and its progress throughout the year as you know in the speaker's notes and it's been very much something that we've talked about since we announced the acquisition was our desire to managing drive the brand for long term health and growth. We are taking two very important decisions towards that end which is reducing a lot of the promotional impression that we believe are more harmful to long-term brand health, specifically through the online price or flash sales, as well as through the more urban discount or wholesale disposition d channel, specifically of course we pull back on the surprise business will have a negative impact of course on comp throughout the year given that currently there brick and mortar comp has been consistent with the first quarter in their second quarter on what is now of course - with our fourth quarter. And I would say around negative 8 you would assume that the pullback in online will mean that brick and mortar comp will improve as the year progresses. That is our plan today.", "Ike Boruchow", "Got it. Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.", "Oliver Chen", "Hi, thank you. Good morning. Our question was about your comments related to coach.com and your digital priorities. Just curious about what you're focused on in terms of stores and mobile and web site integration and also how you'll continue to stand your own in the face of Amazon making so many competitive strides as it relates to retail in general.", "And our second question was just about synergies with Kate Spade. What's the framework for easier to achieve synergies versus longer term synergies. And it looks like you had a nice findings initially, just what drove some of the differences in terms of what you've been seeing very recently since you've had Kate Spade for just a month? Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Sure. First I\u2019ll Josh talk a little bit about his views and strategies on the web. We're very excited about his passion and experience there. And then I will jump in with Kevin on everything related to - everything related to synergies and cost.", "Joshua Schulman", "Good morning. This is Josh. So as Victor said I am passionate about really building the coach.com business both from a business perspective and as a global digital flagship. We see opportunities to immediately impact the business by evolving our targeting strategies and the way we look at the spend allocated for performance marketing.", "And then as we revision coach.com as the global digital flagship really looking at it regionally on global basis and seeing how we can tie that more mystically into the omni channel experience that our customer has.", "From a product point of view online too, we have an opportunity to distinguish the channel and leverage an exclusivity message that can tie into some content creation, as well as amplifying the volume at some lower price point as well.", "In terms of Amazon, for the time being we don't see that as a true luxury play and where many of our core competitors play and we're more excited about engaging directly with our customers through our own digital channels and those of our premium wholesale customers.", "Victor Luis", "[Technical Difficulty] ability to get procurement savings. So those are in a more easier buckets, if you think about more the longer term, that's generally in the systems area, as well as the cost of good sold. So it takes longer to affect changes there. But overall we feel good about the process is underway. We feel good about the teamwork across the organization, as I noted earlier we will be updating you in each quarter earnings call.", "Oliver Chen", "Okay. Thank you. Best Regards.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Oliver.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.", "Anna Andreeva", "Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. We had a follow up on gross margin, what's the negative impact we should expect from Kate for the year and should we that expect underlying codes gross margin up for \u201818.", "And then looking out, Coach Brands operating margins just under 19% this year, you had previously talked about reaching low 20s. Maybe talk about the puts and takes for \u201918 and beyond?", "Victor Luis", "Yeah, several questions there. First on the gross margin, the negative impact I think on a consolidated basis for Kate, did I get that right?", "Anna Andreeva", "Yes.", "Victor Luis", "I think we've not given you know, specific gross margin rate, but it will be you know, call it to probably in the $170 million to $200 million, 200 basis points range for the year. As I said earlier it will be uneven by quarter as we you know, do some of the actions that you would expect it to have that kind of level - of profit is lower than traditional legacy code just to our business.", "And the other question I know was the gross margin for the year in the Coach Brands. Again, we've not given specific, but you should think about the Coach Brand you know, legacy businesses having modest gross margin expansion for the year. And then\u2026", "Anna Andreeva", "Thank you. That's helpful. ", "Victor Luis", "Okay. Anything else?", "Anna Andreeva", "The operating margins, maybe talk about reaching the low 20s and the puts and takes there for the Coach Brands? Thanks so much.", "Victor Luis", "What we said earlier the operating guidance that we have previously provided is no longer operable as we've moved to a house of brand and we will be providing annual operating guidance fourth quarter each year, as we\u2019re looking at it on a total business\u2026", "Anna Andreeva", "Got it. Okay, got it. Thanks so much. And best of luck.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about the comment on Kate and the outlet stores. Could you talk about first of all the split of where you expect to be opening outlook store, maybe even just a little more detail on the overall Kate store expectation for next year? Where and what kind of stores or though, are those.", "And second you know, as you think about the potential competition with Coach Brand in outlet stores with more competition from Kate and maybe customers cross shopping you know, how you plan to mitigate any potential pressure on the legacy Coach Brand business? Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "Hi, Lindsay. I\u2019ll take the first - the second half of your question first in terms of potential competition or overlap, I couldn't be more excited with the results that we just got. In fact, no more than a month ago in post-purchase and combining our data basis, as you know we have a very large Coach data base, we actually combined Coach Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade data basis and did a little bit of cross shopping analysis and the result came back at less than 10% and that was slightly above 10% between Stuart Weitzman and Kate, which was really the highest cross over that we saw and was just about 10. So very exciting news.", "And I think speaks to our initial views and assumptions going into this, which is of course like riding an incremental business given the very unique brand attitude that Kate has, a much stronger leaning in towards a millennial consumer at over 60% which compares to basically just over 30% for the Coach Brand and a very differentiated brand attitude and positioning globally not just here in the U.S. although nascent in international markets.", "In terms of \u2013 so in conclusion, we're not worried at all about the crossover or competition that you look. In terms of \u2013 and we see ourselves obviously growing our total market share with a combined house of brands. In terms of distribution, very excited about the opportunities globally, as I talked to earlier, I believe it was the first question in terms of just the number of opportunities ahead of us, both in the digital and brick and mortar perspective.", "I think on the outlet side, the opportunities are really two. One is definitely distribution, the outlet channel provides great opportunity for those more value conscious consumers that we see globally and visit and probably off the brick and mortar channels, so ones that we're still seeing developments in rather global aggressive pace compared to full price.", "And then second is the opportunity for just us to support that team. There's a great insight, but we believe we can support them in managing it much more efficiently and better. But at of course through innovation and product and hand-bags, leveraging our supply, increasing and improving quality and gross margin overall, all opportunities are ahead of in differentiating between the channels as well. So exciting, we're still very much ahead of us on that front. We look forward to keeping you updated on it.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Great. And then just \u2013 outlet opening U.S. versus Japan or overall store openings, the net store openings where we should expect that to be for Kate?", "Victor Luis", "I think you\u2019ll see it globally. We're still very much in the process of obviously look, we\u2019ve owned the business for a month. We have plans to really drive the business globally. We\u2019re still in the process of negotiating with our partners and landlord partners globally. I think you'll see some growth in our opening of - here in the U.S., as well as internationally with a focus especially on Japan and China.", "Of course, China remains a business which is a joint venture with a third party distributor, but we will certainly fill you in on that and we\u2019re very excited about the opportunity across all markets.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird.", "Mark Altschwager", "Good morning and thanks for all the details today. Just wanted to follow up regarding the new reporting. I think you mentioned plans for low single digit percent increase in Coach brand global comps. Can you just give us a sense of how the comp growth has been tracking in the international segment just to add some context to that guide?", "And then just directionally in North America how are you thinking about the comp growth in fiscal \u201818 versus fiscal \u201817 for Coach Brand? Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Yeah. On the international question, we have not provided comps on that and on the North America we have historically - we said going forward don\u2019t provide global comps and as know indicated we're expecting actually low single digit growth in the Coach Brand thus likely.", "Mark Altschwager", "Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks for taking my question. I thought you made some interesting comments around the outlet consumer\u2019s response to some of the new products going through there. The fact that maybe you had to be a little bit more promotional than you expected and I think you also made some comments around logo not having enough logo product you know, where do you see that cycle shifting, back and forth. Help us understand what's going on in that channel because the products seems so much better? Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Omar. Very good question. I'll let Josh jump in on that.", "Joshua Schulman", "Good morning. One of my early observations was really how this team has driven the outlet channel through innovation and how and how that's been resonating with our customers these past few quarters. I think what we saw different at the end of Q4 was that there was a resurgence in demand for some of our local product that has traditionally occupied a higher margin within our mix.", "And so we have a higher turn on the logo product in the fourth quarter and we're actually working part now to position ourselves to be in business in that product. And my observation that is somewhat related to the overall logo trend, but I also see it as a terrific time for the brand health that this heritage product that is so iconic to Coach is seeing resurgence demand wherever we have it.", "Omar Saad", "Got it. Do you think it's a little bit of a trend, logos and also just a reflection of the b brand health and the demand for it?", "Joshua Schulman", "Yeah, we see it as positive and we're actively chasing now and we anticipate to be in a more complete stock position for Q2.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks very much\u2026", "Victor Luis", "Omar, I would just add, and I think you'll see us to developing into that cross-channel go forward which is an exciting for. It really is.", "Operator", "Our next question\u2026", "Victor Luis", "Yes, yes for price [ph].", "Omar Saad", "Thank you. Best of luck.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. I just want to clarify one thing on the guidance really quickly. Jim Lehrer [ph] consolidation it sounds like it's contributing to the gross margin guidance that you talked about for the year. Is there any way you can help us to nationalize what that adds to revenue or either line for the year, EBITDA line?", "Kevin Wills", "Michael, it\u2019s Kevin, now to be clear it's a negative to the gross margin rate for the year. The last one business effectively 100% margin now we take it in-house and obviously is less than 100% because you've got a cost. So it's actually a modest headwind on the gross margin rate for the year and overall it would be you know, small dollars in the big picture. So it's not a material impact, but it's you know modestly we're very slightly negative for the year we\u2019re taking back.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. It does contribute to upside of the revenue line, I just want to make sure is that right?", "Kevin Wills", "We've not disclosed that, but again it's a very tiny number in relation next year\u2026", "Victor Luis", "Yeah, Michael as you heard in my speakers notes, we're really taking a very deliberate approach to the stock here in year one, we\u2019ve got a business that we starting with about skews, that compares to anywhere in north to 5, 600 skews under Jim Log [ph]", "We're starting with about 120 wholesale doors which from a department store or department store channel and wholesale for example we compare to 5to 600 dollars under Jim Log, if we were to include the disposition channel they were over thousands of door. So we're really starting with a very I would say a very focused and deliberate launch, but very excited about the opportunity long-term given the fact that it's a $28 million dollar opportunity for us and it's growing. And of course we\u2019re leveraging a lot of that now specifically around fit that we're getting from [indiscernible] team.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. And then \u2013 most of my other questions have answered, but curious if you could give us little language on a promotional environment. I know you have some competitors that are planning to close doors or may start closing doors, maybe you could talk about what you're seeing in some of the local markets as that happens and I feel about market share opportunity as you look ahead and obviously you'll be calling back and wanting your other brands, Kate Spade, how you think about the Coach market share opportunity into those competitive dynamics?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. We don't see - look, overall I would say that we don't see dramatic shifts across channels from a promotional perspective. Of course, the department store channel has specifically seen the most substantial pullback across France and there the impact of Kate Spade is truly minimal. Now one of the most positive surprises for us actually we knew this through our diligence prior to the acquisition has been just how clean that brand has been and how well it's been managed from a promotional perspective, as it relates to the department store channel. And so we're excited about that. There's not much cleaning to do in there.", "As it relates to the online channel again, we see most of the impact from our own actions and what we see from Kate Spade has been very difficult to read in terms of impact across brands or cross-channel. For us this is really not as much about reducing it to gain market share in one channel or another. But really about managing brand power for the long-term, that's the strategy, that's what we're focused on. And so doing of course allow for a much more sustainable growth both top and bottom line for our brands.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. Thanks a lot. Best of luck.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Trussell", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You certainly touched on this already. But maybe just a little bit more detail on the comp, especially in North America, you obviously comped the comp which was impressive this quarter. Maybe just elaborate on your confidence to be able to continue to do so over the coming quarters? And you know the particular factors and drivers that you're most excited about.", "Victor Luis", "Yeah, I would say, look, we don\u2019t add anything to what Josh had share with you which is obviously incredibly pleased with the fact that consecutive comp here in North America are very focused on continuing to drive engagement across channels, of course on brick and mortar full price outlet and digital channel and you'll see of course as Josh mentioned digital continues to be increasingly important for him and for the brands under his leadership.", "And globally, I wouldn\u2019t add anything to what we've just guided, which of course is the low single digit cost of the brand across markets which we're excited about. So my brand is increasingly global as you know with growth coming especially out of Europe and China which has been appealing for a few quarters and of course in China for few years. That we\u2019re continues to be very excited about.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question.", "Operator", "Our final question this morning will come from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura.", "Simeon Siegel", "Anything you can elaborate on your comment to refocus Kate's licensing. I believe they license a broader assortment of products, so how un-flexibility do you have there. And then the that comment pertained to geographic JV in Asia as well? Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "Yes. The licenses are part - the discussion about licenses approximate licenses not distribution based licenses. As I mentioned we do have a JV with China that of course we will be focusing on, and it relates to the products based licenses, there is no intent to spend anything early. A lot of these licenses do have short times. So we will be re-evaluating them on a case by case basis.", "I think our objective is just truly focus on the core fashion category and especially in certain home licenses, but you will you will definitely see us reduce the number and average power and much more fully within the handbag in accessories business where we believe the greatest opportunity lies.", "Simeon Siegel", "Great, thanks. Just a random question if can, when you talk about the promotional levels of outlet, do you find you are impacted by promotional levels across all our outlet retailers or its specifically promotional levels of your peers?", "Victor Luis", "I would say in general when we talk about promotion levels, of course were most focused on what is happening I would say in the premium brands space and those domestic and European players that are closest to us across the distribution channels, whether that be with specialty of course in wholesale and in the out of the channel, which of course by nature is a promotional channel.", "Simeon Siegel", "Great. Thanks a lot guys. Best of the luck to the year.", "Andrea Shaw Resnick", "Thank you. Back over to Victor for some brief concluding remarks, Victor?", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Andrea, Just want to close by first and foremost welcoming the Kate Spade team, I know there is quite of those folks listening in and walking down to the Coach Inc. family. We\u2019re incredibly excited to have them as a part of the team and very much looking forward to supporting them in their growth as a brand not only here in the U.S., but globally. Also want to thank and congratulate the Coach Inc and teams on a fantastic fiscal year \u201917, as we continue to drive results and our brand transformation and as the Stuart Weitzman team moves under the direction of Wendy and Giovanni Morelli in this new chapter, as well.", "Obviously could not be more excited about our revolution corporately as a house of brands and bringing our vision to markets across the globe and looking forward to continuing to connect with all of you as we share the work that we're doing not only in our into adding our brands, but of course integrating the Kate Spade brand in the quarters ahead.

With me today to discuss our quarterly results and annual forecast are Victor Luis, Tapestry, Inc.\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Wills, Tapestry CFO.", "Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years.

Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone to our first call as Tapestry. In changing our name, we\u2019re establishing a strong and distinct corporate identity which enables our brands to express their individual personalities and unique language to consumers, therefore eliminating confusion between Coach, Inc. and the Coach brand. We searched for a name to reflect the shared values of optimism, innovation and inclusion that all three of our brands share, while also expressing the diversity of our people and our brands. Our new corporate identity embodies our creative, brand-led, and consumer-focused business, while also representing the heritage of our group.", "Now, turning to our results. As noted in our press release this morning, our first quarter performance was in line with our overall expectations, which as Kevin mentioned on our last call, would be impacted by calendar shifts and currency. Our results clearly reflected the benefits of our diversified multi-brand model, notably the contribution of Kate Spade to our consolidated results, and double-digit growth at Stuart Weitzman.", "While we were not satisfied with Coach\u2019s global comp store sales performance, which was impacted by both, the expected calendar shifts and inventory mix challenges as well as the effects of the unanticipated natural disasters, we have returned to global and North America comp growth in the second quarter and our well-positioned for holiday. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve the annual guidance we set out for Tapestry in August.", "We have been especially pleased with the progress of the integration of Kate Spade, on to our operating platform. During the quarter, we took significant actions to position the brand for long-term success. We began to implement our strategic initiatives including the pull back on wholesale, disposition and flash sales, while taking substantial steps to unlock cost synergies. After only a few months post close of the Kate Spade acquisition, we are even more excited about the opportunities for the brand, both in terms of revenue growth driven by distribution expansion and productivity, and profitability improvements as we leverage our scale across our supply chain and corporate functions.", "We are also optimistic about growth opportunities as we leverage our global business development organization across all brands and geographies. Importantly, we now expect to achieve run rate synergies of approximately $100 million to $115 million in fiscal 2019 versus our previous guidance of $50 million.", "Today, the three brands of the Tapestry family are united in a common philosophy. First, driven by brand-led strategies that focus on the consumer and on an inclusive approach to luxury; second, a focus on innovation across product, marketing and experiences both in our stores and in our digital channels; and lastly, the objectives to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth through strategies that are focused on long-term brand health. Our strategic priority is to achieve this balance by making the appropriate investments while carefully managing our distribution channels to optimize growth.", "As we look forward to the balance of FY18, our strategies of Tapestry are focused on creating and operating platform that powers our multi-brand company; writing the next chapter in the Coach story; building upon our history and heritage of craftsmanship and fashion relevance across product categories, channels and geographies; establishing a healthy foundation to support Kate Spade\u2019s global growth; launching the new creative direction for Stuart Weitzman, while maintaining the brand\u2019s leadership position in the fusion of fashion and fit; and driving innovation and ecommerce and digital marketing, as well as materials and supply chain while leveraging Tapestry\u2019s scale across brands.", "Overall, we remain focused on creating desire for our brands in re-enforcing the emotional bonds with our customers across geographies. We are confident in the opportunities for Tapestry as a whole and for each of our brands individually within the attractive and growing $80 billion global market for premium handbags and accessories, footwear and outerwear.", "Moving to category trends and giving our new reporting structure. We are moving to a global category update. During the first quarter, we estimate that the men\u2019s and women\u2019s premium handbag and accessories market which is over $40 billion grew at high single digit rate globally, accelerating from the June quarter, driven by the strength of luxury logo products, proving that brands absolutely still matter. For perspective, we did still want to provide North America trends this quarter and we estimate that the men\u2019s and women\u2019s premium handbag and accessories market grew at a low single digit rate, also led by the outperformance of luxury brands, partially offset by continued negative trends in the U.S. department store space as some brands have pulled back from the channel.", "Now, turning to results by brand. I\u2019d like to focus on first quarter performance and the holiday outlook for the Coach brand, where we remain focused on elevating brand perception, driving fashion relevance, and ensuring balance across our product offering in both price points and materials.", "Overall, for the first quarter, Coach sales declined 3% as reported and 2% in constant currency. The brand\u2019s North America business declined modestly while the international business was flat on a reported basis and up slightly in constant currency, given the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The brand\u2019s international constant currency sales growth was driven by increases in Europe, Greater China, and Japan.", "During the quarter, our global Coach comp declined 2% with our North America comp down similarly. Europe and Mainland China continued to generate positive comps while our overall comp store sales in Greater China were down as expected, given both the holiday shift and continued weakness in Hong Kong and Macau. The balance of our direct Asia business continued to be negatively impacted by the ongoing issues in Korea with both domestic macroeconomic malaise and weak tourist flows.", "As I mentioned, there were a number of both anticipated and unexpected impacts on global results during the quarter. These included the movement of the Mid-Autumn Festival which reduced Chinese tourist flows and their spend during the quarter and some inventory mix opportunities, stock-outs and storages of certain products, notably logo in the North America outlet channel. There were also the negative effects of hurricanes and typhoons in North America and Asia, respectively. In addition to direct impact on sales from these disasters, we also experienced disruption to our Jacksonville, Florida distribution center, both receiving shipment into the facility as well sending inventory out the stores. However, our rebound quarter-to-date underscores our confidence in Coach\u2019s continued transformation and brand momentum as well as our ability to deliver a strong holiday season.", "Moving to wholesale. Our North America shipments grew during the quarter driven by footwear. As expected, our sales at POS declined due to the rap impact of spring 2017 door closures. However, we were pleased to have positive year-on-year performance in comp doors within our largest accounts. Our results are especially strong in those doors which have been renovated into the modern luxury concept. Our international wholesale business declined as expected, due in part to shipment timing with ships in both the fourth quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of fiscal 2018, while sales at POS rose, driven by door growth.", "Turning to Coach product performance and starting with retail. We continue to see strong consumer response to fashion innovation. Most exciting in the quarter was the launch of the Coach and Selena Gomez collaboration, a new collection designed in partnership with the multitalented actress and singer. This launch was supported by our fall advertising campaign, featuring Selena wearing the Selena Grace bag and Red which has virtually sold out across our network.", "What was a specially exciting was the increase in our North America retail customer database, in part reflecting our strategy to leverage the Selena collaboration to cut through to a broader audience. This was also evidenced in our brand tracking where among the broad premium market, women who believe wearing Coach handbags make them feel fashionable and put together, rose versus a year ago, while Coach also leads in being viewed as high quality. Importantly, among category drivers, perception of the brand\u2019s ubiquity fell year-over-year.", "As we entered Q2, we launched Coach Create, globally, a platform for customers to customize her bags either online or in store. In 35 stores worldwide as well as online, we have the most complete expression of Coach Create which allows customers to customize bags with signature details such as embossed leather Tea Roses or Prairie Rivets. This customization is done in store while the customer shops. And in over 25% of our direct fleet worldwide, we now have standalone monogramming stations.", "We consider Coach Create to be the cornerstone of our co-creation strategy. And based on very strong early results, we will be expanding the most complete expression of the concept to more stores in the second half of the year.", "We continue to build our fashion authority at Coach. After winning the CFDA Accessory Designer of the Year Award earlier this year, Stuart Vevers recent spring fashion show in September was named one of the top 10 global fashion shows among all designer showing in New York, London, Milan or Paris by the industry publication Business of Fashion. The runway show featured a fresh take on Coach Signature, as we begin to capitalize on the logo trend sweeping the market in the months ahead. And just recently, Stuart has been nominated for that British Fashion Council\u2019s Accessory Designer of the Year.", "For Q2, we have focused on cascading the level of innovation and fashion leadership, which Stuart Vevers brings to our most elevated runway collections across a pyramid of price, occasion and function in both 1941 and broader Coach assortments. The Selena Grace bag is a great example of innovation under $400.", "During Q1, we launched the new Coach women\u2019s footwear assortment, both in our stores and in the wholesale channel, following the take back of our license at the end of FY17. We started with the focused and curated offering of about 100 for pre-fall with limited wholesale distribution of about 120 doors. We will build pre-spring and spring from 100 to about a 175 skews and look to grow distribution. Though early days, we look forward to the expansion of Coach footwear as Tapestry looks to play a leading role in the $28 billion and growing premium footwear market.", "Looking ahead to holiday, Coach takes an overtly festive approach with product and marketing. Specifically in retail, we will first offer a compelling holiday gift assortment with options across categories and price points in the wide selection of colors. Touches of playful prints and metallic are aimed at surprising and delighting customers; and second, continue to innovate leather craft, launching coating as a new technique. This novelty platform will be offered across collections and silhouettes from rogue to dinky, as well as in a full range of smaller leather goods, crafted in luxurious lightweight nappa leather.", "Beyond women\u2019s leather goods, we expect growth in lifestyle categories during holiday driven by innovation in shearling, varsity trenches and apparel as well as footwear, notably sneakers and booties. In men\u2019s, we\u2019re excited about growth in travel, outerwear and belts.", "Supporting our retail product initiatives, our holiday marketing will focus on compelling, product-driven concept and storytelling. We will also significantly increase our focus into digital, maximizing investments with 4 billion impressions targeted globally. And we will of course be using Selena to amplify our gifting message and our holiday campaign and including a personal appearance that our Regent Street store in London.", "Moving to Coach brand outlet and starting with Q1. This fall, we delivered Coach Varsity, inspired from our fall runway collection and just in time for back-to-school shopping. This collection included on trend varsity jackets, patches and our first full personalization assortment in outlet. In addition, we continued to drive growth in the lifestyle and men\u2019s categories. As discussed earlier, due to strong performance in Q4 and heightened demand for logo, we entered FY18, chasing some of our top women\u2019s bags and core leather styles and colors in the specialty and logo platforms. As we exited our first quarter, we were able to rebuild our inventory position in these key items and are seeing a positive impacts to handbag performance quarter-to-date.", "Now, looking to our second quarter in outlet. As we move into our biggest season of the year, we are excited to launch our full holiday expression two weeks earlier than last year with the clear 360-degree message across product, stores and marketing. This year\u2019s holiday collection is all about metallic, sparkle and great gifting options across all price points from glitter wristlets to shearling outerwear.", "Starting in November, we launch a jewel toned metallic palette and leather goods with elevated hardware details. As we move further into the season, we launch our Black Friday and Cyber Monday exclusive product and deals across all categories. For December, we will drive excitement through an enhanced flow of newness offering a full assortment of product for both gift-giving and self purchase.", "So, in summary, on the Coach brand, as we look forward to holiday and beyond, we are well-positioned to drive positive comparable store sales driven by compelling products, a differentiated modern luxury store experience, and bold marketing campaigns across all of our channels and geographies. We are especially excited about our development in logo platforms across channels and the leverage that we expect to get form the Selena Gomez campaign in bringing these ideas to our core customers globally, given the current trend for highly differentiated logo product in the broader market.", "Moving to Kate Spade. Sales totaled $269 million for the post-acquisition period. Underlying comparable stores sales improved from previous quarters with bricks and mortar comps down 3% globally compared to 8% in the previous quarter, and total comp down about 9%, impacted by reduced promotional sales online. When looking at Kate Spade versus prior year for the full quarter including the stub period, sales declined about 4%, reflecting our strategic reduction of both wholesale disposition and flash or surprise sales.", "Highlights of the quarter were the strength of innovation and retail, the customer response to the make it mine customization program and the success of small wallets. We are especially excited about our trend in ready-to-wear and our testing a different visual merchandising approach. This test is focused on zoning retail stores by department rather than monthly introduction, allowing for an easier category shopping experience. These tests, which required minimal capital investment, are proving very productive and will be rolled out further in retail throughout the third quarter. In outlet, we saw improved results from higher inventory levels, notably in handbag sales with small leather goods and jewelry also performing well.", "In our U.S. brand tracking survey fielded in September, we saw Kate Spade momentum rise from the prior year among millennials, which represents about 60% of the brand\u2019s customer base. In addition, among the broad premium market, we continue to see the brand resonance on the attributes of fashionable, feminine and fun. In fact, nearly 90% of women believe Kate Spade handbags are fashionable and are on trend, setting us up very well for the increased focus we shall be placing on core handbag innovation in the quarters ahead.", "Looking to holiday and beyond, our focus remains on delighting customers in a distinctly Kate Spade way, full of color and playful sophistication. For Q2, in retail stores, we will expand our customization program and support the expansion of the ready-to-wear visual merchandising tests. Most important, we are focused on a gifting assortment with the more democratic offer and balanced color palette.", "In outlet, we believe we have a real opportunity around our gifting capsule where we actually ran out of inventory by Black Friday last holiday as well as in bag packs and cross body silhouettes. As we said before, we know that Kate Spade is a strong, unique brand, bringing important brand attribute and customer diversification to the Tapestry portfolio. It is a brand with highly productive retail and outlet stores and a strong top tier department store presence in North America.", "Outside of the U.S., there is significant opportunity in Japan, the second largest handbag and accessory market in the world and where the brand already has a strong presence, but is still underpenetrated.", "We are also really pleased with the initial response to Kate Spade in the UK market and extremely excited about the long-term growth opportunities in China where our initial brand tracker shows promising consumer traction for the brand. Of course, we know that as we grow awareness for the brand in China, this will have a positive impact on important travel markets for the Chinese tourists including Europe, Japan and North America.", "As we look ahead for Kate Spade for the balance of fiscal year 2018, we have already begun to take steps to position the brand, building a foundation for solid and sustainable growth. We will continue to significantly curtail promotional impressions by reducing surprise sales and pulling back on wholesale disposition. It\u2019s important to note that in the case of flash, we\u2019re not only pulling back on the number events but also significantly reducing the circulation, no longer using flash sale events as a broad, widely advertised recruitment vehicle. We will also accelerate innovation in the core hand bad and accessory category, along with ready-to-wear and tech, leveraging the Tapestry platform, notably our supply chain and product development capabilities. Indeed, we\u2019ve already made key decisions to reinforce Kate Spade\u2019s leather goods design talent.", "We have begun to review the store fleet and leverage opportunities to maximize the brand\u2019s global footprint. To this point, we opened five new stores in the first quarter and closed four. In addition to the winding down of Jack Spade, we continue to look for focus in our license portfolio while we put our energy and team\u2019s efforts on the most significant women\u2019s opportunities, handbags, ready-to-wear, tech and footwear, both domestically and internationally. And we will tailor the brand\u2019s whimsical and fun marketing messages, ensuring that it resonates in all key global markets while remaining true to the brand\u2019s unique personality.", "I have enjoyed immensely partnering with the terrific Kate Spade team as interim CEO as we continue to look to both capture synergies and more importantly, drive global resonance and growth.", "And finally, at Stuart Weitzman, we drove double-digit growth in the first quarter. Sales rose 10% driven by international wholesale shipment timing with more modest increases in the global, direct business, driven in turn by distribution growth and global ecommerce. New seasonal products and booties did very well in the quarter as did sneakers and our developing handbag offering.", "In October, we launched a dedicated customer analytics program for the Stuart Weitzman brand, which will enable greater business insights moving forward. One initial learning is that our U.S. direct millennial penetration though small is growing nicely, while seeing very exciting penetration of Asian, especially Mainland Chinese millennials across our business.", "We\u2019re just beginning to leverage insights to help us recruit, retain and reactivate lapsed customers into the brand. We\u2019re very much on track to drive double-digit growth for the year at Stuart Weitzman as we continue to evolve the brand identity across global markets but would expect second quarter results to be essentially even on a year-over-year basis, given the extremely difficult compare with last year\u2019s second quarter, which benefited from shipment timing shift.", "We\u2019re very excited to present Giovanni Morelli\u2019s first footwear and handbag collections to the trade in the upcoming weeks. The Stuart Weitzman team is focused on innovation and capturing new occasions and wardrobing opportunities in footwear while building credibility in the leather goods category.", "We\u2019re also looking at distribution opportunities globally, notably in the key Asian markets where we want to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for the brand. You can also expect to see an evolved and exciting new store concept for Stuart Weitzman later this fiscal year with the renovation of our Rodeo Drive store in January. And of course, all of these programs will be supported by seasonal marketing campaigns, featuring a supermodel strategy, providing a platform to amplify the brand message in social media and attract an incremental millennial client.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to our CFO, Kevin Wills, for details on our first quarter financial results and guidance for fiscal 2018. Kevin?", "Kevin Wills", "Thanks, Victor, and good morning, everyone.", "Victor has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results, as well as our outlook for fiscal year 2018.", "Before I begin, please note, the comments I\u2019m about to make are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results, as well as a related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. In addition and as previously announced, beginning in fiscal 2018, we establish reportable segments per brand. Information under these new reportable segments including restated prior year results can be found in our earnings release as well as in the 8-K filed with the SEC today.", "Finally, fiscal 2018 first quarter performance includes the contribution of Kate Spade for the post-acquisition period of July 11, 2017 through the end of the fiscal quarter on September 30, 2017.", "Now, turning to the financial results for Tapestry.", "Net sales totaled $1.29 billion as compared to the $1.04 billion in the prior year, an increase of 24%, driven by the acquisition of Kate Spade and double-digit growth at Stuart Weitzman, partially offset by decline in Coach brand sales. On a constant currency basis, total sales increased to 25%.", "Coach net sales totaled $924 million as compared to 924950 million in the prior year, a decrease of 3%. On a constant currency basis, sales declined 2%. As Victor previously noted, sales during Q1 were negatively impacted by inventory challenges, calendar shifts and the impacts of the stronger U.S. dollars as well as the impact of natural disasters.", "Kate Spade net sales totaled $269 million for the post-acquisition period, reflecting in part the strategic pullback in wholesale disposition and online flash.", "Stuart Weitzman net sales totaled $96 million compared to $88 million reported in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 10% driven by growth in wholesale and an increase in total direct sales.", "Gross profit totaled $853 million while gross margin was 66.2% as compared to 68.9% in the prior year. The addition of Kate Spade pressured our overall gross margin by approximately 130 basis points, as expected, given lower margin profile for the Kate Spade brand.", "Gross margin for the Coach brand was 68.4% compared to gross margin of 69.8% in the prior year. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was larger than expected, driven by inventory mix challenges, notably in the North American outlet channel where there was pent-up demand for higher margins logo product which we were unable to satisfy. This decline was not fully offset by the benefit of lower product cost. We also experienced a negative 30 basis-point impact due to bringing the women\u2019s footwear business in-house. In addition, currency pressured the brand\u2019s gross margin rate by 70 basis points in the quarter.", "Kate Spade gross margin was 61.3%. This performance was above our expectations and prior year, benefiting in part from lower discount rates in the North American outlet channel.", "Gross margin for Stuart Weitzman was 58.1% as compared to 58.9% last year with the year-over-year decline being driven by negative currency impact and channel mix, given a higher penetration of the wholesale sales versus prior year.", "SG&A expenses totaled $684 million and represented 53% of sales as compared to 51.9% in a year ago period. The deleverage in SG&A was driven by the Coach brand where expenses increased slightly versus prior year on the lower level of sales as well as the additional of Kate Spade which had a higher SG&A rate in the quarter, as expected.", "Coach brand SG&A expenses totaled $434 million and represented 47% of sales compared to 45.4% in a year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in expenses was due in part to higher occupancy costs as well as increased depreciation.", "Kate Spade SG&A expenses were $143 million and represented 53.3% of sales. As previously noted, when looking at the Kate Spade results on a pro forma basis, we did not anniversary certain compensation benefits, as expected.", "Stuart Weitzman SG&A expenses were $47 million, an increase of 1% and represented 48.5% of sales as compared to 52.8% of sales in the prior year. In addition, please note that Tapestry\u2019s total SG&A includes corporate costs, as outlined in our press release.", "Operating income for the quarter was $169 million, a decrease of 4% versus prior year, consistent with guidance, while operating margin was 13.1% versus 17% in last year\u2019s first quarter. The addition of Kate Spade pressured our overall operating margin by 140 basis points, as expected.", "Operating income for Coach was $198 million, while operating margin was 21.5% versus 24.4% in the prior year. Operating income for Kate Spade totaled $22 million, while operating margin was 8%. And operating income for Stuart Weitzman was $9 million or 9.6% of sales versus 6% in the prior year.", "Net interest expense was $21 million in the quarter as compared to $6 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher debt levels associated with the Kate Spade acquisition.", "The effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.3%, as compared to 26.3% in the prior year quarter. The adoption of the Accounting Standard Update, ASU 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments, favorably influenced our effective tax rate as certain tax impacts that were previously recorded to equity have now been included in income tax expense. This accounting change lowered the effective tax rate by approximately 5% in the first quarter. Our Q1 tax rate also benefited from the geographic mix of earnings.", "Net income for the quarter totaled $120 million as compared to $126 million in the prior year with earnings per diluted share of $0.42 versus $0.45. Importantly, we are pleased that Kate Spade was immediately accretive to our non-GAAP EPS.", "Now, moving to global distribution by brand. For the Coach brand, we closed two net locations globally finishing the quarter with 960 directly-operated locations worldwide. For Kate Spade, there were 276 directly-operated stores at quarter-end which represented one net opening since the close of the acquisition. And for Stuart Weitzman, we finished the quarter with 81, directly operating stores, no net change from year end.", "Turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. As you know, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Kate Spade for a purchase price of approximately $2.4 billion, which was funded through a combination of senior notes, bank term loans and cash on hand. At the end of fiscal first quarter, our cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.7 billion, as compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year. Our total borrowings outstanding were $2.7 billion which consisted of $1.6 billion of senior notes and $1.1 billion in terms loans versus $600 million in senior notes a year ago.", "Inventory levels at quarter-end were $853 million including approximately $283 million associated with Kate Spade compared to ending inventory of $547 million a year ago. As previously communicated, we expected a higher inventory to sales ratio than has been our recent history due to elevated inventory levels of Kate Spade. We will protect the Kate Spade brand but not moving excess inventory into the disposition market but rather by primarily flowing it into our own network into the second half of the year. Therefore, we expect our inventory to sales ratio to improve as we move to fiscal 2018.", "Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was an out flow of $104 million, compared to an outflow of $38 million last year. During the quarter, we incurred cash outflows of approximately $95 million related to integration and acquisition activities.", "Our CapEx spending was $49 million in Q1 versus $68 million last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was an outflow of $153 million versus an outflow of $106 million in the same period last year, impacted as expected by the integration and acquisition related charges.", "Now turning to our capital allocation policy. Our long-term priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to invest in our brands in order to drive sustainable growth and value creation; secondly, we will seek strategic acquisitions looking for great brands with opportunities for expansion; and finally, returning capital to shareholders with a focus on dividends.", "Since outlining these priorities some years ago, our strong balance sheet has provided flexibility to invest in the Coach brand transformation; successfully acquire two great brands, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade with only modest leverage, while continuing to return capital to shareholders.", "Moving forward, we remain committed to a conservative balance sheet management. To that end, we expect to reduce our outstanding borrowings to $1.9 billion by the end of fiscal 2018, with the repayment of $800 million six-month term loan with excess cash. In addition, based on free cash flow and cash on hand, we may elect to further reduce indebtedness prepaying long-term bank debt. At the same time, we\u2019re maintaining our dividend at an annual rate of a $1.35 per share.", "Now, moving to our 2018 outlook. Throughout the fiscal year, we will naturally incur a number of integrations and one-time charges associated with Kate Spade acquisition. I will provide more details on these expected charges in a few moments but note that will be excluded from our non-GAAP results. Additionally, the Kate Spade guidance is provided subsequent to the deal close on July 11, 2017.", "Now, turning to our guidance on a non-GAAP basis. We expect total revenues for Tapestry in fiscal 2018 to increase about 30% versus fiscal 2017 to $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion with low single digit organic growth. This includes the expectation for low single digit Coach brand global comps and a low double digit increase in Stuart Weitzman brand sales.", "In addition, we expect the acquisition of Kate Spade to add over $1.2 billion in revenue. The Kate Spade revenue projection includes the impact of a planned strategic pullback in the wholesale disposition and online flash channels and assumes a high single digit decrease in comps for the fiscal year.", "In addition, we are projecting operating income growth of 22% to 25% versus fiscal 2017, driven by mid single digit organic growth, the acquisition of Kate Spade, and estimated synergies of $30 million to $35 million. These synergies are expected to offset in part the reduction in profitability from the strategic and deliberate pullback of Kate Spade wholesale disposition and online flash sales. Taken together, the Kate Spade business and resulting synergies are expected to add approximately 130 to $140 million to operating income.", "As Victor mentioned, after only a few months of owning Kate Spade, we are even more excited about the opportunities throughout synergies across the Tapestry platform. To that end, we now expect to achieve run rate synergies of $100 million to $115 million in fiscal 2019 versus our previous guidance of $50 million.", "Net interest expense is expected to be $80 million to $85 million for the year. The full year tax rate is projected to be about 25% to 26%, and we expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for year to be approximately 289 million. Overall, we are projecting earnings per diluted share for the year in the range of $2.35 to $2.40 and increase of about 10% to 12% including low to mid single digit accretion from the acquisition of Kate Spade. We also expect our CapEx to be approximately $325 million in fiscal year 2018.", "As previously noted, we naturally will be incurring a number of integration and one-time charges associated with the Kate Spade acquisition and integration. These charges include such items as transaction fees and integration costs, which include severance, store closure costs and inventory valuation adjustments.", "During the quarter, we incurred a $188 million of integration and acquisition related charges as follows: First, $40 million of acquisition and transaction fees. Second, $90 million of inventory adjustment charges relating to increased cost of goods sold due to the step-up in inventory values as part of purchase accounting and separately the establishment of a reserve for absolute inventory. The increase in cost of goods sold related to purchase accounting is a limited life expense and we expect such to be complete by the end of our second quarter. Third, $49 million of severance and equity vesting, the majority of which was pursuant to contractual commitments; and finally, $9 million of other integration related charges.", "For the full year, we currently anticipate pretax integration charges to be in the $230 million range. Importantly, we estimate that out of the $230 million of charges, approximately $130 million will be non-cash. Finally, we expect to incur approximately $10 million of operational efficiency charges.", "Finally, our fiscal year 2018 directly operating distribution plan by brand is unchanged. We continue to expect approximately 15 net closures globally for the Coach brand with net closures in North America and Japan partially offset by net openings in Europe and Mainland China. For Kate Spade, we continue to expect 20 to 25 net openings globally. As you know, these net openings will be partially offset by the reduction in online promotional flash sales and wholesale disposition sales, as we build the foundation for long-term brand health. And for Stuart Weitzman, we expect approximately five net openings in the fiscal 2018.", "It is important to note that due to the Kate Spade acquisition, we continue to expect significant variability between quarters throughout the year and across all financial metrics, based on the implementation of strategic initiatives, the realization of synergies, the variability in brand and channel mix, as well as currency. That said, we continue to expect to deliver double-digit operating income growth in quarters two, three and four. And while we continue to anticipate our earnings pattern to be uneven in fiscal 2018, we still expect to realize our annual EPS guidance, as previously mentioned.", "In closing, we will grow both our Coach and Stuart Weitzman brands in the year ahead while successfully integrating Kate Spade which we continue to expect to be accretive to our fiscal 2018 results. Overall, we remain very optimistic about global opportunities and we are committed to driving long-term sustainable growth across the Tapestry portfolio o brands.", "I\u2019d now like to open it up to Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.", "Bob Drbul", "Can you hear me?", "Victor Luis", "Good morning. Yes, we can.", "Bob Drbul", "Okay, sorry. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the comp trends at Coach and Kate Spade in the first quarter. Specifically, what drove the negative comp at Coach? And for Kate, what drove the sequential improvement in store comp trends? Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Sure. I\u2019ll take the Kate side of it and then hand off to Josh for some texture on Coach. During the period that we owned Kate, as we expressed in our notes, we saw a decline of 9%, which was also including a 600 bps negative impact from global ecommerce, and that was driven, of course in part by our strategic decisions to pull back on the online promotional sales as we have discussed. The store comp, also as we expressed, went from a negative 8 the previous quarter to a negative 3, and that improvement was really driven by outlet, and we were really pleased with what we saw there as a sequential improvement at both reduced promotional levels and at higher gross margins, and really, thanks to just the right mix and better inventory all around. Handbag\u2019s performing well, SLG\u2019s performing, as well as jewelry. And I\u2019ll pass on to Josh for Coach texture.", "Josh Schulman", "Good morning, Bob. If you remember, on our Q4 call, we had mentioned that Q1 would be pressured by a continued inventory mix issues, specifically at North America outlet where we have a lack of a high margin logo product to satisfy demand. In addition to that, we also expected the calendar shift of the Mid-Autumn Festival which moved from September last year to October this year. So, both of those were anticipated impacts to the quarter. However, what we did not anticipate were the additional impacts of the hurricanes in North America and the typhoons in Asia. And it\u2019s important to note that in addition to the direct impact to sales, to stores in the hurricanes path, we also experienced disruption to our Jacksonville, Florida distribution center which services all of our North America business. And so that distribution center had trouble, both receiving merchandise from the port and then getting it out to the network of Coach stores across the country.", "We believe that if you -- with those factors weren\u2019t in play, we estimate that our global comp would have been positive in the quarter. And as we turned the corner into Q2, we\u2019re actually very pleased that we\u2019ve had a rebound in our comps in Q2 and so that gives us continued confidence in our ability to deliver a strong holiday season.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.", "Ike Boruchow", "Just a quick one on Coach and a quick follow-up on Kate, if I may. So, the Coach brand inventory issue that you guys called out for Q1, is that now totally behind us as we move into holiday? And then, just to finish that question up, how should we would be thinking about the Coach brand gross margin in Q2? And then, as a follow-up in terms of the Kate Spade trajectory, is there a reason we should assume that the Kate Spade top line, run rate should sequentially slow down before stabilizing later or is this kind of the run rate we should be thinking about?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. I will let Josh touch on the Coach inventory, Kevin on gross margin, and then I will take the Kate question.", "Josh Schulman", "Yes. As we look at what happened in Q1, we really had inefficient product mix in outlet in the quarter with the lack of this high margin logo product to satisfy customer demand. And at the same time, some of the best we took in outlet fashion, particularly nylon underperformed our expectation. And taken together, that resulted in an unfavorable promotional stance versus expectations. It\u2019s important to note that as we turned the corner into Q2, our inventory is more balanced and we saw a rebound in our handbag sales.", "Kevin Wills", "Hey, good morning, Ike. It\u2019s Kevin. As it relates to the gross margin rate, we do expect that Q1 will be our most challenging year-over-year comparison due to the inventory issues that we\u2019ve just discussed. As we move into Q2, as Josh outlined, we feel we\u2019re in a much better inventory position, and we should expect to see improved year-over-year sequential performance.", "Victor Luis", "And As it relates to Kate, Ike, we wouldn\u2019t change the guidance that we\u2019ve given there. I think you\u2019re going to see a some variability, specifically as we continue the strategic pullback in the first quarter. Of course, we have the pullback much more present in the online channel than we did in the wholesale channel, given some of the commitments that we had there. So, as we go through quarters, 2, 3 and 4, you will continue to see us increase the pullback from those promotional channels and of course the resulting impact that we have. What is exciting is the underlying trends that we\u2019re seeing in our brick and mortar channel. And again, as I mentioned that\u2019s both driven by the good inventory mix that we had -- and I have to say, the one thing that for us as a team is really exciting as well is the ready-to-wear trends that we\u2019re seeing in Kate Spade across both channels. And of course nothing more exciting than the synergies that we\u2019re beginning to see and the increased amount that we\u2019ve just communicated in the 100 to $115 million range.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn Murphy", "I wanted to focus a little bit about the logo trends you guys are building into. Can you just talk about how you\u2019re planning to look at both, full price versus the outlet interpretation of that trend, any gross margin implications of this mix? And then, just as clarification on the North America quarter-to-date comp for the Coach brand being positive. Can you just talk about how the promotional calendar compared year-over-year? Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "Sure. Erinn, good morning. I\u2019ll let Josh chime in on that.", "Josh Schulman", "Okay. Good morning. In terms of the logo trend, it\u2019s really interesting because this is a trend that\u2019s happening throughout the industry right now, in the most elevated brands. And it took us somewhat by surprise over the summer that the demand for the logo product exceeded our expectations in our outlet channel.", "Historically, as you know, this has been a very important part of the Coach brand identity and the Coach business over time. At one point, logo reached a 70% penetration of our retail sales globally and about 60% in our North America outlet stores.", "Over the past few years, our transformation plans were very focused on reducing some of the ubiquity around logo with the strategic decision not to feature logo in advertising campaigns. And therefore, we have this pull back, which has created pent-up demand as this logo trend comes back into fashion.", "So, what\u2019s really interesting for us is we\u2019re seeing demand in our outlet channel, but we\u2019re also having requests for more logo product coming from our most elevated wholesale partners around the world, like the Bon March\u00e9 in Paris, Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. And so, when Stuart Vevers put it on the runway, it was a great moment for the brand because editors and customers around the world were very excited, which is fresh take and new approach to this iconic part of our brand. So, we are feeling pretty excited about the reintroduction of signature into our most elevated channels this brings.", "Victor Luis", "And Erinn, just on the gross margin. It is our highest item new product. So, obviously, we look to opportunity there. I think that\u2019s a -- what I would also just add to Josh\u2019s comments, of course is just how exciting it is for us, given the fact that this is our most brand and mostly highly differentiated platform. It\u2019s exciting because it obviously reflects the importance that consumers are placing on brand.", "Erinn Murphy", "And then, just the North American comp quarter-to-date, just promotional calendar year-over-year?", "Victor Luis", "Yes. Our commercial calendar is largely similar year-over-year, quarter-to-date.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.", "Anna Andreeva", "A couple of questions from us. Following up on the North America negative 2 comp, I guess was comp negative in both full price and outlets. And then secondly, gross margins for the Coach brand, are you guys still expecting flattish levels for the year, and if so, what would drive that improvement and should we expect gross margins up in each quarter for the remainder of the year? Thanks so much.", "Victor Luis", "Sure. I\u2019ll let Kevin jump in on the gross margin question and then I believe your first question was -- if you could just repeat it one more time, Anna? ", "Anna Andreeva", "I guess, was North America comp a negative in both full price and in outlet?", "Victor Luis", "Comp by channel, got it. And I\u2019ll let Josh chime in on that.", "Kevin Wills", "Good morning, Anna. On the Coach gross margin, we are still expecting to be flat to up modestly for the year. As it relates to the quarterly flows, we would expect relatively similar to up maybe a little in Q2 and Q3 with the bigger improvement occurring in Q4 due to the last year\u2019s comp.", "Josh Schulman", "And in terms of the comp by channel, we don\u2019t disaggregate the comp by channel.", "Anna Andreeva", "Okay, thanks. Best of luck, guys.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Anna.", "Operator", "[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.", "Oliver Chen", "Hi, thank you. Victor, in the context of Tapestry at large, what are your thoughts regarding the 15 to 25-year old and how to cater to that customer and balance different needs? And also, as you think about data science and analytics and customer relationship management, what do you see as the opportunities to balance both art and science, and also achieve digital personalization and creativity kind of in the new world of retail?", "Victor Luis", "Sure. Great questions and I\u2019ll also ask Josh to chime in because obviously we\u2019re leading on some of those areas with the Coach brand. What I can share with you Oliver is that our strategy and data analytics team is chomping at the bit right now as we take the data from all three brands and bring it together. We have approximately $80 million U.S. households now in our database, over 120 million globally in our database and we\u2019re beginning obviously to look at opportunities on how to take that information and leverage it effectively.", "Of course, look, in terms of the first side, first one of your questions as it relates to the 15 to 25-year old specifically, the younger consumer, and we\u2019ve talked I think quite extensively about the opportunity that we have especially with the Kate Spade is, as we see through all of our analytics with their customers still approximately 60% millennial offering us a huge opportunity from learnings. What we see there of course is how well Kate Spade does in the few very specific categories with smaller bags, gifts and specialty tech playing a very significant role, both in the direct channels and I would also add even through some of the wholesale channels.", "We are gearing up as far as the third part of your question, Oliver, we\u2019re spending a lot of time internally discussing about how we gear ourselves up from both the technical platform as well as from an innovation perspective through partnerships with other in collaborations with third parties to be much more active, not just here in the U.S. but globally. I think that we\u2019re incredibly pleased with the performance that our China team has been, especially led us with, in the Coach brand. We have a leadership position both in senior level as well as in WeChat. I think the opportunity for us here is really still here in the U.S. and in Europe for us to truly turn our flagship, dotcom platform into a real force for the brand as well as through what we do through social media.", "But, I\u2019ll let Josh chime in because he has been really focused with the team on what that next phase for the Coach brand will be which will lead for the entire group.", "Josh Schulman", "Yes.. There are two elements of your question that I will touch on. First, our team in China, as Victor mentioned, has really been a pioneer on WeChat, developing a We clientele platform which really allows one and one dialog between the store associates, the brand and the customer. And we\u2019re just seeing terrific consumer engagement out of that. And well, WeChat isn\u2019t the platform of choice outside of China, we\u2019re seeing great learnings from that that can be exported to our other business units in North America and Europe. So that\u2019s something on all of our minds.", "In terms of the millennial customer you talk about, with our engagements with Selena, one of the things that we have seen is the breadth of the age range of the customers that she is attracting. She is definitely bringing some of her core fans into our store that tend to a bit younger than our target customers. But, on the other hand, we\u2019re also finding our core customers simply think about she looks beautiful and terrific in the Coach ads and they aspire to be a part of her world. So, we\u2019re seeing traction across age groups.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Kevin, I was hoping to start with you, if you could, it\u2019s great to hear the upgraded synergy targets. Could you give us a little more detail on the buckets of where you expect those synergies to come from and in what sort of inning you feel like you are in identifying synergies? So, do you feel like this is what we\u2019re going to get or is there opportunity for more? And then just a quick maybe housekeeping question. As you talked about some of the factors that impacted the Coach comp in the quarter, excluding the lack of inventory, could you quantify how much the disruption, the natural disaster disruption and the holiday shifts hurt the comps, so we can maybe get to an underlying number?", "Kevin Wills", "Good morning, Lindsay. On the synergy detail, obviously, we have spent a significant amount of time over the last quarter, building our detailed synergy plans, and we\u2019re pleased that we were able to up our fiscal year 2019 and run rate synergies to 4100 million to $115 million. I would tell you that the synergy work is ongoing. But, as you think about the 100, $115 million that\u2019s probably going to be split fairly evenly between cost of goods sold and SG&A with the vast majority of that residing in the Kate brand. And as it relates what inning we\u2019re in, it\u2019s hard to tell. We\u2019re continuing to do work on that; something is going to be an ongoing process to for as we move throughout the year. But, we\u2019re pleased with the efforts and hopefully there will be more to come. But at this point in time, based on where we\u2019re at, we\u2019re not in a position to take the numbers above the 100 to 115.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Kevin, any more sort of detail beyond just cogs and SG&A on where the costs are coming from?", "Kevin Wills", "On the cogs side, obviously it\u2019s the product, raw material costs, sourcing and manufacturing. So, it\u2019s really a cost of board; there is also some shifting in production between countries. So, we\u2019ve really tried to take a holistic look at the entire supply chain and drive synergies throughout the process. And on the SG&A side, again, really kind of cost of board there from this elimination of duplicative corporate costs to negotiating better things relative to insurance rates or things of that nature. So, again, trying to take a holistic look to leverage our corporate infrastructure. ", "Victor Luis", "Yes. I would just add Lindsay, I think that there is a lot of negations going on across the Company with a lot of our vendors and suppliers. On the cogs side, obviously, three things. You\u2019ve got labor, you\u2019ve got materials and then you\u2019ve got the country shifts that are taking place as we leverage the Coach platform where we have well-established partnerships in lower cost areas.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Great. And then, just quantifying the comp impact?", "Victor Luis", "And then on the comp impact in terms of the inventory and national disaster shifts. We\u2019ve communicated taking it together. We haven\u2019t really broken it down.", "Kevin Wills", "Taken together, we\u2019d be modestly positive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura.", "Simeon Siegel", "Victory, any color you could share on the distribution opportunities for Kate that you mentioned? And then, just nice adjusted gross margins for Kate. Any way to -- given that the outlets have been a source of pressure for them, can you talk to the opportunity you might see there? Thanks.", "Victor Luis", "Sure. First, on the distribution side. I think look, overwhelmingly, the number one opportunity is international. We see that in markets across Asia, obviously a very strong focus on Mainland China. We have a partner there. We\u2019ve been in discussions with them now for a few months on what the future may look like there. And while we don\u2019t have anything to announce today, we hope in the not too distant future to be able to share more. But very, very excited about Kate Spade in that market, both due to what we\u2019re seeing in our tracker in that market in terms of how it\u2019s resonating with the urban millennial consumer as well of course just given what we know about it and the tremendous opportunity that exists from a distribution perspective in the market where stores and malls, whether it would be department stores or shopping malls are already in waiting for a differentiated preposition like Kate.", "In terms of other opportunities from a distribution perspective, of course, there is Europe. And there we are pleased with initial signs in the UK and that\u2019s our focus. Here in the U.S. as it relates to distribution, I think the opportunity is out there. As we know, Kate\u2019s in less than approximately 70 doors today in the North American outlook channel. What we are seeing there of course is that as a brick and mortar channel, it\u2019s holding up better from the traffic perspective than the full price channels. And as we\u2019ve shown this first quarter with the right inventory mix and we give the team there a lot of credit because they\u2019ve been working on that for a few months prior to the acquisition of the brand, getting themselves aligned with the right inventory mix to take care of that opportunity. And what we are exciting about is providing them with the more support in the core handbag development as we look to capture that. And of course, look, we are pulling back on the surprise as well as the disposition sales. And as we remove the more urban, I think much more transparent promotional part of the business, we know that we will continue to see opportunity in our brick and mortar channel.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our final question this morning will come from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad", "I wanted to ask a follow-up on the logo discussion you guys were having earlier. I really want to dive in there. How are you thinking about this logo trend? And as you work into it, are you approaching it differently than the last time around? Victor, I think in the past you had mentioned that sometimes logo becomes a big percentage of the business, it\u2019s hard to differentiate the product between channels and obviously there might be a little bit of the ubiquity effect. But, I noticed you were also saying fashion forward designs are really working well. So, maybe explain how you combine those two dynamics in product line? Thank you.", "Victor Luis", "Sure. I\u2019m going to just add a couple of things and then let Josh trump in because he is really working very closely with Stuart and the design team at Coach on that which lead and of course eventually we do see even some opportunity for the Kate Spade brand to benefit from that. They do have a couple of logo platforms in their archives, and we\u2019re now exploring opportunities for that brand as well.", "I would just reiterate a little bit before handing over to Josh what he stated earlier, which is that at peak, this was its highest, 70% of our business. Logo is on the one hand the most differentiated platform that we have. It\u2019s difficult to copy the signature platform, any other brand is there. So, it\u2019s uniquely ours. The key is as you suggested, Omar, how we manage it carefully, how we differentiate across channels, how we obviously leverage fashion execution with the design team on the logo platform to make it relevant today and not just to bring it back like it was in the past.", "And I\u2019m going to let Josh to jump in because he has been working very closely with Stuart on all of those areas.", "Josh Schulman", "This trend is an industry trend and it\u2019s a very cyclical part of the business. So, every few years, there is a big cycle around logo. And for us, this is very powerful because we have the opportunity to harness this as such an important part of our heritage. And Stuart debuted on the runaway this season and he took a very fresh take on it. He re-colored the logo, did it in a new version of coated canvas, trimmed with the burnish leather. And that really sets the term for our most elevated assortment that is going to be embellished with different icons of the brand in the most elevated ways. And so, we\u2019re really looking in the merchandising mix of how to build a pyramid of products, a good, better, best, and really at the top of the pyramid having a limited edition product that would be highly desirable. And what we have seen already is that some of the most influential fashion editors in the world including for instance the legendary Karen Raphael have already being going into the Coach archives to find logo product and so, it\u2019s alongside the world class brands. So, we are very encouraged by the start, but we know this has to be carefully managed in the seasons ahead.", "Omar Saad", "I appreciate the information. Thanks, guys. Good luck.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Omar.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you everybody. That will conclude our Q&A and we\u2019ll now turn it over to Victor Luis for some concluding remarks.", "Victor Luis", "Thank you, Andrea. As is our custom, I just want to close by thanking all of you for joining us and just as importantly thanking our 20,000-strong-team across the world in 25 markets for all of their hard work and dedication. Obviously, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the evolution of Coach, Inc. to Tapestry as we become a true house of brands, and support the vision of all of our leaders and creative teams across the brands as they bring those narratives to consumers. A lot of exciting activity, a tremendous innovation taking place, and we look forward to sharing that with all of you in the quarters ahead. So, please stay tuned. Thank you.", "Andrea Resnick", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentleman, that will conclude the Tapestry first quarter 2018 conference call.
